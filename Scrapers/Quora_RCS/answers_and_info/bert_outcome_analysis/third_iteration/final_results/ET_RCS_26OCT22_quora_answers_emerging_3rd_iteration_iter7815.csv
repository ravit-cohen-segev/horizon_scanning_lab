Hollywood is under no obligation to present actual science in their “entertainment”. In fact they often create scenarios which are contrary to KNOWN scientific reality. Hollywood is guilty of horrific science dis-education (and many other sorts of dis-education too).OK, enough of that. On to reality.Any real fusion reactor is going to have to somehow bring small nuclei like deuterium or tritium close enough together so that the strong nuclear force will take hold and fuse those nuclei and release energy. The problem is that the strong force has limited range whereas the electric force has unlimited range and is quite strong itself, and it always pushes nuclei away from each other.In order to bring those nuclei close enough to overcome the electric force the nuclei have to be moving really, really fast. There are two ways to do that (that I am aware of).One way isInertial confinement does not yet work so well (or ever?) in the less destructive machines we have built such as theThe second way to whack small nuclei together hard enough and often enough to extract useful energy from their fusion is to make make them move fast enough by confining them in a “magnetic bottle” and heating them with radio waves. (A matter bottle would cool them instantly so they could not fuse.) Scientist are still actively pursuing this too, but gas that hot, a plasma, does not want to be confined and it has STRONG tendency to want to escape.And now we come to the answer to the original question.The machines we build to try to bring small nuclei together require aMaybe it will work someday, but don’t hold your breath waiting for it. And don’t worry about it exploding. If they ever do make fusion work the fusion reactor will only be using tiny amounts of fuel at any one time, too little to explode in any big way.",339 followers,Alex Robinson,3.1K,825,21.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-would-the-fusion-reactor-in-Batman-The-Dark-Knight-Rises-explode-Would-it-not-be-harmless-when-it-runs-out-of-power-and-releases-hydrogen

Witkowski states that he was given access to the transcript of Sporrenberg’s statements by an unidentified present day Polish intelligence officer, and that he was allowed to take some notes but not to copy the original papers. To my knowledge he has never disclosed the identity of his contact in Poland’s spy agency.A number of postwar writers, particularly Joseph Farrell and Henry Stevens, have speculated that The Bell had something to do with Nazi interest in anti-gravity, as did Witkowski himself. The WWII German scientific enterprise was in fact interested in exotic concepts such as anti-gravity and zero point energy, but it is unlikely that Die Glocke had anything to do with these, at least not directly or specifically. (Note that of the two, zero point energy research was much the more legitimate and comprehensive effort, and was directly related to other German work in the fields of quantum mechanics, extreme cold, and superdense elements. Explorations of ZPE continue today.Rather, there is fragmentary but fairly consistent evidence pointing to The Bell as a kind of alternate technology for the breeding of fissile elements for use in nuclear weapons—specifically, that it was an early attempt at building what is today known as an “accelerator driven system” or ADS.Computer Graphic Image of the Likely Appearance of “Die Glocke”.Accelerator-driven subcritical reactor - WikipediaAccelerator-driven Nuclear EnergyThis device was said to have been nicknamed “the beehive” because it produced a loud buzzing sound when in operation. It was also claimed that both human and animal tissues would suffer catastrophic damage if in close proximity to the machine while it was running. This would be consistent with the presence of extremely powerful electromagnetic fields and related phenomena.Keep in mind that nearly the entire late war, underground German secret weapons empire was the domain of the SS and supervised by Sporrenberg’s superior, the notorious General Ing (Engineer) Hans Kammler. Of all the WWII NaziGunson believes, and I concur, that the German approach from this end of their nuclear weapons effort may have employed a technology known as “recoil based fuel breeding”. The extract of the 2008 paper, “Recoil Based Fuel Breeding Fuel Structure” by Liviu Popa-Simil states:In nuclear reactors, the use of nano-particulate pellets could facilitate the recoil implantation for breeding, transmutation and partitioning purposes. Using enriched 238U or 232Th leads to 239Pu and 233U production while using other actinides as 240Pu, 241Am etc. leads to actinide burning. When such a lattice is immersed into a radiation resistant fluid (water, methanol, etc.), the recoiled product is transferred into the flowing fluid and removed from the hot area using a concentrator/purifier, preventing the occurrence of secondary transmutation reactions.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231955480_Recoil_Based_Fuel_Breeding_Fuel_StructureNazi Bell UncoveredThe Bell is believed to have utilized extraordinarily high voltage electrical currents which may have converted thorium-232 into the fourth state of matter—plasma—and then transmuted it into very pure, weapons grade uranium-233, perhaps with the help of a mysterious substance (red mercury?) code-named “Xerum 525”. Although Popa-Simil’s paper is talking about recoil based fuel breeding in (presumably—) conventional modern nuclear reactors, as far as I know it is possible that the same or similar process could also have worked via plasma physics. In addition, another, more recent paper mentions a number of concepts and substances related to the thorium fuel cycle in certain types of reactors, and which are known to have been explored, though perhaps in different contexts and from different starting points, by the Germans in WWII. The abstract for this document states:Thorium is a fertile element that can be applied in the conceptual blanket design of a fusion-fission hybrid energy reactor, in which 232Th is mainly used to breed 233U by capture reaction. It is essential to validate 232Th nuclear data by carrying out integral fusion neutronics experiments for macroscopic thorium assemblies. The thorium assemblies with a D-T fusion neutron source consist of a polyethylene shell, depleted uranium shell, and thorium oxide cylinder.From the 2018 paper, “Fusion Neutronics Experiments for Thorium Assemblies”, By Rong Liu.“D-T” is physics shorthand for “deuterium - tritium”, substances commonly used in various types of thermonuclear weapons. At least some WWII German research and development was certainly moving in this direction. The Germans are also known to have been interested in thorium as bomb fuel by way of the thorium to proactinium to U-233 decay chain.William Pellas's answer to How close did Nazi Germany come to creating an operational nuclear weapon during WWII? Would they have been able to use it on their V2 rockets?If we allow for the possibility that certain superdense elements or substances can serve as triggers for fusion bombs—as is claimed in some sources—then it may be that the purpose of the Bell was to make Xerum 525 itself. In any case it seems most likely that the mysterious NaziCherry red and very dangerousA Suggested Schematic for a Red Mercury Fusion Bomb. This Type of Weapon May Have Been Pursued by WWII German Nuclear Scientists.Witkowski states in the video above that Walter Gerlach—who was definitely one of the greatest German scientists of that era—was the main theoretical scientist who was working on Die Glocke. The infamous Austrian scientist Ronald Richter was also said to have been involved with The Bell, which would seem to point to an attempt at utilizing some kind of exotic approach to nuclear fusion involving extremely high temperatures. Plasma physics would be a natural offshoot of this sort of methodology. It is known that both Gerlach and Richter were major figures in the German Army’s clandestine nuclear weapons project, which was run through theRonald Richter, Genius or Nut?More on the Value of Ronald Richter’s WorkFusion EnergyIcarus Interstellar, Interstellar flight, | Icarus InterstellarThe Huemul ProjectDr. Freidwardt WinterbergDr. Ronald RichterSources vary as to whether one or perhaps as many as four “Bells” were completed. One was allegedly airlifted to Argentina at war’s end, and it is claimed that this is confirmed by declassified Argentine documents—though others say no such documents exist.Again, there are tantalizing traces, hints, and documentary fragments, but definitive answers as to The Bell’s purpose are still elusive and firm conclusions are not possible given the sparse testimony in the historical record which has come to light thus far.

The Indians used them against the British in the 1700s, and the British stole the idea to use against the Americans in the War of 1812 — “…And the ""rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,” of the Star-Spangled Banner.(Above: 150mm German Nebelwerfer rocket launchers firing on the Eastern Front, Kursk, July 1943. But the smoke was a give-away to enemy hunter battery fire or ground attack aircraft.)IMO, the WWII German rocket artillery had in a way taken over from the German Ju 87 Stuka dive-bomber as the main destroyer of Allied soldier’s morale. With both, nerve-wracking, whistling, screaming, moaning shrieks were followed by violent explosions of bombs and shells…it was the horrific screaming noise that terrified soldiers into abandoning their positions, and the explosions that killed them as they ran. “Jericho Trumpets” were now exchanged for 210mm “Screaming Mimi’s” or ""Moaning Minnies.” And they were very effective against Allied soldiers, including in Normandy.Initially smoke screen launchers, the Germans used a series of rocket launchers in 150mm and 210mm, similar to the Soviet Katyusha, ""Little Kate,"" or “Stalin’s Organs” on the Eastern Front that could be so devastating to their own units, and while they had versions since the. beginning, they chose to redesign/upgrade their own, making them more lethal, but never produced them on a s Cale as the Soviets did.. The 28 cm and 32 cm Nebelwerfer 41 shells and many similar projectiles were fired from everything from their packing cases to armoured half-tracks, all very economical and were the forerunners in some ways of today’s Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS). For some reason they are hardly mentioned in discussions about WWII today, although they were extensively used during the war on both Fronts and many Allied troops used to shudder at the memory of the “Moaning Minnies.”WWII German artillery doctrine saw their artillery, including the rocket launchers, as a support platform, an organic component of the infantry that helped suppress enemy activity and reduce strong points. The Soviet WWII doctrine saw the artillery, including the rocket launchers, as an offensive tool, joining infantry support with saturation bombardment of an enemy-held position. The Soviet doctrine was the superior.(Above: Thanks to some “encouragement” by the Soviets, the Nebelwerfer rocket batteries had become an established part of the army artillery system by late 1942, and the Panzer formations decided they needed their own dedicated rocket units. Most Nebelwerfer units used towed launchers, so in order to keep up with the Panzers a self-propelled version was required. The halftrack was the obvious choice as a starting point, but as none could be allocated the Maultier truck was first pressed into use, making something similar to the “Stalin’s Organs.” But later in the war a half-tracked launcher was issued. This was the 15-cm Panzerwerfer 42 which continued to use the 15-cm (5.9-in) rocket two horizontal rows of five )They had success with 150mm and 210mm rockets and the 150mm had an effective range of 7500 yards and the 210mm had an effective range of 8500 yards, or aprox. half the range of an 88mm Flak 18/36 antitank gun. The 150mm projective weighted 34kg.The most basic Nebelwerfer could launch 6–12 rockets in a salvo, Salvo time was 4 seconds, and it could be reloaded in less than three minutes. There were three to six nebelwerfer in a battery, each with six to twelve tubes, with 18–72 tubes firing within seconds to saturate an area. When these things hit, even with iffy accuracy, they would devastate an area, and besides the physical damage, the psychological damage was extensive. Morale of a unit could be in tatters after a rocket attack.The launchers were so light and easy to haul any machine even horses. They didn't even need a heavy battery, but fired off a magneto.(Above: Nebelwerfer were light, mobile, and fairly simple compared to howitzers. But, they also suffered from poor accuracy, and the smoke trails disclosed firing locations to Allied aircraft and artillery. I knew some old P-47 pilots of the 9th Air Force that esp. keyed on the smoke trails they left and “bet” they could arrive to hit the launchers and crews with eight .50s, bombs and rockets before they could pack up and ski-daddle. It was a continuous “race” they held. Counter-battery fire, was always coming, too.)(Above: Of all of Hitler’s “wonder Weapons,” these rocket launchers came the closest to living up to their hype: incredibly cheap, mobile, reliable, working under the most adverse conditions, required very little training to use and had devastating firepower if not great accuracy. Its drawbacks were relatively short range, the distinctive and tale-tell trails of smoke and the expensive ammunition.)(Above: Nicknamed ""Moaning Minnie"" by US soldiers because of the sound it made.)Throughout the war the Germans kept upgrading them, with increased power and range, finally creating six different versions, and Allied soldier's dreaded their attacks even more than mortar “stonks” or regular artillery barrages, as the 155 and 210mm shells hit so much area, all at the same time, with such destructive shells, there was no escape.(Above: Designed, like the “Little Kate” for saturation attacks, not accuracy, the Germans made about 87,000 smaller Nebelwefer tube launchers the Soviets made about 10,000 of the larger, truck-mounted, rail-launched “Stalin’s Organs.” The Germans even tried told design air-to-air rockets to take out bombers but not much came from that.Which was more effective? The Soviet rockets, by far, for in their greater inaccuracy they saturated an area with far more, very high powered shells, noise, white hot propellent and shattered German morale.Thanks!",0 followers,Carl Hamilton,723,2.9K,23.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-we-had-small-enough-fusion-reactors-already-would-it-be-feasible-for-a-hot-air-balloon-or-a-similar-vehicle-to-be-heated-by-a-small-fusion-thruster-instead-of-a-chemical-torch

Germanys Stuka Dive Bombers were notorious for the terrifying shriek they made as they fell on their targets, the RAF's midnight carpet bombing of Axis cities caused untold civilian casualties, and it was the decimation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by U.S. dropped nuclear bombs that helped to finally end the war.As with any new technology, people were eager to see what aerial bombing could do. One of those people was Barnes Wallis.Wallis was British, a very clever engineer, and a ruthless strategist. When he saw the potential aerial bombing could have on German infrastructure, he set his sights on a target lots of people thought of as invulnerable: dams.Not only did dams provide water and hydroelectric for thousands of Germans, if the British could take them out the resulting deluge would cause massive amounts of damage far exceeding that of any bombs at the time.There was one problem though. The Germans knew what a tantalizing target their dams made, and so reinforced all major dams with heavy stockades of anti-torpedo netting.Remember, this was still in the early stages of ariel bombing, guided missiles were a thing of the future, and the current tech was not near accurate enough to hit the side of a dam without using a torpedo dropped way out in front of it.But Wallis had a plan. If he couldn't send the bomb plunging downEverything needed to go perfectly for this thing to work, and so the British Government hired a Civil engineering firm to find out exactly how big a bomb has to be in order to take down a dam. Turns out that 2 tons of Compact RDX and TNT will do the job as long as it explodes right up against the dam.So how do you get something that big to skip? Wallis designed a cylindrical bomb that would get twisted into a backspin before being released low and fast. The bomb would use the Magnus effect, which is the lift created by rapidly spinning objects, to keep momentum even after the first skip. The backspin would also keep it stable enough to skip straight down the line and the velocity of spin and approach could be adjusted to an accurate range.Of course, precision was key if the bombing was going to be successful. And because you can’t really use the trial and error method during a raid, the pilots needed a way to tell exactly when and where to release the payload.The testing began over Chesil beach in England. With a constant speed of spin (500rpm) on the bomb, the problem of determining the altitude of release had to be worked out. This was solved, like so many problems are, using good old geometric triangles ∆ Two searchlights were mounted on the belly of the bomber at such angles that their beams converged on the water below only when at the right altitude of release. This was as simple as it was practical as the raid was planned to take place under the cover of darkness.(Anonymous art showing searchlight method)The second problem of determining the range of release used a similar concept. By this time the target dams had already been chosen. They were Möhne, Edersee, and Sorpe, three vitally important dams in the northern Rhineland of Germany that had been scouted and photographed by Allied reconnaissance aircraft. Using these images, Walis designed custom bombsights that, when at the correct range, would line up with unique features of each dam (likely the flak towers) and in doing so signal the time of release.Finally, after months of testing on reservoirs throughout England, and the training of an elite mission force, it was time to see if the thing actually worked.(Walis and others watch a testing run in Kent)On the night of May 16, 1943, 3 waves of 19 total Avro Lancaster heavy bombers, each fit with a Skipping Dambuster, took off from RAF Scampton in England.(Art by Pat Speirs)It was a long and treacherous flight, especially in the dark. The first casualties were taken down by flak over the Northern coast of the Netherlands, two more planes crashed into powerlines, and one plane had its bomb ripped off by a rogue swell while skimming over the north sea, with that, the entire first wave of bombers was destroyed.The second wave fared better, but, when the first bomb was sent spinning towards Möhne dam, it blew up prematurely and did little or no damage. The second bomb was either dropped to late or, too fast, and went skipping clear over the dam where it absolutely annihilated an unsuspecting powerhouse on the far side.Finally, after the third bomb was sent spinning hopelessly off course, the fourth one skipped, sunk, and blew up right against the dam. The hit weakened the dam and, invigorated by this success, the next bomber, piloted by David Maltby, dropped low, released his payload, and climbed as the bomb skipped, sunk, and blew apart Möhne dam.(Art by Robert Taylor)(Actual destruction of Möhne dam)The aircraft then continued to Edersee dam, which took three bombs before finally breaching.(Edersee Dam before)(Edersee Dam after)The remaining aircraft then took runs over Sorpe dam. But the approach turned out to be difficult and dangerous, and when the surviving bombers finally turned for home, Sorpe stood solid.When the raid was done, only 11 of the original 19 Lancasters made it back to base, and 56 men were lost.Nevertheless, the mission was seen as an undeniable success for the Allied powers. The resulting floods from the collapse of Möhne and Eder, damaged or destroyed literally dozens of German bridges, factories, and mines. Acres and acres of farmland along with an estimated 1500 people were drowned. Production and transportation for the war effort were crippled, and huge amounts of German workers and resources had to be diverted as the dams were frantically rebuilt over the next 5 months.This answer has definitely gone on long enough, but if you want to learn more go watch:Edit: Thanks to the commenters who added info or pointed out mistakes :)∆∆∆",0 followers,Dylan Owens,4.8K,271,26.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-we-had-small-enough-fusion-reactors-already-would-it-be-feasible-for-a-hot-air-balloon-or-a-similar-vehicle-to-be-heated-by-a-small-fusion-thruster-instead-of-a-chemical-torch

The German regime in their infinite wisdom, decided that they didn’t need to fully mobilize their industry for war production until much later in the war. Despite being the first country to gear up for war, Germany was quickly over taken in production by almost everyone. Despite Germany have considerably more resources than the Soviet Union, they were vastly out produced by them. Partially because the Soviets were actually very good at mass producing, but also because the Germans under performed so fantastically.Nazi Germany was rife with rivalry between companies, which made duplicate efforts, without any result. It was rife with experimental prototypes which were based on fantasy of superiority rather than mass production facts. It was rife with the military making decisions on how and what should be produced, rather than people who were experts on mass production. For example, in their pursuit of creating the ultimate tank, the military and their crony engineers altered the design of the Tiger constantly. They made tiny changes, and insisted on introducing them to the production line constantly. On average, a change to the production model was made every 5 models produced. So imagine that during the 1943 Kursk offensive, when Germany fielded around 300 tigers, they had 60 different models, all of them needing slightly different spare parts, slightly different manuals, slightly different maintenance. Imagine the logistical problems. In contrast, the Soviets fielded just models of the original T-34 with a 76mm gun, and made on average 10,000 tanks before they introduced an upgrade, allowing for a huge amount of commonality and more extensive upgrades rather than minor details.Such things prevented the German military production from ever reaching its full potential. At this point, the Germans had already lost. By 1943, it was too late for the German war machine to handle what it was facing, it was under equipped and their defeat was only a matter of time, no matter how you look at it.

Published in the 1 July 2005 edition ofIt was not “a small bomb” that was tested near the end of WWII, but rather a pair of larger strategic nuclear weapon prototypes that were loaded with a small amount of U-235 fissile material.The best article in the public realm that I have seen is Mark Walker and Rainer Karlsch’s piece, “New Light on Hitler’s Bomb”. Published in the 1 July 2005 edition ofWalker and Karlsch write:More surprising, if not shocking, is another revelation in RK’s book (that is, Hitler’s Bombe—WP): a group of scientists under Diebner built and tested a nuclear weapon with the strong support of both Walther Gerlach – an experimental nuclear physicist who by 1944 was in charge of the uranium project for the Reich Research Council. (Hahn, Heisenberg, von Weizsäcker and most of the better-known scientists in the uranium project apparently were not informed about this weapon.) This device was designed to use fission reactions, but it was not an “atomic” bomb like the weapons used against Nagasaki and Hiroshima (figures 1a and b). And although it was also designed to exploit fusion reactions, it was nothing like the “hydrogen” bombs tested by the US and the Soviet Union in the 1950s.Instead, conventional high explosives were formed into a hollow shape, rather than a solid mass, to focus the energy and heat from the explosion to one point inside the shell (figure 1c). Small amounts of enriched uranium, as well as a source of neutrons, were combined with a deuterium-lithium mixture inside the shell.As will be seen shortly, the two authors were mistaken about the intended use of the new German weapon. The reason that the blast yields in the tests were relatively low was not that these were intended as battlefield nukes but rather 1) the Germans were trying to conserve their limited supply of fissile material, and 2) the tests were done not far from populated areas in Thuringia and the Army Weapons Bureau wanted to minimize any radiation risk to nearby citizens. It is of course a measure of the desperation of the German strategic situation in the early spring of 1945 that they proceeded with these tests in that location at all.Encyclopedia Britannica Map Showing the German State of Thuringia.In November of 1944, Soviet spies were made aware of a pending live test of a German nuclear weapon.

The test explosion of a bomb of unusual construction is being prepared under highest secrecy in Thuringia. For the preparations of the tests the local residents are supposed to be transported away by an SS detail; the whole operation is reported to be undertaken in strictest secrecy. The explosions are supposed to take place in a wooded area. For that, special roads to the presumptive test site are being created. The bomb to be tested has a diameter of one and a half meters. It consists of several hollow spheres that nest inside each other. It will be brought to the explosion place with a transporter specially constructed for it. It is still unclear when the test is supposed to take place, but the preparations are going at the maximum fastest pace.CONCLUSION.

Archive of the President of the Russian Federation, 93-81 (45) 37.Peoples’ Commissariat of Defense of the USSRReport:Our trustworthy source from Germany reports:“The Germans have in recent times carried out two large-capacity bomb explosions in Thuringia. The explosions took place in a forest area, under conditions of strictest secrecy. Trees fell at a distance of 500–600 meters from the center of the explosion. Buildings and fortifications specially constructed for the tests have been destroyed.Prisoners of war who were near the epicenter of the explosion died, often without leaving a trace. Prisoners of war who were in the area beyond the center of the explosion have burns on their face and body, the strength of which depends on their position in relation to the epicenter of the explosion. The tests were carried out in a remote deserted area. The regime of secrecy at the test site was at maximum level. Entrance and exit from the territory are by special pass only. SS soldiers have surrounded the area of tests and interrogated any person approaching the area.The bomb, supposedly filled with uranium 235 and weighing approximately two tons, was brought to the test site on a specially constructed truck. Dewars of liquid oxygen were delivered together with it. The bomb was permanently guarded by 20 guards with dogs. The bomb explosion was accompanied by a large explosive wave and high temperature. In addition, a massive radioactive effect was observed. The bomb is a sphere with a diameter of 130 cm.The bomb consists of:Initiator or bomb fuse.Consists of a special tube, which creates fast neutrons. It is charged by special generators, which create high voltage inside the tube. As a result, fast neutrons attack active material.Active bomb material.Active bomb material is uranium 235. It represents a sphere with an opening into which an initiator is inserted. Once this is done, the opening is sealed by a cork made of uranium 235.Protective casing.The uranium sphere is encased in a protective aluminum casing, which is covered by a layer of cadmium. This significantly slows down thermal neutrons emanating from uranium 235, which can cause premature detonation.Explosive matter.After the layer of cadmium it is placed inside explosives that consist of porous TNT saturated with liquid oxygen; TNT is made up of bars of a specially chosen shape. The inner surface of the bars has a spherical curvature, which is the same as that of the external surface of the cadmium layer. Each of the bars is supplied with one detonator or two electrical fuses.Casing.TNT is covered by a protective layer made of a light aluminum alloy. A blasting mechanism is attached on top of this casing.Exterior casing.An exterior casing of armored steel is installed above the blasting mechanism.Fairing.A fairing made of a light alloy can be installed on top of the armored casing for future installation on a rocket of the V-type.Bomb assembly.The sphere, which consists of metal uranium, is placed inside a protective casing, which consists of aluminum, covered in a layer of cadmium, so that the opening in the sphere coinciding with the opening is sealed off by a uranium cork. After this the aluminum sphere, covered in cadmium, is sealed off by a cork, on top of which the last bar of TNT is placed. Next, liquid oxygen is pumped through the opening inside a protective casing, which covers the TNT. After this the bomb is ready for deployment.Bomb ignition.The bomb ignition is carried out with the help of a high-voltage discharge tube. It forms a flow of neutrons, which attack the active material. When the flow of neutrons impacts upon uranium, element 93 fissions, which speeds up the creation of a chain reaction Next, the detonating mechanism detonates the explosive matter, after which a shock from the explosion of the external layer of TNT mixed with liquid oxygen takes place, which is directed toward the center. This allows the uranium to reach a critical mass.Ahead of this, before the explosion, the uranium sphere is irradiated with gamma-rays, the energy of which does not exceed 6 million electron volts, which many times increases its explosive qualities.CONCLUSION.Without doubt, the Germans are carrying out tests of a bomb of high destructive force. In the event of their successful conclusion and production of such bombs in sufficient quantities, they will have weapons capable of slowing down our advanceHead of Chief Intelligence Department of the Red ArmySoviet Dictator Josef Stalin, Left, and Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov, Right, Were Two of Just Four (4) People Who Were Given Copies of a Pair of Late War Red Army Intelligence Reports Concerning the Development and Testing of German Nuclear Weapons.Here it should be noted that according to former MIT scientist Dr. Todd Rider’s analysis of the Thuringia weapon, it was in fact able to function with varying amounts of fissile material. With a full load, about 10 kg, in its core, the highly efficient fusion-boosted fission method of detonation and other aspects of its design would have given it a maximum firepower of 100 kilotons—more than 4 times as much as the Allied Fat Man.From Page 1491 in Dr. Rider’s book,“Table 8.4: Comparison of the U.S. Gadget/Fat Man implosion design (from unclassified sources) with extrapolated design parameters of the March 1945 Thuringian device (Section D.4.4).The explosive yield of the German design was highly dependent on how much fission and fusion fuel were used. The component masses for the Thuringian device in Table 8.4 add up to a total mass of approximately 2000 kg, in excellent agreement with what Ilyichev and Schumann reported. Thus the German bomb had a total deployed mass less than half that of the first U.S. fission bombs (4670 kg for Fat Man), yet could have had a comparable or even greater yield. It took the United States several years to reduce the size and mass of fission bombs. According to Ilyichev and numerous other sources (p. 4137), the German bomb was designed to be launched on a rocket; the United States was not prepared to do that until 1958 (after extensive help from hundreds of German-speaking scientists and engineers it had acquired).”From pg. 1497:“The explosive yield of the Thuringian device would have strongly depended on how much fission and fusion fuel were used.Werner Grothmann, who was Heinrich Himmler’s chief adjutant in the SS for most of the war years, spoke about the Thuringia tests shortly before his death in 2002. In a lengthy interview he gave to his neighbor, Wolf Krotzky, Grothmann stated that:The test was carried out directly there, even though that was in an inhabited area, because due to the course of the war we did not have a lot of choice and, of course, because time was also critical. So we just stayed where the necessary material was produced and stored. In addition, our people and those of Diebner’s other group had their laboratories and the development department. And here close by, too, the mass production of uranium bombs had been planned. In addition, at the beginning of January, the ignition [system] production or at least the development of an ignition system intended for the uranium bomb was likewise supposed to be relocated here, according to my memory. But this was placed in an abandoned mine, not in one of the facilities on site. Diebner allegedly assured that the explosive effect would be quite small for the small amount [of fuel] that the test would require. Unfortunately his prediction was not confirmed. What happened there was horrible. In addition, there were other consequences in the surrounding area, of which I only heard, that doctors, who were under contract with us, had to be deployed there.Grothmann also said unequivocally that at least one, evidently only partially complete serial production version of this bomb was captured by US ground forces when they overran the area several weeks later.Page 3555 inFor this, however, I can vouch myself: Parts of the material had been removed from our research and development laboratories in Thuringia, but not everything. Why this happened, I do not know.Dr. Rider:“In the first three quoted paragraphs, Grothmann told how German engineers successfully invented one or more detonation timing systems to allow the spherical implosion bomb (which he described elsewhere) to create a detonation with “millimeter-exact” accuracy across all of the ignition points around the bomb. He stated that at least one of those ignition systems was a sophisticated optical method using infrared detonators. This description sounds remarkably similar to the technology that Heinz Schlicke may have transferred to the United States from the U-234 submarine’s cargo.”This has long been rumored and there is almost total silence on the world wide web about Schlicke’s expertise in precision bomb fusing such as was used in both the German and US-Allied versions of nuclear implosion bombs. Note the following mention of the same or similar technology in Geoffrey Brooks’“A crucial question is whether Germany had an effective implosion fuse in 1939. It is claimed that they were close to it, and by 1941 had made such advances in the technology of implosion fuses that they were already working on the ultra-violet type. Sources allege that an efficient implosion fuse which could set off all detonators around the bomb sphere at the speed of light was invented by Prof. (Ing) Friedrich Lachner in Vienna pre-war and a model exhibited at the Wiener Technische Hochschule (University) to a gathering of home and foreign physicists at a lecture evening.”Werner GrothmannHeinz Schlicke As He Appeared Later in LifeDr. Rider continues his analysis on pg. 3556:“Adlerhorst or Eagle’s Nest was located near Bad Nauheim, and should not be confused with the better known Eagle’s Nest or Kehlsteinhaus near Berchtesgaden. Adlerhorst was captured by the U.S. Army on 30 March 1945, and subsequently was used by the Allies as “Operation Dustbin” to imprison and interrogate high-value German intelligence targets, including Albert Speer, Wernher von Braun, and many others. If the United States captured German atomic bomb components and immediately took them to Adlerhorst, those components could have been captured no earlier than April 1945. Since the United States could have taken the components to many other sites that were equally or more secure, Grothmann’s statement that they were taken to Adlerhorst suggests that those components were shown to high-value German detainees so that they could not deny the existence of the German nuclear program. Furthermore, that would suggest that the United States had not captured a satisfactory amount of information about the nuclear program, and was desperate to learn more from the detainees. Is it possible to locate and declassify any U.S. records on what German atomic bomb components were found, or what the United States learned from German detainees? See p. 3546 for a very incomplete list of some German and Austrian nuclear-related scientists and engineers who temporarily visited or permanently moved to the United States or United Kingdom after the war, just as Grothmann said.”For Further Reading:",0 followers,Cameron Greene,1.7K,581,11.7M,2013,https://www.quora.com/Was-the-top-secret-German-weapon-to-end-World-War-2-Wunderwaffe-known-as-Die-Glocke-ever-actually-produced

The Soviets would no longer just be a supplier but a full partner. However, the proposal did not give the Soviets all the territory they wanted.A few days later, the Soviets presented a Stalin-drafted written counterproposal with slight modifications where they would accept the four power pact, but it included Soviet rights to Bulgaria and a world sphere of influence focus on the area around modern Iraq and Iran. Hitler hesitated because of the oil in these countries.The deal never got made and Hitler decided to invade the Soviet Union rather than take them on as a partner.

This will actually prove to be important in how fast fusion can be brought to commercial reality and rapidly deployed worldwide.Nuclear Fusion – Smaller Cheaper & SoonerWhile it is common to consider D-T fusion when making comparisons in fission versus fusion arguments, in a long term perspective it is probably better to use D-D fusion to represent the fusion case.D-D fusion is cheaper and more long term sustainable than D-T fusion (there is at present only enough worldwide supply of Tritium to keep a 1 GWe D-T fusion power plant fueled and running for 2 months while there is enough Deuterium in the world’s oceans, 4.6 x 10^13 metric tons, to supply all of the earth’s need for power at a 17 TW level for 29 billion years).D-D fusion is also more energetic by weight of fuel than D-T fusion when all fusion reactions including side-chains go to completion. Of all nuclear reactions (fission or fusion) – D-D fusion of pure Deuterium separated from sea water produces the highest energy yield per kilogram of fuel consumed.It is to be regretted that D-D fusion is slightly more complex than D-T fusion and produces energy through four reactions instead of one reaction like D-T. The additional complexity of four versus one reaction may tend to put off science writers and commentators – so DT fusion routinely gets more coverage in the popular press. In a longer term perspective, it is probable that D-D fusion will be of greater overall historical significance and will in the future produce a large portion of future energy required to power our world.The four D-D fusion reactions (and the net effect reaction):D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeVThe net effect of these four fusion reactions taken together is:The energy output that results from all four D-D fusion reactions is 3.439248 x 10^8 MJ/kg. The temperature a fusion reactor must achieve to produce an efficient D-D plasma burn is 350 million K.Nuclear Fusion Summary – Prospects for breakthrough commercial reactors 2018-2025Brian Wang of the Next Big Future Blog updates hisThe complete conversion of deuterium nuclear fuel releases an energy content of 250 x 10^15 joules per metric ton of deuterium. The quantity of deuterium in the world’s oceans is estimated at 4.6 x 10^13 metric tons. Deuterium present in seawater will yield around 5 x 10^11 TW-year of energy. In the year 2018 the entire planet consumed around 17 TW-years of energy, which means that the energy content of the deuterium in seawater would be enough for 29.4 billion years of energy supply.To give all 10 billion people expected to live on the planet in 2050 the level of energy prosperity we in the developed world are used to, a continuous average use of power of 6 kilowatts per person as is typical in Europe, we would need to generate 60 terawatts as a planet—the equivalent of 900 million barrels of oil per day.The time since the earth first formed = 4.54 billion years.While nuclear fusion is frequently derisively denounced as ""always only 50 years away"", are there currently real reasons for optimism?Regulatory obstacles to nuclear fusion reactors are currently much lower than obstacles impeding the development of innovative nuclear fission reactors. While this may not seem like a significant thing, I believe that it will prove to be important in how fast fusion can be brought out in commercial forms[1].Tom McGuire, lead project engineering at the Lockheed skunkworks and chief designer of the Lockheed Compact Fusion Device has announce the intension to build a new prototype CFD reactor a year until a commercially viable fusion power plant is demonstrated. McGuire expects to achieve a commercial power generating reactor in 5 years (or 5 experimental prototype development cycles). This kind of intense development effort is not possible in the fission universe as a result of obstructive NRC regulation.Conclusion _ While a harder physics problem, small fusion will be available in commercial forms before any form of new Gen-IV fission reactor.Robert Steinhaus's answer to What's our current progress on nuclear fusion power and what problems remain ?[1] - Fission versus Fusion?If you want to innovate and build a fission reactor you need from NRC -1) A design certification to ensure your basic reactor design is safe – cost ~$200 million2) A COL license to allow you to construct and operate your fission reactor – cost ~ $60 million3) Once licensed, you will have to pay each year an operating fee to NRC of ~$5 million dollars whether your reactor is operating or not – whether it is producing electricity or process heat or not.4) A license to obtain fission nuclear fuel for your prototype reactor must be obtained from NRC - private sale or purchase of nuclear fuels is illegal and can result in jail time.5) A Waste Confidence Environmental Impact Statement must be prepared and submitted to NRC to describe how you plan to sequester any nuclear waste produced by your fission reactor prototype. NRC must approve your plan before you are allowed to allow your reactor to go critical and produce any fission power. Your will need to pay NRC staff evaluating your Environmental Impact Statement at a rate of $273 an hour until such time as NRC staff are satisfied with all elements of your plan.6) When you decide you can no longer continue operating your prototype reactor, you will have to pay NRC during reactor decommissioning. Former reactor operators are required to pay NRC staff at a rate of $273 per hour of time they are involved in supervising the decommissioning of your reactor prototype.In contrast, the obstacles to Fusion reactor innovation –1) No regulatory obstacles currently exit in the US preventing prototyping of fusion reactors.2) You can freely and legally build fusion reactors in your home basement or at school without interference of any kind from NRC.3) You can legally buy high purity fusion fuels (D2O – which can be electrolyzed to 99.99% pure Deuterium) on e-Bay for less than $10.4) OPEN SOURCE design guides and plans can be freely downloaded on the internet for several good fusion reactor designs. Helpful Face book and Web Forum resources exits to permit sharing of fusion technical know-how and for group solving of problems with near real-time responses to difficulties.5) There are no defined reactor decommissioning costs for fusion reactor prototypes.Engineers design and build things.Your chance of rapidly designing and building innovative ideas and deploying large numbers of nuclear reactors are much better in the fusion realm than in the fission area as a result of current over regulation of fission nuclear.","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.5K,6.8K,91.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-would-the-fusion-reactor-in-Batman-The-Dark-Knight-Rises-explode-Would-it-not-be-harmless-when-it-runs-out-of-power-and-releases-hydrogen

The high cost of generating is largely down to the extremely strict safety regulation they have to operate under, and the fact that nuclear plats are expensive to build and decommission.

So as a business building nuclear power plants isn’t very attractive, as the margins are slim.

26,"Today, many countries take part in fusion research to some extent, led by the European Union, the USA, Russia and Japan, with vigorous programs also underway in China, Brazil, CaToday, many countries take part in fusion research to some extent, led by the European Union, the USA, Russia and Japan, with vigorous programs also underway in China, Brazil, Canada, and Korea. Initially, fusion research in the USA and USSR was linked to atomic weapons development, and it remained classified until the 1958 Atoms for Peace conference in Geneva. Following a breakthrough at the Soviet tokamak, fusion research became 'big science' in the 1970s. But the cost and complexity of the devices involved increased to the point where international co-operation was the only way forward.Fusion powers the Sun and stars as hydrogen atoms fuse together to form helium, and matter is converted into energy. Hydrogen, heated to very high temperatures changes from a gas to a plasma in which the negatively-charged electrons are separated from the positively-charged atomic nuclei (ions). Normally, fusion is not possible because the strongly repulsive electrostatic forces between the positively charged nuclei prevent them from getting close enough together to collide and for fusion to occur. However, if the conditions are such that the nuclei can overcome the electrostatic forces to the extent that they can come within a very close range of each other, then the attractive nuclear force (which binds protons and neutrons together in atomic nuclei) between the nuclei will outweigh the repulsive (electrostatic) force, allowing the nuclei to fuse together. Such conditions can occur when the temperature increases, causing the ions to move faster and eventually reach speeds high enough to bring the ions close enough together. The nuclei can then fuse, causing a release of energy.While fusion power clearly has much to offer when the technology is eventually developed, the problems associated with it also need to be addressed if it is to become a widely used future energy source.","29,973 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,3K,7.7K,249.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-would-the-fusion-reactor-in-Batman-The-Dark-Knight-Rises-explode-Would-it-not-be-harmless-when-it-runs-out-of-power-and-releases-hydrogen

Most of them similar in basic concept with circular magnetic confinement that holds the fusion reaction in a donut shape where the plasma spins around in circles.There has been a significant improvement in the production of super magnets that makes them much cheaper to build. That was done by MIT.There are a number of other fusion reactor projects using a variety of different methods. These are a bit less predictable. There is a chance that one of these novel fusion reactors will work effectively and find us a cost-effective way of making fusion energy much cheaper than the ITER project and much sooner.So the main international fusion project that will replace ITER with a massive and hugely expensive reactor that may be working in another 25 years. Or the other option may be a much cheaper and novel reactor system that may produce workable power at some unknown time.There is one nuclear technology that we could develop within this decade and provide safer, cheaper and cleaner low carbon energy.A much more effective option that could give us much safer, cleaner and cheaper Generation 4 reactors. They are very different from the common fission reactors now in use around the world. Nothing like Chernobyl of Fukushima.MSR, Molten Salt Reactors have the potential to be ten times safer, cleaner and cheaper power than current PWR reactors. And they could even burn nuclear fuel waste.With enough resources, we could have some of these Next Generation, Gen 4, reactors in production within this decade.Some Gen 4 reactor designs will be able to use much of the most dangerous nuclear fuel waste as fuel. They could burn up nuclear waste and make power from it. The Terrapower project supported by Bill Gates includes an MSR, Molten Salt Reactor, and another reactor is a Wave reactor that could use depleted Uranium or unenriched Uranium or Plutonium as fuel. And there are massive amounts of depleted Uranium in storage around the world. And it is basically free to use.China is leading the world in developing Gen 4 reactors. Including a working prototype gas-cooled reactor. This is a melt-down-resistant reactor. China is also developing a prototype MSR and Wave reactor. Much of it based on US research and technology.The US has the technology to lead the world in Generation 4 nuclear power if the resources were made available.Generation 4 nuclear power will support other low carbon energy sources.Global energy demand is growing rapidly and renewable energy is unable tp keep pace with that demand.Nuclear power supplies 50% of the world's low carbon energy. And as old reactors are retired that number will drop. China and India both have massive coal problems and are planning over 50 nuclear power stations to help replace coal. They also both have massive coal reserves. Much of the growing energy demand in South East Asia is being supplied by coal. Many countries can not afford renewable energy. Currently, there are over 200 new coal-powered power stations being built in South East Asia.We need more low carbon energy options.
