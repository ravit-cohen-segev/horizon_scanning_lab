3,"JavaScript will likely never be “replaced.” It may, however, decline greatly in popularity and usage.I foresee this happening when WebAssembly (Wasm) matures in a few years and adds support for garbage collection, DOM manipulation, etc. When this happens, the floodgates will open and a whole plethora of languages will be available for the Wasm platform.We already have C++ and Rust.

I represented myself pro-se in a 2 year proceeding where I learned to read legal documents, litigate, file motions, and even filed a lawsuit against opposing counsel at the end.I also develop AI for a living, and worked for the past 6 years at NVIDIA and ORBAI making AI do very difficult tasks for some major customers, so I probably now have the most overlapping experience in the world at both AI and learning law simultaneously.Law is simply a very structured conversation. One lawyer writes and files a motion, the other objects and the first gets a final response, then there is a hearing, they each make a short statement, and the judge makes a decision. This 5-let of conversation repeats for each hearing in the case, and mixed in are some events filings that add or request information.The filings themselves are done in a specific document format, often with cover pages with specific fields and text boxes to check, and no more that 10 pages of 2.5 spaced text (really only 4 pages single-spaced text). They are written in a very structured language, often with very specific phrases and boilerplate that tends to reoccur.Also, the sequence of the hearings in a given field of law tends to follow a pattern, some to initiate the case, some to get orders in place, demand discovery, settlement conferences,… trial and this pattern is very predictable.This is a perfect system in which to use AI.There are some quirks of the human brain which make it even simpler to model and use AI in law.When we write a document about a similar subject multiple times, even years apart, we tend to write it the same, shockingly so, and not just the overall style, but the exact same words, phrasing, and sequence of events that we write about. If you sit down, and (without looking at the original) try to just re-write the same story or document you wrote more than a year ago, then go back and read the original, you will gasp in surprise at how similar they are. There is some sort of hierarchical encoding in the human linguistic cortices that is highly deterministic, and that, given similar subjects and inputs, will produce the same output.Senior lawyers are almost like photocopiers in the way they write the same motions about different people and different situations but they come out EXACTLY THE SAME, especially if they tend to lie and exaggerate, these 'decorations' rarely change and are consistent from document to document. I studied 49 case files of two senior attorneys and was astounded at the self-similarity of their filings. It's like the individual clients didn't even exist.Another quirk is that human decision making is actually a very simple, deterministic, and formulaic process. We cannot analyze our entire environment every second and scrutinize every decision from scratch, or we would never get anything done. Instead, we develop habits, patterns, and routines that we follow, without much conscious thought. Think of how you get up in the morning, shower, shave, eat something for breakfast, how you choose your clothing. If you took that behavior and recorded it for a few months, then used an AI to predict your actions each day, you would seriously freak out at how exactly you can be predicted, and how similar we all are in our patterns. How do you think Facebook knows exactly what T-shirt to sell you at what time? I helped write that system.With an already limited set of potential actions open to an attorney at any point in a case, and using a brain that tends to decide to do the same things under similar circumstances, and follows patterns, you have a system that is well suited for AI because it is so formulaic. A simple LSTM RNN predictor does the trick, and you just have to train it on the 'Events and Hearings' section of your opponent's case summaries, which are freely available online in most court systems, and you have a decent predictor of 'what are they going to do next?'What really makes AI sing in law is that humans also write the same, given the same inputs. Predicting the sequence of events that a lawyer will follow is useful, but when you can train an AI to read and reproduce an attorney's writing you have a powerful tool that can show you the exact motion they are going to file, before they even start writing it themselves, so you can prepare in advance, or just do a preemptive filing to block them. This needs a decent text auto-encoder, and is hard to do with existing tech, as the writing comes out as yoga-legalese, with incorrect grammar and sequencing with most auto-encoders. It is an open problem to teach AI to write well, let alone precisely enough for law. Mistakes can be costly.A final bit is that legalese that lawyers use IS just a language, and it is completely possible to write a common language to legalese translator using a seq-seq RNN such that a person can write a plain language document and the translator can make it into a legitimate sounding legalese document. The mapping is not 1–1, as sometimes more information is needed in the legalese document, and the subtleties of legalese require that the words used are very precise in definition, unlike how we use terms loosely in common language. You also need a lot of context, so you need to translate whole paragraphs at a time to really get it right, which is beyond the capability of most seq-seq RNNs.So yes, lawyers can be modeled by AIJust think of what this really means in the context of law, which decides so many things about our lives and our society… senior lawyers are like 1980s video games, and they can be hacked. Frightened yet?Now to build an AI that can actually analyze a case in its entirety, pull in information from past cases and other sources, analyze it, project all possible litigation trajectories forward into the future and weigh the possible final outcomes to come up with an optimal strategy, execute it by composing, formatting, and e-filing, and have it able to adapt, learn and re-plan as the case progresses.Brent",UNKNOWN,Ben Y.

7,"Yes. Here’s why:Consider the work a lawyer does. Much of their job is to put together agreements that ensure that each party has covered off any issue that may cause a dispute in the future. They must look up previous cases and judgements to tailor their case to something they believe to achieve the desired results.This is why AI is poised to take over. There is so much case law already online that a computer can process and find any number of paragraphs covering a specific subject. It can also review court judgements and easily make suggestions as to how to word any particular clause with theYes. Here’s why:Consider the work a lawyer does. Much of their job is to put together agreements that ensure that each party has covered off any issue that may cause a dispute in the future.

There is so much case law already online that a computer can process and find any number of paragraphs covering a specific subject. It can also review court judgements and easily make suggestions as to how to word any particular clause with the highest probability of that clause being enforced if required. For this reason, AI can do a much better job, much faster and for much less cost. Lawyers will have a hard time convincing people to part with their money when AI offers the holy trinity of good, quick and cheap.AI isn’t the only reason for the approaching lack of need for humans in law. Blockchain, too, will reduce the need for people. A crucial part of the blockchain methodology is the automation of contracts – called ‘Smart Contracts’ or Self-Executing Contracts’. What these do is take legal obligations and translate them into code. As the code is self enacting, there is no room for dispute - which again will remove a large part of the lawyers need for existence.Lawyers do seem to be embracing AI. Search a bookstore for AI in law, and you’ll see plenty of results. Perhaps lawyers just want out, or maybe they don’t realise the extent to which AI will replace them. I will be exploring this topic more in a book I am currently writing, based on my experience as CEO of a company providing connectivity IoT technologies. The book will discuss the impact of AI on the future of work, including a dedicated section on lawyers.",78 followers,Rajan Singh,8.7K,360,25.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-do-for-a-job-and-do-you-think-technology-will-replace-you-within-the-next-50-years
8,"As a lawyer i rarely get scared when the news report on how much more accurate and speedy an AI algorithm is at advising on the law than an experienced human attorney for one reason :-Unless the client has a background in law or law enforcement they usually will not be able to assess their own problem and ask the relevant question in the first place.The sociological and cultural backgrounds of a client are important in assessing their case :- A machine can be programmed with law journals and statute but will not have “ street level” understanding of colloquial terms and cultural realities andAs a lawyer i rarely get scared when the news report on how much more accurate and speedy an AI algorithm is at advising on the law than an experienced human attorney for one reason :-Unless the client has a background in law or law enforcement they usually will not be able to assess their own problem and ask the relevant question in the first place.The sociological and cultural backgrounds of a client are important in assessing their case :- A machine can be programmed with law journals and statute but will not have “ street level” understanding of colloquial terms and cultural realities and trends. Without an understanding of a client’s cultural context and background legal advice will be divorced from the realities of the client’s life.Law will always be a field where the human touch is paramount.Distilling the facts of a client’s case into cogent legal questions is something that only the creativity of a human mind can do . Only a human mind is equipped with both knowledge and empathy .On the issue of empathy: In cases that require sensitivity ie. Family Law, Domestic Violence, Sex crime you often have to act on instinct to ask your client about what you believe is going on , and painfully pull facts from them like a surgeon excising a tumor.I see AI as more of an additional tool in an attorney’s arsenal than a threat to the profession at large. A skilled attorney will be able to produce a complicated legal opinion in hours instead of days using AI algorithms .AI may overall increase the speed and efficiency of justice systems around the world ,and make some aspects of paralegal work obsolete but until an AI can approach or surpass human intelligence there will always be a need for human lawyers in my opinion.","284,852 followers",James Altucher,992,878,91.7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-do-for-a-job-and-do-you-think-technology-will-replace-you-within-the-next-50-years

By doing so a company may need fewer humans to do the same (or more) amount of work; for example an accounting firm may have employed 20 people back in the physical “pen & paper” days… but now do the same work with as few as 5 people using specialized accounting software on a computer. Automation “replaced” 15+ people… but there are still people doing those jobs.The same thing is going to happen with AI. I suspect that 50 years from now there will still be a lot of people still doing the same jobs that people do today… but there may be fewer of them doing it because they’ll be using AI to help them be more productive than all the people necessary to do that work now.IOW: instead of asking about automation replacing a job… ask how automation can assist people in doing their jobs more productively.—Short answer: Yes.Longer answer: I’ve worked directly with several companies that use AI to triage legal documents. One company in particular pre-processed over 10,000 contracts daily. Any contracts flagged by the triage AI were then reviewed by (human) paralegals and then if necessary passed up to the company lawyers. Without AI the company would have probably had to hire about five times the number of staff. So in these specific cases a lot of lawyers were definitely “replaced”.There are other ways that AI can assist lawyers: for example, watching micro expressions during depositions to detect “untruthful” answers. Or during jury selection to determine bias for/against a defendant (or prosecutor). Or even during trail to determine attentiveness. Once advanced enough they could even be used to simulate mock trials.
