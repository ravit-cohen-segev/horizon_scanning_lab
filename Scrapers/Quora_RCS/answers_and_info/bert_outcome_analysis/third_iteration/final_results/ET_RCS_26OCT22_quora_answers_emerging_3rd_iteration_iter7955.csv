1,"Cheap fusion power is thirty years off. Always has been, always will be.Said in jest, but unfortunately as true now as when it was first coined.I do not think the current torus-based fusion models will lead to commercial fusion. I think it is probably possible, but I think it will need a conceptual breakthrough to make it happen. However, there is no way to force that to occur. In the meantime, I think we need to keep attention on the subject, and plodding ahead with ITER is the only way we have, at the moment, to do it.","220,640 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,783.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-have-uncontrolled-and-controlled-nuclear-fusion-at-the-same-time

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but itThere’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), andI hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be. It should be considered like the Manhattan project or Apollo programme but way,It should be awe inspiring, and I hope I’ve conveyed a little of that awe.Here’s a photo of the pit in which they’re building the core at ITER. For scale, there is a person standing on the extreme left of the image about halfway down (9 o’clock position). The pressure vessel (the first section of which is complete and slowly making its way into this pit) will contain more steel than the Eiffel tower. Once running, the core will be the hottest place in the solar system, in fact it’ll be hotter than anywhere within around 100 light years of Earth as only blue supergiant stars get this hot at their cores.And ITER is just the small scale prototype. A final generating power plant will be significantly larger.I hope that blows your mind at least a little.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

On Earth it’s clear that just harvesting natural energy flows is the cheapest full lifecycle choice, and fusion isn’t going to change that.But when you get a bit further from the sun, of course there’s no wind, but there’s also insufficient solar energy to travel with.So when it’s worth mining the asteroids and the like, then fusion will be awesome.

I think a pure fusion machine that doesn’t amplify energy output with fission will follow within 20 years, but it may never be economically competitive with pure fission or fission/fusion hybrid machines. On the other hand, I think it is naive to make any predictions of technology beyond ~100 years except where basic laws of physics constrain things (e.g. faster than light space travel). Nobody can say how politics, science, and engineering will progress beyond 50 years. Who knows? We might even come to our senses with respect to radiation fear and begin to really become concerned about global climate change. I think that will take at least 50 years though.I think perhaps a fusion rocket application will be developed within 50 years where the advantages of using hydrogen reaction mass tilt advantage towards a pure fusion machine and where cost is less important than in terrestrial power applications where so many alternatives exist. Also, the space application has the advantage of being in an already high radiation environment and perhaps adequately far from population to quell fear.","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-have-uncontrolled-and-controlled-nuclear-fusion-at-the-same-time

This is a minor energy source despite the fact that natural fission reactions occur at the center of the Earth that make the center as hot as the surface of the Sun. $3000/kW Could provide about 2% of our energy needs.Yet, the cost of mining and processing a ton of thorium or uranium is no more than the cost of mining and processing a ton of coal. Yet, 3 million times the energy content is contained in these fuels. There is also an abundance of them in nature. Furthermore, the radioactivity of the debris need not be any greater than the natural isotopes started with. So, what’s the problem?The technology is hampered by an embargo of nuclear knowledge due to legitimate concerns with weapons proliferation. This limits techniques and fuel choices and makes the technology more dangerous and more costly than it need be.A technical path toward Improvements have been outlined since the 1950s when Brookings Institute looked at nuclear as a possible solution to our then looming America’s energy problem in 1970. That problem came and went with the energy crisis of 1970 and our switch to Mid East Oil and all that entails. These findings have largely been ignored since it assumes international cooperation on nonproliferation that never happened. We would do well to review them today, as the globe is approaching an energy crisis today and faces new environmental challenges beyond that;4. Natural Fusion - the Sun is a natural fusion energy source whose light is freely available to all. 10,000 more energy falls on Earth than humanity uses.

ITER is not scheduled to actually try to make fusion happen until 2035, but that’s just the start of the actual fusion experiment. ITER will not produce electricity even if it is successful. If ITER reaches its goal then a larger and even more expensive test reactor will need to be built in order to actually make electricity. So what are we talking time-wise — 2050? 2060? — to finally have ONE fusion reactor producing power IF all goes according to plan? The problem is . . .. . . we need to stop using fossil fuels NOW (even tho that ain’t gonna happen).In the meantime we have designs for completely safe Gen 3+ reactors which have been built and are running, and more are being built, tho mostly not here in the US much to our shame.So given the time frame of, say, 40 years (?) until starting build-out of fusion reactors (If they work at all) all the while burning coal, oil and gasI really dislike it when people give answers but disable all comments. That means no on can call them out on their answers when said answers are questionable or wrong. There is one such answer (thus far) on this question: fromRE:Fossil fuels will run out FAR sooner than nuclear fuels. What do you do then? And if you burn all that stuff there will be so much CO2 in the air that the Antarctic ice cap and other glaciers all over the world will be melting like mad, raising ocean levels and inundating coastal cities and low-lying countries all over the world.Fossil fuel reserves would crush climate goals: reportWe need to stop burning fossil fuels. And if you factor in the costs of losing our coastal cities and low-lying lands, then fossil fuels aren’t so cheap. And what about the costs of theAnd like many other advocates of renewable energy, his answer ignores advances in nuclear power reactor technology, trying to make us believe that all future reactors will be just the same as they are now, behemoths floated on oceans of cash. We are moving towards small, modular power reactors which can be mass produced in factories and shipped to wherever power is needed in ordinary shipping containers. Mass production will knock down the price a lot, and simple assembly on site will knock the price down even more.RE:When the wind stops blowing windmills produce no power.When the sun stops shining solar cells produce no power.BUT we must stop burning fossil fuels.That leaves energy storage — batteries — and massive, world-wide interconnection. $$$$ To implement energy storage to get reliable power from intermittent sources makes even the current Gen3+ reactors look cheap in comparison.I’ve written in another answer an extrapolation of what it would cost to expand existing, real, solar farms and battery farms based on their actual cost to equal a 1 gigawatt nuclear power plant. I don’t feel like typing it in all over again, so go read it atJeff Barry's answer to What's your view on the claim that ""Solar farms take 450 times more land than nuclear plants, and wind farms take 700 times more land than natural gas wells, to produce the same amount of energy.""?But if you don’t care to read the actual numbers and see my calculations, here is the conclusion from the above:To that 18.6 billion add the $38.4 billion for the redundant solar farms spread around the world + cost of a [global] grid + cost of maintaining and replacing the solar cells and batteries + energy losses over transcontinental or trans-global power lines + . . . .Renewable energy is VASTLY more expensive than nuclear power.

So to calculate the speed for an ion based propulsion system, you need to know how much reaction mass you are carrying, and how you are powering the thing.In principle, a nuclear power plant on a spaceship could provide power for over one hundred years (using something close to today's technology.) So in a sense, the limiting factor is how much reaction mass (herafter, ""fuel"") the ship can carry. Given a large enough ship (so it can carry enough fuel) it should therefore be able to achieve a significant fraction of the speed of light. To be conservative, let's say the ship can accelerate at 1/10 of a gravity and can carry enough reaction mass to achieve 1/10 of the speed of light. UsingThus, mission time to reach the star would be approximately 44 years. If the probe is to return to our system, the round-trip time would be 88 years plus time spent studying the Proxima C system. Although this is a long time to wait for results, it certainly seems achievable, considering that the spacecraft Voyager 1 is still operating on 1970s technology after over 37 years.So the limiting factor is therefore now the speed of the ejected matter (item 2 above.) This can be calculated using the rocket equation (I am using a non-relativistic one so it will be off, but only a little as long as we stay away from values very close to the speed of light.)
