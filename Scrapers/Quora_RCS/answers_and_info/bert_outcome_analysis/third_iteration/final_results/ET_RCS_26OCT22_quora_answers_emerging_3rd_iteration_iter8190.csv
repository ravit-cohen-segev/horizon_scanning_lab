5,"Very interesting question, let me try to answer it.Let me ask one question first:Why is it that China is not worried that the West will scold China for its system on diplomatic occasions? Even from a certain point of view, China is more willing to tangle with the West on these issues?Warning: This answer is very very long!I am Chinese, and I certainly hope foreigners will be friendly to me.Very interesting question, let me try to answer it.Let me ask one question first:Why is it that China is not worried that the West will scold China for its system on diplomatic occasions? Even from a certain point of view, China is more willing to tangle with the West on these issues?Warning: This answer is very very long!I am Chinese, and I certainly hope foreigners will be friendly to me.The greatest contribution of the Communist Party of China lies in organizing more than one billion Chinese people and forming an extremely horrible national system.Western countries once had a national system, that is, during World War II. During the World War, we saw the super industrial power and extremely powerful war potential under the American national system. However, once the western countries enter the era of peace, they will automatically give up the national system. The Western democratic system can avoid centralization,China is a centralized political model, and at the same time, it does one thing in the way of a nationwide system, that is, it develops its economy and consolidates its national defense.So, what worries will China bring to other countries?We believe that economic factors are always the basic reasons. Western countries attack Russia in public opinion because Russia's military strength makes them feel insecure. Western countries attacked Japan in the 1960s because Japan recovered rapidly after the war and its economy developed rapidly. Today, the most basic reason why western countries attack China is still the economy.As an ally of the United States, Japan is hostile at the stage of rapid economic development.Western media call China ""the crusher of developed countries"".Western civilization and Japanese civilization have a total population of one billion, which is not as large as China.Chinese industry is the whole industrial chain. What is the concept of this whole industrial chain?Take the United States, there are no LCD panel industry, high-speed rail industry, lithium battery industry, etc. In the United States, only military shipbuilding is left in the shipbuilding industry, and civilian shipbuilding has basically withdrawn from the competition in the world market. The United States buys European cruise ships and Asian merchant ships. Because of this, the cost of American warships is extremely high, and shipyards have no civilian orders, so they all rely on the navy to support them. Why is the US military spending so high, and a considerable part of them are wasted like this? Why does Trump want manufacturing to return? Because manufacturing is the skeleton of a country, losing manufacturing will cause restrictions everywhere.In Germany, for example, there are basically no industries such as smartphones, notebook computers, tablet computers, chip manufacturing and packaging, LCD panels, aero engines, and the Internet, and there is no independent aerospace industry in Germany.In Japan, for example, satellite navigation, civil aircraft, aero-engine, smartphone chip design, communication equipment, unmanned aerial vehicle, and Internet are basically absent or very weak, and the aerospace industry has no global space mapping network, manned space flight and space station.Another example is the military industry, which is dominated by the United States. Aircraft carriers, fourth-generation aircraft, supersonic aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, intercontinental missiles, phased array radar destroyers, and nuclear submarines, which are the main battle weapons, have no independent design and manufacturing capacity in Germany and Japan.As for China, the above-mentioned dozens of industries are not only all available, but also not bad.In addition to these high-tech manufacturing industries, toys, clothing, furniture, cement, glass, textiles, and other industries with relatively low technical requirements, the developed countries such as the United States, Japan, and Germany have long given up, while China still takes everything, and accounts for more than half of the world's share.For example, in Internet and satellite navigation, only China and the United States are exploring and practicing on a large scale, and China ranks second in the world, ahead of Europe and Japan.Another example is cloud computing, big data, and artificial intelligence. China is also closely following the United States with Ali, Huawei, Tencent, Xunfei, and Baidu. Taking cloud computing as an example, according to the report released by Deutsche Bank in May 2016, the top three in the world are Amazon, Microsoft, and Alibaba in China. Besides Alibaba Cloud, China also has Tencent Cloud, Baidu Cloud, Huawei Cloud, and so on, which are also ahead of Europe and Japan.For example, smartphones and tablet computers, China, the United States, and South Korea have monopolized the world market, and China ranks at least third in the world. The world share of China's mobile phone brands is expected to exceed 50% in 2017.Another example is the shipbuilding industry. The top three countries in the world are China, Japan, and South Korea, with China's share ranking first.Another example is the military industry. China, the United States, Russia, Britain, and France are among the top five countries in the world. In fact, China is the only country that can fully compete with the United States in terms of military expenditure and main battle weapons.Another example is household appliances. China, South Korea, and Europe occupy the major share of the world. Another example is the communication equipment industry. Huawei ZTE ranks first in the world in terms of technical level, output value, and profit. For civil drones, DJI ranks first in the world in terms of technology and output value and profit.Another example is offshore engineering equipment, namely offshore oil drilling platforms, and offshore engineering ships. The global market is dominated by China, South Korea, and Singapore, with China accounting for 35% of the global share, ranking first in the world. In 2015, more than 80% of the global drilling platforms were made in China. The United States, Europe, and Japan have little share of offshore equipment, while China mainly competes with South Korea and Singapore.China is not only everywhere, but also basically in the top five in the world.The integrated circuit industry is the most backward big industry in China, with the United States, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Germany, and the Netherlands ahead, and China ranks seventh in the world, still within the top eight. However, Trump authorities banned chip trade with China. The Communist Party of China began to vigorously promote this super project, and Chinese entrepreneurs joined in one after another. In order to avoid the shortage of chips delaying China's 5G plan, China has implemented the functions of chips in the cloud. That is, the calculation that was originally done with chips is now replaced by cloud computing.In terms of gross output value, China's industrial output value in 2015 was already the sum of the United States and JapanFor example, Obama's policies were abolished immediately after Trump took office. The special system of the Communist Party of China can guarantee that a policy will remain unchanged for decades. For example, China's shelterbelt program for environmental protection has lasted for 78 years, and it has been basically completed in more than 10 years. This kind of super engineering can be seen everywhere in China. Once this system is put into operation, it is a terrifying super machine.The green area indicates the shelterbelt.This COVID-19 pneumonia has already illustrated the problem. A country with a population of 1.4 billion has brought COVID-19 pneumonia under control. In order to fight against COVID-19 pneumonia, the Communist Party of China completed the overall deployment in less than three days. In other words, if war comes, the Communist Party of China can mobilize the whole country in three days, or even a shorter time.Such a super industrial power, super agricultural power, super Internet power, plus super-large population and economic strength. In recent years, China has started to develop its own national defense construction.Any western country will be hostile to China, and any neighbor of China will feel uneasy about China.Now, let me answer the question I raised at the beginning:Why is it that China is not worried that the West will scold China for its system on diplomatic occasions? Even from a certain point of view, China is more willing to tangle with the West on these issues?Attacking China's system will make more and more Westerners think that China is an evil communist country. But in fact, the goal of the Communist Party is not here at all. The goal of the Communist Party is to make China a superpower. If the West attacks China in the field of public opinion, such an attack is very weak. At the same time, I also see that many Westerners are happy to attack China on social media platforms.Today, even if all western countries unite against China, they cannot completely defeat China. This is bad news for the west.For example, if you put bacteria in a beaker, the bacteria will divide once every minute.If the first bacteria were put in at 11 o'clock at night.After 12 o'clock, the bacteria will overflow the beaker.So when did the bacteria reach half of the beaker?11:59In 40 years, China seized 40 years and completed 200 years of work in the West. This is due to the centralized system of the Communist Party. Today, China has been revived, and the reason why China is willing to argue with the West on institutional issues on diplomatic occasions is to win the last few seconds for China.Now western countries want to kill China. Sorry, it's too late.When you really read my answer and see it here, maybe you will change your view of China. China may upset you, but it tells you a fact: a weak country can become strong. China can, and maybe your country can, too.",0 followers,Mike Bell,4.7K,122,274.3K,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-a-deep-understanding-of-quantum-mechanics-a-prerequisite-for-studying-quantum-computing
6,"Why don’t Western people like China?I’m not sure if you’re asking about westerners living in China, or westerners living in their home countries. I’ve answered for both:Why western expats don’t like China:Lots of westerners like China. Some love it.I’ve been here for over 30 years. When people ask me if I “like China” I usually say “It’s home— I like it on goods days. Not so much on bad days. But it’s home, anyway.”But yes, some westerners dislike China, and there can be a number of reasons for it:Why don’t Western people like China?I’m not sure if you’re asking about westerners living in China, or westerners living in their home countries.

But it’s home, anyway.”But yes, some westerners dislike China, and there can be a number of reasons for it:So basically, there are stressors on foreign exists which local Chinese may find difficult to understand. In addition, there are some more objective reasons, such as air pollution and food safety, which can be troublesome.These feelings are sometimes amplified by what I call the “China sucks” feedback loop.In order to relieve the stresses outlined above, some westerners like to sit around in expat bars complaining about China and the Chinese. Their WeChat groups feeds are full of media that validate the “China sucks” narrative; videos, photos, stories, and memes featuring Chinese people driving badly, being rude tourists, assaulting or cheating foreigners, littering, spitting, etc. Also there are stories of Chinese cops or other officials harassing expats.Anyway, if you find a group of successful and mature westerners in China, they are unlikely to dislike the place. Westerners who really dislike the place are very often people who are having issues in some aspect of their lives, and whose anti-China views are constantly being validated and re-validated.Westerners living in their home countries.Now, if you are talking about westerners in their home countries who somehow dislike China, that’s a different story. This is likely due to the constant stream of disinformation about China and its activities. You have to understand that China’s economic and military ascension is a scary thing. For the past 100 (?) years the western counties have ruled the world economy— that looks like it’s come to an end. It’s hard to adjust.Take just one example: the South China Sea “dispute”. If you look at it from a Chinese perspective, it’s perfectly natural that China should carve out it’s own portion of the SCS. Everyone else has been doing it for decades and no one complained. In addition, look at how many US military installations are arrayed along China’s coast, between Taiwan and Vladivostok. And with the US and Vietnam getting more friendly with one another, it makes sense that China should reserve it’s own space.OK. That’s the a reasonable China perspective. But if you’re in the US, you may not even know, or may not notice, that the US has stationed itself across China’s doorstep and outside it’s backyard fence. You almost certainly don’t know that SE Asian countries have been claiming parts of the SCS for years. So it seems like a clear case of Chinese aggression.So the media tells you that China is threatening your economic and military dominance, and is a growing threat to world peace. If you believe that, it makes sense to dislike China.",571 followers,Rachel Casale,827,124,888.9K,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-a-deep-understanding-of-quantum-mechanics-a-prerequisite-for-studying-quantum-computing

No pollution, clean streets, no beggars/homeless, wide variety of independent shops and food outlets, moderate traffic, !!electric motorcycles!!, well run places to stay, delicious food (so much better than UK ‘Chinese takeaway), very little sexualisation of women (either clothes or depiction in adverts), everyone with a 15cm smartphone, great internet access, people hiring bikes with an app on their phone.Where shall I stop?Once the truth starts to filter to the general population, respect will grow.Of course there will be resistance. We in the West cannot bear the idea that our version of ‘democracy’ is not the best for everyone. It will take us a while to understand the role of the Chinese Communist party and the benefits of a system like that.Addition 1: We are told that China suppresses religion - but in Dali there is a three-sources temple in the town - Confucius, Tao, Buddha - and the Confucius Centre in the centre has been completely rebuilt in the last few years. On the outskirts there is the Guan Yin temple. Ordinary folk out shopping come in all the time to say a prayer etc. I sensed their genuinely spiritual experience.Addition 2: I also realised why China was advancing so fast - they work steadily! Wherever I looked people seemed to be just ‘getting on with it’. I sensed this was a deep habit, centuries old in the population.Addition 3: Dancing in the park! Amazing. Just a group of people with a music-system doing musical Tai Chi. Another small group playing instruments in the park. So unselfconscious. Just enjoying themselves.Update 2020: My prediction is probably now wrong. A dark cloud has descended over China/West relations. There is a growing China-phobia in the UK. People with no knowledge of China, who, when I wrote this post 2 years ago, would have little to say about China, now are experts making cold-war-like statements.I responded recently to a very good article by a Harvard professor warning against a new cold-war with China. I was immediately vilified by comment writers (as was the author), accusing me of being a Chinese troll, or perhaps the author of the article. Very disturbing.The main driving force for this is that western commentators blame China for their COVID19 deaths because of the delay in reporting in Dec 2019. The very slow and inadequate responses by the UK, US and now Brazil and all the consequent deaths are blamed in China, not on the inadequate response.China is not perfect, but the inaccurate picture I reported 2 years ago has been transformed into something more dangerous.",63 followers,Peter Elliott,1.1K,5.4K,20M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-a-deep-understanding-of-quantum-mechanics-a-prerequisite-for-studying-quantum-computing

If China is now democratic like Europe and the United States, maybe Europe and America will not exist. At that time, there was only one country in the world: China! Therefore, don’t believe their so-called democracy. Their purpose is nothing more than messing up China. To put it bluntly, they are now very jealous of China’s economic development and admire China’s large market and need China’s large consumption power. , This is their real purpose. In terms of economic construction, as a big country, it is normal for China to gradually rise under the condition of normal political and economic development, but the world is such a big place, there are so many businesses, and the cake is limited, so you will naturally share more of your rise. , Then some people must eat less.What's more, with the adjustment of my country's industry, there are fewer and fewer economic models for extracting resources from our country. The United States, Japan and other countries rely on gold dollars for our non-renewable resources. The rest is to rely on US dollars to buy our high labor value-added products.In this way, for the United States and other Western developed countries, a huge and irreversible trade deficit has been formed.

I bet you will be struck by its tranquility and beauty when you come here.Litang County in Sichuan Province, which I think is a bit like Switzerland, also has herds of cattle and sheep.The ancient town of Wuyuan, with white walls and black tiles, is a characteristic building in southern China.

So these areas can be lifted out of poverty through tourism, and many poor areas have become rich in this way.On Quora, I often see people asking if China is poor or backward.

Life here is peaceful and good, no guns, no riots, you can go out at night.The Chang 'an Avenue in Beijing.Red lanterns lit up the streets.This is what Chinese cities look like. China's economy is developing and its cities are becoming better and better. Changes are taking place every day.What also impressed me was that Chinese people are warm-hearted and kind. If you ask strangers for help, they will certainly do their best to help you, especially new visitors. Because hospitality is their tradition. .I am always touched by their warmth.Volunteers in China cut the old man's hair for free.The policeman took the lost child in his arms and wrapped him in his coat to keep him warm。In China, people trust the police so much that they can go to them for help with any problems.If you want to see more of these photos, I have plenty more, but I can't post them all in this answer.

This setting satisfies the PC for putting black into the scene without “breaking the heart” of the white audiences by making black females dating white males.As for Asian, they can become either kungfu/ninja masters or nerds. And somehow all of sudden the film directors are “feminists” that they wanna “empower” women so it likely to end up with Asian female actor being cool and independent and powerful, almost like Asian males are weak and can’t handle anything so the women have to come up. Strangely, they return to patriarchy and no longer “empower” women when it comes to white females. Again, it’s like I can welcome you to our film for racial harmony and equality, but you can’t “overact” to take the white man’s leadership.Not only in the films and TV shows but also in games, music and fashion that, when it comes to white, it’s always normal and universal and common sensed standard. But when it comes to Asian specifically, it’s always some kinda “distinct” and “unique” setups that all of sudden it’s all about diversity rather than universalism. Black is once again luckier than Asian in this case for the former can be more universal than the latter.Therefore, there is an identity card here for every group. You will be included and “helped” for my moral superiority, but don’t expect to take the lead. In this case, every group is complementary for the white and the West.But once you switch it, and let’s say that the American audiences have to sit down in the film theater to watch English subtitle and someone else being the “Captain” to save the world, then all of sudden they don’t “get used” to it. because you are substituting them.To imply that, you would understand that why Russia is always the bad guy while the East European Slavic countries are good, and why China is evil but all the countries nearby are one way or another “important” for the West.

So that’s what a “metric” is.TheIn Newtonian Mechanics, the universe is assumed to be totally Euclidean — and thus we can use the 3D Euclidean metric to define all of our distances (and light always travels in straight lines, because straight lines are the shortest distance between two points in Euclidean space).However, in the early 20th century, Einstein (with help from Lorenz, Poincare and so on), realised that 3D Euclidean geometry was insufficient to describe electromagnetic effects. 3D geometry justHowever — they realised that if you moved to aMinkowski space is a 4-dimensional space, which has a Euclidean spatial part, and aThis is why we call it “spacetime” — because you need to includeIn Minkowski space you can still define a “distance” between two events in spacetime — and thus we have a metric:ηThe bottom square is just the Euclidean metric — the diagonal of 1’s.

This should be roughly accessible to an American high school student.Let’s break the phrase down:> “metric”tl;dr: a “metric” is some general way to measure distance.Effectively, “metric” refers to some way of measuring something. Feel free to substitute the word “distance”!Except… it’s not just distance. It’s a way of measuring distance. So use phrase “distance measuring stick”.Ehhh, that’s messy. Use the phrase “distance measure”.Buuuut, the word “measure” means something specific in mathematics. So, let’s not use that.The word “metric” is really deep in our language, going waaaaaay back as referring to just a way to measure something. It doesn’t mean anything specific way to do it—unless you specify what it is.What’s the metric for success on Wall Street? Money, and more of it.When we talk about a metric here, we’re just talking about some kind of process for measuring something.What's the distance between 10 and 7?To find it, you subtract. (A verb…) The process of doing this is called… subtraction (a noun). Why I'm calling it a noun and verb will be mentioned later.What’s the metric for winning an archery contest? Measuring the distance to the bullseye. (… actually, in math… this would be the “Pythagorean metric”)How many blocks until the New York Public Library? Go 8 blocks (… actually, in math, this way of measuring this is often called the “taxi cab metric”.)Simple enough? “Metric” just means “a way of measuring distance”. And there are different ways to measure distance.I’ve repeated this so many times now, let’s pretend it’s true.> “tensor”tl;dr: a tensor is a mathematical object. It’s a “hyper-matrix”.This is where it gets confusing. So, I’ll just tell lead in to what a tensor is. And you need… to really relax your brain a bit.In English, you’re used to making sentences like noun + verb. “Bob jumps.” An object. And a doing of something.Math is exactly the same. We do this over-and-over-and-over again. But math, we’re just SUPER-specific about what the noun is. And what the verb can be.In math, we often deal with numbers. So, numbers are a kind of “mathematical object”. A kind noun.And numbers are a mathematical object that you already know what you can do to them. Like “add”. That’s a verb.But numbers aren’t the only mathematical nouns. There are quite a few.We can have many numbers, and these numbers collected together are a set. This is one of the most general ideas about how to arrange numbers.AWe don’t really know how to “add” sets of numbers together. There’s not a good verb for “add”-ing sets.Now, some math nerds will say to me, “That’s not true. You can join them together.”OH?! Is that what “add” means?See mathematicians are just like your grammar teacher. They're precise. They say what they mean. Not something else.You could invent a way to “add” sets. But generally, there just isn’t one right way to do that.We can also arrange some simple numbers in pairs. Sometimes we call those points, like (x,y).But… what can you do with that? Can you do anything to it? How do you add two points? Like sets, there’s no right answer.But we can give certain points a verb (like “add”), and call the pair of points a vector. And that basically means, it’s not just a point, the point represents “pointing”—verbing—in some direction. Sometimes, when we want to represent a vector, we write a little arrow over it. Boop!So, you can actually take a pointAnd now know we know, that when we add these pairs we add each number pair-wise:(How was the magically divined? Because that satisfies one of the definitions of a vector. Which… is a separate discussion.)Now, we can also arrange numbers into rectangles, and we call that a matrix.(Now, each number in a matrix is… well, a number. But if you look at any column of a matrix… well, you can “pull out” that whole column and call it a vector. Or, you can pull out a row of a matrix… and call that… a vector too!My point is this: This is all really, super flexible! I can do almost anything to these objects. As long as I can communicate to you, what I’m doing.And now stuff gets weird. With matrices, the lines between noun and verb start to get blurry. Because a matrix itself is a noun.But that noun can also be treated as representing a verb. A matrix is a bunch of numbers like above. But a matrix can also represent the process of doing something. Verbing.How? It's beyond the answer. But if I read the matrix in a certain way, it's like a computer program. A program is a thing. But it's a think that does something too.So what in the world does all this build-up have to do with a tensor?A tensor is yet another type of mathematical noun.You noticed so far, we started with numbers.And we collected them into vectors.And then we collected those vectors into a matrix.A tensor is the next step up.In fact, a matrix is a simple type of tensor.But why would you want to do that? Well, there are lots of reasons. But, they’re a bit beyond this. Just know, that a tensor is a type of mathematical noun… that also represent a verb.So what is a “metric tensor”?A metric tensor is a mathematical object that tells you how to measure distance… in some place.What any particular metric tensor is… will depend on what place you’re in!If you’re standing on a plane (which is infinitely flat), you’re going to measure distance differently than if you lived on a planet (which is curved).You...",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

Rent prices cost 479.28% higher than India. This happens because every country has its own metric tensor. Think, what would have happen if all of them had same metric?Similarly, every point in CO- ordinate system has its own metric tensor. We don’t care about this usually because our Euclidean co-ordinate system has same metric tensor everywhere. In advance physics or mathematics, we have to deal with non -Euclidean spaces with varying metric tensor at every point. So let’s understand how this works..How will you calculate distance between two points or angle between two vector on plane or in Euclidean space?Its simple, we apply Euclidean geometry right? we measure dx and dy, use Pythagoras to compute the distance, similarly using dot product I can compute angle. Now, how will you measure distance between two points or angle on a sphere, or Earth or any complex surface like teddy bear. Its really difficult because we can’t apply our Euclidean geometry here.In order to do that let us solve these…Let us assume I’ve a rubber sheet , if I draw two points on this sheet, then what is the distance between two points. Its just Euclidean distance.(dr)^2 = (dx)^2 + (dy)^2;Assume, I’ve stretch the rubber sheet in x – direction by 2 times, now the distance will be…(dr)^2 = (2dx)^2 + (dy)^2;If I stretch the rubber sheet in y – direction by 2 times, now the distance will be..(dr)^2 = (dx)^2 + (2dy)^2;If I stretch the rubber sheet in both y and x – direction by 2 and 3 times respectively, now the distance between the points will be.(dr)^2 = (2dx)^2 + (3dy)^2;What if I stretch the same sheet in some random direction. Now, the distance between the points is not same as before. How to relate the unstretched distance to stretched distance.What If sheets are stretched in any random directions uniformly. Then the distance will be(dr)^2 =g11(dx)^2 +(g12+g21)(dxdy)^2 +g22(dy)^2Hence, the whole stretching information is captured by these co-efficients (g11,g12,g21,g22).And this stretching information is stored in efficient data structure i.e tensor, which is called Metric Tensor.A tensor is just a mathematical object to store data (data structure in maths) 0th rank tensor is scalar, 1st rank tensor is vector, 2nd rank tensor is matrix…etc. Time is stored in scalar, force is stored in vector, metric space is represented by 2nd order tensor. Similarly, Einstein uses 4th order tensors to store space -time curvature information.Hence, if I know by how much and in which direction my sheet is stretched, I can easily calculate the distance between two points. In other words, If I know the metric tensor of stretched sheet, I can compute the distance between any two points by equation(dr)^2 =g11(dx)^2 +(g12+g21)(dxdy)^2 +g22(dy)^2What is the use of these Metric Tensor (Stretching info of Euclidean planes)? So lets go back to our original problem, how to calculate distance between two points on any complex surfaces.Let us consider two points on sphere (surface can be anything like bottle, doll or any complex surface). Imagine, you take a rubber sheet and stretch it however you want to approximate the spherical surface, so that original shape of sphere is not lost and paste it (Note I use rubber patches because I can deform it however I want to approximate any surface). and note the stretching information i.e Metric Tensor (i.e g11,g12,g21,g22). Now, draw a line between those two points on rubber sheet and remove that rubber sheet.Now as rubber sheet goes back to its original unstretched state, I can get (dx,dy) on my rubber sheet. So, now I’ve dx, dy, and (g11,g12,g21,g22) stretched information (Metric Tensor) which I had noted. So, I can compute distance between those two points on surface using Equation:(dr)^2 = g11(dx)^2 + g12(dxdy)+g21(dydx)+g22(dy)^2;Hence, I can approximate any complex surface better by increasing these rubber patches (deformable Euclidean spaces). Ideally any surface is 100% approximated by infinite patches (Riemannian Manifolds). And every patch has its stretching info(metric_tensor). As I know the stretching information of all sheet, now I can compute the distance between any two point on any complex surface by simple summation, which is nothing but Geo_desic distance. Even angle between any two vectors can be computed using metric tensor.Hence, the whole surface information is captured by these little patches via space stretching information which is called Metric Tensor.Metric Tensor of sphere isThis means in order to approximate surface of radius (R) by patch at particular point (x,y,z) or (R,theta,phi) in spherical co-ordinates, I have to stretch my rubber sheet R^2 times in x direction and R^2sin(tetha) times in y direction. You can observe how unit distance on rubber sheet varies at different position on sphere when approximated by these rubber sheets. Similarly, any complex surface will have its own metric tensors (stretching information) as function of position on surface. This kind of patch approximation of surfaces enables us to compute angles and distances very easily on any complex surfaces.Generalization to N dimensional non Euclidean spaces.Nash embedding theorem says, We can approximate any complex M dimensional surfaces (manifolds) with (M-1) dimensional Euclidean spaces (here 3D sphere was approximated by 2D rubber sheet patches) by stretching it. And every point on this N-manifold has its own metric tensor (patch stretching info). This Euclidean approximation enables us to use our Euclidean geometry on non- Euclidean spaces like Riemannian manifolds.Note: every point in co-ordinate system (Euclidean, polar, any Einstein space-time, any surface) has its own vector space. And every vector space has its own metric space(metric tensor). This metric enables us to compute distance, area,angle or volume in that space. Without metric tensor, we can't measure anything in space. In Euclidean co-ordinate system, every point has same vector space, hence metric remains same all over the space. But complex surfaces have variable vector space, hence metric changes with position.Metric Tensor of 3D Euclidean space….This shows that the space is un-stretched at any point of space.Metric Tensor of non – Euclidean N dimensional space, the stretching of space is function of position.Hence, any complex M-dimensional surfaces information can be captured by these Metric Tensor. This enables us to introduce concept of distance, angles and areas on N-d complex Manifolds.","16,998 followers",Mark Eichenlaub,1.6K,393,8.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-a-deep-understanding-of-quantum-mechanics-a-prerequisite-for-studying-quantum-computing

It’s primarily young people from big cities who loathe the idea of having to serve because spending one year in the middle of nowhere with no entertainment whatsoever with a bunch of guys he never met in his life. Majority of provincial guys are completely fine with conscription service, most of our professional servicemen in the assault groups are primarily from the provinces.Mandatory service is not only obligatory but the person can get conscripted till the person is 27 years old, so actually avoiding it is not easy, I’m actually in favor of decreasing the limit conscription age to 22, so the person can get his degree in whatever he wants and be free from conscription forever, the 27 age limit is obviously a Soviet method where if the person is not aiming for a PhD then he must be in the military to defend against the Western threat and back in the Soviet days the conscription was three years long, these days it’s just 12 months. Still we have a thing called “Alternative Civilian Service” where the person can simply do a year of compulsory work in social services such as the post office or healthcare clinics and never have to do military service at all. College students can also continue their studies in military universities instead and work as researchers or technicians in the military with proper salaries that usually surpasses the salaries of the average servicemen.Is it bad?Since 1998, a decree was enacted that states that conscripts can’t be put in warzones (Syria) or “hotposts” (North-Caucasus) under any circumstances, so no real risks to his life. In 2013,In 2008 there were large reforms to end hazing and improve the living conditions of the military facilities, they enacted a law against hazing and installed CCTV cameras in nearly every facility, not only to eradicate hazing but also eradicate corruption. Superiors can’t touch conscripts under any circumstances, conscripts themselves can report any dissatisfaction they have to the military affairs office, plus there are physical inspections every other week to make sure their health is ok. Since 2013 all sergeants are professional servicemen under contract, so no chances of hazing or “dedovshchina” happening, no sergeant would put his career on the line or risk getting arrested.There’s no internet or Netflix, true, smartphones are also prohibited, skype with family only on the weekends, TV is usually on our military channel or news channel, they can choose any channel only during recreational hours, the “payment” is also nonexistent, just 2,000 roubles (30 USD) a month, unless they specialize in a job, so they can actually receive an actual payment that starts from 20,000 rubles (200 USD).But it’s not bad, people just don’t wanna be forced to do it, which is fair enough.The mandatory service is mainly because we need large amounts of manpower to do menial but critical work that keeps our military running and we try to create an environment where they can execute those tasks smoothly so the professional servicemen can focus in being proficient at their specializations. The borders are just too large and the Soviet Union left a gigantic amount of equipment behind, as much the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation and officers would like to move to a purely professional contract force, these young men do a crucial and invaluable duty in helping keep this nation safe and we’re grateful for their service.","43,458 followers",Misha Firer,613,1.3K,133.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-a-deep-understanding-of-quantum-mechanics-a-prerequisite-for-studying-quantum-computing

It is first part of trilogy “Win. Winner. Winnest.”Main character is Vasili is drafted to russky brutalsky army. Vasili’s mother had crowd-funded online to collect 10,000 rubles to pay bribe to dodge, but she fell short 3,469 rubles.Vasili is sent to elite Rocket and Missile Range Garrison in Moscow Oblast. On the first night,Vasili gets a gram of hash through his mother, butDediCaptain demands 10 grams of hash to save Vasili’s a$$. Vasili promises he’ll pay later with interest. In the meantime, his mother has been working hard behind the scenes to get her son a transfer to even better military post in navy, on cruiser “Beriya.” Mother is forced to sell her 23 square meter family apartment on the fifth floor without elevator to pay off captain.Cruiser “Beriya” is Soviet and very big but understaffed because of army dodging and shrinking male population. Funds for Navy is systematically ransacked by minister of defence Serdyuchka and his greedy girlfriend so light bulbs are in serious shortage. Bulbs not like your Westernsky energy-saving spiral things, I mean energy-devouring, bulbous, brittle with a filament hanging in ether.When time to practice manoeuvres, sailors battle each other for light bulbs. Vasili again on the receiving end. He lose fist fight and the corridor to his room is unlit. He stumbles through darkness and falls through a hole like in Star Wars and lands in an abandoned section. His right leg is broken. He cries for help, but all in vain.Vasili is attacked by hungry rats and finds skeletons of other sailors who had died before him.Luck is on his side. Cruiser is attacked by rogue drones. Sailors run around the deck screaming “Devils’ fly machines!” and fire at them with kalashnikovs. Some of the missiles are inoperable. Cannons are rusty. Priests spray holy water to drive drones away.A direct hit below deck allows Vasili to escape. He gets into a rescue boat, which is saved by Americansky cruiser five days later but only after the survivors have eaten one of their dead comrades.When Vasili sees American flag, he tries to drown himself, but is too late. When mother finds out that her son has been captured by the enemy, she denounces him no matter how much TV people tried to explain that Vasili was merely picked up in the open sea.Vasili is seriously shocked by Americansky cruiser. Sailors exercise in the state of the art gym, play computer games on Play Station, eat three times a day, and get paid thousands of dollars a month.Back on “Beriya,” Vasili and his perpetually hungry comrades spent their days fighting for bulbs and trying not to break their necks in dark corridors.When the cruiser passes by Russian oligarch’s super-yacht, Americansky ask if the oligarch can take his compatriots on board. He refuses and quickly steams away from the cruiser.Next day, the event happens. From a secret military base in Kamchatka the super-weapon SsiKoon is launched. A pyramid-shaped protoplasmic bomb containing at least a thousand Hiroshima explosions in its core travels at near the speed of light warping time and space.As it traverses blue sky, Vasili and his comrades shed tears of joy, lifestyle comparisons gone out of their minds for good. Vasili begins to sing a patriotic song and his comrades join in with him.This is russky super-weapon and it works, which means the obvious: his country is the best in the world. Vasili is a proud citizen, soldier, and sailor of his heroic nation.The super-weapon explodes and a big mushroom rises above the waves. What country has just been wiped out?

The food was awfull and the service was boring.As you can see, opinions can be different.I hope I could answer your question, Tufshin.",0 followers,Konstantin Petrenko,691,896,8.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-the-Western-world-treat-China-unfriendly

Often it is simply impossible to ensure your authority in the men's team, if you did not serve in the army. You simply will not be respected properly, because in the eyes of others you will be considered a weakling. You also can't hold many government positions if you haven't done your military service.That is why cases of evasion from military service in Russia are not so common.As for the quality of military service - it was bad during 1990-2010, now it is much better.

In fact, they nearly have it correct.The Soviet (and now Russian) military have a mainly conscripted (drafted) armed service. The officers are usually the sons of higher ranking Party/Politburo members, not necessarily the most capable. Disobedience or non-compliance is dealt with extremely harshly and swiftly. Any error that occurs is always the fault of an enlisted man, regardless of the error.Their chain of command is not always clear cut, due to a Political Officer that is assigned to each & every command. The Political Officer can, and often does, step in & override the Commanding Officer in various matters if the CO is not a very strong personality and in good standing with the party.These are just a few reasons that Russians don’t volunteer to join their military services.","66,708 followers",Dima Vorobiev,598,4.2K,139.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-the-Western-world-treat-China-unfriendly

It went from being broke quasi-criminal bums to a relatively capable force that looks not worse than the most advanced foreign counterparts.When I was finishing school, I was terrified that I would be drafted for the military service because the only one thing I associated the army with was hazing. At the turn of the century Russian army was not much better than the Russian prison.Glamorous representation of the Russian army hazing. It’s basically Abu Ghraib.But I was lucky. I graduated from one of the best universities in the country which, among other things, had a military department. Given my military specialty (which, ironically, was psychological warfare, hello Quora) I didn't have to go and serve.Things changed after the Georgian war of 2008 when it became evident that the Russian army, while not being a complete failure (after all, we won triumphantly) still left a lot to be desired. At that time the minister of defense was this man — Anatoly Serdyukov.Photo opps are not really his thing.One of the most despised Russian government officials, he was corrupt af. Surprisingly, it was his activities that led to the quality transformation of the Russian army, and with the advent of Sergei Shoigu as Serdyukov’s successor the transformation was complete.The real reason to be proud of the Russian Military came to be after the Ukrainian crisis and the reunification of Crimea, when the world saw the “polite green men” with top notch gear and uniform which “they probably purchased at a surplus store,” — said President Putin, trying to conceal the fact it was us.It was in fact us.So now the Russian military is a modern well equipped and very smart force that managed to overcome the shortcomings of the 1990s.","43,459 followers",Misha Firer,1.3K,1.3K,133.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-the-Western-world-treat-China-unfriendly
