3,"Rivigo.I came across this start-up when I was reading a column in Times of India.Rivigo is really a unique start-up,their business model,the area they work in is quite unique.They want to revolutionize trucking and logistics in India.

Logistics have become paramount part of supply chain management with rise of eCommerce and other industries.The common problem is that everyone wants faster delivery of goods. Rivigo is trying to solve this problem by their unique solution.Mostly delivery of cargo in any industry across country is done through trucking. And trucking in India is in tumultuous shape,they face acute shortage of drivers and there are many other problems ,Truck drivers face very harsh lifestyles as they have to drive through all over India.Many long-distance trucks have two drivers, taking turns to sleep. Other trucks have only one driver, fighting sleep (often with drugs). Rivigo has replaced this with a relay system. Each driver drives 4.5 hours to a company pit stop, and hands over to another driver who again drives 4.5 hours to the next pit stop. The relay continues till destination. This cuts delivery time for Delhi-Chennai from 96 hours to 48, and for Bengaluru-Kolkata from 110 hours to 44. This is twice the speed of some courier companies, and maximizes truck utilization.From a pit stop, each driver catches a truck in the return direction to get home by night. The driver suddenly becomes a normal worker with a full family and community life. He gets a cellphone and good wages by village standards. His truck is air-conditioned, improving comfort and social status.One of their product is “Full truck load” as mentioned on their website, which promises delivery Anywhere to anywhere in India in just 3 days,against the industry average of 7-8 day.This looks like future of trucking/logistics,this can replace today’s unorganized,inefficient trucking and logistics sector in India,Which can deliver goods on time to warehouses reducing costs.May be in future this company can become Maersk of India.I think this is very innovative start-up and based on quite unique Idea.Edit‘Drive in India’ can generate more jobs than ‘Make in India’Maersk - Wikipedia",723 followers,Harshal Deokar,21.5K,227,1.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/As-a-practicing-tech-professional-what-are-ways-that-you-have-successfully-used-to-stay-current-with-new-and-emerging-technologies
4,"It’s probably not what you’d think.The biggest innovations in business today revolve around business models, not new tech.How do I know this?Most “entrepreneurs” in 2017 are in reality remote workers and freelancers who like to control their time, location, and income through their own efforts.The sheer amount of these entrepreneurs in the marketplace far outweighs the Stanford PhD’s creating a new fabric or bluetooth battery charger.This is amazing for anyone who currently works a traditional job; it means that there are millions of people pushing and reformatting the way companies hire and rIt’s probably not what you’d think.The biggest innovations in business today revolve around business models, not new tech.How do I know this?Most “entrepreneurs” in 2017 are in reality remote workers and freelancers who like to control their time, location, and income through their own efforts.The sheer amount of these entrepreneurs in the marketplace far outweighs the Stanford PhD’s creating a new fabric or bluetooth battery charger.This is amazing for anyone who currently works a traditional job; it means that there are millions of people pushing and reformatting the way companies hire and retain talent.In the future, we will all benefit from this restructuring. It will be easier than ever to start small businesses, hire talent from around the world, and scale companies using a remote work force.This is an absolute game-changing innovation and it’s happening right in front of our eyes- already affecting most companies around the world. The reason we don’t hear about it as much is because there isn’t just one juggernaut company leading this trend like SpaceX or Tesla do in their respective industries.The market is changing, and everything is changing along with it.","10,419 followers",Nathan Ketsdever,657,48.3K,22.2M,2012,https://www.quora.com/As-a-practicing-tech-professional-what-are-ways-that-you-have-successfully-used-to-stay-current-with-new-and-emerging-technologies
5,"The answer for both the questions is yes, new technologies and new strategies are born in startups. However, the new strategies and technologies are not new in the sense that they are not known. What the startups do is that they take the best of the available ideas, technologies and strategies and build upon it. For example, Dropbox, a cloud storage startup, did not invent the cloud, but it did invent the modern cloud storage. It applied the cloud storage to the development of new technology for both individuals and businesses by extending cloud storage to a personal cloud.","2,782 followers",Shivani Nalkar,26.7K,133,1.8M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-emerging-technology-trends-that-are-making-their-way-into-Tata-AIA-s-future-roadmap

7,"Only if you also agree to ban human drivers.If self-driving cars are made illegal DESPITE BEING SAFER than humans, and you don’t also ban humans, you are condemning tens of thousands of people to hideous deaths.Which do you think is going to improve more in the next few years - self-driving technology, or 17-year olds’ attitude to risk?",44 followers,Mark Harrison,653,28.2K,119.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/As-a-practicing-tech-professional-what-are-ways-that-you-have-successfully-used-to-stay-current-with-new-and-emerging-technologies
8,"Many do, many don’t.The thing is, it only takes a few.If self-driving cars work (and by ‘work’, I mean they can consistent and reliably get you where you’re going with a significantly lower risk of collisions or problems than human drivers), then there’s such a huge financial and practical incentive to using them that trends are only going to go one way, toward more use, never less.Once you have some few people who are willing to use self-driving cars (and believe me, early adopters will be lining up), then we’ll have them operating in real life, returning real information about their safety,Many do, many don’t.The thing is, it only takes a few.If self-driving cars work (and by ‘work’, I mean they can consistent and reliably get you where you’re going with a significantly lower risk of collisions or problems than human drivers), then there’s such a huge financial and practical incentive to using them that trends are only going to go one way, toward more use, never less.Once you have some few people who are willing to use self-driving cars (and believe me, early adopters will be lining up), then we’ll have them operating in real life, returning real information about their safety, and getting other people used to the idea.Here’s how I see things happening after that.First, businesses are going to make decisions, purely off the data. Businesses can’t afford to get emotionally attached to things. If the data say we can save money, we’ll do it.Most companies (including companies that operate industrial plants) have most fatalities and near-fatalities as a result of vehicle accidents. Just being able to reduce those will be worth a significant amount of money to these companies. What will be worth even more is if they can reduce the number of drivers they need (they’ll probably just use autonomous modes for long-haul, freeway driving at first, with humans to take over the first and last miles of the trips). This will mean a major market, which will allow the technology to improve, and economies of scale to drop the prices.Next will be taxis and ride-sharing services (which are already heavily investing). Once drivers no longer have to be paid, they’ll make huge profits. Of course, when anyone can do this, it will drive down the cost of getting rides. Eventually it will approach the cost of owning a car, and people will increasingly transition away from ownership (particularly in big cities, where parking is difficult or expensive).In process of time, more and more people will see their friends and neighbors using self-driving cars more and more, the idea will become less scary, and eventually, they’ll get on board too.Once market penetration is 50–70%, you’ll start to see cities outlawing human drivers within city limits. If the cars are as safe as we hope they’ll be, we’ll stop shrugging off traffic fatalities as just something that happens, and every death will be a big deal. It will be the more liberal cities at first, then the trend will spread. States will start making it harder to get driver’s licenses, and easier to suspend them, because people are no longer assumed to have no alternative to get around. Eventually, some states will start banning human drivers on state highways. Finally, the federal government will ban human drivers on interstates (or at least restrict highway funding for any state that doesn’t do so). There will always be some holdout areas that refuse to conform to these rules, but eventually, driving yourself will just be more trouble than it’s worth.It’s rather like cell phones, really. At first, there will be a few enthusiasts and a million people who insist that they’d never carry a government-issued tracking collar. But over a couple of decades, the world will change to where those people are compelled by reality, often grudgingly, to accept the new technology. There will always be some few people who need to operate vehicles (off-roaders, farmers, construction workers, etc), and a few stubborn people who don’t really need driver’s licenses, but refuse to give them up. But for most of us, being able to watch TV, do work, or read on our daily commutes will become completely natural, and we’ll wonder why anyone would have hesitated.",0 followers,Thomas Kolb,1.3K,575,4.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/As-a-practicing-tech-professional-what-are-ways-that-you-have-successfully-used-to-stay-current-with-new-and-emerging-technologies

It will be nothing very to lay back in the back seat.I believe when every car is self driving there will be no vehiclesOn the road with physical drivers. No steering wheel,brakes or anything for a human to use. Some believe there will be normal vehicles as we have them today.
