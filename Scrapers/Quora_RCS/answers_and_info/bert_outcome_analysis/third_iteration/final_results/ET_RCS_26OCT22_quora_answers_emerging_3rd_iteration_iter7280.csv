1,"Because it doesn't make sense to spend thousands of dollars on proprietary software when can get the same or better performance from open-source software, which is true in most web development tools and platforms.The same cannot be said for all open-source projects, but a lot of the mature ones are really just good enough.","2,108 followers",Alex Jauch,564,1.3K,15.8M,2012,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-it-that-startups-dont-like-using-Microsoft-development-technologies

This applies to almost any closed-source software now. E.g., a dozen years ago, a Oracle database was de rigueur, but I can't remember the last time I heard about a startup using one.",3 followers,Pawan Kumar,928,204,840.8K,2011,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-it-that-startups-dont-like-using-Microsoft-development-technologies
5,"A new, low-energy technique for extracting metals from oxides.In the realm ofSolar energy is used to refine metals that are then shaped into mirrors to increase the solar energy yield.The lower the energy needed to separate metals from their oxide or perchloraA new, low-energy technique for extracting metals from oxides.In the realm ofSolar energy is used to refine metals that are then shaped into mirrors to increase the solar energy yield.The lower the energy needed to separate metals from their oxide or perchlorate state, the better the system will work. With Mars being nearly a vacuum with what little else being carbon dioxide, creating a refining chamber that is essentially devoid of oxygen (or chlorine), separating the metals seems plausible with lasers, electric sparks, or perhaps even mechanical pressure.I don’t know the answer to the solution. On Earth, there are processes that involve massive amounts of energy or reagents. On Mars, we want to keep everything as lightweight as possible. The goal is to refine metals on Mars so we don’t need to shipA process that seems possible is to scoop up Mars sand and dust and sift it down to a regulated size. Put this dust through magnets that separate the grains that are ferromagnetic. Move this dust into a vacuum chamber, expose it to energy like lasers or electrical sparks to break free some of the molecular bonds — perhaps it is in a rolling barrel. After some amount of time, pour the result into a new sifting step and pull out the lumps.These lumps — probably the size of cornflake crumbs will have a higher concentration of iron and some of it may be ductile. by mechanically pressing the cornflake crumbs, if any sticks together, it’s metal that can be further worked into mirrors.This hypothetical process is inspired by reverse osmosis water filtration. Compared to the amount of water on the input side of reverse osmosis, the output size is quite small, but the cost for that smaller amount of filtered water is relatively low.There’s a lot of dust and sand on Mars. We don’t need a process that gets great yield — we only need the metal that’s easy to get.When the solar energy system is built out and generating massive amounts of electricity, then we can use better techniques to get a higher yield with higher quality. But for the bootstrapping of the energy system, we just need mirrors.",2 followers,Himanshu Chavhan,20.4K,71,660.2K,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-it-that-startups-dont-like-using-Microsoft-development-technologies
