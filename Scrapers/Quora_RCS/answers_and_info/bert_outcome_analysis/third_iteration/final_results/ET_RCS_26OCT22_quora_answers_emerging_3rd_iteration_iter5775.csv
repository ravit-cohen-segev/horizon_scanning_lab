3,"Books have been the memory of mankind since the beginning. Will the technologies we see emerging today fundamentally change that?Not just books. I think you mean writing. We have early documents from Sumer and other places, but the earliest are receipts and lists and other such short, everyday notes.New tech seems to have made all sorts of writing more common.

Will the technologies we see emerging today fundamentally change that?Not just books. I think you mean writing. We have early documents from Sumer and other places, but the earliest are receipts and lists and other such short, everyday notes.New tech seems to have made all sorts of writing more common. The amount of email I get enormously exceeds the snail mail letters I used to get from friends and relatives and, horribly, advertisers. Lots of people, some barely literate, read and write vast quantities of commentary on social media and sites like Quora or Reddit.Books as such are and will continue to be popular. Over the last few years I’ve taken to buying ebooks, except for those that feature graphics or photos. Thanks to scanning tech, anybody with a smartphone or other computer has access to almost everything printed before 1800, and much of the rest too, including the archives of newspapers and magazines. When I was a grad student at NYU I depended on microfiche for old books and on the microfilm readers at the NY Public Library for old periodicals. If I were still writing papers I could research them now from my bed in New Mexico, absent rare items in private collections — and those will eventually be scanned, I’m sure.Ebooks still have a few drawbacks, mostly because the readers we use aren’t very big. There are obvious solutions to that; anyway, the advantages outweigh the downside. When I moved here from NY I gave away, or threw away, about half my books, but still had to schlep thousands across the country, literally a pain — took years for my back to recover. In our new house, shelving had to be built to accommodate them. Some of my books are sixty or seventy years old and if you open them the spine splits and they shed all over the place. Bugs and mice eat them. The paper shows foxing and may crack when you turn a page. Stupidly named “perfect” bindings come apart and the pages have to be held together with rubber bands, which rot.Ebooks take up no space at all — I keep most of mine in the cloud — and even a hand-sized Kindle, or a phone with a micro-SD card, can hold a thousand of them. If you come across a word you don’t know, tap it to get a dictionary definition or a Wikipedia article, or surf the Web to find commentary. Forget where you saw a citation or a phrase? Use the search engine. Record “marginal notes,” outline salient passages, and share notations if you wish — or see those of other readers. Rate a book and review it if the spirit moves you. There are (rather primitive) facilities for lending a book. (Libraries have better lending platforms.) Out-of-print books are cheap or free.To a grumpy, elderly, nerdy, misanthropic bibliophile like me, ebooks are a dream come true. I grew up in Miami, which in the 50’s was strictly from Hicksville, with few bookstores, a (small) library an hour’s bus ride away from home — and in any event I was a kid with hardly any money to spend on books. It was a great day when I discovered you could order books by mail from vendors in NYC — but of course you had to know what you wanted, and find out, by snail mail, if they had it, and pay shipping, and wait a month for it to arrive. My parents, who had little use for books, wouldn’t or couldn’t invest in a Britannica or a big dictionary. So I grew up stupid.Sigh. If, if, if. If, instead of being at the end of my rope, I were a grumpy, nerdy, misanthropic,",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,12K,5.6K,427.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-and-or-entertainment-companies-successfully-adapted-their-business-model-for-emerging-markets

You now have roughly half the services that we currently carry around in our pocket in the form of a 4-inch long, 140g glass slab.Back in the 1980’s there were maybe a small handful of billionaires on the entire planet with the resources to pull together for their own exclusive use all the stuff we now casually carry about in our pockets. I’m not sure if there has ever been a technological shift in society this profound in such a short space of time before. Smartphones are truly incredible pieces of technology when you step back to consider them, and it’s no wonder (although more than a little scary) that they are quickly overtaking many areas of human existence.","1,297 followers",Nathan Lloyd Hewitt,545,85,1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Books-have-been-the-memory-of-mankind-since-the-beginning-Will-the-technologies-we-see-emerging-today-fundamentally-change-that
6,"I don’t write in “self improvement” topic, but there is a first for everything. Two of my favorite books that I read together are: “How to get whatever you want” and “Think and Grow Rich”. I read these as a 17 year old and they were phenomenal. I tried to apply a lot of it during that time and had quite a bit of fortune implementing them.The key concepts like “just show up” and “just ask” —are so simple and yet so powerful.I will give you examples of how I used it.I was in my second year of college when we had the annual programming contestI don’t write in “self improvement” topic, but there is a first for everything. Two of my favorite books that I read together are: “How to get whatever you want” and “Think and Grow Rich”. I read these as a 17 year old and they were phenomenal. I tried to apply a lot of it during that time and had quite a bit of fortune implementing them.The key concepts like “just show up” and “just ask” —are so simple and yet so powerful.I will give you examples of how I used it.I was in my second year of college when we had the annual programming contest to select the top team to go to the prestigious ACM ICPC. I was preparing for the contest since the time I joined college. I led a team that was short of 1 person [he had to leave another contest in the last minute] and we tied up for the top slot. The other team were one year senior to us and the college gave them the slot to go to the Asia regionals in IIT Kanpur. I didn’t like the idea of seniority just used to break the tie.I would have given up if not for that crazy book above. I just explored for sometime the other alternatives in the days before social media and found an Asia regionals happened in Dhaka, Bangladesh. I just found out the organiser’s number and called him out of the blue [when it cost over $1/min for the international call from a public booth and I had very little money]. I convinced him to take our team from India. I went through all the rules and he could not find any hole in my argument. He was more amused by the strange request from a teenager from abroad and okayed my proposal.And then came the task of convincing my teammates that Bangladesh was a safe country to go to. We had a trip of our lifetimes taking a 3.5 day travel one way from the southern part of India to Bangladesh over 2 trains and a bus. It was an amazing experience interacting with everyone there and although we could not make it to the world finals we got home with a honorable mention for being in the top 10%. I should have tried the following 2 years too, but somehow never participated [and of course I regret that now for not showing up].From sitting in a small town in the middle of nowhere in a day without all the information revolution to getting there was a big win for me.Two months later I did an even crazier thing. I was in New Delhi attending a college competition. I got a strange idea to walk up to the Rashtrapati Bhavan [President’s palace] to get a meeting with the President of the largest democracy. In an another time I would not have done that, but I was crazy in the power of asking. It could not harm, right?I just showed up and asked. The secretary thought it was funny that a teenager was walking up to get an appointment with the President of India. She still passed up my request to President’s PA. A day later my relative got the call that the President wanted to talk to me. He was genuinely curious about a teenager who came all the way from the southern part of India and had gumption to write to him.That led to the greatest day in my life:A year later I was applying for grad school. I got an admission, but without a scholarship. I called up a professor and explained the situation. He not only gave the scholarship that enabled me to go to gradschool, but someone who is still in touch with me after so many year.I applied the same principles to a lot of smaller successes too — from getting airline seats upgraded to getting into contests. Once I was in Linuxcon where there was a Linux quiz & raffle. I answered the quiz and they asked us to come for a raffle in the afternoon. I usually don’t go for this and thought there will be a big crowd. When I showed up there was just 1 other guy and I had a 50% chance of winning. And winning I did of a good laptop that I immediately sold on eBay. All I had to do was just show up. Another time I saw a startup competition going on. I was in for an another event and asked if I could pitch. The qualifiers were already over a long time ago, but they still let me pitch in the finals. I strangely won the pitch prize for someone who knew about the contest only 30 min before.After I graduated from college, I failed to use many of the principles as I grew to think that “self improvement” stuff is just icky. That means that I also went back to my old ways of being too shy to ask for stuff and thus went on a period of plateau with no major success in life. Now putting those principles back to motion. If you aim for the right thing, be reasonable, persistent and show up everytime you could very likely get that thing.We often think of success as a cut throat race where you race against thousands. Often what I found was success was a race where only a handful even show up — others are either lazy, unaware or too shy to even ask to get in. Winning often happen in contests that most don’t even know exists.",0 followers,Emeleigh Cormack,6.5K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Books-have-been-the-memory-of-mankind-since-the-beginning-Will-the-technologies-we-see-emerging-today-fundamentally-change-that

You realise that people are wasting their time, focused on meanginless things, all to avoid their mortality And that it doesn’t matter anyway.While that sounds depressing, it’s actually the opposite.You realise that your anxieties are pointless. That most of what you fear is unnecessary. And that we waste so much of our time worrying about not being good enough, skilled enough, or lucky enough to do what we want.But in reality: nobody gives a fuck. You are going to die anyway. Might as well take whatever leap you want. Nobody cares. Nothing you will do will really be remembered. And if it does, well you’re dead. You won’t know about it.It’s a tough read.
