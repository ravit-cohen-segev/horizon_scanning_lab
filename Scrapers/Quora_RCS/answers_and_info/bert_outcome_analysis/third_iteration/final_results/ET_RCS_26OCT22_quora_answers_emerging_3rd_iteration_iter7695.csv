The primary benefit would be the safe destruction of nuclear waste, enabling greater adoption of nuclear power and use of alternative fuels. There would also be net energy production.

As a power source, the fusion-fission hybrid would also allow for fission power without enrichment, which would potentially make the world a safer place by allowing the use of nuclear power without any proliferation risks.The idea is to take advantage of one of the byproducts of a fusion reaction: the production of large quantities of fast neutrons. These neutrons would be used to split nuclear fuel, thus generating power. Because the neutrons are provided by fusion, the fuel does not require a high concentration of fissile isotopes to generate a sustained reaction. Essentially any such source would be suitable as a fuel in such a reactor, and they could be run using the nuclear waste of standard nuclear reactors.The core of the device is a Tokamak which is covered in a blanket of nuclear fuel. The Tokamak is run below Q=1. We are much closer to the development of a Tokamak that can sustain this operation than the development of a Tokamak capable of fusion power on its own. Obviously, there are a variety of engineering challenges that remain before such a system can work, but it is closer than one might think. Tokamaks are understood much better than they used to be, and their stable operating times are over a minute in some cases, which is a reasonable amount of time when compared to the relevant time-scales predicted by plasma physics, which means that with more improvements it will be possible to confine plasmas for much longer. One of the main challenges of any use of fusion energy is developing materials that do not change their properties when exposed to massive amounts of energetic neutrons, and this case is no exception.Here is a link to an article that closely consults the protagonists of this idea:http://www.utexas.edu/news/2009/01/27/nuclear_hybrid/","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2012,https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-minimal-viable-product-for-nuclear-fusion-power-reactors-look-like-What-are-the-barriers
1,"I used to work on fusion simulation codes (particle in cell) with the US National Labs when I was at NVIDIA, and I was very interested in seeing if we could solve the problems with fusion and picked the scientist and engineers' brains endlessly. My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that thereI used to work on fusion simulation codes (particle in cell) with the US National Labs when I was at NVIDIA, and I was very interested in seeing if we could solve the problems with fusion and picked the scientist and engineers' brains endlessly. My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","220,640 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,783.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-minimal-viable-product-for-nuclear-fusion-power-reactors-look-like-What-are-the-barriers
2,"For a research fusion reactor, the goal is to 'break even'.  The power output must be at least as much as the power input.However for a power fusion reactor, you have a million other factors including the ability to harness that power and literally compete with the power-grid in terms of price (cents/megawatt hour).  So I'm going to say at least 2 orders of magnitude more than break even.Side note - its taken decades to even talk realistically about break even.

Development of the first grid-linked nuclear fission power plants took 10 years after the development of nuclear fission weapons.Development of fusion weapons (hydrogen bombs) also took almost 10 years of limitless government funding after the development of fission weapons. So you're combining two different challenges: fusion is harder to master than fission, and power production is harder to master than weapon production. The complexity increases exponentially.All in all, we should expect that a controlled fusion energy source will take a long time to develop.We're working our way throughYou really can't rush this stuff much.

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but itThere’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), andI hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be. It should be considered like the Manhattan project or Apollo programme but way,It should be awe inspiring, and I hope I’ve conveyed a little of that awe.Here’s a photo of the pit in which they’re building the core at ITER. For scale, there is a person standing on the extreme left of the image about halfway down (9 o’clock position). The pressure vessel (the first section of which is complete and slowly making its way into this pit) will contain more steel than the Eiffel tower. Once running, the core will be the hottest place in the solar system, in fact it’ll be hotter than anywhere within around 100 light years of Earth as only blue supergiant stars get this hot at their cores.And ITER is just the small scale prototype.

In theory once you have that, you have your essentially limitless energy source. It’s not actually limitless, but there is enough water in the Solar system to maintain our level of civilization on nothing but fusion power for billions (yes, with a B) of years, well beyond when the Sun runs out of hydrogen.On the other hand all of these projects are very far from being useful. See, producing more energy in plasma than what you put in via magnets is an important milestone, but the one you should be looking at is not the energy of plasma, it’s the energy you can harvest from that plasma. It’s mostly thermal energy and the conversion factor of that to electric power is usually around 1/2. So even these reactors won’t actually be producing more electric power than what they need to power them. They’d have to produce approximately twice that much just to break even.But wait, breaking even still only means you’re running the reactor without external input. You aren’t putting any energy in the grid yet at this point, all you’re doing is producing small quantities of helium. For the reactor to become commercially viable, it needs to produce energy far in excess of that and you need to account for energy needed to generate adequate deuterium and possibly tritium to run the core.That’s why even the furthest advanced fusion reactors are still very far removed from being useful as a power source. It is hoped that once we manage to produce a reactor that will put more energy out than it needed to run it, smaller incremental improvements will follow quickly and the next two steps will not need an exorbiant amount of time. Math seems to suggest we’ll be able to extract several times the energy we put in, that’s why these projects are being financed in the first place.But don’t count on fusion power plant construction starting in mid-2030s either.

Only ICF fusion will for the foreseeable near future be able to reach fusion conditions for advanced Generation-3 fusion reactions like He3-He3The energy needed to ignite an inertially confined thermonuclear fusion reaction in liquid (or solid) First Generation deuterium-tritium (DT) fuel is not that large; it is on the order of not more than 20 MJ or about the same amount of chemical energy stored in about 2.5 cups of automotive gasoline.The problem is that this energy for ICF fusion ignition must be compressed in space (focused down to an area less than a 2 mm) and in time (to less than 3 nanoseconds).Fusion Plasma Density and why it matters -ICF fusion uses the densest fusion plasma which results in operating fusion plasma capable of supporting the largest release of energy for a given size fusion device.ICF fusion plasma is literally 10^10 times more dense than the plasma routinely generated in Magnetic Confinement tokamak experiments like ITER or stellarator experiments like W7-x. The energy that can be drawn from plasma at fusion conditions is not a linear relationship with plasma density but is rather proportional to a squared function of plasma density - so small improvements in operating plasma density matter and greatly influence whether a particular technical approach to fusion is capable of producing break-even energy. This is particularly true in the case of small mobile fusion applications like wearable ARC fusion reactors.Note: Deuterium separated from sea water is totally non-radioactive and fusion of this fuel produces only totally non-radioactive nuclear waste (helium). The more advanced third generation He3-He3 fusion reaction has the additional benefit that it produces no neutrons at all and as a result has much relaxed shielding requirements.Fusion has many significant advantages over nuclear fission when used in direct small mobile fusion applications -1) Fusion has no critical mass requirement; all that a fusion reaction requires is the right conditions be met (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) to support fusion. As a result, very tiny fusion power plants can potentially be built.2) Fusion fuels are widely available in space. Hydrogen (and deuterium) is the most abundant elements in the universe. Hydrogen is fully 10^10 times more abundant by atoms in the universe than any combination of fission fuels (U233, U235, Pu239).3) When fusion fails to work, it tends to just flame out, and serious accidents and melt downs do not tend to happen4) Neutrons and gammas produced by fission reactors are hard to shield for vehicle or nuclear propulsion applications. Charged particles like protons produced from He3-He3 fusion are somewhat easier and more cost effective to shield. A combination of magnetic fields and electrostatic fields can be used to provide a low mass solution for biological shielding needed to provide excellent operator safety for mobile He3-He3 Inertial Confinement fusion reactors. Aneutronic fusion reactions like p-B11 and D-He3 are other good possibilities for a wearable fusion reactor application and deserve attention from designers.Helium3-Helium3 fusionHe3 + He3-> He4 + 2 protons + 12.86 MeV (energy)He3-He3 fusion produces only charged protons and energy (no difficult to shield neutrons at all).Charged Protons produced from He3-He3 fusion can be very efficiently collected on light weight grids and screens and used to directly power electric motors that actually drive the wheels of a nuclear car. Neutronless He3-He3 fusion does not require an expensive precision turbine-generator to convert nuclear heat into electricity (for He3-He3 fusion, lower cost and lighter weight direct collection of charged particles on grids suffices).He3 fusion fuel is rare on earth but can be obtained from processing lunar regolith or potentially by synthetically manufacturing He3 in specially tuned D-D fusion reactors here on earth.A properly tuned D-D inertial confinement fusion reactor may be able to produce He3 on earth (so we may not have to go to the moon for it).D-D fusion is a practical reaction for energy production from inertial confinementIt is proposed (but not yet experimentally demonstrated) that there are a range of conditions (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) that ICF D-D fusion reactors can be operated at that suppress the following D-D fusion side chainHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThis D-D fusion sidechain occurs at higher temperaturesand normally consumes the He3 produced inside a D-D fusion reactor. By properly tuning the operating conditions of a D-D ICF fusion reactor, it should be possible to make the ICF fusion reactor produce both fusion energy and He3 fuel.Manufacturing (2.3 x 10^13 metric tons) of He3 worldwide from modified D-D fusion of sea water would open up many fusion application that are now not seriously considered, including fueling nuclear fusion based transportation.Note: The amount of Deuterium in seawater is very vast (4.6 x 10^13 metric tons). The amount of He3 that could be produced from a modified form of D-D fusion that suppresses the He3 sidechain is similarly vast (2.3 x 10^13 metric tons).D-D fusion normally produces He3D-D Fusion of Deuterium fuel produces energy through four reactions:D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeVD + D -> T + p + 4.03 MeV(side chains)D + T -> He-4 + n + 17.588 MeVHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThe net effect of these four fusion reactions taken together is:6 D -> 2 He-4 + 2p + 2n + 43.243 MeVWill there ever be personal wearable ARC reactors?Early Magnetic Confinement Fusion power plants are likely to be very large and very stationary.

12,Two words “thermal efficiency”A compact high energy source such as the “Arc Reactor” would turn to a puddle of molten metal in seconds.Any high density / high energy power source on the scale of the “Arc Reactor” will be maxed out in in its compact design on the scale of a 2500 square foot house … and that is a huge stretch.Thermal efficiency will always be the limiting factor … even with superconductors the process will generate mostly waste heat or no better than 50/50. So if the miniature arc reactor put out 500 MW … it would also generate at least 500 MW of waste heat.

13,"Nuclear reactors and small are usually opposites. The problem is the shielding. Shielding is inherently heavy.The one approach is aneutronic fusion. Whoops, I may have been optimistic. Even these reactions tend to result in some neutrons. There are also substantial gammas.I don’t think there is a way unless you are willing to kill Tony.",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,631,9.4K,195.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-would-it-take-to-make-radical-breakthroughs-quickly-in-fusion-energy-technology
14,"The problem is neatly summed up as“Current state of fusion reactors is such that they produce less power than they consume in order to perform nuclear fusion within them”They need additional energy just to work.There was an article about a german design called ‘Stellarator’ which is sort of a twisted and mangled Tokamak type (at least from what I saw on the drawings) that is more efficient in generating fusion, so it has some promise, I guess.Types of nuclear fusion reactors:Magnetic confinement (magnetic fields used to contract and hold deuterium plasma - Tokamak, Stellarator)Inertial confineThe problem is neatly summed up as“Current state of fusion reactors is such that they produce less power than they consume in order to perform nuclear fusion within them”They need additional energy just to work.There was an article about a german design called ‘Stellarator’ which is sort of a twisted and mangled Tokamak type (at least from what I saw on the drawings) that is more efficient in generating fusion, so it has some promise, I guess.Types of nuclear fusion reactors:Magnetic confinement (magnetic fields used to contract and hold deuterium plasma - Tokamak, Stellarator)Inertial confinement (“In inertial confinement fusion (ICF), which is a newer line of research, laser or ion beams are focused very precisely onto the surface of a target, which is a pellet of D-T fuel, a few millimetres in diameter. This heats the outer layer of the material, which explodes outwards generating an inward-moving compression front or implosion that compresses and heats the inner layers of material.”Magnetized target fusion“Magnetized target fusion (MTF), also referred to as magneto-inertial fusion (MIF), is a pulsed approach to fusion that combines the compressional heating of inertial confinement fusion with the magnetically reduced thermal transport and magnetically enhanced alpha heating of magnetic confinement fusion.”Hybrid fusion“Fusion can also be combined with fission in what is referred to as hybrid nuclear fusion where the blanket surrounding the core is a subcritical fission reactor. The fusion reaction acts as a source of neutrons for the surrounding blanket, where these neutrons are captured, resulting in fission reactions taking place. These fission reactions would also produce more neutrons, thereby assisting further fission reactions in the blanket.” - personally, I like this one. It’s sort of like a boosted fission bomb.All the short descriptions are taken from the article on","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-minimal-viable-product-for-nuclear-fusion-power-reactors-look-like-What-are-the-barriers
