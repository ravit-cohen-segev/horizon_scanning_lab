4,"No, basic ritual behaviour has been observed in common chimps. Chimps in West Africa have special trees, one tree per clan, and the chimps go there and throw a stone against the tree trunk. The purpose doesn’t seem to be either territorial or musical, just something that they feel they must do.If ritual behaviour exists in both the human line and chimps, it probably goes back to our common ancestor.","14,900 followers",Krister Sundelin,2.2K,23.8K,89.8M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-emerging-technologies-that-a-Java-developer-should-learn-in-the-next-year
5,"If evolution is true, why there's only 1 intelligent life (human) ? Why other species did not get intelligent?I mean for example why just 1 specie out of thousands became as intelligent as us ?Actually, thereThere are other primates that are undeniably intelligent. They can make and use tools, solve problems, and can learn several hundred human words.Same goes for elephants: they are social, self-aware, and have a language.And then there are dolphins and whales, which are also social, intelligent, self-aware, and have languages.And then there arIf evolution is true, why there's only 1 intelligent life (human) ?

There have been more than one type at different times in our evolution. At least two,However, the question asking why intelligence is rare is a valid one.The reason is that intelligence is notAnd the reason is this: to be an intelligent species, you need a big brain.Big brains mean that giving birth – especially for upright walking species – is effing dangerous when the big skull holding the big brain is pushed out through the birth canal and the pelvis.For us, nature solved the problem by having us give birth to anBig brains also consume a lot of energy, which means that you have to spend all day hunting and foraging, while a smaller-brained species can sleep in the sun for days after a successful hunt.So a big brain has big evolutionary drawbacks unless it can be used in ways that offset those drawbacks. You need something else, like an appendage that can manipulate objects, or anatomy capable of communicating with others of your species.But if not, why bother?

6,"Consumer drones range from palm-sized variants to ones that would endanger your car’s body work should they meet on a dark street. Military UAVs also start in the palm, but quickly ramp up to something with the wingspan of a 737. These would also mess up your car.In addition to the massive size variable, military UAVs also have more secure communications, with the larger ones being satellite linked. Their sensors have greater fidelity, range, and versatility. Some of them can be shoulder-launched and turned into a weapon, exploding on contact. Others just plain carry bombs or missiles.
