This is a big problem because many modern ICs literally cannot have all the transistors working at once without causing permanent thermal damage to themselves; they have to self-regulate to turn parts of themselves off when not in use (so-calledVarious kinds of devices have been proposed to replace conventional silicon MOSFET transistors:​",UNKNOWN,Prachi,13.5K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-recent-invention-will-become-the-next-transistor-Why-will-it-be-huge-and-what-applications-may-come-soon

It’s implications could be world-changing, as the reasons for our beliefs will become accessible to neuroscientists, and much of what has been in the domains of philosophy and theology will then be open to scientific explanation.",UNKNOWN,Ernest W.

So he invested his time and money on improving that and today we see Amazon, a leader in the online market.The secret that Jeff threw at us to find the ‘The Next Big Thing’, is not by looking at something that will drop from the blue but something that will stick with us.

There are countless blockchain startups listed across a wide-range of crypto exchanges around the world. Your ROI will greatly depend on the risk you are willing to take, and never invest what you aren’t willing to lose. Catching a great startup in its early stages is difficult, but the reward of finding a future top-200 or 300 coin is what has so many traders researching underrated projects with low marketcaps. If you can get in early, you can accumulate a large amount of coins before it goes mainstream, and profit from latecomers who suffer from a fear-of-missing-out. In these trading environments, research is your best friend, and can diminish the risk to your investment. Important factors to look for include the coin’s use-case, brand, team and community.One microcap project that I am bullish on, and have been accumulating for weeks, is VEY. They are developing the first paid-survey platform for cryptocurrency, and they are severely undervalued.Vey . ioTheir service will provide the market research industry with instant, zero-fee survey transactions, connecting survey creators and participants without a greedy third party. This is a huge upgrade, in profitability and efficiency, compared to the paid survey businesses around today. VEY is currently trading at an evaluation around $70k, and if you read up on them, you will understand that this is a tiny fraction of where they should be. VEY is one of my longterm holds.

7,"According to my opinion, hybrid coins will be the next big thing. Such coins bring stability in the cryptocurrency hence solving the issue of volatility. One such coin has already been launched. It’s called SGC (Secured Gold Coin). Its a gold backed coin, with 60% percent gold backing and 40% utility. It is also integrated in the MasterCard which makes it an everyday use coin.

Will it all crash and go to zero? Even if it does, you only lose $1,000/$2,000, that’s your maximum risk.If it doesn’t crash, $1,000 will already get you quite far. More specifically, it is most likely to yield you $17,000, not bad.

Then refinanced and started over.Oh, and maybe added in a vacation home to double their fun.Then the real estate market collapsed. Banks quit lending. Owners couldn’t refinance. People walked away from their homes and their vaporous wealth.Since then I’ve watched the “next big thing” of gold, oil and Bitcoins. All bought in a frenzy right before the price imploded.See, the problem is, no one knows it’s the “next big thing” until everyone is talking about it over cocktails.By that time the vortex is sucking in enthusiastic speculators. Just in time to evaporate their wealth.So instead of speculating in “the next big thing” the most successful investors, I know of, buy cheap what no one else wants.Warren Buffett bought a wood furniture company in the midst of the tech boom.Then he bought a railroad in the midst of the Great Recession.Many thought he was nuts. “Old senile Warren has lost it,” some derided.Yep, pretty much. Except he bought both cheap because nobody wanted them. He fixed them up and eventually made a boat load of money when other investors rediscovered them.So you can keep chasing the current “next big thing.” And getting surprised, how just after you invest, it implodes.At least you can do that until you run out of money.Or do like old senile Uncle Warren. Look for what no one wants. Buy it cheap. And wait for it to become a “sort of big thing”.Me? I like Uncle Warren. And wish I was half as senile and wealthy.Real wealth isn’t built chasing what is popular but what will be popular.",0 followers,James Larsson,505,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-could-be-the-next-breakthrough-in-Science-and-Technology

The Boston area and Research Triangle in North Carolina are viewed as the closest things in the US today.One last thought. There are plenty of very smart people working hard all over the country.
