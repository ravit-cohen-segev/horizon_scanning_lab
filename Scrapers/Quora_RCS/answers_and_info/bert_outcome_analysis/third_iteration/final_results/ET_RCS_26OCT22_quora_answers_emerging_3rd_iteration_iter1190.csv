Western Europe may have lacked such things, but the rest of the world carried on.

The primary domestic challenger was Route 128 around Boston with Digital Equipment, Data General, Wang and other tech companies seeded by MIT and other great schools. Other possible leadership areas were Dallas (anchored by TI), Phoenix (Motorola), Seattle (Microsoft) and St Paul-Minneapolis (Control Data/Cray/Univac). Eventually Silicon Valley emerged as the leader. All of the above have good technical communities but they fade in comparison to SV as it has gotten stronger.The big difference, I believe, is in California’s laws on employment. (Disclaimer: I am not an attorney. I worked in Silicon Valley from 1969 until retirement in 2012 and that experience is the basis for my opinions stated here.)Basically, a “non-compete” agreement in California is total unenforceable between an employee and a corporation. The state’s position and as practiced by the State’s Courts is that no one can be barred from gainful employment in their skill area. End of discussion. There is one exception: If a company/organization wants to prevent you from working in competition with them, they “MUST PAY YOU’ your normal annual income (salary, benefits, etc.) to NOT work in your field. When the payments stop, the employee is free to find work for a competitor. Many California employees know this so signing a non-compete agreement is equivalent to signing a roll of toilet paper. All employers know this as well but they still ask employees to sign them just in case you don’t know the law and they can saber rattle.Needless to say, the employers and their attorneys have figured out a small but very important impediment to the employee who goes to work for a competitor. And that is Intellectual Property (IP) Rights. You cannot take IP from one employer to another. What is IP? For sales people, it is customer lists. For engineers, it is background IP and company secret IP not presented in any patent filings. For marketing people, it is plans for new products and programs yet to be publically announced. For software, is is any code you have written or have copied to a disk while employed by your former employer. Don’t take copies of electronic files that you happened to acquire while employed. You get the idea.Does this stop you from changing jobs or forming your own company to compete with your former employer? No, definitely no. But it does have an impact on how you might be assigned at your new employer.I know of at least one case where we hired a technical expert to work on a new product. Because it was a secret program not yet public, we interviewed on the basis of her skill set and technical knowledge without revealing what it was she was going to work on.

5,"Absolutely! Within the Federation people are free to pursue interests that help better themselves and  help better humanity. So you can imagine that without having to go out and make money people could organize and explore new technologies to their hearts desire.There are also external reasons to keep advancing.

They know that there are technologically advanced races out there (to say nothing of past civilizations that were also more advanced and much longer lived).In fact I think the problem with a civilization like that portrayed in Star Trek is that the pace of innovation would be SO fast that most humans would not be able to keep up. Other races (Vulcans or Binars, etc) would have a much easier time. But the complexity of some of these technologies would be staggering. Imagine that your CPU cores are running Faster Than Light within a subspace field. What could you do?Competing technologies would also create a tremendous amount complexity. Planets separated by weeks of subspace communication lag could develop completely different but overlapping technologies.When I think about our own civilization and how complexity has led us to create more heuristics and shortcuts to survive, I don't know how we'd keep up in 300 years. I think the Binars (or Borg) provide the right insight into our future. Namely that we'll all be augmented with some form of artificial computers that interface with our brains and nervous systems that help us exceed the natural limits of our bodies so that we can keep up. We'll all probably end up looking like Geordi.Just my two cents.",775 followers,John Boyland,1.8K,5.2K,2.1M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-the-next-generation-of-mobile-technology-will-bring

And that's pretty scary. But assuming that doesn't happen, we will continue to research and develop new technologies.Keep in mind that even in Star Trek, the crews of the various ships often encountered beings and civilizations much farther advanced than humanity. I have no reason to believe we would not continue to evolve towards and beyond those types of civilizations given something does not violate the laws of physics and we don't blow ourselves up in the process.","105,667 followers",Dave Consiglio,626,6.8K,91.6M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-are-your-views-on-the-Antikythera-mechanism-Could-the-Ancient-Greeks-really-have-had-such-a-technology-with-a-gap-of-1500-years-until-the-next-similar-device-was-made-How-could-this-technology-have-been-lost
7,"Certainly.  The number of highly educated people was shown to be high, and it really doesn't matter how nice your life is, there will always be something that you feel could be improved upon.

8,"The answers are good and it is true that these technologies can still be better. Warp can go to slipstream/transwarp/ultrawarp. Transporter can increase range from 40000km to even more than 40 ligthyears (as seen in Voyager). Holodecks can change from crude forcefields and photons to emulate matter at the fundamental level (such as in Voyager). Shields can become both neutralizing (similar to the Borg) and reflecting (such as the concept of corbomite shielding) incoming fire.

Shields can become both neutralizing (similar to the Borg) and reflecting (such as the concept of corbomite shielding) incoming fire. It can also be more metaphasic which allows a ship to withstand the pressure and heat from a star corona. So far their metaphasic shields are unstable, especially for capital ships. They need to be more regenerative as well (as in the multi-regenerative shield system the Borg uses). Temporal shield with temporal weapons/traveling technology. Cloaking technology as well. Phasers to be more powerful, with smaller emitters, to be able to fire multiple frequencies at once. They also need increased range since they are limited to 300 000 km in the 24th century. They can be changed to be able to fire the same way as transphasic torpedoes act though they would be less efficient. They can also create shield draining phaser/disruptor/torpedoes. They can perfect the pulse phaser with a greater range increase since they are more limited. They can also get better in fighters (which I still don't understand why they had that in DS9 for fleet operations). Their fighters are not really fighters and they would need better ones. When it comes to ground troop, they need a lot more progress. Better hand to hand weapons, better range weapons (like sniper rifles), better protections (like an armored uniform with personal shield), are badly needed though they are not so bad if we look at DS9. Better sensors are too an another advance. They can scan about 10 lightyears away. Many species can do better such as some the Voth who can detect individual life forms from 90 lightyears away. The ships can also become larger, though with increase in power for smaller ships I don't think it would be necessary. They can increase the size of the Federation. Now all of these are fine and good, they touch Starfleet most and above all. However, we forget the essential. Medical understanding, diagnostic, and cure are also an important part of a society. While they did cure multiple illnesses, such as cancer it seems, many are still left out. They can't recreate a spine though they can cure humans if they had spine problems, just not species like Klingons. There are a lot of things they need to do to advance still.",17 followers,Rom Lokken,918,0,0,2016,https://www.quora.com/Which-place-might-become-next-silicon-valley
9,"Easily, in fact we see other races at higher levels of advancement with Star Trek, so it's reasonable to assume that such advancement is open to the Federation.One example of this would be the Voth, who were a much older species than humanity and had large and powerful city ships with capabilities the Federation could only dream of- unfortunately we didn't see too much of them, but we do know they were able to transport (beam) at least a 300 meter ship with relative ease.PropulsionWith engines, Starfleet was stil using Warp drive in the 24th century.

The further Starfleet explores the Galaxy, the more they know, the more species they meet (and they might not all be friendly.)Photon torpedoes have existed since at least the 22nd century. They're old and outdated and quickly being replaced by quantum torpedoes. What other new technologies can be invented or shared from new member worlds in the future?TransportersThe new films totally jumped the gun on this one, but how long until long range transport becomes easily available?(Note here: even if long range transporters become the main method of transport between planets, you can't explore the unknown with them- and that's what Trek is about.)Time travelVirtually all time travel is accidental in the 24th century. We know by the 29th that time becomes what space is to those in the 24th century. That technology isn't invented over night.Who's going to make it?Anyone!People don't work for money anymore, maybe sometimes trading, but people's motivation is to better themselves and those around them.Sooner or later, someone's going to invent something new in all these fields and it could be anyone on Earth, or anyone in the whole Federation for that matter.Also Starfleet's main mission is one of exploration and discovering new worlds and civilisations, many of these will be friendly and want to trade technology and some may even want to join the Federation, that's an entire galaxy full of opportunities for expansion in many ways, including technologically.So the answer is almost certainly yes, thanks for the A2A!",10 followers,Leigh Hogan,725,0,0,2016,https://www.quora.com/Which-place-might-become-next-silicon-valley
