Its ability to scale; however, has been a central issue of debate. Many novel innovations have come into existence that offer interesting solutions, to name a few,One new solution that piques my interest isThis data storage method allows low-power devices to fully participate in the temtum network and confirm transactions without requiring the resources demanded by traditional proof-of-work blockchain networks such as Bitcoin. The combination of the temtum Consensus Algorithm and Temporal technology allows the temtum network to deliver extremely high transaction throughput and short transaction confirmation times with low resource requirements.They have used laboratory tests followed by a live deployment over globally distributed servers to confirm a throughput of up to 120,000 transactions per second (a multiple of the peak capacity of 56,000 TPS on the VISA network).[2]The technology behind temtum is already fully developed, including mobile and web applications, (which are described below). It is already a fully operational form of payment and has already secured Govt contracts. Temtum is also being developed by one of the strongest teams in the Blockchain industry. Here is some more info;- Developed by Dragon Infosec:- Has a live mainnet :https://explorer.temtum.com/- PhD / peer reviewed tech- Contracts with Anguilla and Zimbwawe for their currency - lots of others coming- Private funded - no ICO / IEO - never asked anyone for cash - its all their own- Totally feelessThe NIST Randomness Beacon is novel to temtum, and is a source of truly random numbers that broadcasts full-entropy bit-strings in blocks of 512 bits every 60 seconds, providing three key functions: unpredictability, autonomy and consistency. The unpredictable nature of the NIST Randomness Beacon makes it impossible for any user to predict the bits it generates before they are published by the source. All users accessing the source of the beacon can be confident that they all receive an identical random string, while the beacon remains highly resistant to malicious interference by external parties. The key features of the NIST Randomness Beacon include:- Generated numbers that cannot be predicted before they are published–even by future quantum computing techniques.- The public,time-bound and authenticated nature ofthe NIST Randomness Beacon allows any user application to prove that it used truly random numbers not known before a specific point in time.- Proof of random number generation can be validated offline at any point subsequent to generation. Based on these properties,the NIST beacon has been chosen as a source of randomness for the Temporal network.","31,158 followers",Phillip Remaker,1.7K,11K,78.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-know-about-upcoming-technologies-in-software
9,"I like to describe blockchain with this joke:A handy flowchart for when to use blockchain.Of course, that’s not exactly fair. My problem is that too many people try to use blockchain to solve problems that are much better solved with simpler technologies.A commenter to thisThe basic idea is that if you have multiple, decentralized writers to a database who do not trust one another, a blockchain could be a useful tool to maintain a trustworthy distributed database or ledger.

However, it’s still not all that simple. To make a blockchain work, you need a perpetuating incentive system that drives all of the disparate, distrusting parties to certify one another’s work. Proof-of-work or proof-of-stake systems can work, but the system needs careful design to ensure that parties cannot collude to falsify information. It’s a hard problem.Bitcoin brilliantly created a “mining” concept that “mints” currency based on “miners” doing work to certify blocks of transactions. The incentive system also had built in mathematical brakes and accelerators to prevent easy monopolization of mining. The system still runs the risk of more than 50% of mining resources falling under unified administrative control, in which case the majority can effectively lock out the minority, but that has yet to happen.IBM talks about theirWARNING: I suck at predicting the future of technology, so assume I am wrong.DISCLAIMER: I work for Cisco, but opinions expressed on Quora are strictly my own.UPDATE: There’s an XKCD for that, as usual.(alt-text: Blockchains are like grappling hooks, in that it's extremely cool when you encounter a problem for which they're the right solution, but it happens way too rarely in real life.)That alt-text sums it up better than I could!",3 followers,Sridhar Mahadevan,1.1K,177,6.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-know-about-upcoming-technologies-in-software
10,"Blockchain refers to blocks of information that are connected via a unique number peculiar to each block called hash thus giving the name ""chain"" to it. As of now, it is the most secure database in the world with a decentralised approach that prevents malicious monopolistic activities. By eliminating human third parties and substituting them to a virtual third party is what adds the niche to blockchain and gains it the trust it holds.Machine learning can be understood as a technology that learns from past data and improves performance with new data.Blockchain refers to blocks of information that are connected via a unique number peculiar to each block called hash thus giving the name ""chain"" to it.

Machine learning algorithms have amazing capabilities of learning. These capabilities can be applied in the blockchain to make the chain smarter than before. This integration can be helpful in the improvement in the security of the distributed ledger of the blockchain. Also, the computation power of ML can be used in the reduction of time taken to find the golden nonce and also the ML can be used for making the data sharing routes better. Further, we can build many better models of machine learning using the decentralized data architecture feature of blockchain technology.","10,686 followers",Daniel Tunkelang,822,685,4.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-know-about-upcoming-technologies-in-software

Why, after (depending on how you count) is printing press technology still in development after over 500 or 1200 years?Those are not satirical retorts. They go to one of the fundamentals of technology development, which is that human imagination is always finding ways to improve any class of technology. Printing presses were slow and inflexible when first invented, but people keep coming up with new ways to make printing faster, more flexible, less expensive, and, in general, more adaptive to the varied uses that we have for printing. The same is true for telephones (interactive voice technology) and light bulbs (light technology), which have changed radically in my lifetime. The same is true for all inventions, including AI and blockchain.Between them, AI technologies are older, with a history that goes back almost 70 years, a history of use in entertainment for about 50 years (starting with Eliza), and a history of practical use that goes back a little over 30 years (starting, by my accounting, with rule-based decision systems that could take practical action using the event-condition-action) model. I’m sure there are those who would say that such programs aren’t “AI”, but they were certainly a practical step forward towards the systems we have today. It continues to be developed because we can imagine improvements (or at least developments) in AI that we haven’t made yet. It remains that we continue to find ways to make AI technologies faster, more flexible, less expensive, and, in general, more adaptive to the varied uses that we have for machine intelligence. That won’t stop because machine intelligence technologies reach the holy grail of “self awareness” (if we ever reach that goal) or machine intelligences become capable of improving themselves (a more practical and readily achieved goal. If it stops it will be because of a failure of human imagination.Blockchain is newer. The first blockchain system that I’m aware of is about 20 years old now. Imagining it required developments in programming, networks, and computer capabilities (processor speed and memory) that came together at about that time. It is a very young technology that is currently used to solve a limited number of problems. And in the most public of its applications (the representation of value/money) it has strongly entrenched competition (physical money, for instance) that retains considerable advantages, especially for people that don’t carry electronic devices around in their pockets. That will undoubtedly change over the (one hopes) next 500 or 1200 years as we continue to find ways to make blockchain technologies faster, more flexible, less expensive, and, in general, more adaptive to the varied uses that we have for blockchain.I don’t want to say this was a silly question, but the truth is that all inventions evolve over time. Doing that requires continuing development.
