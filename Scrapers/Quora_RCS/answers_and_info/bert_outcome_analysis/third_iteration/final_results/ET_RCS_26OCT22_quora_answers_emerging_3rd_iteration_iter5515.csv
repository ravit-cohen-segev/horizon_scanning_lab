1,"Hi Tiff, I was 72 six days ago. Over the years, even though I have never been wealthy, I have been able to follow all of the trends in technology. From 7 1/4 inch Reel to Reel 4 track tape recorders that weighed 40 lbs to the early Walkman. In school in 1964–68, I took Business Machines, the machines we had would have fit in with any western you might have seen. Calculators and Cash Registers that had pull handles. Our typing class used old ones like this.Later I would own a more up to date one, but still manual. Then in the early 80’s I had to take a surveying course at community college, andHi Tiff, I was 72 six days ago.

Our typing class used old ones like this.Later I would own a more up to date one, but still manual. Then in the early 80’s I had to take a surveying course at community college, and needed a calculator. I got a Texas Instrument with solar collector at the top. A funny thing happened in our math class, when the teacher insisted we know how to do calculations without our calculator, because we wouldn’t have an extension long enough out doors. Better than half the class held up our solar powered calculators. The Ok, Boomer, insisted on doing his thing anyway. LOL Never forget the other time he got upset. We had gone out on a field exercise, and had to hand in our work sheets. Believe it or not he had the whole class, University Engineers and us 30+ retreads, printing out our numbers LOL. I liked him, he was a hard nosed Scot, that had come up the hard way. He was not a teacher by profession.I got into computers in the late 80’s early 90’s, with an Atari 800, and later a 1040ste. Still had the latter into 1997, when I came into some money and bought a Hewitt Packard IBM style PC. and Monitor. I thought I had arrived. The two computers and my interest in data bases for genealogical research, got me a job later in 1998, managing a mailing list that was having problems. Job would be my last, as I was replaced by a 250,000 dollar computer system, and a college grad, 15 years ago, on Dec 22nd 2005. We don’t think of programs as A.I. but they are in their own way.I say all this to point out that technology is always changing how we live our lives. Whether it is receiving a package from Amazon, or walking into a store, without having to open the door, or getting on an elevator and pressing a button or going to a restaurant and paying for the meal at the table. But those are all old tech now. In a few years even those may be obsolete, replaced by voice activated direction.I just saw my kidney doctor, and while I’m still borderline diabetic, that hasn’t changed in over 20+ years. The kidney actually improved a tick. Just have to monitor my diet and weight. In 5–6 years I will be a candidate for a kidney transfer, from my own stem cells, if I need it. Medicine is great if you have access to it. I’m in Canada so I have benefited from M4A for most of my life. Hernia operation, at the place where Rand Paul went. Then I had a collapsed artery in my heart, that was fixed with a balloon and two stents like Bernie Sanders. I was told I was 2 weeks away from a heart attack, seizure or stroke. Then there was the slippery ice Feb 9th 2009, that was on my ex wife’s driveway. Took out my right knee. It was hanging by the muscles around the knee, and the water inflation that caused the leg to swell up double the size. I had a doctor fresh from the battle field around Misrata, Libya, repair the leg, so I could walk again. Can’t run, but hey I been able, in the last 3 years, to do half marathons with 25 lb back packs or 3 miles carrying 30-40 lbs, from the grocery store. Both slowly, but I did them. And I didn’t have to sue my ex wife for the cost of the health care :DI see my two doctors once a year. My meds are almost free, just a $4.11 fee each for 3 months worth. Life is good, not perfect. I can look forward to owning a Full Self Driving Tesla in 2 years or so. Which will increase my income, as I put it on the Tesla Network. My mobility will increase as well, as I don’t drive, and the car will. Just tell it where I want to go and it will take me there. This year because I am in Southern Canada, I can expect to get access to the Starlink Internet constellation. That will increase my access to the internet and the Internet of Things. There is even talk of it being accessible in the car. I have 3 Amazon Echo 2’s and have fun with Alexa. In 10 years I expect her or her daughter to be an android (aka Data) that will be able to look after the house, monitor my health and finances. Look after my schedule and a host of other things. Who knows, if we are compatible we might even opt to get married in 2040 when she gets human rights.So, How do you like the changes new technology has brought to your life? I am extremely thankful to have lived a good life so far, helped where I could and be able to look forward to 19–20 more years than when I was born: 86 years now for life expectancy, instead of 67. At which time, who knows what the future might hold. I might get my wish, a regenerated 30 year old body that won’t age. Then my wife and I can celebrate our 50th anniversary on Mars :DHahahaha forgot to mention, computer, tablet, and smart phone. With all that it implies, as far as connectivity. Sometimes it is easy to forget the small things :) Like microwaves, air friers, high powered blenders, coffee grinders freezers and refrigerators, shop vacs, or stand mixers. Battery operated tools, power outlets with their own breakers. Even the washing machine’s and driers. Things that are taken for granted.Back in 1962, I was expecting to die at any moment during a Nuclear War. That feeling was revisited this week. But hopefully saner minds have prevailed. Lets pray that it continues to hold. The future seems like such a teeter - totter at the moment. Tomorrow Land on the one hand and Soylent Green on the other.Take care and thanks for the question. dc","5,084 followers",Bobby Tatro,3.2K,2.2K,45.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-will-the-new-technologies-bring-to-our-life

Technology has made our work easy and time consumable.

4,"New technology is viable if it satisfies certain demand. It either eliminates routine work (such as a dishwasher), entertains (TV), provides means of communication (phone), transportation (plane), cures diseases, serves military purpose etc etc. Sometimes combination of those (such as computer). The impacts are very different and sometimes unpredictable. Some of them eliminate a lot of jobs. Some of them create jobs. Some of them help people. The impact is very varied.","58,988 followers",Michael Wolfe,504,2K,17.3M,2013,https://www.quora.com/What-will-the-new-technologies-bring-to-our-life

This is what the 99% does , so now that we’ve got an understanding please stop!So how do you keep up with emerging new technologies ? How about developing them? Yeah bruh, don’t Google “emerging technologies” and start using all the buzzwords like you know what you’re talking about. Develop these technologies and lead the way. Technolgy just doesn’t get better. Someone has to work on it. Yeah bruh you !Why are you still sitting there?
