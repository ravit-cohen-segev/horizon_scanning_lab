1,"Re:Nope. It is just getting restarted.Why?As of this point in time we have only three technologies which we KNOW can deliver substantial amounts of electricity: burning fossil fuels, “renewable energy”, and nuclear fission power. Nuclear fusion MAY someday produce electricity for us, but there is no guaranty that it ever will, so I will not consider fusion power.

The war in the 13 Colonies was part of a much larger world war with the British fighting the Dutch, the Spanish, and the French around the globe.Yorktown was indeed a turning point. But you must realise that over half of the fighting men were French, and the French also had 29 warships. It was the combination of the additional French soldiers and the French Navy bottling in the British that resulted in Cornwallis surrendering his 7,000 troops. These 7,000 were NOT the entirety of the British Army, much less the British Army in America.Yorktown was a turning point less so because of the defeat, but because the British came to the conclusion that it just wasn’t worth fighting over the 13 Colonies anymore. During the period of negotiation, there were still many battles and skirmishes, the majority of which were won by the British, AND the British remained in occupation of New York City until November 1783, two years after Yorktown. By the way, the evacuation of New York included former slaves freed by the British from colonial slave holders, not something a defeated side would be able to do.That, of course, rules out the first premise of you question. As to the second, not only is the modern US more powerful than anyone could possibly imagine, what’s the point? What could possibly be the outcome? Land? That doesn’t fly anymore with anyone other than Russia and China, and that’s because those two countries don’t care what the people think who live in any place that could be acquired.","1,795 followers",David Osofsky,933,9.3K,12M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Has-nuclear-technology-peaked

They wanted nothing to do with it and they had a big problem on the continent they were dealing with.But once the UK troops arrived and were fighting the US troops in the USA both sides agreed to a truce.The Americans will say a truce is a tie.

We had defeated the southerns.

So it would be a lot of ships carrying a lot of troops a long way.How many of those troop ships would sink with the considerable assistance of the Royal Navy, starting with the hunter-killer nuclear submarines? A lot, that’s guaranteed. After - bet on it - several aircraft carriers. How would the American public like that? We’ll see.But say they are still with it (despite the SAS trashing US power stations, public buildings, airports, etc) - as the US troopships get closer they are now in range of the RAF. So that’s a lot more dead troopships that can’t be protected properly because the US can only use the aircraft on the surviving aircraft carriers to defend them.What is the morale of the surviving troops, when they get to a port? The US still don’t have air superiority, remember, because they’ve lost a lot of aircraft carriers, and the surviving carriers have lost a lot of aircraft protecting the fleet on the way over.So the surviving American troops storm ashore at a port - where they meet the British Army - fresh, well equipped, well-armed and in positions they’ve had weeks to prepare. And the Americans don’t have air superiority or anything like it. I’ve heard people say the US Army doesn’t know how to fight without air superiority.So do they get ashore? Maybe. Maybe not. Talk to any experienced US soldier who has trained in NATO with the Royal Marines or the Paras and ask him how he’d like to be coming ashore in that situation against those guys defending their homes.
