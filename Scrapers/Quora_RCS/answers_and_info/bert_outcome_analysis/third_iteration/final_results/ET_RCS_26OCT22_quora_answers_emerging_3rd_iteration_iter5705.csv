But it can and it will.Fortunately, quantum technologies are already being studied and trying to be put into practice in the UK as part of theThe primary focus of the UKNQTP are four 'hubs' for quantum technologies:Being at Birmingham, I've spoken to a few professors about their work in this area and they believe that, eventually you can have quantum physics solving simple but extensive problems.For example, some of the UKs tunnels, water and sewer networks are well over 100 years old. We literally have no idea where most of it is. To find them, we have to go down and look. But with quantum tech we can, in theory, sense it from above and use the data to map a complex network.Another example is navigation in submarines. You might love your fancy SATNAV in the car, but that's pretty useless when you go through a tunnel or past a tall building. Now imagine being deep under water. Using quantum physics, you can basically build a super sensitive accelerometer which reacts to the gravity of objects around it.Quantum positioning system steps in when GPS fails“Today, if a submarine goes a day without a GPS fix we’ll have a navigation drift of the order of a kilometre when it surfaces,” says Neil Stansfield at the UKI haven't even touched on quantum computing yet, that's a whole field in itself. But if we fully unlock the potential of quantum physics we'll receive benefits tenfold for whatever cost goes in to it.We've gone through the classical age, to the industrial age, then the atomic age and digital age.

In many cases, the best thing the government can do is to provide space and funding, but otherwise to get out of the way and allow innovation and research to happen without overbearing regulation.There are situations where direct government intervention would be useful though, one of the key ones being electric & autonomous driving vehicles.

There will be huge advantages to being a country with a progressive approach to an EV charging infrastructure and traffic by-laws which are favourable to autonomous driving. The UK government have already made some steps in this direction, with autonomous testing zones springing up in certain locations in the UK.Another is bio-medical research (e.g. stem-cells and generic engineering). Too much government regulation could stifle any innovation in this space.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-emerging-technologies-in-2022

Tesla has already implemented it into their cars, but it is limited due to some legal issues. I know people who find ways to bypass this and just let their car drive for them.

Another technology I think will emerge is virtual reality technology. I feel like VR won’t require a bulky headset in the future and it won’t require a large and inconvenient setup at home. I think it will be implemented in such a way that you could take it anywhere you go and use it. Maybe it will be implemented into glasses or some other small form factor headset. I also think it will be a mix of AR and VR. At one moment you can see the world but have an interface, but you will be able to switch over to VR at any time. For all, we know this might never happen, but that's where I see VR and driverless cars going.",4 followers,Leon Brennan,24.9K,693,21.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-emerging-technologies-in-2022

When I heard the doctor tell her “six months”, it felt likeI met my wife, Jess, twenty-one years ago when she was nineteen.Our parents owned side-by-side cabins in the northern part of New York and we both happened to be along for the week-long hunting trip our fathers planned that year.Jess' father was a skilled hunter and could hit a headshot from a mile away — same as my dad.Jess and I didn't hunt with them — we hung out by the lake.The moment I saw Jess I fell in love. We've been together ever since.But now, now that she has an expiration date, I just don't know what to do — I'm scared and lost.Monday morning at work I was telling my best friend and supervisor, Timmy, about my wife's condition. Timmy told me that I.T. or Intelligent Terrestrial just came out with their latest models.These models are different than those of yesteryear because they are 52% mechanical and 48% biological.Timmy said all you have to do is mail a sample of DNA to I.T. and upload a digital copy of your consciousness through an app. You can then purchase a custom made clone at an age of your choice. When the clone arrives it will turn on, study it's surroundings and await a consciousness download.“Oh my God Timmy, what's the catch?”“The price, Leon.”When I got home from work, Jess and I plugged in and uploaded a digital copy of our entire conscious catalog to I.T. and then mailed off DNA samples.Jess asked me what age I wanted her to be. It felt awkward to say “twenty”, but I did it — I was honest. I miss her smooth, youthful skin and I want her to be young and healthy — especially if I have to cash my entire 401K in to afford it.We told her parents that we were going to basically bring her back from the dead and her father threatened to shoot any abomination that we brought into this world.One month later, on a day that Jess was particularly ill, the doorbell rang.Jess and I dragged the box through the door and laid it on the living room floor. I gently cut along the lines and when I opened the flaps, there,she,was.The last time my heart fluttered like this was the day I met her.Jess helped me lift I.T. out of the box and sit I.T. up.I.T. was warm and soft. I.T. was mine. I paid for I.T. I own I.T.Machines like this don't have rights — even though they are part biological, the governments recognize them in the same way they would a lawnmower — so, as I said, I.T. is my possession.The science behind uploading a digital consciousness is so cutting edge, that the laws just haven't caught up yet.Jess turned I.T. on and I.T. looked right into my eyes. I was in love — with two women, but, it was the same woman. We hadn't uploaded Jess' consciousness yet, so, I.T. was running on basic programming, but I.T. was gorgeous.Jess asked me what I wanted to do, and for the first time in a very long time — I lied to her.I told her we should go shopping and buy I.T. some clothes.I.T. doesn't seem to have a personality yet.“Hello…. Smile…”Jess picked outfits for both of them and we went for a walk through the park together. It was amazing — I was so happy.We walked down a cozy little trail and found a tuck away to sit and talk.I.T. watched and studied every move Jess and I made. I.T. was learning and adapting.I.T. was becoming aware.At one point Jess and I got distracted and I.T. wandered off. When we found I.T., I.T. was gazing at the sky.I asked I.T. what it was doing. I.T. said, “Where do I come from?”“You come from Heaven. You are my angel.”That answer seemed to work for I.T. We all walked back to the car and headed home.When we got home, Jess immediately started coughing. She fell to the ground and I tried to help her, but I didn't know what to do.Jess passed away right then. It was finally over.I called her family and the police. It took an hour for them to remove the body. I had Jess 2.0 sitting in my back room waiting for them to leave.After the police left, I plugged I.T. into my laptop and downloaded Jess' consciousness.After the download was complete, we walked outside and I looked into her gigantic brown eyes. I asked her, “Is it you, Jess?”She smiled and said, “It is, silly — now kiss me.”Her head slammed back. I didn't know if she was glitching or what and then I heard a bang and saw a hole above her left eye.My beautiful Jessica died twice today. I was crushed.Over the next two decades, I fell into a deep, dark, alcohol-fueled depression. Although I had developed a serious alcohol problem, I was able to work and save every single penny I earned.After twenty years of saving, I decided I wanted both of them back — the twenty-year-old Jess and the forty-year-old Jess.I sent my entire life savings off to I.T. and in one month, my doorbell rang.I cut the box open and wept when I saw my angel(s).I turned them on.I also clothed them. The younger version of me may have left them in the nude, but at this age, I just want my companion(s) back.The ladies helped me back to my room to lay down. I was so tired from all the excitement.I've waited and worked an entire lifetime to be with the woman I love. And now, at long last — she is beside me.I died, on that very night as a happy man.One day later, the doorbell rang. It seems my beautiful Jessicas used my direct deposit life insurance benefit to make a purchase.They gently cut the box open.And turned me on.You ask where technology will be in 2050?We will be everywhere.LeonSpecial thanks:Cameron — Dear friend. Thank you so much for all your help with bringing this idea to life. You are awesome. I'm proud to call you friend.Kinsalynn — My sister and friend. Your help with makeup and photography was an absolute godsend — thank you so much. I love and appreciate you. P.S. you took over 300 pictures in an eight hour span. Thank you from the bottom of my heart:)Brooke — Even with a bullet hole in the head, you are deliciously gorgeous.
