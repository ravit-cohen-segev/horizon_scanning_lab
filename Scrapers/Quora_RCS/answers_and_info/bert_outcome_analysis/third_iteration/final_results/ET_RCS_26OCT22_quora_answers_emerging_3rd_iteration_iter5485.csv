2,"It very much depends on what time scales you consider. If you look at the overall historic record, it would be Italy and somewhat Greece that would qualify as the economic and technology leader, as it led the most successful civilization for a great many centuries, at a time where current Germany was little more than an ensemble of barbaric tribes. Next, it would probably be England, which presided over what was probably the world’s greatest global empire, it created the foundations of today’s technological civilization, and it was culturally so prevalent that we are discussing this in EnglishIt very much depends on what time scales you consider.

Next, it would probably be England, which presided over what was probably the world’s greatest global empire, it created the foundations of today’s technological civilization, and it was culturally so prevalent that we are discussing this in English today, as the lingua franca of the global culture. Next, I would point out to the Iberian kingdoms, which started the first globalization, which can be attested by the fact that Portuguese and Spanish are spoken throughout the world, while German is pretty much circumscribed to its original speakers.If you look at the last 150 years, you may have a point. From 1870 on, Germany has emerged as an economic, scientific and technological powerhouse. But 150 years is but an instant in the framework of history, and Germany has not yet fully proven that it is sustainable as a nation. Twice it has been at the center of major world conflicts, and twice it has emerged defeated. It has been split and reunited in different configurations more times than one would care to count. It is undoubtedly enjoying a very good moment, but that is due also, in great part, to its participation in a wider European project, without which it would have a very hard time achieving its current levels of economic success. Still, in spite of that success, the seeds for its possible demise, may still lie within, as the reemergence of its worst instincts is showing its ugly head in the form of AfD and other xenophobic movements.In the long-run, for a country to be successful, it has to hold two essential virtues: to be able to achieve success from a bad situation, AND then to be able to live with that success. Germany has shown to be remarkable at the former, but it has an appalling record at the latter. Whenever it has enjoyed major success, it has quickly squandered it in pointless endeavors, and hegemony projects. From 1945 to 1989, it seemed to have proven its detractors wrong, and it appeared to have turned a page, with major economic and technological success, accompanied by a very healthy relationship with its neighbors. But this was in a context of the country being divided, its Eastern half being subdued by its victor, its Western half being in a strong military and economic straightjacket of NATO and the EEC. After it regained its full autonomy in 1989, Germany has shown some worrying signs of being back to its old habits. While they are very incipient, those signs are worrying enough, given Germany’s history.So, I would say that history is yet to be written. The last 150 years showed that Germany is great at building success, but appalling at keeping it. Let’s see what the future holds.","3,581 followers",Lance LaSalle,7.8K,6K,22.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-emerging-technologies-no-matter-how-big-or-small
3,"Germany has a history of technical education that dates back to its unification in 1871 and a long history of other technological innovations in different parts of the country going back to the late 19th century. The reason you get lenses from Germany is because they are the leader in producing optical glass and have been for 200 years.Although many other countries have a fine history of scientific education, in Germany such an education is treated with a great deal more reverence than something that will merely make you a lot of money.

For example, although England invented the first artificial dye, the chemical industry soon moved to Germany as there was a larger pool of scientists coming out of the “polytechnics”.Some of the other innovations that came out of German labs were the development of the Haber-Bosch process - a way of making nitrogen compounds literally out of the air. That development is probably responsible for 2 billion people being alive right now. Germany is also where the first plastics were developed.Since unification, Germany has also had a strong industrial base. Unlike many other countries where workers were treated interchangeably, German firms involve workers in the governance of the company. Wages are good and so is productivity. Unions are strong but strikes are rare. In his film “Where to Invade Next”, Michael Moore visits, of all things, a German pencil factory. That factory is consistently profitable and keeps selling more pencils every year even though they have to compete against cheap Asian imports. They make damn fine pencils though.",46 followers,Ian Lang,759,5.8K,64.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-emerging-technologies-no-matter-how-big-or-small

5,"I don't like This kind of questions, which lack logic, on Quora.Before saying anything to the questionI don't like This kind of questions, which lack logic, on Quora.Before saying anything to the questionEven if it is a truth in your opinion, You can’t just put the Question in that way, which makes people consider it is a fact (while there remains some doubts).It can be really misleading.When people answer it, they tend to focus on ‘Why Germany does well in economy and technology’ without thinking about the question I mentioned above.When people read others’ answer, they are also likely to focus on ‘Why Germany does well in economy and technology’ without thinking about the question I mentioned above.As people focus on ‘Why Germany does well in economy and technology’, they are more likely to ignore other things and to acept the idea thatJust a small number of people can avoid that.Asking question in that way can be really misleading. And I think it can be purposeful to ask question in that way to mislead the public.If you are interested in how Germany succeed, you can ask in a less misleading way.Judging from the way you asked the question , I bet that you either hate Germany or want peopleo hate Germany.［BTW, I admire Germany］[PS:I am too young, simple,naive and not good in English.

6,Although to a much lesser degree today than previously Germany did have a distinct cultural trait based upon an authoritarian hierarchy that ran from the head of the family to the work place and finally to the state. Within this system and parallel to their social structure the work ethic was regarded as a necessary function of life. These social values are still present today in the younger generations although modified to fit in a much more liberal culture based upon strong democratic foundations. Thus you have a modern society that places a high value on education and productivity.,261 followers,Scott Goldman,6.4K,954,29.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Germany-consistently-emerge-as-Europes-economic-and-technology-leader-even-though-it-has-suffered-repeated-calamities-and-has-a-relatively-short-history-as-a-unified-country
7,I would say that Germany leads because it is a group of smaller sovereign self responsible bundeslander rather than a monopoly or empire with a central out of touch control that are known to self destruct due to communication turbulence into chaos.The german leadership is that of a wolf pack with the leader holding the umbrella over the sovereign bundeslander who each survive in their own rightThe german structure is the example of small is sustainable and so is forever productive.,561 followers,Harry Coffill,878,163,1.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Germany-consistently-emerge-as-Europes-economic-and-technology-leader-even-though-it-has-suffered-repeated-calamities-and-has-a-relatively-short-history-as-a-unified-country
