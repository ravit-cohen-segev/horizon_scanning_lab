He’s an old appliance, bought second hand by poor farmers because they couldn’t afford anything better. As advanced as he might seem to us, he’s hopelessly outdated in universe.Sound familiar? Star Wars was first released in 1977. The first commercial color TV was sold in 1953, and they wouldn’t become commonplace until the mid 60s. The choppy, monochromatic nature of the holograms is meant to be reminiscent of the TVs much of the audience for Star Wars would have grown up with. A clever visual shorthand that tells us that by the standards of the Galaxy Far Far Away, our heroes are all people of little means.","220,550 followers",Franklin Veaux,738,47.3K,782.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/In-Star-Wars-with-such-advanced-technology-why-are-holograms-relatively-crude
1,"Because the movies weren’t able to adequately fake what the holograms were supposed to look like.It’s an unfortunate problem that affects all older sci-fi movies. It all comes down to what’s easy to fake on screen.It was quite easy to fake spaceships in the 70’s, even without anything like interstellar spaceship technology. You just needed to put models on wires or crane arms and light them appropriately.It was also quite easy to fake a fully autonomous android in the 70’s, even without anything like real android technology.

All you needed to do was put a person in a suit.However, it’s not easy to fake a futuristic display system without actually inventing one. So that’s why the graphical displays, including the holograms, all look so bad in older sci-fi movies. They are really hard to fake.So for older movies we basically have to use our imagination for what the holograms would “really” look like. The newer movies give us a better idea of what the holograms are supposed to look like in-universe, and they look much better. But of course, the newer movies didn’t make them perfect (even once CGI technology could do it) because they had to bear some resemblance to what came before in the older movies.","220,550 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.5K,47.3K,782.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/In-Star-Wars-with-such-advanced-technology-why-are-holograms-relatively-crude

Perhaps there isn’t a feasible way to build a high definition holo-projector into something small enough to carry around in your pocket (or a droid.) Or maybe the holonet just can’t support the bandwidth for higher quality images. It also raises another possibility: there could be higher quality holograms being employed in the setting all the time that we just mistake for real people.","1,204 followers",Berend Harmsen,2.3K,2.5K,8.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/In-Star-Wars-with-such-advanced-technology-why-are-holograms-relatively-crude

It seems to be a part analog, part digital world they have. It’s not clean. Most machines are basically functional and sometimes rudimentary.I sort of see it as cultural choices the characters made. They don’t seem to be capitalistic—at least most don’t. They seem more grounded in personal relationships. They don’t go to movies or have a device to check their social status like we do so they don’t have the same kinds of gadgets and fun tech for the average person. Most average people are slaves or slave away with hard work. Most of the rich people are meeting with dignitaries and spies in order to bring down a powerful regime. Others are a part of the regime. Or they are into illicit gambling or smuggling. It seems that every character in Star Wars is doing something pretty incredible with their lives, or they are toiling in the dirt. Since the people toiling in the dirt have to scrape to get by, they are not going to be into fancy holograms or making them better.

Other sapphire (cameras, touch id sensors, Apple Watch screens) Apple can source them from other manufacturers but GT was the only one having sapphire technology capable of building very large crystals, suitable for iPhones.GT did not meet some of the expectations (deadline? quantity? quality? we do not know). So Apple's iPhone 6 was launched with no sapphire. (Actually we do not know for sure if apple wanted to launch with sapphire or planned more models for a later launch date, but we do know that GT did not meet some of the expectations).Apple cancelled the fourth 140m payment to GT and GT is also missing the revenue from the iPhone 6 screens (or at least that revenue is delayed, if Apple is still thinking of using sapphire for phones). GT also will eventually have to start paying back the loan. And they may (or may not) have lost their largest customer. Not to mention that the equipment in Apple's factory will stay as collateral.GT then filed for bankruptcy in order to get the protections that this allows them while handling the huge cash-flow and balance sheet fuckup they currently have. Officially they say the business model is still sound and maybe sustainable.The above may or may not be exactly what happened, but it's what I understood from various public sources, up to today.","6,251 followers",Brett Bilbrey,3.9K,0,0,2014,https://www.quora.com/In-Star-Wars-with-such-advanced-technology-why-are-holograms-relatively-crude

(It is still a secret project that can not be spoken of.)- My wife was assigned a year long internship for her doctorate in Biloxi Mississippi and I wanted to spend time with her in Biloxi.- My team did many great things (Mac Mini, Apple TV, the built in iSight, prototype for the iPad, prototypes for many other features, etc.), so I could leave with a great feeling of accomplishment.- The first 5 years I worked at Apple, I did not take time off or vacations. It was grueling. So I earned being able to retire.- My 5 kids were growing up, and I wanted to spend time with them. Since joining Apple, I did not have a good work/life balance... Success came at a cost.- After retiring, I became an advisor to many companies (and the University of Michigan - Dearborn). This is a great way to keep busy.- By retiring, I could pursue building a science center focused not on education, but instead on inspiring visitors.

Perhaps you are an unhappy person”.I replied, No. I am not unhappy about my life. I am truly a very happy person. I have accepted myself. Moreover, I am enjoying every moment of my life despite lots of limitations. Happiness does not depend on traveling several countries, physical beauty, property, cars, high-paying job and a girlfriend. It depends on you. I live in the moment, lead a simple life, work hard, love my parents, spend quality time with my family and friends, explore my country, help people, meditate, run, chase my passion and do what I love to do.“Very little is needed to make a happy life, it is all within yourself; in your way of thinking”.Photo Source :",102 followers,Vishal Detroja,11.1K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-most-advanced-technology-created-by-a-non-human

""Smart people"" have given us all sorts of abominable ideas over the years, from social Darwinism to phrenology to Objectivism to ""sociobiological"" justifications for why war is fundamentally necessary to the character of the human species.

Here is a test for those who think that a computer can do any calculation. Use the fastest computer available to you and write a program to calculate the value of pi up to 28 digits accurately. You will know how difficult it is.There were many inventions in the field of science and technology in ancient India. Since many persons of the present generation does not know them, they will be described briefly to enable the readers to have the basic understanding about them.2. THE INVENTIONS OF ANCIENT INDIAWho invented Calculus? The western books say that Newton invented Calculus. You can see the Sanskrit mathematics texts by Arya Bhatta and Bhaskaracharya which were written many centuries before Newton that they contain Calculus. For that matter, who invented numbers? The Indians. The ancient Romans did not know the number zero. Ancient Indians knew very large numbers like Mahogham (1 followed by 62 zeros) and the corresponding smaller decimal fractions. Paavuloori Mallana of 12th century wrote Ganitha Sastram in Telugu. One poem in the book starts like this:“Sara sasi shatka chandra sara saayaka ….”The meaning appears to be a poetic description of nature. Each word used in the poem has a methematical terminology meaning. It deals with a methematical problem. One grain is placed in the first square of the chess board. Double of that number, are placed in the second square, and so on. How many grains have to be placed in the last square? The poem gives the answer as 18446744073709551614 which is equal to 2 to the power 63.Who invented Nuclear Physics?Buddhist teacher Pakudha Katyayana taught atomic theory. Maharshi Kanaada of 3rd century, B.C. wrote atomic theory in Vaiseshika Sutras. Agni Purana gives smaller magnitudes. The smallest of them is called Paramaanu which nearly equals one billionth part of a meter. This value tallies with the size of an organicWho were the first to calculate the velocity of light?The Rig Veda Bhashyam by Sayana Madhava gives the following Sloka praising the Sun:Yojanam sahasre dve, satadve, dvecha yojane Ekena nimeshardhena kramamaana namosthuthe One Yojana equals 15788.8 meters, and half of Nimesha equals 8/75 fraction of a second. This gives the velocity of light as 325940 km/s. We have to remember here that the above value is an approximate one intended for easyWho invented weaving? Many experts agree that primitive gins and spinning wheels originated in India. The earliest samples of cotton fabric were found in the excavations of the Indus Valley. Samples of the most ancient mordant dyeing technique for cotton fabrics, Kalamkari, were also found there. The Kalamkari technique was perfected in South India and the traditional method continues till date. The Puranas describe spinning and weaving that match the modern concept of an industry. The weaving industry involved specialized factories working in association with domestic industries and paid at piece rates. The fibers used for spinning and the fabrics produced were of the most varied types, unparalleled in any other country during that period. Indians were exceptional for their skills in spinning and weaving which have not been surpassed by peoples of other lands even in historic past. Pliny’s Natural History informs that India exported to Rome large quantities of sheep wool, woolen fabrics, colored carpets, silks, cotton clothes, and fabrics ranging from coarse canvas to textiles of the finest texture. Ancient Indians had the reputation of making the thinnest saree that could pass through a finger ring. During the reign of Julius Caesar, the Roman Emperor, the British did not know weaving and lived naked.Who invented the guns?Some people in medieval Europe heard of powerful fireAccording to Sir A.

Its like saying – “India invented the wheel! lets go back into the ancient books and remake the wheel the way they did!” “India had flying machines called vimānas - let’s go and make one and get commercial!” Why not just hop down to the travel agent and buy a ticket on a ready made Boeing?Sushruta pioneered cosmetic/surgery 500 BCE - the India surgeons were the first to do nose-reconstructions due to the common punishment of cutting off the noses of criminals. The question to ask is - if you need cosmetic surgery would you go to a native surgeon using Sushruta’s manual from 500 BCE or would you go to an America trained surgeon at the Apollo Hospital?The most effective and useful machine that was ever invented is the bicycle - there is nothing in the entire corpus of the Vedas or allied scriptures which would enable you to build even this most simple machine let alone vimānas or time-travel machines.“Western” Science is serving us very well - in fact far too well!
