1,"The technology industry is constantly evolving in a chain reaction of rapid technological developments.Here are four top tech trends to look for:1) Edge computingCloud computing and the cloud are now an omnipotent part of everyday life. But now that cloud computing is no longer an emerging technology, we can look to advanced computing for the next big leap forward.

But now that cloud computing is no longer an emerging technology, we can look to advanced computing for the next big leap forward. Edge computing is a concept that has spread rapidly from the telecommunications and mobile industries to almost every industry. Edge computing is much more advanced than the cloud and involves circumventing the latency that exists with cloud computing. The global market for advanced computing is estimated to be worth $ 6.72 billion by 2022, according to reports, with blue-chip companies like Microsoft investing billions more in the emerging advanced computing revolution. quickly.2) artificial intelligenceArtificial intelligence is already well known, but it is not yet ubiquitous in all aspects of our daily lives. In 2021, we expect artificial intelligence technologies to grow exponentially and be integrated into almost all technology products and services. According to AI investor and philanthropist Tej Kohli, AI has at least four times more applications than the internet, and therefore the AI economy could be worth $ 150 trillion in potential. Although prominent technologists like Elon Musk have raised concerns about some of the risks of AI, it is already widely used to predict maintenance and assess risks. But with potential applications across all industries, 2021 could be the year AI finally comes of age.3) augmented realityAnother technological trend to watch out for in 2021 is augmented reality. Many people have heard of or tried virtual reality but are not sure what augmented reality means. As augmented reality becomes mainstream, we expect more companies to use it in their marketing strategies. And as the world adjusts to the confines of a post-coronavirus world, AR may play a larger role in our daily interactions. Gaming companies are already using AR widely, with some in the esports industry predicting a future of vast augmented reality stadiums packed with fans watching AR action live as it unfolds. RA investor Ryan Wang predicted significant growth in RA.4) CybersecurityMany people will be surprised to learn that cybersecurity has been on our list of the top tech trends to watch in 2021, but it certainly deserves its place. Cybersecurity now dominates the priorities of all organizations as it adjusts to a post-COVID 19 world. Telecommuter identities and devices are the new security perimeter and cybersecurity technology is constantly evolving with more hackers. in addition to advanced. Cybersecurity investor Nazo Moosa is one of the largest cybersecurity investors in Europe and expects rapid growth. Reports suggest that the global cybersecurity market is now worth $ 173 billion in 2020 and $ 270 billion in 2026. Jobs in this industry are also growing 3 times faster than any other job in the tech world. . So look for cybersecurity tools that are increasingly present in your daily work and family life in 2021.","8,323 followers",Mehul R Anghan,1.4K,764,25.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-upcoming-technologies-in-India-in-2021

Well, unfortunately, those microbots are impossible, but there is a similar technology that’s being developed in real life.The idea is to build tiny replicators that can create more of themselves, like a sort of super bacteria that never stops replicating.

I don’t have a crystal ball in front of me, but it’s clear the software development industry will evolve. Like now, developers are learning the latest framework/libraries to build their apps.

Same for test automation developers.An exemple I did, I implement an image recognition library to validate if the user interface match the baseline. Tools evolves, and as a test automation developer, engineer and so on, you have the job to learn and improve yourself.This is how we remain relevant in the application development cycle, especially in the QA/testing one. In agile project, when the team is rushed to push a new version of the app every 2 weeks sprint, as a project management perspective, you have to reduce the testing burden for both manual and automation testers. The application under development needs to tested what so ever. And to meet their deadline, automation testing is a must!That’s why test automation won’t disappear. It’s sure it will evolve, like in any aspect in the software development industry. No need to be scared about this.If you need to be scared about something related test automation is this accronym: BDD (behavior driven-development/cucumber).Have a nice day!","1,201 followers",Yad Konrad,1.6K,586,3.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-upcoming-technologies-in-India-in-2021
10,"Software testing as a dedicated discipline is shrinking. For the companies I’ve worked at, the days where there are dedicated test teams on par with the dev teams are gone.When I joined Microsoft working on Windows, the ratio of test to dev was 1:1 to 1.5:1. I’d be surprised if it’s even 1:10 these days. At Google and Amazon, I saw the same thing, small test teams doing some integration and scenario testing, but most technical staff were developers.I believe agility of patching and upgrades is a big reason why.When I worked on Windows, it had to release to hundreds of millions of people, and oSoftware testing as a dedicated discipline is shrinking.

That’s a long time to live with bugs.Now software patches for applications and for services can be created and deployed within a few weeks.The bar for release quality is much lower (not at Microsoft, in general). The developer is responsible for finding and addressing easily found bugs before release. Then they own the software after release, fixing and addressing problems that come up. This saves a tremendous amount of labor spent finding and fixing bugs a customer will never hit.Software testing is shrinking as a fraction of development effort, and the dedicated discipline is on its way out. Lucky for existing testers, it’s generally a slow decline.",19 followers,Tia Mongla,559,52,657.8K,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-upcoming-technologies-in-India-in-2021
