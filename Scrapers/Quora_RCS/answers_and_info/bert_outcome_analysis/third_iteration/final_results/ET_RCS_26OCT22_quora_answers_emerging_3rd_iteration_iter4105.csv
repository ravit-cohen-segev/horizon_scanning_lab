The world has already seen them, and developed symmetric or asymmetric counters to them. Basically why bother developing a 'old to the world' tech, when you can get ahead in something new.So in short Russia ranges from ahead of the curve in some technologies, and 2–3 decades behind at the worse in others.","43,431 followers",Misha Firer,947,1.3K,133.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-Russia-technically-advanced

Finally, we had a domestic Tesla, and in 2011 Putin drove a Yo-mobil for the rolling cameras. Everything looked very bright and promising, but nothing came to fruition. No factory was built. No mass production was launched.The grand total of three Yo-mobils were manufactured. Appropriately, the king court’s jester politician Zhirinovsky bought one and managed to drive 300 miles, at which point the car refused to charge. A Mercedes Benz E-class picked him up.142 millions euro invested in the project had magically disappeared.Looks too good to be true? True.Marussia Sports CarFounded in 2007 by Nikolai Fomenko and partners, Marussia Motors set an ambitious goal of producing the first Russian racing car.They beat Yo-mobil and managed to produce forty four prototypes of varying degrees of (in)completion.Hundreds of millions of dollars went down the pipe, and in 2014 the project was shut down at a loss. The same year, Nikolai Fomenko sailed on his super-yacht into Dubai marina for the yacht-show.His super yacht was neither designed nor manufactured in Russia.Mr. Chubais, the head of Rosnano, a state venture fund, is giving Mr. Putin heads-up on how he’s blowing, sorry, spending budget moneyPlastic Logic 100 eBook ReaderThis e-book reader is based on the developments of the German company PlasticLogic. In 2011, it was on the verge of bankruptcy due to its failed product: the electronic book reader Que.But then Rusnano swooped in and the business of the PlasticLogic went uphill. Until it didn’t.Mr. Chubais paid off $50 million worth of PlasticLogic debts, and another $100 million was offered as a loan guarantee to build a plant in Zelenograd near Moscow. He sold the idea to the government that his eBook readers would be used instead of textbooks in all the schools of Russia. $700 million more were poured into the project.To cut the long story short, in 2012, the construction of the plant and the production of devices were abandoned altogether, citing economic inexpediency.Do you think Mr. Chubais got fired? It’s a rhetorical question.Prime minister Dmitry Medvedev said about YotaPhone, new Russian smartphone: “When Steve Jobs heard about YotaPhone, he was worried.”At the end of 2013, CEO of Rostec, owner of Yota Devices Ltd, ex-KGB general and Mr. Putin’s old friend, Sergei Chemezov presented the highly innovative Russian smartphone YotaPhone with two displays to Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.Observe, they always present their prototypes to the supreme leaders and not to the public.In Russia, government is your investor, your marketer, your consumer, your law, your freedom, your bank, and your career. Public doesn't count for much. They only need to be fed buckwheat and macaroni and entertained with TV fluff and parades.For some unbeknownst reason, all the smartphone components were produced in wealthy Singapore, the E-ink display was from aforementioned PlasticLogic, which explains why sale price was so high.In 2013, YotaPhone was sold for 499 euros. Grand total of 40,000 devices were sold by mid-2014.Riding on the back of their success, in 2014, Yotaphone 2 was released, and 22,760 units were sold.In 2017, Yotaphone 3 was released at the price of $450 with even fewer units sold.Hundreds of consumers await the release of the KGB general’s YotaPhone 4.Meet Boris, a man in Alyosha robot suit passing off as a robotIn December 2018, the story of a Russian cutting-edge life size robot that was the answer to Boston Dynamics’ robot, went on all the federal TV channels.During the nationall forum “Projectors” held in Yaroslavl, the life size robot Boris was showing some cool dance moves to the clapping audience.Turned out it was a human pretending to be a robot by wearing Alyosha robot suit.

That alone should makes the US light-years ahead in military development, right?Well, not quite. Just like any bodily institution on Earth, the US Armed Forces has its own budgeting problem.Usually, it’s a foreign policy problem though.See, the budget for the US military doesn’t just go to tech-development inside the country. It has to go to maintain their global military presence as well. Such case isn’t the case with Russia where they only have small overseas presence in countries such as Central African Republic and Syria.What’s more to add is head-to-head military confrontation between major power is a thing of the past and it will probably be nothing to be concerned of.Let me ask you something. When was the last time you saw Russian Mig-29 having a dogfight with American F-15 in real life? Pretty sure even if you do, it was a mock dogfight in an airshow.Why is that the case? Because a war between Russia and USA is a war that will never come. Thus making an arms race pointless.Like i said, it’s kind of useless to compare Russian and US military because it’s they’re the same on the surface only.The US who seek to be the dominant power on the global stage will always be ahead with its aircraft carrier fleet to which is in line with its gargantuan budget.On the other hand, Russia who has smaller money to spend always prefer to go with nuclear submarine which is while not as impressive, will still makes any foreign forces think twice before having a conflict with Russia.That’s all i can say for now.

It's certainly a joke, but as we say, ""There's a fraction of a joke in every joke...""For the first time since 2006 Russia has not entered the top five countries with the largest defense expenditures. Although the world's defense spending set a record of $1.8 trillion, $239 for every person in the world was spent in one year.So, the top five countries.First place - in the U.S., Trump has allocated $649 billion, which is 3.2% of the Gross Domestic Product, reduced by GDP . that will account for almost 40% of total world spending on the armed forces.In second place, China's military budget will be over $250 billion, about 1.9 percent of GDP. I believe China significantly underestimates the official military budget of 175 billion, with an annual defense budget growth rate of 7-8 percent in all scenarios.Third, Saudi Arabia - $67.6 billion, about 8.8% of GDP.Fourth, India - $66.5 billion 2.4% of GDP,Fifth, France - $63.8 billion 2.3% of GDPSixth, Russia spent 2.8% of GDP in 2018 and came in sixth, with defense spending $61.4 billion.Seventh, UK - military spending $50 billion respectively.If we analyze all these figures, as well as the number of weapons deployed in Western Europe and the U.S., then simply comparing the figures for defense spending and the number of weapons, it is clear that Russia simply cannot and does not intend to attack the U.S. and NATO and invade European countries.Here, for example, are absolutely fresh data:The U.S. military budget in 2020 for the first time will reach almost $750 billion, which is comparable to the total annual military budget of all countries in the world and 16 times higher than Russia's.Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu at the final board of the military department with participation of Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the military budget of the Russian Federation in 2020 will fall to ninth place in the world, while in 2019 it was in eighth place.""If in 2018 we were in seventh place in terms of military spending among the world's leading states, in the current year - on the eighth, and in the next year we will be on the ninth,"" - said Shoigu.The military budget of the Russian Federation remains practically unchanged for several years, and the decline is associated with the annual growth of military budgets of the U.S. and other countries, the minister added.If we compare the U.S. and Russian military budgets, they are simply incomparable, for example, the level of salaries in the armed forces and the total cost of maintaining the U.S. and Russian army and navy. Hundreds of military bases are located all over the world. In fact, the NATO alliance is fully funded by the US. Only the huge U.S. Navy with its constant and stupid maneuvers rocks billions of dollars from the budget.It is still possible to compare some of the final indicators in the procurement of weapons and military equipment. This is the way things are:So far we can only compare the plans for purchasing equipment in 2020 in the US and Russia. For example, the United States is going to purchase 110 fourth and fifth generation aircraft and 12 KC-46 refuelers in 2020. In turn, Russia is going to buy 106 airplanes, helicopters and drones from the industry in 2020.As for the improvement of the American strategic nuclear forces, in 2020 it is planned to allocate $570 million for land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles; $3 billion for the promising B-21 Raider strategic bomber; $712 million for the long-range cruise missile with a nuclear warhead; $2.2 billion for the Colombian class nuclear missile submarines and $2.5 billion for the control, monitoring and communication facilities in the strategic nuclear forces system.It is not possible to compare these data with similar data in Russia at this stage. This part of the Russian military budget has been closed.At the same time, the United States is going to deploy 12 warships and two large experimental unmanned surface ships in its navy in 2020. These include three Virginia-class submarines, three DDG-51 Flight III destroyers and one advanced FFG (X) frigate.In turn, Russia is going to increase its navy combat strength by 14 ships and boats, by three submarines and by 18 supply vessels and boats.As a result, I would like to note that all these figures do not matter from the point of view of the army's solvency.Thus, Lieutenant General Valery Zaparenko, the former Deputy Head of the General Operations Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, said:""there is no direct and unambiguous dependence between the size of the military budget and victories on the battlefield,""Let's say Saudi Arabia is among the top three world leaders in terms of military spending, sometimes shifting to fourth place. It would seem that it is impossible to stand up in an armed struggle against such a military machine. But it has not been possible to defeat Riyadh Riyadh by the Husite insurgents and end this conflict victoriously for several years,"" the warlord said.And there are many such examples, the general said. For eighteen years of fighting in Afghanistan, the U.S. military, despite all its unparalleled power, has failed to achieve any intelligible results.And at the same time, the limited Russian military contingent in Syria serves as a guarantor of peace and security in that country, Zaparenko believes.And maybe the most important thing is that the U.S. and Russian armies have completely different tasks. Take the latest military doctrines of these countries, you will be surprised to notice that Russia is not going to ""conquer"" Europe or the United States. The main task is to repulse the aggressor with dignity, protect civilians and prevent the enemy from entering its territory. There is no need to create a lot of old weapons to achieve these goals. It is better to have less weapons, but better quality and efficiency.

The Chinese are just more open to new things, so they tend to field newer tech which most times lack quality. The Russian industries on the other hand can build anything, but they are owned and controlled by the government. This makes them modernise or adapt newer techniques at a speed the government dictates instead of the open market.Still, the Chinese are not behind in everything, they have been doing great in telecommunications, but their equipments still use western IPs.In the grand scheme, the Chinese have a better future technologically. This is because they are much more open to the West than Russia. If Russia stays closed in 100 years time like it is today, the Chinese will for sure overtake them. But for today the Russians are doing better technologically and the Chinese are learning fast and getting better.","5,678 followers",Alexei Yahontov,1.1K,540,21.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-Russia-technically-advanced

All the numbers in the Drake equation are very much guesswork, and the numbers people plug into it are mostly based on our highly biased sample of one (1) planet with technological life on it.And even with that sample, you can get any number from 0 to 100,000 civilisations in the galaxy. Optimists often get higher numbers, and it was one of these higher numbers that caused Enrico Fermi to burst out “but where are they?!” It’s not as much a paradox as it is a sudden outburst that happened to live its own life. The solution is actually quite simple: the actual number could be closer to zero than to 100,000.Still, the discussion on the Fermi paradox rages on. One popular idea is The Great Filter: there is something like a filter that is not necessarily in the Drake equation that prevents us from seeing aliens out there. The Great Filter could be behind us or ahead of us: they’re often called “We’re First”; “We’re Rare” and “We’re Fucked!”We’re FirstWe’re RareA variant is that it took quite a long time for life on Earth to evolve to become more than single-celled.

This means only aliens inside that tiny bubble would have reasons to suspect we exist. People often forget or don't get to know how big the galaxy is.On top of that, this signal is faint. In a radio-noise rich galaxy. It means aliens have to be looking at the right direction to see the signal.Aliens don't even know we're here.Let's pretend they somehow do know: how'd they travel here? Interstellar travel is hard, dangerous, and will remain unfeasible for long for us. We're probably centuries (many centuries!) away from it. The amount of energy required to make it in relativistic times is absurd. If we consider exotic ways or propeling, we might be talking about literally stellar amounts of energy. We have to suppose aliens have many centuries of advantage on us to be able just to travel here. Any alien. Now restrict that only to those inside that tiny bubble, and it almost makes me feel sad. Aliens farther away would require much, much more time to come here, either travel time or time to develop exotic technology to do so fast.Ok, maybe it might be a little too much to expect them to come here. But why not sending a signal? Saying Hello? Let's pretend it's easy (spoiler: it’s not):It might be the case they know about us, they have seen us and just decided to keep quiet. So then… Why haven't we at leastBecause we'reThis ""planet"", Pluto, is in our damned backyard and all we had was the picture in the left. We couldn't take a decent look at it until we literally went there with a probe to take the picture in the right! And it took 10 years for the probe to travel there through space! It took us so long that by the time we got there, it wasn’t even a proper planet any more!And that's mere, (not so) ridiculous 0.000628 light years away! That's right, it took 10 years for our brave probeAnd we had to go there just like that to take the right picture.We are so near-sighted that we don't even have direct image pictures of worlds of other stars. Ok. There're some pictures, actually, but it's from something else, actually. And it's like this:No, not the huge blob in the center. That's the covered up star (and it's covered lest it would outshine and obfuscate the whole picture, otherwise, 'cause that's what stars do). It's the small smear below it. And that's not exactly a planet. It's a brown dwarf. It's almost a small star, actually. So, no bonus.Bottom line:There's no paradox in Fermi's Paradox in my not-so-humble opinion. It's everything within what we could expect because interstellar sighting is hard, interstellar communication is much, much harder (and risky) and interstellar travel is insanely harder.Edit 0:Edit 1: As someone pointed out in the comments (I'm sorry I forgot the name), I'm not considering that we could (and even should) spot radio signals generated accidentally by aliens (much like our 1939 transmission) and yet we've found none. Taking into account we’reAnyway, we'd have to assume we're somehow late in the evolution run, something I see no reason to believe, exactly due to the mediocrity principle: we should not be especially advanced nor especially primitive.Even though stars the age of our sun have been around the galaxy for at least 7 or 8 billion years? Sure. But how does metalicity come into account, for instance? It is not much of an absurd idea to consider earlier stars in the universe couldn’t even form rocky or life-bearing worlds around them. Even if they did, I think we can’t affirm we’re scouring even the nearby stars properly, much less the distant ones (which is, for all practical means, look into the past). After all, we’ve identified the first exo-planet in 1995, mere 25 years ago.Edit 2: a thousand up votes? Thank you all!Edit 3:Our “eyesight” could be affected by the idea that as a civilization advances, it may stop broadcasting in the radio spectrum.Even we aren’t broadcasting in the same way we used to in the age of radio and broadcast TV. A lot of us get our radio with satellite radio, which aims down at us, rather than out to the universe. For TV, we are using satellites more and more, and most of the TVs in US homes can’t even receive broadcast VHF and UHF signals any more. Most TV is distributed over satellite networks, then through cables to our homes.In that context, and given that we have only been listening fo a few decades, it seems unlikely that an advanced civilization’s communication technological development would be so well synchronized with ours that we would be listening for the exact kind of signals that we are currently equipped to receive?Edit 4:""We are short-sighted, because we are brief.""— that's a phrase I see constantly being used by",2 followers,Richard Muller,912,2.3K,202.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-Russia-technically-advanced
10,"A simple answer the paradox is that the claim of an “extremely high probability of the existence of alien civilizations” is not valid.That high probability is usually based on the “Drake equation.” That equation consists of a product of probabilities, most of which can be fairly well estimated, and at least one that is totally unknown.

See, for example, the Wikipedia article,The key take-away is that the conclusion is flimsy, not definitive. The Drake Equation hides its weakness by distracting the reader with lots of large numbers. But multiply a lot of large and moderately certain numbers by an indeterminate one, and the result is indeterminate.Thus the likelihood of other intelligence in the universe is not high; it is indeterminate. Thus a possible resolution to the Fermi paradox is that we are actually alone. The aliens have never visited because there aren’t any.It is worth noting that Fermi did not consider his statement to be a paradox.

The Drake Equation was thought up by Astronomer and Astrophysicist Frank Drake and is typically expressed as follows:where:NandRfnfffLThe thing is, though, this thought experiment by Dr. Drake was never meant to actually be a probability estimate of the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy in the first place. Instead, he was just pointing out all the various variables that we would need to know in order to somehow come up with such a probability estimate, knowing full well that we simply do not have this knowledge at the current time. So anybody who thinks that we actually know how likely it is for there to be active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in our galaxy (and, further, claims that we somehow know that active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations are likely to be common) is just pulling it out of their rectum (or, more likely, just parroting somebody else who pulled it out ofNote, btw, that this is a separate question from the probability of “life” existing elsewhere in the galaxy.

He is essentially as blind as a bat and both the man and creature use echolocation to target their enemies and prey respectively. As stated in #3, Daredevil goes out at night to confront his enemies, which parallels a bat nocturnally hunting its prey.Therefore, Matt should be called the “Bat of Hell’s Kitchen,” or essentially a “Bat out of hell.”","3,451 followers",Olisa Efobi,5.1K,838,25.3M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Is-Russia-technically-advanced

18,"I agree with the incredible character breakdowns of the people below me—T-Challa really mirrors the background, skill set, and hero’s arc of Batman. I’d like to add, though, that I find Daredevil to match the tone and intensity of the Dark Knight. He’s down on the streets, hiding behind the mask—he believes in helping the system to bring about justice, but when it fails, he’s out there in the alleyways getting bloody, staggering back home to get sewn up by a frustrated ally.",57 followers,Luke Sauqaqa,3.7K,63,246.6K,2016,https://www.quora.com/Is-Russia-technically-advanced

Sure sure, you can make comparisons here and there, but Bruce Wayne, aka Batman, is a DC character not a Marvel character. That being said, there are a few who are rather similar.Those are probably the best contenders for “Marvel’s Batman”. A Moon Knight movie could be the MCU version of a Batman movie. Iron Man is basically a daylight version of Batman. Black Panther is the human among gods version. And Daredevil is basically a poor man’s Batman. Almost literally.If I had to pick I’d go with Daredevil. To me he captures all the best elements of Batman without being weighed down by some of the other attributes. Crime fighter, dark, mysterious, scares the crap out of bad guys… etc etc. Black Panther and Iron Man share some superficial similarities, but ultimately they’re not really like Batman in spirit.

That is exactly what for the vast majority of humans that have lived my condition meant. The whole night I had nightmares about this.This morning I had my jaw surgery.
