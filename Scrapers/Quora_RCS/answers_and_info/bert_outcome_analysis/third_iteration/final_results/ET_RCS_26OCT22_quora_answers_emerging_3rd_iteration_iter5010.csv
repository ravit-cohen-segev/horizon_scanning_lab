Streaming will be the future of music listening for many years to come.Compact Disks have completely faded away by now. On a couple of years there will be major opportunities for those who want to expand their CD collections, with music stores and department stores clearing away all their stock because the space taken by CDs is making them lose money. Stores that sell CDs started to sell more merchandise, musical accessories and mainly records. The vinyl records have become an important market niche. Unfortunately, most newly recorded records have a somewhat sub-par audio quality and most record players that are being sold to the mass market are complete trash.MP3 as a format is also losing relevance. Most music streaming services still use MP3 encoding, but with larger bandwidths and better networks, as well as bigger servers, and the demand of better formats by the general public, or just the novelty of introducing other formats, MP3 will give its way to lossless files such as FLAC, and novelty “formats” such as MQA.Cassettes have faded away a long long time ago. And this is the weirdest part of your question. In fact, there are some movements trying to revive the cassette as a music format, mostly because of the Sony Walkman revivalism on many pop-culture productions such as Guardians of the Galaxy. But cassettes rely on a very complex magnetic process on top of a very complex mechanical process in order to be recorded and played. Because of that, there are not many companies that still produce cassette players, and the new ones entering the market are of very low quality. It is very expansive to make good cassette paraphernalia, and the only way companies were able to do it back in the 70’s and 80’s was because of production scale.Another niche is for those that still use portable digital audio players (DAP) that have a storage device. The iPod is fading too, but other companies are still making their high quality portable DAPs, such as Sony, Onkyo, FiiO, AK, Hiby, Xduuo, iBasso, etc. You can rip your CD collection to high quality lossless files (WAV, FLAC) and store them in a microSD card and take it with you. There are sites and streaming services that sell downloadable music in high resolution formats too.",1 follower,Shaheer Khan,1K,63,708.4K,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-music-listening-technology-With-casettes-and-CDs-fading-away-what-will-replace-MP3s
1,"Not going to happen completely.But, there may well be no consumer DSLRs left within a couple of years.There will be professional DSLRs still available for about a decade.Why?Pro DSLRs are often sold as a component of something else, or as part of a support contract for an organisation, and the manufacturers have really long contracts to continue supplying replacement cameras, parts and service to their customers.",5 followers,Bill Otto,7.6K,7.5K,43.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-music-listening-technology-With-casettes-and-CDs-fading-away-what-will-replace-MP3s
2,"DSLR will not end, but mirrorless will continue to improve and eventually surpass DSLR in all areas. No it is not there yet. Yes mirrorless is great and can do some things better, but not all. Video is one area it typically surpasses the DSLR, the Nikon D780 being perhaps the one exception as Nikon used their mirrorless Z6 technology in the D780 when in live view mode - and it is the one DSLR that is as capable as any mirrorless when in that mode. There are other areas however the mirrorless is less capable, I owned two Sony cameras and have sold them recently as they were not up to what I neeDSLR will not end, but mirrorless will continue to improve and eventually surpass DSLR in all areas.

There are other areas however the mirrorless is less capable, I owned two Sony cameras and have sold them recently as they were not up to what I needed. However I will likely look again hard at the mirrorless technology, Nikon very likely as it has caught up with the Sony in pretty much ever aspect (and the Sony/Nikon sensors typically are more capable than the Canon sensors from a pure specification and lab testing performance).",4 followers,Rolando Gómez,822,124,4.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-likely-is-the-fact-that-DSLR-technology-will-end-and-be-replaced-by-mirrorless-technology-during-or-by-the-end-of-2021
3,First I wanna thank you for A2AWell interesting questionWell let's dive into past people used to be habitual to use horse cart for daily commute but when car was invented it just not only made it's new market but also replaced horse cart.Same is the case with smartphone it kinda replaced desktop for basic stuff like emailsSo if the new Technology introduced is worth using and is better than smartphones then people would buy it for sure if marketing is executed preciselyDo stop by my profileLife is tough huh!!First I wanna thank you for A2AWell interesting questionWell let's dive into past people used to be habitual to use horse cart for daily commute but when car was invented it just not only made it's new market but also replaced horse cart.Same is the case with smartphone it kinda replaced desktop for basic stuff like emailsSo if the new Technology introduced is worth using and is better than smartphones then people would buy it for sure if marketing is executed preciselyDo stop by my profileLife is tough huh!!,5 followers,Bill Otto,7.6K,7.5K,43.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-music-listening-technology-With-casettes-and-CDs-fading-away-what-will-replace-MP3s

People are still required for designing, building, and operating all those machines.
