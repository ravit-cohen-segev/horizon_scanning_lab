And we know that AMD is pursuing 5nm already, And also some of Projects in Big Giant like QC and Samsung Has been providing good yield with 5nm/7nm/14nm/16nm .Now as we know A technology node is denoted by channel Length of FET and The process node used by a foundry relates to the number of transistors that fit inside a specified space, such as a square mm. For example, the transistor density of the chips currently produced using the 7nm process (such as Apple's A13 Bionic, Qualcomm's SnapdrHi,Small, smaller, smallest. Where will it stop, 3nm is already coming in 2021, that's right next year. And we know that AMD is pursuing 5nm already, And also some of Projects in Big Giant like QC and Samsung Has been providing good yield with 5nm/7nm/14nm/16nm .Now as we know A technology node is denoted by channel Length of FET and The process node used by a foundry relates to the number of transistors that fit inside a specified space, such as a square mm. For example, the transistor density of the chips currently produced using the 7nm process (such as Apple's A13 Bionic, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 865 Mobile Platform, and Huawei's Kirin 990 5G chipset) is approximately 100 million transistors per square mm. That allows Apple to stuff 8.5 billion transistors into each A13 Bionic SoC. The new 5nm chips rolling off the assembly line this year will have 171.3 million transistors per square mm which will allow the 5nm A14 Bionic to contain 15 billion transistors inside. Performance of the new chips will increase 10-15% while energy consumption will decline by 25%-30%.The transistor density of chips keeps going up as the process node goes down , Right now, TSMC and Samsung are racing to complete facilities to produce 3nm chips. TSMC's 3nm chips will deliver a 5% performance boost while consuming 15% less energy. And the transistor density will rise by 1.7 to just shy of 300 million transistors per square mm. Amazing. TSMC is expected to begin risk production of 3nm chips in 2021.Upcoming Year will be a Racing Competition for all Vlsi companies and that may turn out to be a war of Lower Tech node (5nm/3nm War Begins).Since I am a follower of non violence , I dont like war in General 😉😉but above one is a silent war as most companies dont Reveal their Road maps and that makes this war interesting, Let's be part and enjoy this.Happy Learnings 😊😊RegardsZiya",7 followers,Rohit Virmani,1.9K,2.3K,86.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-latest-technology-in-the-VLSI-field

These can help indian companies to collaborate with foreign ventures to transfer technology and build technology togetherEducationIndia must revive education more based on vocational than sticking to obsolete theories. Our new generation needs to aware of new developments and these discoveries and essential information needs to be incorporated to the textbook or to study materialsSkill India initiativeIndia has most number of graduated unemployed than anywhere . We have large Numbers of engineering and other graduates not employed to respective sectors .so the government should initiative inclusive schemes or infrastructure development to accommodate or use this man power efficiently so that the right minds will be directed to best fields . Skill india initiative is a right movement for that ,but awareness should be given largely than present scenarioInformation technologyMany people are intelligent and they are ready to work hard as well . But there is lack of motives and mentors to channelize this intelligence and energy for the right couse . So every people should be connected to network where their ideas can be shared and information can be gatherd according to their interestsForeign direct investment (FDI)India must welcome foreign companies to establish their plants and investment in building required infrastructure for the same ,so that we will be provided with job opportunities and skill training. We can gradually use this knowledge as well as skill later on developing our own technology combined with latest developments and collaboration with foreign firms will reduce time and effortHigher education (establish technology based universities and provide education and training )We must bring scholarships and Incentives to bright minds to conduct their experiments and research on latest sectors and field . And stop intelligent minds going outside to Persue studies and research. We must use our best minds to develop our best technology. Basically stop brain drainingStartups and entrepreneurshipHelp the business minds to establish own business and help them starting the ventures without putting so much financial burden , MUDRA LOAN is an good initiative so far government has taken.Eliminate red tapism and improve ease of doing businessMany great initiatives sometimes halts by red tapism and complex government clearance procedures. We must ease the procedures and give them green light as soon as possible. So that their motive and effort will be appreciated and felicitated .Public private collaborationWe must welcome and encourage private sector to develop technologies. For example in India defence manufacturing was primarily excercised by public firms so that development process sometimes takes so long time. So once we engane them effectively they can invest more money on the development and can find our right minds more professionally and can organise the process more efficiently. So the development process will take faster than the normal paceSo these are some of the important steps the Indian government must take to develop technologies indigenously and to become powerful technology giant in the futureThank you",63 followers,Dan Kim,866,1.3K,4.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-can-India-become-a-technologically-advanced-country

Action expresses priorities. India’s first underwater rail tunnel completed ahead of schedule. The entire project is 16.6 km long, out of which 10.8 km runs under the ground. Of this 10.8 km, 502 metres is under the water. The tunnel is being dug 30 metres below the riverbed. The project connects Howrah to the west and Salt lake to the east. Digging this tunnel was the most difficult and critical task in the entire project. The stretch of 16.6 km will have 12 stations, six of which will be under the ground, while the remaining six stations will be on elevated tracks. Congratulate the engineers & employess of Afcons Transtonnelstroy and Kolkata Kolkata Metro Railway Corporation Ltd!! Thanks me later.3. A solar plant of the size and cost of a center table on your rooftop can insure your home against power cuts and halve your electricity bill. Made-in-IIT solar plant powers thousands of rural homes - smaller and cheaper than present installations. At a cost of Rs 20,000, the rooftop plant and storage system can run couple of tube lights, fans, charging points and a TV. The solar inverterless DC system is cost and energy-efficient as unlike other solar power systems, it does not convert direct current produced by a solar installation into alternate current . A 125W solar installation will require 10sqft space, while 500W requires 50 sqft of space. The system comes with a full DC wiring. A wonderful cost effective solution.4. The Made In India BMM300 clay brick making machine is genius. It cranks out bricks laying them in nice straight rows for easy collection. The production capacity is 300 brick/min. It is the world's only Mobile Brick Making machine. Made in Firozpur Bangur village in Sonepat, it stood 19th among 30 innovations that bagged the DST-Lockheed Martin India Innovation Growth Programme awards for 2016. Congratulate Vilas Chhikara and his team. Thanks me later.5.You can have results or excuses, not both. 13-year-old students from Tamil Nadu designed low-cost toilet urinals using 20-liter waste plastic bottles. Finding the stench that emanated from their school toilet unbearable, students at a government school in Trichy district designed low-cost urinals. The project won the ‘Boldest Idea’ award at the ‘I CAN Awards 2016’ organised by Design for Change. As the cost of installing urinals was high, the boys came up with an imaginative solution. Congratulating the students on their idea, the seller handed over used, damaged, and leaking water bottles free-of-cost. Using funds collected from the students and teachers, they purchased other necessary pipes and parts. To flush the urinals after use, they set up a line of drip irrigation pipes above the urinals. Congratulate the 5 member team – Supikpandian, Santhosh, Dhiyanithi, Ragul, and Prabaharan. Thanks me later.I think i answered this question to some extent.
