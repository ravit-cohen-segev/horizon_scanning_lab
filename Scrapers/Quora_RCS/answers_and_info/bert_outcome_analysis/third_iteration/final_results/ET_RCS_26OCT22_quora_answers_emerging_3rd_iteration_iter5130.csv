For example, if one wants to make a post-dated (one-off) payment, cheque is perhaps the only method. Cheques can be also used to pay for high value transactions. A high value transaction may be declined on the debit card and the credit card may not have sufficient limit or shopper may not have a credit card.In USA, many people still pay monthly rent and utilities by cheque. Of course electronic direct debit facility is available, but people continue to use the old method.Finally, what happens if your internet is down or the servers are down at the bank? There exist many people who do not have a credit card. In this situation debit card may not work.","4,500 followers",Bob Myers,2.7K,16.4K,14.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-haven-t-bank-cheques-been-completely-replaced-with-the-latest-technology

The grading “design” was total crap. It was so bad that we had to have another office of that firm take control of the project and re-do all the work. The message here… the software does a lot of basic calculations, but there is still an art form to refining the work. Grading is complex and while the software can do millions of calculations it cant “see” the wackiness of the results. There is no elegance. It’s only a good start.The rest of their work is not as automated… there is still a lot of manual thought work required.Architecture is even more complex, and as good as the tools have become there are FAR from getting to a point where they can figure out ANYTHING.in the 1980’s the CAD salesmen told us that CAD you give us more time to design… and they were wrong… we have plenty of design time, but it allows us to do more faster. We’ve shortened the design time, we’re out putting 10 times more content (at least) and it’s 100 times better than before - but, the design is still done by the human, not the software.",1 follower,Sangram Sagar,1.3K,913,71.7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Why-haven-t-bank-cheques-been-completely-replaced-with-the-latest-technology
2,"As a structural engineer, I keep asking myself the same question. Will I be obsolete in 30 years? I think less number of structural engineers will be needed, as a lot of the repetition will be done by machines. But I don't think they will be replaced completely.70 years ago structural engineers designed structures without calculators, let alone computers. They used to perform all calculations using slide rules. It took a long time to analyze an entire building.35 years ago few used computers, most had calculators.

They used to perform all calculations using slide rules. It took a long time to analyze an entire building.35 years ago few used computers, most had calculators. They were able to perform calculations much more quickly, but because of this ability, more detailed calculations were demanded from them.Now we almost always use computers, but we need to perform many checks that were not necessary 35 years ago.As machines become more able, they will speed things up, but we will be required to investigate things we didn't use to. Because the the society will demand safer, more efficient designs.All in all, most of the grunt work will be done by machines, but we will need people to communicate with the computers.",269 followers,Divyanshu Shankar,616,58,338.6K,2017,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-soon-replace-architects-and-civil-engineers

5,"Depends from what angle you look at it from. Certainly if we’re talking about video games, then often the format between these genres remains the same, such as in a game like World of Warcraft (Fantasy) compared to Anarchy Online (Sci-fi) both are MMORPGs, in World of Warcraft you get spells, in AO, you get nano’s. In WoW you get armour, in AO you get gear and implants. But when it comes down to it - It’s the same formula, only renamed cosmetics.But science fiction is ideologically very different from magic.

Magic is (to a rational mind) pure fiction. There is no chance of magic ever becoming a thing because it is in its perfected form utter tripe that is outside of the laws of physics. Sure it’s fun to dream, and no harm in it, but it’s nonsensical fantasy.Science fiction on the other hand is developed under the premise of a reality not yet realized with plausibility.Think of it as the “vision” phase of an advancement.Example : “Imagine if we could breathe underwater, I bet one day we’ll have that ability”.A science fiction writer would write a story about gene splicing a fish and a human to produce gills on a fish.Now such a feat, regardless of the exact implementation, in other words a human that is capable of breathing underwater IS in the realms of possibility and would not break any laws of physics.We also know that such a thing is not currently possible.What we are sure of that, with enough work and time such a thing is 100% possible.This is the premise of science fiction -> “I know what I want, but we’re not advanced enough yet to realize it”.Every piece of technology we have now, was at one time “science fiction”.","220,609 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.7K,47.3K,782.8M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-soon-replace-architects-and-civil-engineers

9,"Nope, not a chance.The airline industry can satisfy any demand for non-stop service between any two cities.With hyperloop, that is hard. Let’s say there are 4 cities, A, B, C, D. To provide service between each city pair requires building 12 hyper loop tracks. If there are 5 cities, 20 tracks are needed. If there are 100 cities, 100 * 99 = 9900 tracks are needed. The cost becomes so prohibitive so fast, that a hub and spoke model would have to emerge.

Namely, there is point to point service between hubs a small set of regions, and within each region, a hyper loop network connection sub-regions. Within each sub-region there would be districts. So one might have a hyper loop network among San Francisco, Denver, Chicago, and New York. San Francisco might be the hub of a region of LA, Portland, Seattle. San Francisco would also be the hub of San Jose, Oakland, Sacramento, Stockton, Reno, etc.LA would be in a sub-region of San Diego, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Tucson.Now there is a problem: there is a high demand for service between Reno and Las Vegas. Locals in Nevada must hyper loop: Las Vegas-Los Angeles-San Francisco-Reno. There will be massive political pressure to waste money building hyper loop tracks between Las Vegas and Reno, just as California is wasting money building high speed rail links between northern and southern California.Or they can just take a non-stop flight on South West Airlines.South West airlines is well positioned to prey on the weaknesses of any surface transportation system that requires a road, track, tunnel, etc. The other airlines, with their hub and spoke model, are less so, but they will still be providing non-stop services from secondary cities on each coast to each other, and at worst get from any secondary city in the hyper loop network to any other secondary city in one connection. And in the airline business, Los Angeles, Dallas, Atlanta, Houston, etc. are not secondary cities.Once one considers transoceanic and transcontinental hyper loop service, the problems I’ve identified magnify.Hyper loop is a good technology for service within metropolitan areas. Cities across the world are being choked by traffic, and these problems will become acute soon in America.","1,288 followers",Mani Gandham,771,875,3.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-haven-t-bank-cheques-been-completely-replaced-with-the-latest-technology
10,"How about you sit down with a good stiff drink. Ready? There is never going to be even a mile of Hyperloop implemented. It's all hype. Vacuum tunnels have been investigated for over 100 years, and every time, the judgement is nope, no how, no way. The technical and regulatory and economic hurdles are many, and each one is a deal-killer. Mostly just a killer. Here is what happen to a half-inch thick steel tube under a mild vacuum:Tubes have a lot of strength under internal pressure. But under external pressure there is an unfortunate positive feedback effect.How about you sit down with a good stiff drink. Ready? There is never going to be even a mile of Hyperloop implemented.

But under external pressure there is an unfortunate positive feedback effect. The slightest inward bowing causes that part to lose the hoop strength provided by the rest of the circumference. That part then bows inward even more, losing even more strength and then it snowballs, as above. Every inch of the Hyperloop is haunted by this unfortunate principle.",1 follower,Andy Kerr,6.3K,3.2K,15.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-soon-replace-architects-and-civil-engineers
