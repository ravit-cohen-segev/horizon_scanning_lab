If an F-16 was manufactured in 1974, and was never shot down, then by 2025 it will have had 51 years of active service.So why is the US government still using jets that are almost half a century old? Consider the following. The base version of the F-16 costs an estimated 30 million dollars. Fully upgraded it can easily cost twice that. For this amount of money you want to get as much usage out of the machine as possible.Furthermore, there’s really not much you can do to improve on the design. The human body can only handle so many G forces before it dies. The F-16 is every bit as effective a weapon now as it was when it was first created, and barring a major paradigm shift in air combat, it will remain effective for the foreseeable future.Compare this to a Commodore personal computer from roughly the same time period. This machine is hopelessly outdated. It would have a hard time running a modern word processor, let alone anything I’d actually want to use a computer for. But the machine was only a couple hundred dollars, which is what it would cost me today to get one about a million times more powerful.To be more precise, if we look at transistor count, a computer from 1974 has roughly 10 million times fewer transistors than a computer made last year. Let that sink in.And the people who manufactured both devices knew this. Military engineers knew they were making big, expensive products that were going to be in service for decades, and which wouldn’t really need to be improved upon until there was another major war. And at that point there’s no telling what improvements would be required.Consumer products engineers knew they were making small, cheap, disposable products that the customer would probably throw away in under a decade, because by then an improved version would appear. They could make the device sturdier, but that would increase the cost to the consumer for a device they were going to throw away anyway.If a Commodore microcomputer was indestructible, you’d still have thrown it away by now because you don’t need it anymore. So why bother?Although, with careful use and regular maintenance, even old consumer products can last for decades. You just need to be really careful with them.",0 followers,Danny S,1K,23.1K,31.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-close-are-we-to-developing-advanced-technology-like-force-fields-ray-guns-etc

The labs are required by law to use every reasonable effort to get the taxpayer funded technologies out to the private sector. They have proven and established procedures to do this.Here’s the problem: most technologies developed in the labs solve very unique problems that are not generally encountered outside those facilities because of the primary lab missions - national security.Here’s the unspoken truth: for every engineer and scientist employed at the national labs working on solutions, there is an entire class of colleagues with whom they attended college and graduate school. These people all studied together and learned solutions approaches from the same faculty. They worked together in teams on projects and learned from each other. Now that a few of them are at the labs, there are a bunch of others already in the private sector, or other government agencies, using the same approaches to solving problems. Usually both sets of people end up with fundamentally the same solutions.So the government technologies are for the most part the same as the private sector’s solutions because the people solving these problems are doing the same thing. The difference is focus, funding, and expected return. Private sector solutions have to be cost effective and provide a return on investment. Lab solutions have a budget to work within but never have to provide a return. Often a government solution is used once for a single problem and then discarded into the surplus auction materials to the private sector.Of those unique technologies like secret weapons or software, they are often 20 years ahead of where the private sector is. My job was the difficult one of trying to find a private sector need for a solution for a problem that did not yet exist because the private sector had not yet ADOPTED and ADAPTED technologies into common use. This is generally because investments in technologies have an expected return over a period of time before a company or person will want to invest money for an upgrade. And that time interval can be years or decades depending on the scale of investment.One example is the 3-D printing technology that is becoming more common in multiple uses. I worked on the initial commercialization plans for that technology more than 20 years ago. It is still on its expected growth curve for adoption and adaption by industry. While the people who invented it more than 25 years ago in the lab saw limited uses, the uses for which is was developed, commercial interests were very limited at first. In fact the first company that licensed the technology saw only a few military uses for the first ten years. It took more than a decade in the private sector before other people began to have ideas on how it could be used. And the technology itself had to evolve a bit, particularly with the materials that could be used. Eventually we will see this particular technology everywhere, even in your own home.So was the original development of 3-D printing secret? Sort of, but the engineers who invented it had classmates that could easily have done the same if there had been a need and an investor willing to put up the capital. What really happened is that the government had a need for a solution and the investment capital and time, and paid for it to be invented in house. Then, by law, made it available to the world outside the labs. Which is what happened.The labs had invented ways of analyzing gas plumes in the open environment, initially for gas or bio warfare applications, but these were adapted to environmental monitoring of industrial plant emissions by the monitoring agencies and companies themselves. Another secret technology? Only initially. Now these are in common use.There are software packages that have been made by lab folks that would blow your mind but nobody has been interested in those technologies because companies have developed their own solutions for their specific problems and keep those solutions to themselves. Does this make them secret technologies? Not really. A simple call to any of the national lab tech transfer offices can gain one an introduction to these technologies and their commercial availability - for US companies anyway, not foreign companies.There are new solutions being made available constantly if you know how to access that information. But again, most of these solutions are too early stage for adoption into daily life, and they must be adapted for non weapons or national security applications. This takes significant investment and will not have the kind of whiz bang returns one commonly sees with the latest release from Apple. These solutions have multi decade returns at much lower rates, so most investors go for something that has larger and faster returns. That’s the main reason you don’t see things the government has invented. Nobody really wants them.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,12.7K,996,156M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-close-are-we-to-developing-advanced-technology-like-force-fields-ray-guns-etc

Supposedly, this technology was used to help cripple the Iraqi air defense system when the US invaded.This was important to Cisco because we were working in security and cryptography and the NSA was forever trying to get us to corrupt our products so they could un-encrypt foreign transmissions on the fly. One time we were required to corrupt product that had been shipped to China and it started a major debate about our fiduciary responsibility to the country or to the customer. The issue was that if you sell a security product that you know is corrupted, you are knowingly committing fraud and are liable. As the Product Manager at the time I asked the NSA if they would stand behind us (and me as I might be personally liable) in court if we were discovered. Of course the answer from the NSA was “Hell no.”We were on our own. We then entered into a long debate about how to detect Easter eggs and other corruption introduced into security products unknowingly through another vendor’s corrupted hardware. The issue was never resolved but it should be known that our security source code HAD to be provided to the NSA in order to get FIPS certification and they made certain changes to it.So to answer your question, USA military technology is advanced far beyond anyone’s knowledge to describe the extent.On the other hand, the Chinese probably know more about our technology than we do since they perpetrated the greatest security breach in history by compromising the RSA key technology used by almost everyone in the world.

For going between cities and provinces, China has a high speed rail system in place that is more extensive than the American highway system!

I could take a high speed train from Nanjing to Shanghai in about 1.5 hours!In contrast, I took an Amtrak train from Detroit to Chicago (about 300 miles/480 km) and it took over 8 hours!Another area China wins at is public utilities. They provide electricity, water, and gas for billions of people for very affordable prices! I paid maybe a total of $20 (US) per month for all utility bills, whereas it cost me over $100 in America! Atop of that is wireless technology (which is considered a public utility in China). I paid 100 rmb ($15) monthly for 16 GB of 4G data, with 1000 texts and 500 minutes of talk (which pretty much meant unlimited everything for me). In America I pay $50 a month for my unlimited plan.

Here’s what we know we have to look forward to.Ant Man and The Wasp- this movie will be set sometime after Civil War and before Infinity War. The main villain is Ghost, and Goliath will feature in the movie. Hank Pym and Hope are on the run from the government who wants their tech, and so far the reviews that have come in seem fairly positive.Venom-this is the first in Sony’s Spider-verse, although it may feature Tom Holland, technically making it part of the MCU. Carnage is the suggested villain and the movie Venom will feature a very different version of Venom, not impacted by Spider man at all.Captain Marvel- Marvels first movie with a female protagonist, Captain Marvel will be set in the 90’s and feature a younger Phil Coulson and Nick Fury. The kree empire will be present on screen, featuring characters like Yon Rogg, Ronan and Korath. Set pictures seem to indicate that Captain Marvel will use her old suit for part of the movie. The main villains of the movie will be the shapeshifting Skrulls.Avengers 4- one of the most anticipated movies ever, not too much is confirmed about it. The title is unkown, and no trailer yet exists. The movie appears to feature time travel to retrieve the infinity stones. Set photos and released art hint at some interesting concepts like Cap wielding Mjolnir and Professor Hulk.Spider-Man: Far From Home-this movie is the first to appear after Avengers 4 and is set in London with Mysterio as the villain. The movie is said to feature and older and more mature version of Peter Parker.Guardians of the Galaxy vol III- almost nothing is known about this movie except for the fact that it is the last Gotg. Mark Hamill is confirmed for a new role in the movie. It will likely feature Nova or Adam Warlock as new additions to the team. Who will even be in it with almost every Gaurdian currently dead is a mystery.Black Widow- this movie has a director and a leading actress. It could incorporate storylines featuring the other Black Widows, the Red Room or even Budapest.Those are all the confirmed MCU movies. They have hinted at movies featuring the Eternals. Marvel did say they had many more movies in production, although the exact number is unclear. Marvel likes trilogies, so movies we can expect are:Dr. Strange IIDr. Strange IIIBlack Panther IIBlack Panther IIISpider-Man III (and hopefully more)Captain Marvel IICaptain Marvel IIIAnt Man IIIThese are movies we can almost certainly look forward to do the the success of the first one for each of the characters. Possible other movies could include Namor, Adam Warlock and more Captain Marvel movies. With Disney’s acquisition of Fox the Fantastic Four and X-men may be the main focus of the MCU movies for the next couple years. Kevin Feige also stated they are planting seeds for a new group of Young Avengers, with Cassie Lang (Stature) and Miles Morales (Spider Man). If Avengers 4 does feature time travel, then it’s possible that there could be an alternate reality where the infinity stones were removed from certain situations. Possible future villains could be the likes of Galactus, Skrulls and Dr. Doom.","15,677 followers",Sarthak Raj Baral,7.1K,550,66M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-evidence-that-the-US-government-is-keeping-highly-advanced-technology-under-wraps

Well did you know that back in 1990s, when there wasn’t a HUGE rivalry between Marvel and DC, there was a crossover called JLA/Avengers.Yeah. Back In the day, there weren’t many fanboys debating which one is better. The writers were actually friends, and they created crossovers. Now, there aren’t even any crossovers anymore. In fact, Stan Lee was in the new Teen Titans movie, and he was about to be featured in a Super Man show. Back then, the Marvel and DC writers and companies were at least friendly. They were rivals, but they were still friendsIn fact, it’s been highly speculated that Barry Allen traveled to the Marvel universe one time. I mean come on man. That showed how even though they were fierce rivals, they still worked together on some easter eggsNow, its considered like a taboo if Marvel is friends with DC. Before, fans couldn’t care if you were a DC or Marvel fanboy. It doesn’t matter which heroes you liked, as long as the hero is fleshed out and has cool moments. You guys could still gossip. Now, in 2018, if you say Marvel is better, there are fanboys who have the compulsion to fire back and say Marvel sucks. It’s a shame that instead of moving forward, we are moving backward and hating on each other.But back to the point. So I mention on perspective right? Here’s the thing.Some people like DC Super Heroes because they areIn All Star Super Man, a boy was about to commit suicide, Super Man stops him, and comforts him.He is also the First Super Hero in the world. Without Super Man there wouldn’t be Marvel, Spider Man, or Batman. All superhero characters are based on his template. The origin story, the superpowers, the secret identity, the love interest, and the villains. He’s obviously not the first character in history to have all of these things but the classic superhero tale is all Superman’s.People complain that Super Man is boring because he’s too nice, he’s too good, and he’s just not interesting. They probably haven’t even read Super Man. Super Man is basically Clark Kent, Kal-El, and Super Man.Clark Kent is a guy who’s born on a farm in Kansas. He’s nerdy, humble, and doesn’t stand out. Sounds kinda familiar right? Because clark Kent is US. Clark is the nerd who does what’s right and doesn’t get the recognition. Clark is the guy who is good at a lot of stuff, but doesn’t get noticed. He’s the guy loves the beautiful girl at work and can’t seem to get her attention because of the big strong guy in the cape she’s in love with. That’s Clark Kent. The mild-mannered reporter.Kal-el. The alien sent to earth who is just a little bit different. The immigrant with the american dream. Kal-el may be an alien, but how does that make him any different than us? We’ve all felt alienated. We’ve all felt different, and that we need to hide who we are to fit in. We feel like there’s nobody else like us. We’ve been to new places, started new schools and jobs and gone to new countries where we are very much out of our element. Kal-el is this person in all of us. Diametrically, Kal-el is also the person Superman wasSuperman. The hero. Superman is the guy we all want to be. He’s strong, he’s fast and he can FLY! Love him or hate him, you would be Superman if you had the chance. He’s what we all wish we could be. The nerd who can take off his glasses and be strong and get noticed. He’s also an ideal. This is where people find him too alienating. They can’t seem to be able to connect with the idea that a man with all the power in the world would use his strength to help others and not for personal gain. And if that concept is too foreign to you, than you are beyond help in many ways. I think the idea of this guy who just wants to do good and help others is a beautiful idea. But there’s also the action hero side of Superman. He may want to do good, but he’s a strong dude and he’s not afraid to hit something. He’s a man of action of justice. And he will fight for what’s right.Super Man is considered by some people to be the best hero because he’s both relatable and inspiring at the same time.People also like Batman because he’s one of the most inspirational super heroes.Batman is not designed to be relatable. . I don’t know too many humans who are infinitely wealthy, driven by vengeance, and pathologically broody.But the key point is this. As a child, Bruce Wayne had a huge tragedy in front of him. But instead of being corrupt and being angry, he decided to channel his energy to fight crime to prevent kids from losing their parents. He had a dark past, but instead of choosing the easy way out and being a criminal, he fought against Fate and became a superhero. A lot of people are inspired about this, and believe that even if they have a dark past (like a drug or drinking addiction) they can change their life around.Batman strictly follow his principle – Never kill anyone. He believes that no one has the rights to end someone’s life. Even when many tried to convince him that killing the bad ones is the only way to stop them, he never gave up on his principle.Ra’s Al Ghul: “Your compassion is a weakness your enemies will not share”Batman: “That’s why it’s so important. It separates us from them”.Batman is also inspiring because he’s one of the founding members of the Justice League. He’s standing next to beings who are revered as gods. But does he cower or show any signs of being uncomfortable. No. He stands up to them, and even talks down on them, and they often listen. This inspires people, because no matter if you’re a nerd, you can stand next to jocks or people who play sports as equals.But you must be thinking, gee this guy talks a lot about DC Super Hero Heroes, he must love DC right hahahahaWRONGLet’s talk about my boy, Spider Man over here.People like Spider Man why? Because he’sBut do people relate to Batman? Are people billionaires, or at least millionaires? Are they super genius who can solve almost any problem? Can they create gadgets, as well as machines and cars and tanks? Are they a head of their company? Can they learn countless martial arts?NO.Spider Man is relatable, because he’s like US. Back in the 1960s, Stan Lee decide to create a risky move. He decide to create a teenage superhero not as a sidekick, but as a loner.Back in the day, teenage superheroes had to be sidekicks so it could appeal to younger audience because most writers don’t know how to write a story where a teenager could act independently, and it could boost the mentor’s sales. They also thought that a teenage superhero wasn’t a good idea, and could give them a bad reputation.Stan Lee was like SCREW THAT. Just because you’re a teenager doesn’t mean you aren’t qualified to be a superhero. Just because you’re a boy doesn’t mean you have to be a sidekick. Spider Man was a teenager, when he would react to danger, he would react what a teenager would react. A teenager wouldn’t look at a bad guy and say “Pfft. This guy is nothing. I could do this all day.” No, a teenager would be like “oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit.”In DC, you had Batman. you had superman. you had all these superheroes who were MEN, who all children could aspire to, and all the children could be men and superheroes if they eat their vegetables or something like that. A nerdy kid would read that and be like “oh dang. I want to be like that. Except I’m not because I’m just a boy who’s a loser and don’t have any chicks.”Spider Man came along and say “Hey nerdy kid. you too can be a superhero because you’re just like me.”Super Man may be an alien, but did he had to worry about acing his classes? Super Man became a superhero when he first got a job. Did Batman have to worry about curfew? Batman does this superhero thing all night! Does Bruce and Clark Kent have to worry about asking girls out? No, because Clark already have a girlfriend, and Bruce is a playboy. Not many comic readers are playboy, or have girlfriends. Spider Man was what every superhero was. He had to study, but he can’t because he’s too busy fighting crime. he has to worry about money issues, and needs to find a job. He has to contemplate whether he should use his 20 dollars for his bus pass, his lunch, or to use it for web shooters.Every human being has struggled with doing the right thing at some point. Every human being has had problem in life bombard them to the point they aren’t sure what to do. People like spidey because he shows us ourselves in a way that shows we can overcome the mundane if we don’t give up. In fact, Peter’s first job was at the Daily bugle, where his boss doesn’t even like Spider Man, so Peter has to take pictures so that his boss can publish Anti-Spider Man news. talk about bad luck. But does Peter complain about it? No. He has to push on and keep on doing it because he is self-less and he needs to do it not for him, but for his aunt. He also gets underpaid, but has to deal with it.Peter parker gets bullied at school, but he can’t fight back or else he will risk his identity out. He can’t seem to make that many friends because he’s an introvert. If you think of your typical teenage comic book reader in the 1970’s, Spider-Man hit all the right buttons.Finally, people like Spider Man because of his attitude. Even in the face of danger, peter quipps not because he finds it funny, but because he’s nervous so he’s trying to relieve tension. That’s what a teenager should react. When Batman and Super man meet a bad guy, they often react with confidence or without emotion, just wanting to get the job done. when Spider Man meets a strong super villain, he is nervous, but he uses humor to disguise it. People also like Spider Man because it’s more colorful and unique and Batman and Superman. Spider Man also learns martial arts too, which some people could relate to.So now that I got that out of the way, the million dollar question. Which one do I prefer. DC Or Marvel? or which one’s better.Like I said, it all boils down to the reader’s perspective. Do people like heroes that inspire people (Batman, Super Man) or do people like super heroes that relate to people (Spider Man).In fact, this was point out in JLA/ Avengers.When the Justice League arrived in the Marvel universe, they were shocked and dismayed at the Avenger’s efforts to improve their Earth.Super Man is EXTREMELY angered by this because even with all the powers, the Marvel super heroes have failed to improve the Earth’s conditions. He feels that they haven’t been doing their job correctly.When the Marvel heroes got the Ultimate Nullifier away during a skirmish, Super Man says he doesn’t respect them at all.Similarly, when the Avengers arrived in DC Universe, they were shocked and in awe of how futuristic the DC Universe is, and surprised how beloved the super heroes are, compared to the Marvel universe where everyone hates mutants and blames super heroes for destruction.Captain America is furious about this because he believes that Justice League are treating the civilians like public. He believes they are treated like Gods, and believes that superheroes should protect people’s freedoms, not demand people’s adoration.on one hand, I do understand why Super Man is ticked off. It seems that the Avengers aren’t doing their job right. There are so many drug dealers, so many people that are in poverty, so many people that are corrupt. He believes that the Avengers aren’t doing their job to the fullest ability. But the issue is that the Marvel universe is more cynical than DC Universe. The public hate the mutants because they’re not normal, they’re like abomination. But in the DC universe, everyone accepts superheroes.And for captain America, I understand why he’s ticked off. His ideals are that everyone should have equal rights and be treated equally. He believes that being a superhero is for people to not be scared for them. He believes that being a superhero will help the civilians be at ease so they won’t be afraid of danger, because they know the Avengers will arrive. He doesn’t agree with you should be a super hero because of the public will adore you. That’s not what being a superhero is about. It’s about saving people, not making you popular. He doesn’t like how, in his perspective, the Justice League are like fascists, and they are considered Gods.In conclusion, people prefer Marvel because they have characters that are more relatable. People prefer DC because they have characters that inspire you. But there shouldn’t be which one’s better or not. I mean, if DC and Marvel super heroes can hang out, I am pretty sure Marvel and DC fans could hang out.",75 followers,Pavel Šefl,9.9K,141,453.7K,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-evidence-that-the-US-government-is-keeping-highly-advanced-technology-under-wraps

Nothing lasts forever. Egyptian civilization peaked early, so it is to be expected that it would drop off and other civilizations would move into the vanguard of history, leaving Egypt as representing the vanguard of an earlier era.The long answer: Egyptian civilization has been called “the Gift of the Nile” and it is the Nile river that defined Egyptian civilization during its greatest period. The area immediately adjacent to the Nile was annually flooded and so was excellent agricultural land; beyond this, Egypt was a desert. So the civilization of ancient Egypt grew along the river, supported by the multiple crops possible each year because of the fertility of the lands along the river. Egyptian civilization grew up at a time when there was little competition from other civilizations. There was trade (lapis lazuli, for example, comes from Afghanistan), which was a stimulus, but no peer states with which Egypt had to battle regularly. So Egypt was primarily limited by its geographical circumstances, but not by being crowded around by rivals. As one of the earliest great civilizations in the region, Egypt was a model to other peoples as well as drawing in trade and commerce through its success. Egypt exploited these natural advantages to the fullest extent, growing large and powerful.Egypt was the only civilization in the region to survive the crisis of 1200 BC (attacks by the mysterious “sea peoples” who brought other civilizations in the region to an end), and, as the sole surviving civilization in the region, in the period post-1200 BC Egypt was once again an example and a model to other peoples. But Egyptian civilization didn’t change much, so as new forms of religion and new forms of governance grew up around them, they maintained their ancient religion and their ancient political institutions. These institutions could not compete with the growing power of rivals in the Mediterranean, so it was no surprise that Egypt was defeated by Rome ( remember the whole story of Antony and Cleopatra?) and become the Roman province of Egypt in 30 BC. There were some lingering traces of Egyptian culture after that, but Egypt as a political institution or a military power, as an independent state, was over once they were conquered by Rome.As Roman power in Egypt faded and was handed off to Byzantium (the Eastern Roman Empire), Islam eventually moved into North Africa and took over former Roman possessions in North Africa, but here, again, the center of the civilization was in Baghdad, not in Alexandria or Cairo (nor in Luxor), so this wasn’t Egyptian civilization in the proper sense of the term. Interestingly, Egypt once again become a power in the Middle Ages under the Mamluks, but this was an Islamic civilization that was quite different from ancient Egypt, and cannot be considered a revival of Egypt in the sense of reviving its ancient culture or institutions.The Mamluks remained more or less in power (there were struggles with the Ottoman Empire) until the French under Napoleon in 1798 conquered Mamluk Egypt, and from that time Egypt was a colony of western nation-states until Egypt itself became an independent nation-state in 1953. As a nation-state Egypt has never had especially strong institutions, and has experienced repeated crises that have prevented the country from being among the peaceful and prosperous nation-states of the world. However, Egypt still to this day (i.e., from the Middle Ages to the present), is considered to be the intellectual center of the Islamic world. Islamic scholars look to the ancient universities of Egypt for intellectual leadership. This intellectual leadership is, again, a matter of Islamic civilization, and does not trace any of its institutions or its culture to ancient Egyptian civilization.",0 followers,Alexander Ramsbottom,520,64,1.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-close-are-we-to-developing-advanced-technology-like-force-fields-ray-guns-etc

That is why, ever since 1959,The insurmountable obstacle, however, still is making the correct connections to the millions of spinal nerve axons -Some readers have suggested nanotechnology, and I think it needs to be addressed, even if it is science fiction at the moment. So, even in 30 or 50 years, for nanotechnology to work, it would still come with a number of steep requirements: the nanites will have to be able to recognize and map the different severed neuronal axons, communicate their findings either to a central processing unit or to each other for collective (hive) processing and then grab and move around the matched axons in order to try to seal them together. The issue of filling the gaps between remote matches will have to be addressed, as well as how toFor example, at the other end of this there will be the problem of excess heat.

The silicon chip that is the heart of the computer and so many of the imaging and other devices used in medicine was discovered in 1952.An illustrative example from my experience of what science can do for the sick. In 1959 I was a medical officer in a village hospital near Krishnagiri, in South India. In the nearby small town called Pochampalli, there was a popular young doctor. One day he felt unwell. Suddenly it struck him that he has not been passing urine for a couple of days. He rushed to the nearby town of Vellore where there was a missionary-run medical college and an attached modern hospital. The diagnosis was renal shutdown. He was given the best treatment available but he passed away within a month. Today his story would have been different. He would have been put on three times a week renal dialysis and as soon as a suitable donor was available, he would have received a renal transplant. There would have been no dent in his natural life span.The opening sentence in the chapter on Hodgkin’s disease in Baily and Love textbook of surgery I used as an undergraduate was, ‘the diagnosis of Hodgkin’s disease is a sentence of death’. Now the cure rate in early cases of the disease is 100%.Cancer breast early cases are regularly cured. A heart attack is not as life-threatening as it once was. The patent receives a prick in the groin, and the cardiologist imaging the patient’s heart on the screen places as many stents as needed to open up and keep open his heart’s arteries. The list of what a few years ago was not even dreamt but are now commonplace is long.A brief look into two significant improvements wrought by science and two by technology will give one an idea of how medicine has changed.Antibiotics are one of the important scientific discoveries of medicine. The material produced from one living thing killing another is antibiosis, and the agents responsible are antibiotics. (One living thing helping another is symbiosis. Symbiotics have yet to appear. It may in the future.)In 1952 when I entered the wards after completing anatomy and physiology my colleagues and I noted a strange ward ritual every day. An attendant from the pharmacy will come to the ward to deliver a bunch of vials and the assistant doctor of the unit who would be eyeing for his arrival will receive the vials eagerly and with great reverence. It was the day’s supply of penicillin vials for the ward. Penicillin first used during the last years of World War II was available worldwide but was a scarce commodity. Then considered a miracle drug it received the respectful treatment it deserved.The discovery of antibiotics was not a scientific breakthrough. Penicillin, as is well known, was an accidental discovery made in 1928. Fleming, its discoverer, initially thought of it not as a miracle drug but as a useful substance in bacteriological labs to keep out unwanted bacteria from growing in cultures. Its use for treating bacterial infection had to wait a dozen years and a world war. But the discovery of other antibiotics was science through and through.Scientists immediately surmised that the fungus was producing an antibacterial substance to fight competition from bacteria in their natural environment. If one fungus could do that there should be others too that are producing such substances. This proved to be true. A frantic search was on and soon streptomycin came into use. Whereas penicillin was effective mostly in Gram-positive bacteria streptomycin was effective on the dreaded bacteria producing tuberculosis.Soon more antibiotics started appearing, many were new and some were existing ones that were scientifically modified to expand their bacterial spectrum. Doctors thought that they were seeing the end of bacterial diseases. One popular professor of ours declared in open class that VD no longer meant venereal disease but vanishing disease. Then something strange happened. Bacteria fought back. They started developing resistance to antibiotics. Seventy years on and venereal diseases far from disappearing are flourishing. Science has its limitations.Insulin as a treatment for diabetes is one of the great medical discoveries. Banting’s isolation of insulin in 1922 was in itself not science, but identifying lack of insulin as the cause of diabetes and tracing the origin of insulin to groups of cells in the pancreas was pure science. For long insulin had to be extracted from animals. Now we have an alternate source. Surprisingly it is a bacterium that is at the centre of this miracle. Scientists have altered the genome of the bacterium E coli to produce insulin. This is genetic engineering, the highest and purest form of science. If insulin can be produced in labs in culture flasks, then large quantities will be available affordably for the millions of the world’s sufferers. This is not to be. Insulin continues to be high priced. Corporations can easily hijack science. Another limitation of science—human greedMany technological advances have improved medicine. Imaging our bodies is one of them. The first to appear was X-ray in the closing years of the 19th century. It is holding its own despite the appearance of newer imaging techniques. It is cheap and effective. Its modern offshoot the CT scan has wide applications but such is its effect on neurology and neurosurgery that both of these specialties, especially neurosurgery, have been reborn after the advent of CT scan. Ultrasound and MRI are the others.In our student days, we would hover around the operation theatre when an abdominal case we had discussed was operated on to find out whose preoperative diagnosis was the correct one. That excitement is lost to the modern-day medical student, Thanks to the various imaging techniques the abdomen cannot hold its secrets.Fibreoptics is another miracle application brought on by technology. Gastroscopy, colonoscopy, and bronchoscopy are widely used, and laparoscopy has made scarless abdominal operations a common reality.In our enthusiasm, we should not start believing that science and technology have changed medicine beyond recognition. In many fields, they have, in many others, they have not. Obstetrics and gynaecology, for example, are largely untouched by modernity and it is sobering when we realise that for all the advances in medicine Covid-19 cases are treated today just as they would have been a hundred years ago.","68,788 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-close-are-we-to-developing-advanced-technology-like-force-fields-ray-guns-etc
