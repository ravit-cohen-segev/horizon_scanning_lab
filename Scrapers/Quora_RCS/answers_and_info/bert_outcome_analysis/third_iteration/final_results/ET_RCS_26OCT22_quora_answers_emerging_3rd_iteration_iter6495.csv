You have to measure the rate of progress relative to the existing technology.Second, it is true that the Romans were not great technological innovators. The Romans are often credited as being great technologists and scientists but this is mostly false. The early Romans, before there expansion, were not great technologists at all. They were warriors and merchants. They had no great intellectual tradition. As they expanded, they of course incorporated a lot of nations that did actually have great intellectual traditions. However, the Romans were not very forward looking in terms of science and technology. They valued existing technologies that they could exploit directly, but they did not foster scientific investigation. The classical Roman era was to a some extent a fairly stagnant era intellectually. That may sound surprising given all of the fabulous construction projects, but truthfully those projects were mostly using existing technologies of the nations they had conquered. There was some innovation in building things larger, but the Roman leadership was never particularly thinking about trying to develop new technologies. That was not how they thought.",UNKNOWN,Ashton,856,69,148.5K,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-didn-t-the-Roman-army-evolve-technologically-From-1-to-350-CE-almost-nothing-new-technologically-was-delivered-while-in-the-last-350-years-we-went-from-muskets-to-nukes

2,"Technology tends to evolve exponentially. Gaius Julius Caesar and George Washington lived over 1800 years apart. But if either one of them wanted to journey 200 miles over land, they would have had the same options - walk, ride a horse, or ride in a carriage. The journey would have taken days. By contrast, George Washington and you live only 200 years apart, but you can ride in a car, train, helicopter, or airplane, and get there in just a few hours at the most.

By contrast, you could book a flight now and go from New York to London in under 6 hours.On another level, I am 51 years old. When I was a child, nobody had a personal computer or a cell phone. A large TV was 25 inches. There was no DNA sequencing, and nearly every prescription medicine in use today had yet to be invented. I could go on.The Roman army made use of the technological advances that were available to it. It adopted chain mail and horse armor, used fairly advanced siege engines, and had early signal technology. If someone had invited a working attack helicopter, I’m sure they would have used it too.Your better question is why didn’t the human race advance technology faster. Every discovery builds on the ones before it. Education is more widespread, and we don’t need half our population devoted to farming and basic activities to go on living. There are many other reasons, but none of them involve “the ancient people didn’t want to”.","5,085 followers",Bobby Tatro,3.9K,2.2K,45.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-didn-t-the-Roman-army-evolve-technologically-From-1-to-350-CE-almost-nothing-new-technologically-was-delivered-while-in-the-last-350-years-we-went-from-muskets-to-nukes

5,"Interesting notion. No.Those EMFs you are asking about? They are in the range of electromagnetic spectrum from microwaves down to radio. They are “radiation” in the technical sense of “expanding or moving through space,” but are not “radiation” in the sense you mean—radiation that interacts with living things to cause harm.These EMFs pass through you and keep on going.

Once in a great while, a photon of one is absorbed as heat. The amount of heat is so tiny that, unless you like to climb military radars for a living, your body will never notice, much less adapt, much less die early and contribute to evolution.But it does beg the question, how much of that sort of radiation—the kind that can harm living things and drive evolution—do you think is normal?Right now, February 4th, 2021, a government-run, Internet-connected Geiger counter not too far from where I’m standing is measuring not quite 3,000 gamma ray photons per minute. That’s pretty low, and tells me its measuring the air and that, for example I’m not standing right by it. My body (and yours) generates that many gamma ray photons every few seconds just from the decay of trace amounts of radioactive potassium in my bones, left over from the supernova that made all the heavy elements that formed the Earth.Some of those elements—uranium, for example—exist in the granite of my kitchen countertop, and I know from direct measurement that it’s about four times as “radioactive” as the background where I’m standing, or about twice as “radioactive” as say, me.But that’s nothing. There are places in Iran, Brazil, and India, where the soils are so rich in thorium the locals are exposed to ten times as much radiation as I am when I go in the kitchen in my underwear to cook eggs. That radiation does enter the bodies of people in those areas and it does damage there cells—we know this because the body’s cellular radiation repair machinery leave detectable traces, and they tell us people in these areas are busy at work repairing radiation damage.But you know what we don’t see? In these people chronically exposed to ten times the radiation as the rest of us? Nothing. They don’t have higher rates of cancer or anything else that we can detect…so that pretty much garantees the rest us should just chill the hell out about nuclear power already and accept it’s vital role in getting rid of coal—which kills hundreds of thousands of people per year and oh, by they way, is the single biggest source of radioactive radon gas for most people—are very real and measurable cause of cancer.But all of this is nothing. All this background radiation, the potassium in our bones, the uranium in our countertops, the thorium in our soils—it’s all still with use because it has a half life measured in billions of years. And that means when life first appeared on this planet some 3.4–3.8 billion years ago, it was a dramaticallyHere’s the takeaway:","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,742,6.8K,91.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-didn-t-the-Roman-army-evolve-technologically-From-1-to-350-CE-almost-nothing-new-technologically-was-delivered-while-in-the-last-350-years-we-went-from-muskets-to-nukes
6,"NO. Evolution happens to POPULATIONS over GENERATIONS. In order for EMFs to affect evolution, the EMFs would have to favor a particular group of individuals (population) to have a different number (either more or less) offspring per generation than other groups.The available evidence does not say that is happening. Of course, significant human generated EM fields have only been around since the widespread use of electricity and radio. That is 100 years at the most. For humans, 100 years is only 4 generations. Unless the effect is huge, that is not enough generations to see anything. The effectNO. Evolution happens to POPULATIONS over GENERATIONS.

Unless the effect is huge, that is not enough generations to see anything. The effect is swamped by better nutrition, reduced childhood diseases, birth control, etc.What is more, there is no biological mechanism for the low level EMFs to exert any effect on differential reproduction. The EMFs do not have significant physiological effects, either positive or negative. The energy levels of the radio wave fields are way too low to introduce new mutations, either. Any ionization is stopped at the level of the skin, so they,cannot exert an effect on the sex cells — which is where the mutations have to happen to influence evolution.Finally, the population of humans is so large that,in the absence of an effect that let only 10% of the population or less reproduce, it would take millions of generations for the effect to spread to everyone in the population — become fixed. And fixation is what is required for evolution to be affected.Some people claim, without adequate evidence, that EMFs might affect health over a 60-70 year lifespan. That affects individuals, but it is irrelevant to evolution.","220,628 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,783M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-didn-t-the-Roman-army-evolve-technologically-From-1-to-350-CE-almost-nothing-new-technologically-was-delivered-while-in-the-last-350-years-we-went-from-muskets-to-nukes

8,"I understand your concern, but the mistake you make is to think evolution is ‘supposed’ to go in any particular way. Basics of evolution: the environment favours some variations in genetic makeup more than others. That’s natural selection. ‘Natural’ here just means ‘the environmental conditions, however they come about’.The ‘environment’ doesn’t mean just soil, weather etc. It includes all the life that exists in that place too. Even at the smallest level of difference, for example two kids growing up in a family are in different environments because each is a part of the other’s environment.EI understand your concern, but the mistake you make is to think evolution is ‘supposed’ to go in any particular way.

Even at the smallest level of difference, for example two kids growing up in a family are in different environments because each is a part of the other’s environment.Environment also includes the actions of all the organisms that affect each other and the world around them. For example, beavers greatly affect the environment around them.Putting that together, the changes due to technology, all the things humans do, have had a huge effect on the environment. There are suggestions that EMFs can affect the human nervous system, which could result in memory loss, sleep disturbances, nausea, headaches etc. They may also cause cancers.If this results in people living less effective lives, that is where natural selection plays out. There will be people who are less affected than average, some more affected. Over many generations - many, so too slowly for us to notice in a lifetime- the less affected will become more and more of the population. It isn’t a deviation from where evolution was supposed to go. It is just plain, simple evolution, the effect of the environment on our genetic makeup.",3 followers,Samuel Bateman,1.1K,102,56.4K,2021,https://www.quora.com/From-all-the-EMFs-around-due-to-rapidly-growing-and-widely-dispersed-technology-dont-we-as-humans-evolve-differently-than-were-supposed-to-with-all-the-radiation
