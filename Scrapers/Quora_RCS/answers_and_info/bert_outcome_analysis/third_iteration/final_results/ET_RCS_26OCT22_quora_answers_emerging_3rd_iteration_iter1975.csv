3,"A Tale of Two Local Small BusinessesHere in Tampa there’s a local sandwich shop. It is a half mile from my house. If you start going there, they will smile when you walk in.

If you start going there on a regular basis, they will quickly learn your name and call you by it when you walk in.Additionally, employees will learn the nuances of your taste, your favorite sandwich and just how you like it made.Every time I eat there, even if I spend more money than planned, I feel like I’ve been treated well and my dollars were well spent. There’s never a post-meal bitter taste, figuratively or literally.About a quarter mile from my house is a local convenience store.We commonly refer to it as Hell Mart.The man behind the desk is typically impersonal, listening to sports radio, taking his sweet time to ring you up. Upon checkout, he hands your change back without a smile, word, or any form of amiable human communication.It is unfortunate, because the place was so damn conveniently close.The straw that broke the proverbial camel’s back happened when I went in to buy ice cream from one of these refrigerated bins:(Although the one in question was far more hideous, I can assure you.)Upon grabbing the ice cream bar I realized it had melted, and the entire bin was unplugged.At the counter I said, “Hello - just a heads up. Your ice cream machine was left unplugged. Everything is probably melted or close to it. It probably needs to be replaced.”I’d venture there’s standard protocol response in situation: perhaps “Thank you” and a service call to repla...",22 followers,Nishchal Arora,9.5K,131,3.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-business-is-likely-to-boom-in-the-upcoming-years-excluding-technology-based-businesses

No hard work and no struggle.

9,"Not like the old battleships, but we might see a return of Guns in a bit larger platforms, specially to support land forces. It is more likely we see Cruiser sized Nuclear ships with a couple of those guns.. I cannot see realistically ships carry 9 or 12 of large caliber railguns on the next 20 years.","105,665 followers",Dave Consiglio,546,6.8K,91.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-business-is-likely-to-boom-in-the-upcoming-years-excluding-technology-based-businesses
10,No. They won’t be called battleships. There will be no more battleships. At this point the railgun does not appear to be the decisive weapon around which a platform is built. Missiles are that weapon.I doubt that we’ll see any non carrier surface ships with nuclear power due to logistics considerations. It’s more practical to build high current ships as the Zumwalt class was built.,3 followers,Mark Bradford,12.8K,579,2.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-business-is-likely-to-boom-in-the-upcoming-years-excluding-technology-based-businesses
11,"It is unlikely.First, such a ship might very well come in at a cost bracket comparable to a smaller super carrier.But it can do only one thing that justifies it:Shoot railguns.And considering that rail guns are not a weapon that revolutionizes anything but is only, maybe, able to deliver kinetic power at a mid range cheaper than missiles or aircrafts but with worse accuracy. A rail gun projectile travelling at Mach 6 still needs 2 and a half minutes to reach out to 200 km, enough time for maneuvering sufficient to make them miss.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,4.1K,5.6K,427.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-business-is-likely-to-boom-in-the-upcoming-years-excluding-technology-based-businesses
