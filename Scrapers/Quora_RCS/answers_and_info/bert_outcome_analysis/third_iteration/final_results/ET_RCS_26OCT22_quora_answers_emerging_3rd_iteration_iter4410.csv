They helped secure the Revolution after the 1812 defeat, but sadly helped prolong the American Civil War half a century later.The British knew of these technologies, but seriously underestimated them and never applied them themselves. Ironically, they had contributed to them considerably in the past, but had abandoned their development, because of their obvious disadvantages.Food preservation technologyThere are several examples of food preservation technology that had been developed during the eighteenth century from experiments combining several different traditional French and German technologies (e.g. fermentation, pickling, mollassing, and cook&seal) with several different Native American technologies (e.g. Jerky), and even some African American ones (nutritious alcoholic fruit mush a.k.a “Hooch”).The results of these experiments gave the American Colonial Patriots a considerable advantage over the British Army, that made very little use of preserves. The British rank and file didn’t like the often tasteless or foul smelling American preserves. The British commanders therefore wrongly deemed them of no nutritional value and of no use in the field. A mistake that would cost them the American Colonies.Especially the protein-rich preserved meats, and the sugar-rich and iron-rich molasses varieties mixed with tasteless flour cakes were formidable weapons of war.The British commanders anticipated the colonials’ advantage of being supplied by the local population, but failed to reckon with the possibility of highly nutritious preserves that lasted longer than a year (!).Small hidden encampments without cooking fires were spotted too late, as most preserves were consumable without cooking them first. Sieges took too long. Small cut-off and isolated pockets of rebel resistance were bypassed, and not engaged. Strategic and tactical calculations proved all wrong. But worst of all: the British started experiencing food shortages themselves, resulting in quite a few Bread Mutinies, and diseases of malnutrition.Then there were the “Jerky Snipers”The French allies appreciated the value of colonial preserves, but hated the taste of it. They started their own experiments with cook&seal, that led to the taste-conserving preservation technology of the FrenchmanSniping technologyBeef Jerky was an important part of sniping technology. It made the sniper team into an autonomous self-sufficient long range mobile unit. But the sniper rifle gave it its teeth. Ironically the German-designed rifled musket had been in use by the British Army since the mid 1700’s and were still in use at the time of the 1776 colonial war, by theReloading the British version took however four times as long as it took a standard army issue smooth-bore. The barrel had to be cleaned between discharges, to prevent soot from clogging up the rifling grooves. Also, the bullet couldn’t simply be dropped down the barrel, but had to be forced down with a rod, as it had to fit tightly.The British version proved especially cumbersome as it sported the prescribed “line length” barrel, which was long enough for the aiming second firing line to pass through the reloading first fire line. Since a couple of decades already, American hunters had been carrying German-designed versions with a much shorter barrel, thus shortening the reloading time by half, and improving the balance and aim. They didn’t have a first firing line buddy to deal with. It had the length of a walking stick, so from a distance, British sentinels often didn’t recognise it as a fire-arm held butt-on-ground by a handful of colonials that didn’t seem part of an organised military unit.The French allies used them as well, and took many of these rifles home after the Revolutionary wars.

Dillin’s 1924 best-selling book I’m afraid is one of the many post-WW1 pseudo-historical works commissioned in order to defend the US Army’s argumentation in favour a large standing army.

But, there are lots of little problems:My model solves all that.Everyone has a supercomputer in their pockets now. Great!I have a program that's free to download. Let's call it ""TeachMe"". You can access it on the web, too, so you don't have to go mobile. But mobile is what makes this tick, as you'll see:I want to learn something, so I tell the app:""I want to learn about algorithms.""I live in a town of 100, 000 people. I'm going to guess that, at 5:14pm on a Thursday night, in a town of 100, 000 people, there's someone here who can teach me about algorithms.The app identifies that person. There are probably many people. It will ask the most optimal one first:""Can you teach Ian Smyth about algorithms?""If that person says yes, then bam. The app then connects us to a physical location, such as a library study room, for a specific time, for an hour.The details in there can be worked out: maybe I set a time when I ask (Here's where my model really shines:It costs $20 for one hour. Consider it ""tutoring"". The teacher makes $15, and we make $5.The class, however, isThe class is pushed out to people who might be interested. They have until 30 minutes before class starts to confirm whether they're going or not.If all 5 people attend in total, then each person pays $4.If 10 people attend, each person pays $2.If 20 people attend, that class on algorithms for one hour costsWhen it's over, students rate the teacher, like how an Uber driver is given stars. The higher the rating, the more push notifications that teacher is going to get. The lower the rating, the less they'll get. At some point, their rating will be so low that they won't get any notifications asking them to teach.Then, they don't teach. And bad teachers are eliminated.They could always ask to be taught how to teach, however. Guaranteed somebody can help them out with that.The beauty of this is that, no matter what you're looking to learn,We also build in a function that tracks your progress in classes. It ""builds"" disciplines of knowledge, like stacking blocks.""Intro to Algorithms"" is stacked as a one hour block. This serves as your resume. If you make it public, any employer can see it. In fact, we can connect employers to relevant profiles automatically.That means you don't want to worry aboutYou simply learn things you want to know more about.We connect you to someone who can teach it, for $15 an hour (and we take the other $5).Others are sent a notification, and the price is split between those who are going. The location is adjusted accordingly.You gain personalized learning from someone whoThe class you took is added on as a block to your profile.You can jump right in to a topic:""I want to learn about General Relativity.""Without having to do all the math first.If you really like it, then you can start to work backwards.""I want to learn about Calculus.""We close ourselves off to anHow will I know I like Physics once I get past mechanics!? Why would I ""pick"" any program if I didn't know whether I'd actually like it or not 4 years later!?We'reChildren don't say:""Mother, father. I'm going to spend four years doing math now, and only math. I've decided, this is who I am going to be.""What the hell?But that's what 18 year olds actually do!Children!They. Are. Children.I am a child! I am 20! I have the UNIVERSE to explore!One curiosity will lead to an interest. Which will lead to a thousand more.My model ensures that you can explore all those interests, get help from people who can actually teach, engage with others who also want to learn the same thing, get accredited for learning it by having blocks on your profile, and network with others who could potentially pay you for the value you're learning!My model is all aboutWe don't need more engineers. We don't need more artists. We don't need more scientists.We need more people who will follow their curiosities, practice their interests, and connect fields that others wouldn't have even thought to connect.We need those people to feel secure in that what they're learning is recognized by others (unlike online courses).We need those people to be able to learn with others, and have someone who can actually teach help them out.We need to take the segregation of learning and throw it down a hole to Hell.I don't care if I'm taught a class by a 12 year old, because if he/she actually knows what they're talking about,I'm working on this model right now. I know there are difficulties in the infrastructure. Specifically, how do we connect to rooms? We need a way to automatically book them.Ideally, I would take the $5 revenue and build our own centres. People would be connected there. The rooms could move automatically to accommodate a class that grows in size over the hour.We could include other rooms aimed at providing space and resource so people canWe could have cafe's so people could go eat, talk, and laugh with one another after hour long classes.I think that if this system is implemented properly, education would become totally democratic. Nobody would care if you have a degree. All they'd care about is whether you have knowledge, and skills in applying that knowledge, so you can do certain jobs. Those jobs will change and fluctuate due to supply and demand, and so can the types of things you learn.I have ways to make it free, too. We could implement 360 degree cameras in all the lecture rooms, and anyone could access the lecture as an ""online"" course. Therefore, you're only really paying for the additional benefit of learning in person, if you do go. I know 20 people will go forYou could access those real time lectures through VR/AR. Smart contact lenses. Anything!If AI got smart enough, we could even link people to lecture rooms taught by holographic, computer generated ""teachers"" whose algorithms could determine the optimal way to teach specific people, as we all learn completely differently.My model lowers the risk of getting an educationIf it took off, universities would die. Thankfully.Or, perhaps they would become ""research"" centres. That's already what they are.Isn't it insane that a researcher takes the position of a teacher? What kind of logic is that?Someone who canThis is really straightforward stuff. That's what I love about it, it's just really straightforward.For all those who would say:""But what about homework?""""What about assignments?""""How do we measure their learning?""You DON'T! Stop thinking that's something you should be doing.If someone loves something, they will do it and practice it. When they feel confident enough to do it as work for someone else, then they will interview for that position. Or, that employer will reach out to them.For one person, learning calculus might take 5 months. For someone else, it might take four weeks.Everyone. Is. Different.We can work in ways to have assignments and projects for classes. AI can help us optimally find the best way to do that too. In fact, based on your ability, AI could determine the most optimal way to have you move forward with your learning via an assignment or project.Honestly, this model just really excites me.It's something that I want to see exist.I want to go learn about algorithms right now.I want to just jump in, and test the waters.I want to see if I'd love it.I'll know fairly quickly whether I will or not.I don't want to spend $500 to find out.And that doesn't mean I want a degree in it.TeachMe.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,1.3K,5.6K,427.1M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-were-examples-of-new-technology-used-in-the-Revolutionary-War

Did the early Sumerian innovators say - ""boys here is how you have to cultivate wheat"" and proceed on a 4 year lecturing marathon?In the modern days, when we think of education, we think of that lecture hall with a podium where the preacher, oops teacher, stands and a row of benches where obedient, attentive students listen to the sermon without question.What did the online education companies do? They ""revolutionized"" the whole process by recording the lectures & putting the podium on the Internet. Phew, problem solved. They copied a broken, outdated, expensive system without any thought to changing the process or format.  No wonder their engagement and graduation rates are so low.Traditionally, humans learned through three activities: 1) Observing, 2) Doing and 3) Talking. Imagine an early human learning pottery. He would seen a potting master do the art. After observing that he would try to get his hands on and then converse with the master and the other folks doing the same. Eventually, he will master pottery by observing, doing and talking - finetuning along the way.A class completely run on WhatsAppI have done a number of experiments in teaching both online and offline in the past and one of the most promising experiments for me was to teach almost completely on Whatsapp with Trello as the content sharing tool. I conducted two of these classes early last year - Jan and Fed that each went over a month long.I organized a class of about 40 into a central Whatsapp group and then also had 6 more groups of 6-7 people each. They were in 3 different continents and hardly anyone knew other before. The goal was to build the learning purely by observations, doing and talking.The students were given exercises everyday and have to complete, demonstrate and talk about it. Others observe, learn and then fine-tune.These classes were the most engaging of anything I have seen and it was hard as an instructor to keep up with the mindboggling variety of ideas of the students. This is just a starting point.Online education has to go way beyond lectures and have these for less than 10% of the activities. While it is tempting to records hours and hours of lectures & distribute it, the effectiveness is even lesser than it is in a classroom.The tools should primarily focus on strongly facilitating interactions in","1,610 followers",Thanos Papangelis,1.5K,0,0,2016,https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-use-technology-to-create-an-effective-alternative-to-the-current-system-of-higher-education-such-that-engagement-and-outcomes-are-closer-to-or-better-than-what-we-see-with-traditional-education

You'd never guess that in a million years from his track record as a technology executive and innovator. I asked him about that one day.His dad was a professor of English as a major university. Mid-way through the first semester of his second year he came home, flummoxed because he needed to file a degree plan. He asked his dad for help.His dad (who was a great guy, and also a friend of mine) said ""Well, when you graduate, do you want toMy friend pondered, and said ""Have an education"". His dad nodded, and said ""then take whatever the hell you want to take, it'll all sort itself out over time"".That's still very true. I love to see young people come in all fired up about ""I""m gonna get a degree in X because then I can Y"" only to discover that the stuff that really goes into X blows chunks for them, and that there's this really much more interesting thing going on over in this other department.The problem is - and the reason that we're having discussions like this broadly - is that employers have outsized expectations about what a college degree should mean. Particularly in technology, where many interpret a degree in Computer Science as meaning ""ready to and capable of solving any deterministic problem in the programming language of my choice in what I think is a reasonable amount of time"" as opposed to the much more realistic ""capable of doing some programming, fairly familiar with the underlying theory that makes it possible and its application in a few cases touched on in class"".See that disconnect? It's pervasive. It's toxic. To the companies that hold that view, to the students in a panic trying to make sure that it doesn't apply to them, and to the educational process.Anyway, you want alternatives, I'll give you an alternative. This isn't even my idea. Unfortunately, I can't recall the author, although I believe it wasStop treating school as an educational medium. Recognize that it's a life-skills and socialization institution.  Move the ""information transfer"" portion to on-line, augmented by social group discussion of the concepts and potentially broader applications.The role of professors shifts - it's about facilitating collaborative work in social groups to discuss what all this stuff means, rather than pounding data into people's heads. If they don't self-pound the data in, there's nothing for them to discuss, and they get excluded until they demonstrate otherwise.But make the higher education experience about learning life lessons - the value of showing up and participating, getting along with people you've never met and might not like while doing projects, managing your time, managing your money. And along the way, make available a vast array of information, delivered using on-line technology, in bite-sized chunks, with frequent stop-and-check quizes, amplified by social groups for discussion and experimentation.You'll wind up with much more well rounded individuals, much more capable of coping with life after college, who along the way learned much more than they do in the current regime because the feedback changes from grades on homework (which still happens, on-line) to real-time in discussions with their peers, and mentors.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,3.6K,996,156M,2016,https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-use-technology-to-create-an-effective-alternative-to-the-current-system-of-higher-education-such-that-engagement-and-outcomes-are-closer-to-or-better-than-what-we-see-with-traditional-education

8,"The current/traditional system of higher education could well be described as an expensive, on-campus, classroom styled, cohort organised, professor centric, seat-time structured and curriculum based learning system. This system requires the student to learn and understand a specialised core canon of information from generally paper-based textbooks. Understanding must then be demonstrated via the production of mostly text-based assessments to a standard that satisfies the requirement of a particular educational institution.

This system requires the student to learn and understand a specialised core canon of information from generally paper-based textbooks. Understanding must then be demonstrated via the production of mostly text-based assessments to a standard that satisfies the requirement of a particular educational institution. In meeting this standard, the student secures the institution's academic award.If we look at the impact that technology could play on each aspect of this definition, we may well discover an effective alternative. But first ...Let it be said right at the start, that the current/traditional system of higher education has served well the needs of an industrial age, where graduates acquired “know what"" knowledge to carry out specialist roles and functions that were logical, controlled and cumulatively sequenced.So education institutions became the learning factories of the industrial age and synced their output to the specialised needs of that age. In doing so they also imbibed the industrial age's efficiency mantra and organised students into age-related cohorts where knowledge was taught to students collectively, following the same sequence and delivered from the same geographic place. This bureaucratic, one-size-fits-all industrial age product became primarily focused on the industrial age's 'efficiency of production' mantra, which generally took precedence over the individual student's needs.But the world has changed .... and it has changed fundamentally in a way that many describe as a new age.In today's age, 'change and innovation' rather than 'stability and structure' is the new norm, making many of our industrial age skills now redundant. This matrix below shows the progress of our changing human society and the significant change that is now taking place as our society transitions from the Industrial Age to the current Information/Conceptual age.In this ever-changing 21st century Knowledge/Conceptual age, students need far more than to ‘know what’ to do in specialist roles and functions. They need to be able to use knowledge as a resource to build something new, rather than see acquired knowledge/understanding as an end in itself. Students need to be able to create new knowledge with their 'know-what' knowledge and so be able to use higher-order thinking to apply, analyse, synthase, evaluate and create.In the Information/Conceptual age, students need to master the Internet/mobile technologies to then creatively use knowledge to build new knowledge that is shared and enhanced by their engagement with global/virtual networks.There is no doubt in my mind that the advent of the Internet, coupled with mobile technologies, has fundamentally changed the way we learn in the same way that microwave ovens changed the way we cooked, TVs changed the way we entertained ourselves, ATMs changed the way we engaged with banks and how MP3's playing digital recordings changed the way we listened to music.So looking once more at each of the aspects of the current/traditional system of higher education described previously, I will look at how technology could be used to create an effective alternative:""Increasingly we’ll see location-based services utilised as a key learning tool in higher education.

One of the main functions of a college is that of an employment agency.  You can get access to all of the courses in a college, and you can teach yourself to know as much as any college graduate.  The problem is that you don't get things like the alumni network, career services, and the branding that helps you get the job that you need to pay off your high tuition.Also, much of the purpose of going to college is so that you learn the college culture, and a lot of social skills that needed for a job.But it's not out of the question that you can somehow replicate that online.  The second function of a college is that of ""young adult babysitters"" and that seems to be really, really difficult to replicate online.  A lot of online institutions deal with the problem by not even trying.  You have to babysit a 20 year old.  You don't have to babysit a 40 year old, and if you have an online system that's targeted toward 40 year old business executives, you don't have to worry about things that you do with 20 year old undergraduates.College is a place where 18-21 can do stupid things in a safe environment.  One of the first things that I learned in college was ""eat your vegetables.""  My mother always forced me to eat my vegetables at home, and when I got to college, I stopped eating my vegetables, and that lasted for about a month, when I get extremely ill, and I learned that I needed to eat vegetables.People aged 18-21 need to learn a lot about things like relationships, sex, drugs, and	alcohol, and part of the reason	parents send their kids off to college is that it gets them out of the house into a safe environment, where people can figure out their lives, and do stupid and crazy things without doing any permanent damage.  There is a lot that can go horribly wrong in the process, and residential colleges have extremely sophisticated monitoring programs where the college can step in.It's not out of the question that some other institution will do this.  US colleges took over the job of ""young adult babysitting"" from the military in the 1960's, but if you actually want to replace a traditional college, you will have to figure out how to do babysitting.",416 followers,Sagar Dhabadgaonkar,7.7K,89,532.2K,2016,https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-use-technology-to-create-an-effective-alternative-to-the-current-system-of-higher-education-such-that-engagement-and-outcomes-are-closer-to-or-better-than-what-we-see-with-traditional-education
