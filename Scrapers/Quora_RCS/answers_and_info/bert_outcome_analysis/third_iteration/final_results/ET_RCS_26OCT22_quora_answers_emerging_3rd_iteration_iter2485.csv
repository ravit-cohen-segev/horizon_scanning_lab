I’ve been writing a lot of similar stories recently, and it’s something I enjoy doing.Mark Pratscher wakes. It is 8:00 AM, February 3rd. The year is 2070, and he has an English class to teach in thirty minutes.Mark sits up, experiencing no drowsiness. Last night, he had taken a pill that contained all of his necessary hormones, specifically coordinated to his schedule. Mark’s digital shadow (an advanced version of a digital assistant like Siri) ensured that he fell asleep on time by adding melatonin to his bloodstream. Now, it has woken him up with cortisol, a neurotransmitter that wakes him naturally from sleep.Mark sighs contentedly and looks around the clean room. He has an important class today, one that he’s been preparing for a few days. Despite the severe weather outside, he will have no trouble teaching it. Mark stands up and walks downstairs, where his breakfast is waiting. Though he lives alone, Mark has several robots that do much of the cleaning and cooking.He sits down at the table and flips open his phone, which rapidly expands into a tablet. His class plan sits by the edge of the screen, reminding him to be teaching in twenty-five minutes. He ignores it and starts reading his personalized feed, which has collected all of his relevant news and information. The feed details some of the larger world events and he is briefly interested in a few of them: “Israel’s new fleet is days from reaching Mars! Here’s what you should know.”He mostly focuses on the posts from his friends, however, writing a nice comment to his friend Chloe who just earned her teaching license in history. He skims the rest of the news but finds an interesting editorial about the effects of digitizing historical monuments. “Hmm…” he says aloud, reading. The article raises an interesting point about how virtual tourism has finally surpassed real tourism and some of the unintended consequences. Mark checks to make sure it’s been written by a human and then adds it to his notes as something to discuss during class if he has the chance.A soft vibrating sound disturbs his thoughts a few seconds after he finishes the article. His digital assistant is reminding him of the time. “Whoops,” Mark says. He had lost track of time, immersed in the article and his breakfast. Only five minutes until class starts.Mark hurriedly sets aside his plates and walks to his VR setup, which is by far the most important room in the house and somewhere he will spend most of his day. He steps inside the room, activates the switch, and closes the door.The room is about twenty feet by twenty feet, and contains a large array of sensors as well as a giant treadmill built into the floor. This single room is Mark’s link to the outside world, and while it is not as advanced as it could be, it is quite impressive. Mark looks around at the gleaming metal, and then powers on his headset. It is time to start teaching.Several things happen as Mark puts on the headset. Six cameras glow to life and began tracking his movements through a laser technology called LIDAR. A treadmill starts up silently beneath him and subtly moves him to the center of the room in the optimal tracking position.The headset glows to life as it detects his face and displays his environment: a beautifully rendered library. He’d logged off there last night.Mark looks around, realizes where he is, and then starts jogging to class, passing doors to other classes. He could teleport, but he enjoys the feel of walking and knows that he needs the exercise.The treadmill moves smoothly beneath his feet as he changes directions, and he nearly bumps into a student with bright pink hair. “Hi Mr. Pratscher!” she exclaims. He chuckles. “Good to see you, Julia.” A microphone located on his headset picks up his voice and sends it to Julia. Mark has never met Julia in real life, of course, but she is still a favorite student of his and writes exceptional essays.Mark finally reaches class, a few minutes early. Most of the students are already there, chatting and discussing ideas. It is a diverse class, with kids from India, Russia, and the United States. Several of them speak another language, but translation technology is so good that Mark never notices. There are about fifteen kids total, all perfectly matched to his teaching style and excited to learn. It is an ideal environment to teach in.“Alright class,” Mark says. “We’ve been doing a lot of academic study of early 17 and 18th century England and I figured we could use a bit of a break from analyzing writing style and so forth. To truly understand a writer like Jonathan Swift, and especially his writing, you need to consider the environment he lived in. And it turns out…” Mark gestures to the back of the room, masked by a curtain, “that there is a complete simulation of England and Ireland in 1729! You all remember why I chose the year 1729, right?”Mark looks around at the class, and an Indian teenager raises his hand to answer. “It’s the year Jonathan Swift wroteMark nods. “Absolutely right, Sahil. Bonus point for the initiative.” The teenager grins as his digital shadow adds a point to his grade. “Now,” Mark continues. “Let’s head inside and explore the life of Dr. Jonathan Swift.”The class steps through the curtain, Mark Pratscher in the lead, and walks the streets of Northern Ireland to Swift’s house. A few students note inaccuracies in the simulation, for which Mark awards points. “If we have time, I might assign an essay for anyone willing to detail the inaccuracies and send a report to the simulation designers. You could probably make a bit of money doing that.” Mark notes.The class continues to explore, and Mark continues to teach in his casual, exploratory manner, pointing out key details and holding a class discussion as they walk. The class moves through Ireland and then to England, finally stopping to discuss the era as a whole. Soon, class time is running out and the material is covered.At the end of the class, Mark leads the students back to the curtain and steps through to his classroom. “Alright students.” he says. “That’s all I have for you today. If you have time, do some extra reading on Swift’s other works. Some of the other teachers have let me know that they’ll be doing persuasive writing in a few days, and this would be an excellent example of such a work. Feel free to write me if you need advice. Until then… see you next time!”The students smile and wave as they leave. Mark has a brief discussion with two of them about formatting an edit to the simulation. With his advice in mind, the two students leave his classroom and Mark finds himself alone. He has a few hours before teaching again in the evening, and it’s just about lunchtime.Mark reaches up for his headset and takes it off gently. As he places it down on a table, he smiles. Rationally, Mark knows he just spent the last three hours walking around on a treadmill and talking to thin air. However, he also knows that the students will benefit from his teaching and that they have learned skills in his class that they will carry around for the rest of their lives.He smiles again, turns off the VR setup, and heads to his simple kitchen. There is a lot going on in the greater world: intelligent AI is making waves, spacecraft are reaching other planets, and it is negative thirty degrees outside.To Mark, though, none of that matters. He is simply happy to have his students, the technology that lets him teach more effectively, and some great food.Mark may be teaching in a virtual world, but that does not make his joy any less real.","56,973 followers",Flavian Mwasi,1.9K,678,73.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Will-the-most-advanced-technology-bring-us-happiness-Why

The Middle Kingdom considered itself the middle of the universe and the emperor considered himself the middle of the middle!He therefore lacked interest in outside trade because he felt the kingdom already had all the resources and technology it needed to satisfy his wildest imaginations.ConcubinesAnd like the emperor, we should ask ourselves…To reflect on this question, sit on Daddy’s lap, and let me tell you a story about a Chinese farmer and a Western businessman…The Fisherman and The BusinessmanA businessman took a short vacation to a small Chinese coastal village. Unable to sleep he walked the pier. A small boat with just one fisherman had docked and inside the boat were several large tuna.“Only a little while”“Why don’t you stay out longer and catch more fish?”“I have enough to support my family and give a few to friends,”“But …. What do you do with the rest of your time?”The fisherman looked up and smiled,The businessman laughedThe fisherman asked“15- 20 years, 25 tops”“But what then?”The businessman laughed and said“Millions? Then what?”The businessman replied,Where this anecdote can be misleading is it presumes theBut what if the businessman continued by saying,The fisherman must then eitherThis would make the anecdote more historically accurate.Because if the Chinese fisherman was a metaphor forThis is also true for today.If a country or corporation becomes too satisfied then they’ll eventually be conquered by the competition.But what if there was no competition?If there wasn’t a West then Imperial China would likely still exist. Keep in mind a Chinese person of 1400 A.D. lived a remarkably similar life to a person of 1800 A.D and so it’s conceivable to believe that without the West a Chinese person of 1800 A.D. would live a similar life to a person of 2200 A.D.And life was better for the Chinese when they were stuck in theIn businessIn governmentLet’s go forward in time…I believe the pace of change will eventually slow down as global power continues to centralize into fewer and fewer hands.Eventually the global elite will come together under the premise,Now hopefully this decision will be made by some sort of coalition of democratic nations.Because if it doesn’t happen through democratic consensus then it will happen by dictatorial decree.“Artificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia but for all humankind, whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.” — Vladimir PutinBecause left unabated the race for better A.I. will eventually lead to someone getting the upper-hand and so, for example, the Chinese could unlock an artificial intelligence so powerful it gives them control over all the global satellites and therefore the globe.And then they would build a metaphorical great wall around any further technological development that could threaten their power, and then who knows, the world could slowly devolve back into something that looks a little like Imperial China.And as long as there aren’t any alien forces lurking upon the horizon, technology could stay stopped for a long, long time because the only people who could tear down the wall would be the people guarding it.I hope this answer gives you a greater sense of purpose because we can control how the wall is built. Why should we even build a wall around technology?
