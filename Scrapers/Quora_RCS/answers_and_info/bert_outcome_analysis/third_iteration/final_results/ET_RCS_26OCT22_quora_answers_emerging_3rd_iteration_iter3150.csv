0,"With all the advanced technology dissecting the genome and DNA, why can't we find a cure for coronavirus?DNA checks itself, so this means that replication should be consistent. This can change it the DNA gets damaged and future replication would created mutated copies.RNA does not check itself and is prone to mutation. Coronavirus is an RNA virus. This makes it harder to get to the bit that works.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/With-all-the-advanced-technology-dissecting-the-genome-and-DNA-why-cant-we-find-a-cure-for-coronavirus
1,"The power of science has lead the non-scientist to believe that science can cure anything and everything quickly. That is just not the case.Science is a meticulous process with many dead-ends.

2,"The biggest non-human technological advance is beaver dams and lodges.Beavers put in a lot of effort into creating dams that create ponds. They then build homes (lodges) in or at the pond. The pond provides protection for the lodge. Beavers can easily enter the lodge via an underwater entrance but other animals cannot.Lodges can be substantial, up to 8 feet wide and 3 feet high inside. They are so strong that large animals, like bears, cannot easily break into them. The dams are even bigger, occasionally reaching more than 300 feet in length. The longest one ever measured is 2,790 feet. No aniThe biggest non-human technological advance is beaver dams and lodges.Beavers put in a lot of effort into creating dams that create ponds.

4,"Some animals use tools. Some birds for instance, but this is pure instinct. Some animals use tools that they have modified from other things, and pass on the methods of doing this to their young.

6,"Well… unless the aliens are artificial (i.e. programmed machines), then we had to assume any biological creature evolved on its planet. We then have to assume that it (or its ancestors) had some method to obtain food, defend itself from predators, hunt, enforce social norms (i.e. laws) amongst themselves, etc. All that requires some level of violence. You can’t be willing to kill for food, but not able to kill for other reasons.Now… given a long enough time with technology and being apex creatures, maybe violence can be removed from a species, but like in humans, most complex evolved featuresWell… unless the aliens are artificial (i.e. programmed machines), then we had to assume any biological creature evolved on its planet.

Fairness, empathy, and other emotions are also based on anger and aggression. You see a wrong and you want to correct it. It’s hard to imagine any creature without some potential for violence being able to have other strong emotions, drives, goals, etc.If you can imagine aliens which aren’t violent, then you could also simply imagine aliens which just lack empathy. Like humans stepping on ants, it isn’t that we are violent… we just don’t care. That could be equally worse.",UNKNOWN,Ernest W.

7,"Why do we presume that technology equals enlightened? Or that the term would be understood the same way by an extraterrestrial race that it is here? How do we know they would evaluate intelligence the same way we do? Yes, we postulate that these ideas have some sort of overarching value that all beings could agree on, but we have yet to agree on basic definitions of these things across the cultures of one planet.Violence is a standard reaction among humans to what is different.

12,No animals will ever be able to overcome their need for oxygen. Oxygen is needed to help power many chemical reactions within animal bodies and without it they would die. There is no real way around this. Even plants require some oxygen to live (although they do produce an excess of it some is reabsorbed for respiration) and plants don’t have the high energy requirements that animals do to move around.,"5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-closest-thing-to-an-advanced-technological-society-that-any-animals-have-ever-formed
