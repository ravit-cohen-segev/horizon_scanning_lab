0,"Human extinction will either happen via a disaster or speciation. In the case of speciation, our progeny will inevitably have more advanced technology than we do. In the case of some sort of disaster, I see no reason to assume that the next billion years of recovery won’t involve at least one advanced species.","15,557 followers",Gary Meaney,1.5K,758,23.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/When-humans-eventually-become-extinct-do-you-think-another-species-is-likely-to-evolve-to-a-level-where-they-can-develop-their-own-technologies
1,How long did it take for a sapient species with our technology to evolve? 3.8 billion years. I don’t think you should hold your breath waiting for a new technological species.,"105,672 followers",Dave Consiglio,742,6.8K,91.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/When-humans-eventually-become-extinct-do-you-think-another-species-is-likely-to-evolve-to-a-level-where-they-can-develop-their-own-technologies
2,"2Any primate alive today can evolve to be like us but not be us. Primates have hands. What is is a selective pressure and these selective pressures would have to be very similar to the rise of man. Every condition would have to be met,even the world would have to the same and when the our line branched off the cladogram. Following the same recipe leading to the evolution to ourselves. These creature maybe bipedal and intelligent but they not have a mind set that modern humans. They might have a different mindset, not look the same and decide to remain less technologicall.

It is also that these creature could go extinct because could have never of had the same adaptive mutations that our predecessors had. Maybe they would never discover chow to make fire and confine them a climate that never a cold and frigid climate. Even every environmental condition man evolved along with other creatures and they can evolve in a different path as well, they could out compete us and drive the creatures like an early primate following the same selective pressures as we did. If was an experiment called Trying to re-evolve man, I would call it the game of Chance. The thing about evolution creatures can find different ways to adapt to changes in their environment and taking different courses every time you play and remember mine is money",3 followers,Samuel Bateman,1.1K,102,56.3K,2019,https://www.quora.com/When-humans-eventually-become-extinct-do-you-think-another-species-is-likely-to-evolve-to-a-level-where-they-can-develop-their-own-technologies
3,"Time travel from future to present or past cannot happen in our universe because future didn’t happen yet. It is just speculation in science or math which doesn’t hold to reality. Humans are evolving continuously according to the latitude, longitude and climate they are at. The changes in evolution of humans are hard to see as they take effect in tens of thousands of years because of which it may seem that humans are not evolving.If aliens who have seen humans are from other universes, they may have a different sense of time as their clocks may have started much earlier than our clock which stTime travel from future to present or past cannot happen in our universe because future didn’t happen yet.

They sort of existed before humans were born so they may seem from future. Aliens from other dimensions at present if the other dimensions exist may have same clock compared to humans and are not from future.",4 followers,Dan Bradbury,4.2K,21.7K,235.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/When-humans-eventually-become-extinct-do-you-think-another-species-is-likely-to-evolve-to-a-level-where-they-can-develop-their-own-technologies
4,"Interesting question.My view is none; all the big changes have been brought about by hardwareThese all shaped the software we write, because they each removed a limit on the software weSo jQuery grew swop recognition. Cordova added Camera APIs. Always on broadband has disrupted almost everything, everywhere. TV, Shopping, Taxicabs, Radio, NewspapersI'd be interested to see if innovation could come from the software side?","56,375 followers",Charlie Cheever,5.9K,1.5K,9.4M,2016,https://www.quora.com/When-humans-eventually-become-extinct-do-you-think-another-species-is-likely-to-evolve-to-a-level-where-they-can-develop-their-own-technologies
