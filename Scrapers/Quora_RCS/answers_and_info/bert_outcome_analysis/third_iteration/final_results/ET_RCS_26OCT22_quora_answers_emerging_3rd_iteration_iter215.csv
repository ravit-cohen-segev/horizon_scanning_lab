The question, ‘what’s next’ is a constant in a tech geek’s professional life. When it comes to technology, there is always something fresh and the hunt to develop and implement a new technology that could augment businesses is unyielding. The inquisitiveness to know and seek knowledge about the technology and how it is going to impact the daily lives of the human species.Technology is true, one of the greatest change agents in the present world, and is moving faster than ever before. It has the supremacy to offer innovative solutions to global challenges. The emerging technologies have brought a radical shift in the information, technology and development sector and thereby impacting the other industries along with sales and marketing business segments well. Mapping the imminent technology proposal of the business demands the business leaders to first identify these emerging technology trends. They ought to learn the dynamics of the technology and how it would impact the present and the future of the business.Here are some of the most revolutionary and disruptive emerging technologies:Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence have taken huge leaps in the recent past few years. For example, a business can apply machine learning and offer the consumer a fresh purchasing option, depending on the analysis of the history of the purchasing pattern and taste of the consumer. Machine Learning could be an effective tool for cyber financial frauds. Artificial Intelligence could be a more robust system to combat the new complex cyber-attacks. The ML and AI technologies blend a variety of other skills and expertise such as neural networks, deep learning, and natural language processing. This also includes other statistical concepts to appreciate, learn, forecast, acclimate and potentially function autonomously.Internet of Things (IoT)IoT is seen as the change agent for the luxurious and effective lifestyle for the consumers, offering valuable customer interactions and exceptional experiences for them. IoT is one of the most exciting areas of focus today. The idea revolves around the nano-sensors circulating in the human body or any specific object. Once connected with the technology, this is going to have a proliferating impact on the various sectors such as medicine, agriculture, architecture etc.Blockchain TechnologyBlockchain Technology is the disruptor of the Financial Industry. Mostly espoused by the cryptocurrency industry, today, even the conventional banks have started to clout its usage. The rise of bitcoin industry has raised the ambiguous inquisitiveness of the blockchain technology affecting the emerging markets. The blockchain technology is a digital principled ledger which creates numerous chained blocks of data and ensures sales and marketing resources are focused on the numbers of the business.Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR)The fascinating Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) is the current catchphrase of every technocrat. The AR and VR are potentially remodelling the way consumers interact with each other and the technology, inspiring the growth of pervasive settings. For instance, AR allows the user to blend the real and virtual world. With the help of VR technology, firms can deploy virtual business training and remote involvement. . The technology is also helpful to know in-depth about the changing tastes of the target audience and has immense potential to influence the business strategies.Big DataBig data technology is a very simple and effective concept. An exceptional method to collect, organise and comprehend the data for the benefit of the business. The quantitative output of data-driven analysis is one of the core strengths of big data technology. The Big data technology involves building huge data architectures to organise and analyze the unstructured data and offer real-time value for the business. The vast augmentation of the digital data has enabled not just big, but also the small and medium enterprises to disrupt the power of big-data. This technology with the right expertise would help the business to lower the cost of consumer gaining, augment sales and step into new business markets.Market AutomationEvery entrepreneur and business tycoon must be aware that marketing automation is here to stay. In the present-day scenario, sales and marketing personnel must automate processes in every way possible to offer the best experiences for the consumers. Businesses must leverage the benefits of this exclusive technology to eradicate the human-exclusive tasks. A robust automation tool is tailored to the explicit requirements of the business.The online e-commerce leverages the best of automation technology. An e-commerce industry can use automation technology to understand the customer’s buying cycle and share the right message at the right time. For example, if he or she has left the shopping cart without making a purchase.Cloud ComputingThe market forecast states that in the next five years, 50% of the business organisations and global companies are moving their data to the cloud. This also points that Cloud Computing Technology companies such as Microsoft have greater responsibility to safeguard and secure the consumer valuable data. In the healthcare sector, operations and medical organisations can maintain the patient data, check the status of the patient and offer necessary treatments as and when necessary, without storing the data in the hardcopy of files.Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.","135,477 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-10-emerging-technologies-in-the-next-5-10-years-2020%E2%80%932025

An intelligent algorithm will work “slot-based” intersection, or SI, where cars and infrastructure communicate through an algorithm that choreographs a graceful dance of vehicle platoons through an intersection. “slot-based” scheduling, which is already in use everywhere from air traffic control to business management. The basic idea is that actors in a system are grouped into batches, and the speed of their movement is carefully controlled to move them more efficiently through a space. a sensor-equipped car would need to communicate its trajectory—right, left, or straight—to a central algorithm controlling the intersection, which would group it into a “batch” of other cars going in the same direction. Second, the central software system would need to be able to control the speed of each platoon, using cruise control-style software that already exists in most cars, to limit the speed of your car as it moved through the intersection.ADVANCED AUGMENTED REALITY AND POWERFUL AIAn advanced VR and AR will be developed by 2023 that will analyze crime scene investigations with powerful algorithms to identify and derive possible scenarios and suspects involved within a crime scene. Massive online databases can be accessed in the field, to compare any relevant findings. Facial recognition, combined with online criminal records, allows full instant profiles to be generated on a suspect through an officer's augmented field of vision. New AI programs can identify any suspicious behavior or familiar faces.Fully Autonomous Driverless VehiclesFully automated cars are expected to contribute some 13.7 billion U.S. dollars by 2030 in terms of research testing and development. One in ten vehicles will be self-driving by 2030. Senior citizens will be the ones using this feature the most.DIGITAL BIOLOGYMore-than-exponentially falling costs of DNA sequencing  [ https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Sequencing-Human-Genome-cost ]have ...",256 followers,Priyal Gupta,9.7K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-10-emerging-technologies-in-the-next-5-10-years-2020%E2%80%932025

It is our main weapon in the fight against genetic diseases. Importantly, this technology is getting cheaper, faster and easier to use.Cellular agriculture is just one way to outsource food production. Mankind has already learned how to make meat, fish, dairy products without the use of animals. At the same time, meat can be grown not only from animal cells, there are scientists who create meat-like proteins from plants.The characteristics of these products almost completely reproduce traditional analogues in their composition. And gene editing is used to increase the yield of products.This is the “point” in materials science where manipulation becomes nanoscale: it is a million times smaller than the size of an ant, 8,000 times smaller than a red blood cell, and 2.5 times smaller than a DNA strand. Nanobots are machines that can self-replicate and take apart any material, atom by atom, and use this ""raw material"" to create anything.Progress in the nano world has been remarkably fast, and there are now many nano products on the market.","2,115 followers",Pavithran Subbiah,698,110,3.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-10-emerging-technologies-in-the-next-5-10-years-2020%E2%80%932025

There is one that stands head-and-shoulders above the others:As a Wall Street denizen for almost two decades and a venture investor for almost one, I have a keen appreciation for the short-termism that plagues public companies versus those which have chosen to remain private. Jeff Bezos and Amazon have done the seemingly impossible: gaining the benefits of being public (access to vast amounts of capital, capital structure flexibility, a broad shareholder base and the internal policies and practices necessitated by being public) without being bound by quarterly earnings estimates, analyst pressure or forces adverse to long-term value creation. This has all been done through boom-and-bust, sharp swings in market sentiment (and investor cynicism of the monetization of web-based businesses) and competitive threats from every direction. They have, under Bezos's leadership, built a very distinct culture that is all about optimizing the customer experience, from purchase price to fulfillment to creative solutions around pain points that had slowed the growth of the online-to-doorstep model (most notably shipping costs). I have marveled at the evolution of their strategy around long-term value drivers and awareness of their unique assets, e.g., the advent of AWS.In many ways Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett are kindred spirits: build sustainable value that compounds over long periods of time, avoid being swayed by short-term sentiment and control your own destiny. Warren, however, has created a diversified portfolio that is essentially a cost-effective fund-of-funds with the best asset allocator on the planet. Jeff is all in on his one principal assets, AMZN. And the way he has stewarded its growth through trauma, uncertainty and turmoil is my lodestar for how one should execute against a big, audacious vision.He and the Amazon team have my utmost admiration.",0 followers,Praveen S V,603,256,13.5M,2013,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-company-do-you-admire-most

And it’s not quantity over quality: Many Estonian startups are now successful companies that you may recognize, such as Skype, Transferwise, Pipedrive, Cloutex, Click & Grow, GrabCAD, Erply, Fortumo, Lingvist and others.(It has an e-residency service, a transnational digital identity available to anyone. An e-resident can not only establish a company in Estonia through the Internet, but they can also have access to other online services that have been available to Estonians for over a decade.E-residents are issued a smart ID card, a legal equivalent to handwritten signatures and face-to-face identification in Estonia and worldwide. The cards themselves are protected by 2048-bit encryption, and the signature/ID functionality is provided by two security certificates stored on the card’s microchip.SourcesAnd as we know that only thing constant with science and technology isThis list will also beThanks.Thanks for the edits","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,632,1.5K,2.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-10-emerging-technologies-in-the-next-5-10-years-2020%E2%80%932025
25,"In my opinion, Japan.Based on my visit, Japan is probably among the cleanest countries on earth. They take a bath/shower twice a day, the streets are extremely clean (Even the slum areas.), public toilets are pretty clean as well (Compared to most countries.).The Japanese understand the benefit of mutual respect. They bow to each other, they ask permission for stuffs that people from other countries usually don't, and their voice isn't loud.In terms of technology, Japan is relatively advanced.

Tokyo has a lot of vending machines around the city, there are underground parkings for bicycle and switchable parking garages for cars to save space. Japan is one of the leading nations in terms of robotic technology. Robotics have been existing in Japan since the Edo period (1603–1867). Japan had made several records of making the fastest trains in the world. Tokyo is one of the largest cities in the world.In terms of industry, Japan is one of the most industrious countries in the world. Brands like Toyota, Honda, Kawasaki, Sony are probably famous in most parts of the world. Japanese animation, better known as 'anime' is also widely famous.Movies and tv shows often stereotype Tokyo as a high tech place filled with modern buildings and lights.999999","1,210 followers",Emmanuel Lore,2.6K,559,5.9M,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-10-emerging-technologies-in-the-next-5-10-years-2020%E2%80%932025

United States of America has discovered the internet which was the start of IT. They have the best space shuttle programs as they have visited moon for the first time in the world in 1969. These all things are the human friendly. But USA has also developed the nuclear weapons to destroy the enemies and occupy the lands. World Wars had a great experience with USA power upon other countries.JAPANTechnology leader Japan lands on the fifth spot with 54,170 patents and more than 2 million published journals. Japan is the most technologically advanced nation in Asia and maybe the whole world.And in weapons, Japan is developing gundam-like units that can fire lasers and can float in air. Some rumors said that japan is developing a big barrier that can defend whole japan from nuclear bombs, and tsunamis.Japan is the master of technology. It has Sony, Fujitsu, Toshiba, Toyota. Thank Japan for your PlayStation, Nintendo and SEGA consoles.GERMANYGermany ranks third with 16,605 patents and more than 2.1 million published researches. It’s worth noting that German students rank 13th in the best performers in math and science. The country allots over $102 billion on R&D. Germany is known as a land of ideas, inventions, and innovations.Notable discoveries like the Aspirin, Z3 (the first programmable computer), bacteriology (a branch of science founded by Robert Koch), a chip card (the microprocessor card you see every day), jet engine, contact lenses, and more were developed by Germans.Sources:Top 10 most Advanced Technology Countries in the World10 Most Advanced Countries in ScienceDon’t forget to be awesome, -E.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,16.1K,996,155.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-important-technology-of-the-future

30,"You will find countries like Japan listed as number one on a lot of peoples lists, but keep in mind, it mainly purchases its high tech industries (Boston Dynamics, ARM holdings etc.) and adopts concepts developed in the west, but rarely introduces technological milestones itself. For instance, the first practical high speed electric trains were developed in France and later, Maglev in England and Germany, they were simply not implemented on a wide scale for economic and political reasons. Today, German companies are largely responsible for the technology stack behind China’s new maglev trains.Continue ReadingYou will find countries like Japan listed as number one on a lot of peoples lists, but keep in mind, it mainly purchases its high tech industries (Boston Dynamics, ARM holdings etc.) and adopts concepts developed in the west, but rarely introduces technological milestones itself.
