My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Can-we-make-artificial-sunlight

OPA’s estimate was announced by DOE.OPA’s responded with an updated estimate for the cost of the US portion of ITER -“The new cost estimate, which is a range from $4.0 to $6.5 billion, is a reflection of the historical cost growth of the project and the high level of risk and uncertainty' associated with this highly complicated international undertaking.”If you project out OPA’s estimate for the 9.1% pledge the US has made to the ITER project, the US pledge to ITER is now expected to be between US$4 billion and US$6.5 billion; according to OPA,Using DOE OPA's best estimate, the shared total ITER project cost to the international consortium is now ultimately expected to range from US$44 billion to US$75 billion.US taking a hard look at its involvement in ITERThe nuclear community needs to seriously consider the implications for the cost of fusion power plantsThere currently may be greater hope for cost competitive commercial fusion from technology implemented by small fusion startups.LPP Fusion is the name of a leading small US company innovating fusion.One of the keys to practical production of fusion power is to meet the basic conditions required for fusion (the famous Lawson criteria of temperature, plasma pressure, and confinement time). At least one small fusion experiment at Lawrenceville Plasma Physics headed up by Dr. Eric Lerner has at this point technically already met the minimal conditions for D-T fusion.D + T -> 2He-4 (3.5 MeV) + neutron (14.1 MeV)The Lawson criterion for fusion ignition and break-even with D-T fusion is about 4 x 10^15 keV s/cm^3.Eric Lerner of Lawrenceville Plasma Physics reports in peer reviewed literature that his experiment has achieved 5 x 10^15 keV s/cm^3In theory, LPP should not be that far away, but they are not putting effort into D-T or D-D fusion at this time (although in the past they have made many runs using Deuterium fuel and D-D fusion). D-T fusion is the fusion reaction that is easiest to achieve - but LPP is not currently interested in going that direction.LPP isn't really interested in D-T type fusion. The ""problem"" with D-T fusion is that a lot of the energy in D-T comes in the form of 14.1 MeV high-energy neutrons, which tend to make reactor materials highly radioactive via neutron activation. In theory you can capture that energy the same way you do with a conventional nuclear reactor (that is, by using the radiation to get something like liquid Lithium hot and using it to boil water or heat molten salt to run a turbine). Part of the problem with D-T fusion is the tritium itself, which is radioactive unlike deuterium fusion fuel, and LPP doesn't want to get into all those radioactive-materials handling issues. Tritium is also very expensive to purchase (about $30,000 per gram as estimated by Los Alamos National Lab).So LPP has chosen to set their sights just a bit higher. They plan to bypass easier to achieve D-T and the cheap and very sustainable D-D fusion reaction in favor of aneutronic fusion (for me, the is a questionable and perhaps unfortunate choice - neutronic fusion producing a huge number of high value neutrons is valuable and could be used for applications like nuclear waste burning, medical isotope production, and manufacture of fuel for fission reactors, as well as producing electricity from fusion).The fusion reaction LPP prefers is called p-B-11, which uses conventional hydrogen (which becomes a bare proton, p, when ionized) and boron-11, which is over 100X more difficult to ignite in a tokamak (and is about 20X as hard to ignite in a properly designed Inertial Confinement Fusion device).[1] - Ivy-Mike nuclear test performed in 1952 -[2] - LPP at Google's Solve for X Conference - still leading the field -Historical Fact - Over the past five decades the technical advance of fusion experiments as measured by the Fusion Triple product nTt doubles every 1.8 years -this is a more rapid trend of sustained technical advance than the growth of the number of transistors on CPU chips (Moore’s Law)..","29,974 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.7K,249.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Will-the-energy-crisis-be-solved-if-sustained-nuclear-fusion-became-a-reality-What-are-its-negative-effects

One is providing designs that need to be approved by a country’s nuclear regulating agency, which can take many years. Second, the idea of unlimited power is, to be frank, “pie in the sky”. When nuclear power was first being used back in the 1950’s, the catch phrase was that nuclear power would make electricity so plentiful it would be “too cheap to meter”. This was also a “pie in the sky” statement. After all, electric utility companies are commercial, for profit businesses. They won’t stay in business for very long if they end up giving away the power they produce for free. Another piece is that an earth-based fusion reactor plant is not like the sun and would not be able to produce unlimited energy. The earth-bound fusion process has some similarities to the fusion process in the sun, but there are also quite a lot of differences, e.g. the temperatures needed to ignite fusion in a small fusion reactor on earth is significantly greater than on the sun. As Mr. Johnson notes, the cost of a commercial fusion reactor, at least initially, would be quite high, and I agree. Back in the early days of nuclear power in the US, you could build a 1000 MW(electric) nuclear power station for $300 million by the early 1970’s. Today, that price tag is $15 billion and counting. Plus, initially you get a 40 year operating license, so you have to pay off the initial investment plus all the costs of operating a nuclear station for 40 years and make a profit. In today’s market with cheap natural gas, and with many electricity markets in the US being deregulated (competition among electricity generators) building and operating a new nuclear power station is not economically feasible in much of the US. At this point, the same would be true of a commercial fusion power station, so finding a non-government company to build one would be difficult. And any project of this type to built by a government entity, frankly, would likely be poorly managed with massive cost overruns, legal suits, and end up like the Yucca Mountain nuclear repository and never get built, but will waste many 10’s of billions of tax dollars.

But the next stage has to lift 2498 stages, so it’s actually 2498 stages bundled together, and the previous stage is now 4997 stages. And so on. You’ll wind up with an immense pyramid of giant rockets, many miles across at the bottom.Or maybe you switch to a less dense, but higher energy density fuel, like hydrogen instead of kerosene. It will require more volume for the same amount of impulse, but if you work your way through the fairly complex optimization, you can probably mix LH2 and Kerosene to shrink the stack somewhat. Shrink your payload smaller than the Apollo capsule and you’ll do better yet. Maybe it’ll be only a few miles across at the base instead of the size of a mountain. But it’s just not going to work out with chemical propellants. Nobody can afford to build such a monster.So you have a few options:","2,496 followers",Jim Reich,1.4K,6.1K,5.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Can-we-make-artificial-sunlight

To put this in perspective, one of the fastest human built objects is the Parker Solar Probe, which achieved speeds of 213,200 miles per hour, or about 3.1% of our 0.01 c speed. What allowed the Parker Solar probe to achieve such incredible speeds, is a combination of several factors, starting with the launch of the spacecraft on a Delta IV Heavy rocketEven with this powerful launch vehicle, it couldn’t have achieved anywhere close to its mission parameters, or breaking the speed record. In order to achieve that, the spacecraft will perform seven flybys of the planet Venus, in order to slowly lower its closest approach to the sun. In January of this year, it passed 19.4 billion meters from the Sun, and it will perform this same flyby in June. In December 2025, the probe will achieve its closest flyby, which is 6.9 billion meters from the Sun’s center or 6.2 billion meters from the Sun’s surface. This is only 9 solar radii away from the Sun, and reach 430,000 miles per hour, or 6% or our target speed.As other answers have pointed out, the first hurdle to achieving 1% of the speed of light is the matter of fuel energy density. Chemical propulsion is nowhere near dense enough to get close, the fastest speeds achieved by chemical rockets is the launch of the New Horizons probe, about 36,400 miles per hour, and that was using an Atlas V, one of the most powerful rockets currently in service. In order to achieve 1% of the speed of light, we’ll need more efficient and more powerful forms of propulsion, and there are quite a few that you could choose from, far too many to mention here.The next hurdle is acceleration. We as humans can only survived sustained g-forces for so long before you start encountering organ failure, you actually reach the point where the structures inside us will literally be torn apart. Accelerations from fractions of 1 g (Earth surface gravity), up to about 2 to 3 g’s would probably be sustainable for a decent amount of time, from months at fractions of g to about 1 to 2 g, from days or hours perhaps of 3 g or so. Once you get into the higher accelerations, the kind usually only experienced in amusement park rides for fractions of a second, or in maneuvers in high speed aircraft, then you get down to less than several hours. Even higher accelerations would require even smaller time frames in order to be survivable. The highest acceleration ever survived by a human being was 46.2 g, and that was only for a fraction of a second.That being said, it wouldn’t take that much acceleration to get to 1% of the speed of light. If you wanted to accelerate at a comfortable 1 g, it would take 305,810 seconds, or 3.51 days. The distance traveled while accelerating at 1 g for that long is just over 4 times the average distance between the Earth and the Sun. If you accelerated five times faster, or 5g, it would only take 61,652 seconds, or 17 hours, and you would only travel about 62% of the average Earth-Sun distance.As other answers have pointed out, a major problem with traveling at these velocities is debris. This is a problem even with current space travel, and we travel much slower. As you get faster and faster, the relative velocity of debris gets larger and larger, and even the smallest of particles can eventually get deadly. Imagine a grain of sand hitting a target at 3 million meters per second. The kinetic energy of such a projectile would be 1.35 mega Joules, or about the same amount of kinetic energy of a Chevy Tahoe traveling at 67 miles per hour. What makes the grain of sand hitting you even worse than the truck hitting you is that the grain of sand has an incredibly small area. This is what allows small, fast moving projectiles to punch through materials that would easily stop a truck. Any reasonable solution to this problem adds mass, and thereby decreases how quickly you can accelerate to 1% of the speed of light, and also how far you can go based on the amount of fuel you have.Another consideration that needs to be made that other answers have touched upon is that you have to slow down in order to arrive at your destination, unless the destination is traveling at 1% of the speed of light. This is why the most time efficient way of traveling between any two points in space with constant acceleration involves accelerating towards the target for half the journey, and decelerating for the second half. This turns navigational problems into less a consideration of how fast you can get, which in space is rather meaningless, since any object given enough time, acceleration, and fuel can get up to some ridiculously fast speeds, but more a consideration of max acceleration. With a decent long term constant acceleration, you can get anywhere in the inner solar system within a week, anywhere in the solar system in a month, maybe two depending on orbital position. The Moon is about 3 and a half hours, about the same as a long regional flight, say London to Athens.",0 followers,Wayne Boyd,862,5.1K,13.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Will-the-energy-crisis-be-solved-if-sustained-nuclear-fusion-became-a-reality-What-are-its-negative-effects

This is about five orders of magnitude less effecient than the absolute minimum we’d need to have any hope of reaching any significant portion of c.Fortunately, there are alternatives.In order to get to 1% of light speed we need a more effecient method of harvesting energy. We have two that quality - fission is about 0.08% effecient, fusion is about ten times better. Nuclear fission is just about effecient enough to be able to get a spacecraft to a few percentage points of c (1–5%,All you need to do is to get one of these in a small enough spaceship and have everyone live next to a fully running nuclear reactor for a couple of years, without getting cooked by the waste heat. You can’t use a river for cooling water in space you see. You need to radiate the excess heat away somehow.Fusion power could be used to get up to perhaps 20–30% of c with the same setup and the same overall problems, albeit at higher speeds.

This supposes that there has been plenty of time for intelligent civilizations to interact within our galaxy when one examines the age and number of stars, as well as the distances between them. Yet, the fact that extra-terrestrial intelligence has never been observed leads to a logical paradox where our observations are inconsistent with our theoretical expectation. This original question from Fermi seemed to also reinforce the prevailing paradigm at the time that interstellar travel was impossible. Project Daedalus was a bold way to examine the Fermi Paradox head on and gave a partial answer – interstellar travel is possible. The basis of this belief was the demonstration of a credible engineering design just at the outset of the space age that could in theory, cross the interstellar distances. In the future scientific advancement would lead to a refined and more efficient design. The absence of alien visitors would therefore require a different explanation because Project Daedalus demonstrated that with current, and near future, technology, interstellar travel is feasible. Therefore, another solution to the absence of extra-terrestrial visitation was necessary.There were three stated goals for Project Daedalus:The two-stage engine configuration was powered by inertial confinement fusion using deuterium and helium-3 pellets. Electron beam diodes positioned around the base of the engine exhaust would impinge on the pellets and ignite them to produce large energy gain, at a rate of 250 detonations per second. This would continue for a boost phase lasting over 3.8 years followed by a cruise phase lasting 46 years and travelling at over 12% of the speed of light until the 450 tons science probe would finally reach its destination of the Barnard’s Star system 5.9 light years away, which it would transit in a matter of days due to its flyby nature.Also Orion could work.The “nuclear pollution” from this would be small set next to existing atomic bomb testing pollution.Project Orion (nuclear propulsion) - WikipediaAn atomic (fission) Orion can achieve perhaps 9%–11% of the speed of light.You have a bomb magazine and after each detonation of a bomb under the pusher plate, another bomb is fired using a cannon through the shown hole in the pusher plate in the figure.One pusher plate. Steam or pneumatic cylinders acting as shock absorbers between the pusher plate & main hull.The bomb detonates at a predetermined distance behind the pusher plate and timed so the pusher plate is at or near full extension of the shock absorbers. The bomb detonation pushes the plate forward and the shock absorbers change a sudden violent impulse to a much smoother acceleration with the level of acceleration not exactly constant, but generally if done right does not exceed safe accelerations for human bodies and no negative acceleration felt by the crew.Nor were “standard” nuclear weapons used.The shape of the bomb's reaction mass is critical to efficiency. The original project designed bombs with a reaction mass made of tungsten (A bomb with a cylinder of reaction mass expands into a flat, disk-shaped wave of plasma when it explodes. A bomb with a disk-shaped reaction mass expands into a far more efficient cigar-shaped wave of plasma debris.The cigar shape focuses much of the plasma to impinge onto the pusher-plate.The bomb would detonate a preset distance below the pusher plate well centered with the propellent end pointed at the pusher plate. That is tungsten or some similar very dense metal as opaque as possible to X-rays and gamma rays. That turns the nuclear explosion into practical thrust by bouncing the tungsten plasma off the pusher plate.This is a sophisticated well-developed designTest footage of the concept built into models with chemical explosive charges to show how it would work.",48 followers,Ryan Murphy,11.5K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Will-the-energy-crisis-be-solved-if-sustained-nuclear-fusion-became-a-reality-What-are-its-negative-effects

Still, it provides sufficient survival advantage that flight evolved.But in space there’s literally nothing dense enough to be worth even trying to push against, not even the relatively thick interplanetary medium (basically the Solar Wind,Rockets have to carry their own mass to push against, and once pushed, that “reaction mass” is left behind, and it can’t be re-used.Rockets come in different types- straight-up chemical combustion rockets that use solid or liquid fuels, ion rockets, drawing-board plasma rockets (like VASIMR) and nuclear rockets… all of them can be rated efficiency-wise by something calledThere are some caveats- for instance ion engines have a relatively low fuel consumption rate so they have good efficiency there, but they derive the energy to push the propellant away from an onboard power supply, where chemical engines derive the power from the fuel itself.Rocket scientists have tried all sorts of combinations of chemical fuels. All of them have associated hazards- they are after all energy-storage media, and the more energy they store the more hazardous they are if something goes wrong. The most common high-thrust fuel in use is liquid hydrogen combined with the oxidizer liquid oxygen, and you probably have some idea of how dangerous they both are.The chemical system with the highest efficiency ever tested is a mixture of lithium, fluorine and hydrogen, but the hazards outweigh the benefits.The rocket engine with the highest theoretical specific impulse is the so-calledA very bright fellow named Robert Bussard had the idea of designing a sort of interstellar ramjet that worked by collecting, “burning” and expelling the hydrogen gas that seems to be pretty much everywhere between the planets and the stars. That way it would have both an unlimited fuel supply and an unlimited power supply. I put “burning” in quotes because his idea is to run the hydrogen through an onboard fusion reactor, which we don’t know how to build yet. It has some issues beyond that though- when he came up with the idea the amount of available hydrogen was thought to be much higher than we now know it to be, it would collect the hydrogen with a very powerful magnetic field which would act as a scoop requiring it to be accelerated to a significant fraction of c by onboard fuel or some sort of booster before it could collect fuel, and there is some controversy whether the energy expended in collecting the hydrogen is greater than that to be gained from it (in other words it might act more as a brake than an engine).Ever since someone thought up the idea of an “There’s also the “You may have hear of the recent “We can’t get up to a significant fraction of light using rockets because the universe just doesn’t work that way.

Fusing tiny amounts of fuel releases stageering amounts of power. Say a pound of fusion fuel can produce as much as a million tons of coal or oil. So very small power plants, say quick mart sized, could replace full sized commercial electric power plants. Better fusion fuel cycles can do this without steam turbines, much of any waste or thermal pollution. Say up to 20 times less waste heat per watt of electricity produced. With fuel costs of a few dollars a year.The plants are not only projected to be very small but very cheap. Litteraly the cost of New fusion plant should be less then a years fuel bill for a coal plant of similar power output. Having few moving parts, no fuel handeling efforts to speak of, little to repair. The fusion plants should need very little land, personnel, or maintenance. Nor would they have any major dangers or impacts on the local community from fuel fires, pollution, huge cooling towers, etc. so they could be sited in small corners in big cities or industrial areas, rather then far out in the county with high tension lines trailing into the cities.because they are very small and light, most better fuel cycles not needing the heavy radiation shielding of a nuclear fission power plant, they can be used in mobile systems like ships and at least bigger aircraft.Global impacts would be dramatic reduction ( estimated 70% ) of all fossil fuel use, by all fixed factories and building using the cheaper fusion electric power rather then fossil fuel.
