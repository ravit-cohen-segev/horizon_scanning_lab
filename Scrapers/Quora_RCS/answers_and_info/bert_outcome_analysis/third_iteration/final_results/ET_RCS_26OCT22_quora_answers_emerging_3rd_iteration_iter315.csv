Sad is a kind of emotion, often come in an intensive way. Your heart aches, your body reacts, but it's still a healthy emotion.Depression is void of all emotion. You're numb, careless, empty, apathetic, and feeling like you're an outsider of the world. You walk down the familiar hallway, see your classmates chatting with each other, and you don't think you belong to the same place with them anymore. An invisible wall barricaded yourself from the rest of others on the earth.Depression is the loss of the ability to feel happiness or appreciate life. Everything ceases to be colorful or enjoyable. Everything turns meaningless. You feel like answering every question with a shrug, ""so what?""* People with depression cry all the time.Half true, but not entirely. Some people have excessive crying spells, some simply can't cry at all. It varies.According to my own experience, if you're still able to cry, you're not beyond hope. Unlike the way TV show portrays, someone determined to commit suicide is rarely melodramatic.If a suicidal person is still capable of crying or being melodramatic, it means they do not want to die, but they can't find a reason to live.When I was determined to die, death felt homely to me, and I became calmer than ever, thinking that I had made the best decision.* Depression is a choice/a way to seek attention.False. The pervasive feeling in a depressive episode is the loss of control, which is the exact opposite of ""choice.""Feigning depression is a very inefficient way to seek attention. If you really feel someone is seeking attention, perhaps they have totally lost control of their brain and nerves, and they are clinging on you to seek a reason to live. In other words, you can be the last straw for them.Even if they are feigning depression to seek attention, there must be a reason why they want attention, and why they choose to seek attention in this way.* Depressed people are weakFalse. Depressed people are anything but weak.Could anyone imagine how much strength it takes to get up and do the simplest task every morning during a depressive episode?We cope with the ups and downs of daily life like everyone else. On top of it, we have to fight with our brain that turns against us, we have to tirelessly feign happiness when we are around people, and we also have to bear the shame because people wouldn't understand.Life won't stop for me just because I'm in a depressive episode. Life goes on. If I don't force myself to gather the strength to function, things would only get worse.* Depression happens for a reason. The fault is on the depressed person.False.

I think another one may be Singapore’s wealth. Lots of Americans would believe that Singapore’s economic situation is similar to that of its neighbors, when that could not be farther from the truth. Singapore is an incredibly rich nation, not just by the standards of their neighbors (Malaysia and Indonesia) but by the standards of the West too. They are without a doubt a 1st world country. On the flip side, some people assume all Singaporeans are fairly wealthy because of high government assistance, however even with this huge government assistance, some Singaporeans worry about paying next months bills. Of course, this is true with all counties, so it would be inevitable and is not really Singapore’s fault. I think another thing a lot of people misunderstand is the very small size of Singapore, approximately the size of just one large US city (like San Francisco or New York), and that as a result, Singaporeans (who can afford to do so) love to travel. Finally, relating to the fact that Singaporeans love to travel, lots of people don’t understand Singapores incredible location. It is no longer than a seven hour flight to all major destinations in Asia, Australia, and island countries like the Maldives (an AMAZING place to visit), which makes traveling to places most could only dream of an easy weekend trip for Singapore residents.

How indeed does one prepare oneself for a (research or otherwise) career in machine learning, in particular in terms of familiarizing oneself with the underlying mathematics? I’m going to resist the temptation of trotting out some standard books, and instead, focus on giving broad advice.There’s some bad news on this front, and it’s best to get this out of the way as quickly as possible. Having spent 35+ years studying machine learning, let me put this in the most direct way possible: no matter how much time and effort you devote to it, you can never know enough math to read through all the ML literature. Different parts of ML use a variety of esoteric math. There’s just no way one person can know all of this math, so it’s good to be forewarned.OK, with that out of the way, how does one prepare oneself? Think of the process analogous to conditioning your mind and body to run a marathon. It’s a gradual process, of improving your fitness, your ability to run for longer and longer distances, your breathing technique, your mental focus, and dozens of other dimensions. Working in ML is not like running a 100 meter sprint, where the race is pretty much over in a single breath. It’s much more of an endurance sport, where you have to constantly work at it to remain in shape, and there’s no point at which you can relax and say: OK, I know it all! Because no one does!An example from my recent work will clarify the issues involved. One of the major challenges in machine learning is that there’s never enough training data to tackle every ML problem that presents itself. Humans are especially adept in solving this challenge. I can get on a flight from San Francisco and within a few short hours find myself in a dizzying diversity of new environments, from the glitzy subways of Tokyo and the bleak winter in Scandinavia to an arid savannah in Africa, or a swampy rainforest in Brazil. There’s no way I can ever hope to collect training samples from every possible environment that I can encounter in life. So, what do we do? We transfer our learned knowledge from places we’ve been — so, having taken the BART subway in San Francisco, and subways in New York and London, I can try to handle the complexity of the subway in Tokyo by drawing upon my previous experience. Of course, it doesn’t quite match — the language is completely different, the tone and texture of the visual experience is completely different (attendants in gloved hands show you the way in Tokyo — no such luxury is available in the US!). Yet, we somehow manage, and plod our way through new experiences. We even cherish the prospect of finding ourselves in some alien new culture, where we don’t speak the language and can’t ask for directions. It opens up our mind to new horizons, all part of the charm of travel.So, what’s the mathematics involved in implementing a transfer learning algorithm? It varies a lot depending on what type of approach you investigate. Let’s review some approaches from computer vision over the past few years. One class of approaches are so-called subspace methods, where the training data from a collection of images in the “source” domain (which conveniently has labels given to us) is to be compared with a collection of unlabeled images from a “target” domain (e.g., “source” → NY subway, “target” → Tokyo subway).One can take a collection of images of size NxN and using a variety of different methods find the smallest subspace that the source images lie in (treating each image as a vector in N^2 dimensions). Now, to understand this body of work, you obviously need to know some linear algebra. So, if you don’t understand linear algebra, or you took a class way back when and forgot it all, it’s time to refresh your memory or learn anew. Fortunately, there are excellent textbooks (Strang is usually a good place to start) and also something like MATLAB will let you explore linear algebraic ML methods without having to implement things like eigenvalue or singular value decomposition. As I usually told my students, keep the motto “eigen do it if I try” in mind. Persevere, and keep the focus on why you are learning this math. Because it is important and essential to understand much of modern ML.OK, great, you’ve managed to learn some linear algebra. Are you done? Ummm, not quite. So, back to our transfer learning example. You construct a source subspace from the source images, and a target subspace from the target images. Umm, how does one do that. OK, you can use a garden variety dimensionality reduction method like principal components analysis (PCA), which just computes the dominant eigenvectors of the covariance matrices of the source and target images. This is one subroutine call in MATLAB. But, PCA is 100 years old. How about something new and cool, like a ooh la la subspace tracking method like GOUDA, which uses the fancier math of Lie groups. Oops, now you need to learn some group theory, the mathematics of symmetry. As it turns out, matrices of certain types, like all invertible matrices, or all positive definite matrices, are not just linear algebraic objects, they are also of interest in group theory, a particularly important subfield of which is Lie groups (Lie → “Lee”).OK, great, you have a smattering of knowledge of group theory and Lie groups. Are you done? Hmmm…actually not, because it turns out Lie groups are not just groups, but they are also continuous manifolds. What in the blazes is a “manifold”? If you google this, you are likely to encounter web pages describing engine parts! No, a manifold is something entirely different in machine learning, where it means a non-Euclidean space that has curvature. It turns out the set of all probability distributions (e.g., 1 dimensional Gaussians with a scalar variance dimension and a scalar mean dimension) are not Euclidean, but rather, describe a curved space. So, the set of all positive definite matrices form a Lie group, with a certain curvature. What this implies is that obvious operations like taking the average have to done with considerable care. So, off you go, learning all there is to know about manifolds, Riemannian manifolds, tangent spaces, covariant derivatives, exp and log mappings, etc. Oh, what fun!Getting back to our transfer learning method, if you compute the source covariance matrix C_s and the target covariance matrix C_t, then there is a simple method called CORAL (for correlational alignment) that figures out how to transform C_s into C_t using some invertible mapping A. CORAL is popular as a transfer learning method in computer vision. But, CORAL does not actually use the knowledge that the space of positive definite matrices (or covariance matrices) forms a manifold. In fact, it forms something called a cone in convex analysis. If you subtract one covariance matrix from another, the result is not a covariance matrix. So, they do not form a vector space, but rather something else entirely. Oops, it turns out the study of cones is important in convex analysis, so there you go again, you need to learn about convex sets and functions, projections onto convex sets, etc. The dividing line between tractable and intractable optimization is not linear vs. nonlinear, but rather, convex vs. non-convex.I hope the pattern is becoming clear. Like one of those legendary Russian dolls, where each time you open one, you find it is not the end, but there’s another one inside it, so it is with learning math in machine learning. Each time you learn a bit of math, you find it opens the door to an entirely new field of math, which you need to know something about as well. For my most recent paper, I had to digest a whole book devoted entirely to the topic of positive definite matrices (it’s like the old joke, where the deeper you go, the more you know about a specialized topic, until you know everything about —- nothing!).Any given problem in machine learning, like transfer learning, can be formulated as a convex optimization problem, as a manifold learning problem, as a multivariate statistical estimation problem, as a nonlinear gradient based deep learning problem, etc. etc. Each of these requires learning a bit about the underlying math involved.If you feel discouraged, and feel like tearing your hair out at this point, I sympathize with you. But, on the other hand, you can look on the positive side, and realize that in terms of our analogy of running a marathon, you are steadily becoming better at running the long race, building your mathematical muscle as you go along, and gradually things start falling into place. Things start to make sense, and different subfields start connecting with each other. Something strange happens. You start liking it! Of course, there’s a drawback. Someone who doesn't understand any of the math you get good at using asks you to explain your work, and you realize that it’s impossible to do that without writing equations.Most researchers find their comfort zone and try to stay within it, since otherwise, it takes a great deal of time and effort to master the dozens of mathematical subfields that modern ML uses. But, this strategy eventually fails, and one is always forced to get outside one’s comfort zone and learn some new math, since otherwise, a whole area of the field becomes alien to you.Fortunately, the human brain is an amazing instrument, and provides decades and decades of trouble-free operation, allowing us to continually learn over 40,50, 60, years or more. How precisely it does that without zeroing out all prior learning is one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in science!",3 followers,Sridhar Mahadevan,1.1K,177,6.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-common-misconceptions-about-technology
24,"No. I wrote my first ML program waaay back in 1982, before there was Internet, Google, GPU computing, laptops, cellphones, digital cameras, desktop PCs, heck before there was almost anything remotely resembling what you see in the tech world around you today.How did I even discover the existence of such a field? Back then, to educate oneself, you read books. Of course, you had to either go to a library, or in my case, a quaint event called a book fair. I attended a large book fair in New Delhi, India’s capital, and picked up this 800 page tome, a fairly massive affair. Why, I don’t know. AfterNo. I wrote my first ML program waaay back in 1982, before there was Internet, Google, GPU computing, laptops, cellphones, digital cameras, desktop PCs, heck before there was almost anything remotely resembling what you see in the tech world around you today.How did I even discover the existence of such a field? Back then, to educate oneself, you read books. Of course, you had to either go to a library, or in my case, a quaint event called a book fair. I attended a large book fair in New Delhi, India’s capital, and picked up this 800 page tome, a fairly massive affair. Why, I don’t know. After all, I was at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, studying to become an electrical engineer.Hofstadter’s first book, and in my opinion, still his best, was an utter revelation to me. It opened up a whole new world of imagination of what deep links there are between art, music and abstract math, realized by the three central characters — Johann Sebastian Bach, Maurice Escher, Kurt Gödel — and computing, including of course AI and ML.The book featured an intriguing set of visual puzzles from a Russian researcher named Bongard, where the task is to discover a rule that separates the six figures on the left from those on the right. This is an elementary problem in ML called classification. It’s analogous to distinguishing email from spam or deciding if an image contains a face. As humans, we classify sensory stimuli billions of times through our lives, and our very survival depends on it. As you cross the road, is the object approaching you a person or a Fedex truck? Get the answer wrong and your life may indeed be over. Not surprisingly, we solve such problems amazingly well.I’ll leave you to work this one out, but with absolutely no training in this field, I nonetheless decided to foolishly make this the core of my Masters thesis project. Somehow I plodded through and worked out a solution, however naively it seems in retrospect. That experience made me realize that AI and ML was my life’s goal, and I decided to come to the United States in 1983, where I was incredibly fortunate to work with this brilliant Stanford educated researcher, Thomas Mitchell, now the Dean of the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University.From Tom, I learned the most important lesson of all, which no book can teach you. Research is *fun*. He simply embodied the spirit of a researcher who bubbled with enthusiasm for the field of ML. He worked harder than anyone I had met, yet seemed to be having a ball. That lesson made a huge imprint on me and stayed with me ever since.After getting my PhD, I joined IBM Watson Research in New York in late 1989, where they couldn’t figure out what to do with an ML researcher. So they threw me into a newly formed robotics group, even though I had absolutely no background in this field. I had never ever programmed a robot. Amazingly enough, I seemed to thrive in this somewhat challenging situation, and ended up writing some of my most highly cited papers, exploring how robots can acquire new behaviors using the newly emerging field of reinforcement learning. I also published in 1993 perhaps the first book on robot learning, which featured research from all over the world in this new area of AI. Despite having no background in robotics, I still managed to make a name for myself.Many years later, I was elected a Fellow of AAAI, the leading international professional society for AI researchers. Each year, a small handful of researchers are selected and the competition is fierce. This year’s AAAI Fellows include some of the founders of the deep learning revolution: Yoshua Bengio, and Yann Le Cun.The list of AAAI Fellows include some of the most amazing researchers in AI and ML, and I’m humbled to be listed in such distinguished company. None of this would have happened if back in 1982, I thought doing ML with no formal training in this field, with primitive computing, or doing robot learning at IBM in 1990 with no training in robotics, was “difficult”.For those aspiring young researchers reading this on Quora, the best advice I can give you is that nothing is “difficult” if you set yourself the challenge of working on it. Above all, remember: research is fun! It’s an exploration into the unknown.For many years, from 2001–2018, I was privileged to co-direct the Autonomous Learning Laboratory at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, with one of reinforcement learning’s true pioneers, Andrew Barto. Andy and his former PhD student, Rich Sutton, helped establish the modern field of RL, the area that gave rise to Deep Mind and Alpha Go Zero. Andy and Rich embodied the true spirit of researchers having fun and working with them was the best professional experience of my career.PhD students at the lab hung up a sign on the main door that was a quote from one of the most distinguished scientists of all time, Albert Einstein.That sums it all. Research doesn’t need expertise. Einstein in fact hated textbook knowledge. Above all, he prized imagination, the ability to dream. If you want to make your children smart, he told parents, teach them fairy stories.As we battle the latest pandemic, the Wuhan coronavirus, the biggest weapon at our disposal is our ability to sequence its genome. The biggest breakthrough in biology of the 20th century came from Watson and Crick, two brash biologists who upturned the world of biology by having fun! Watson went on to write a highly popular account of their discovery called the Double Helix. In it he tells the story of how they scandalized established researchers, like Oswald Avery of Columbia University, when he realized they didn’t know elementary biochemistry. Yet, by playing with 3D models and in effect stealing from Rosalind Franklin’s carefully gathered data sets, they cracked the secret of life. They were simply having fun!So, again, my answer is, no, ML is not difficult. It is fun!",3 followers,Sridhar Mahadevan,1K,177,6.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-common-misconceptions-about-technology

Most of us follow such a schedule regularly, without even realizing that such applications would be seen as absurd and impossible just over a decade ago.Machine Learning has silently crept into our lives, changing it in enormous ways. There are numerous other uses which I can’t cover at length e.g.If we judge by impact in recent times, I’m sure it’s extremely difficult to name another field which has a higher influence than ML.Having said that, I accept not everything is rosy. There are certain limitations to ML systems. We still require a ‘deeper’ understanding of newer approaches such as Deep Learning. Interpretability of such models is an open challenge. The number of individuals currently entering the field may be more than what is required. There may be other fields which could result in bigger breakthroughs for our civilization, we never know for sure.Regardless of which side of the fence you sit on, you cannot ignore the impact and lure of ML.If there had to be one field which should be overhyped, my vote would surely go to Machine Learning.",0 followers,Lyken Syu,595,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-common-misconceptions-about-technology

They are also significantly smaller than the top 3, which makes them less visible to researchers outside the machine learning community. However, in terms of dissemination within the machine learning community, these conferences are just as good as the top 3. For instance, I regularly check up on papers coming from these conferences. But I would never physically attend these conferences if I didn't have a paper to present -- they're not the best networking events because of their limited scale.Niche Conferences:I call these two conferences niche conferences because they focus on a very narrow set of topics (from a machine learning perspective). ICLR is a recently created conference organized by the deep learning folks. The focus of ICLR is to study how to learn representations of data, which is basically what deep learning does. COLT is the conference on learning theory, and so is primarily focused on theoretical aspects of machine learning. Both conferences are great for their respective topics, and you get a more focused audience for your work.Regional Conferences:There are some regional conferences as well. I'd attend ECML or ACML if I specifically wanted to network with Europeans or Asians, respectively.Other Conferences:Hence, I often skim through the proceedings of the following conferences from other computational fields:Finally, there are conferences that are so broad that you could even call them unfocused. But they do have a fair amount of machine learning papers.Journals:Note that JMLR and JAIR are completely open access, so they are free to browse.
