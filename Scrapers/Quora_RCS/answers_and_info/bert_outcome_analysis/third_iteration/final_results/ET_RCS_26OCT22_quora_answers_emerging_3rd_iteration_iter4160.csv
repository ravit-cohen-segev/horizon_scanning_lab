As Robert Wright argues in the amazing book,Most of the massive changes driving human history have been communications revolutions. I mean this in the sense that they enable more and more brains to be in close proximity to one another -- creating, spreading and iterating ideas/technologies more rapidly than was previously imaginable.There are a few major communications revolutions in human history that qualify.The development of languageSo what will be the next?  Well, if you buy the argument that the big revolutions are those that bring more and more brains into proximity of each other, then the next big change will be the merging of the internet with our brains.Right now, the main things keeping our brains from being literally connected to the internet areBut things change.My guess is that the technology that enables our brains to communicate with the internet will start with the treatment of major neurological disabilities.The therapeutic use cases could very easily evolve into enhancement. Human enhancement of this nature raises a massive host of ethical issues.But again, things change.I don't know if this will lead to the Singularity that people like Ray Kurzweil talk about. But barring some civilizational collapse or some major international agreement never to go there, the merging of biology and internet technology seems almost inevitable.","75,031 followers",Neman Ashraf,4.5K,410,37.1M,2010,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-revolutionary-technologies-that-could-transform-the-world-in-the-next-5-10-years

4,"The Energy RevolutionI think a so-called Energy Revolution would be the next big paradigm shift.  If a day comes when we learn to tap into energy effortlessly, wirelessly, and without monetary charge, it will open up the minds of human beings in a whole new way; to not be dependent on expensive, expendable energy sources and energy cables would truly separate us from our caveman past.  Imagine a world where free wireless power reaches the remote mountains of Afghanistan and the remote plains of Montana and the farthest reaches of Antarctica.Obviously, this seems like a pipe dream.

If a day comes when we learn to tap into energy effortlessly, wirelessly, and without monetary charge, it will open up the minds of human beings in a whole new way; to not be dependent on expensive, expendable energy sources and energy cables would truly separate us from our caveman past.  Imagine a world where free wireless power reaches the remote mountains of Afghanistan and the remote plains of Montana and the farthest reaches of Antarctica.Obviously, this seems like a pipe dream.  But there are several innovators who thought along these lines.  The prime thinker on the topic of global wireless energy generation and transmission was Nikola Tesla.  He wanted to get rid of power cables and use the earth itself (the static electrical charges between the earth and the ionosphere) to create a worldwide wireless energy field that could power -- wirelessly -- everything in its range.  He wanted to set up a series of transmission towers that would broadcast not only power but radio communications as well:[Please, gutter-minds, don't snicker][Please, gutter-minds, don't snicker]A modern-day equivalent would broadcast wireless power as well as the Internet (which I believe will consume radio and telecom in general in the near future).Unfortunately, while many have tried to replicate and recreate Tesla's work, none have yet succeeded -- leading many to deem Tesla mad or just plain deceitful in his claims of success.  Others claim conspiracy:  the U.S. government stole and hid away Tesla's technologies.  And his ideashttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardenclyffe_TowerIf it's possible to tap into the energy of the planet itself -- rather than its tiny byproducts like oil and coal -- then isn't that the smartest way to go?  Since the planet is constantly spinning and producing electromagnetic radiation, it seems like a no-brainer (Lots of what-ifs, I know.  But what if we reach a point where our current sources of energy just aren't enough; where our consumption outweighs production?  Then what...?Keeping up with the KardashevsSomething to think about is to so-called Kardashev scale, a science fiction-esque concept measuring the state of advancement of a civilization.  In essence:  a Type I civilization is one like ours that has mastered the process of harnessing potential energy from our own planet; a Type II civilization is one that can harness all the potential energy of their local star; and a Type III civilization is one that can harness all the potential energy of their galaxy.While these are clearly hypothetical concepts (like a potential Type IV civilization that harnesses all the power of the universe -- becoming, essentially, God), the idea of harnessing such vast amounts of energy requires some sort of Energy Revolution.  And science fiction concepts like the Kardashev scale often drive real science.  HumansWhich is why technology is advancing at such a rapid rate, often in the areas of energy efficiency and consumption.  For example, Apple uses super energy-efficient processors in their iPads, which makes the battery last longer and which, in turn, helped turn tablet computers from an afterthought into the new hot thing.  This, in turn, increased demand for super energy-efficient processors, leading to further breakthroughs in energy efficiency.And given the faster and faster rates at which human beings consume energy -- especially with the smartphones and tablets in everyone's hands -- we are clearly heading in the direction ofWe","246,860 followers",Dushka Zapata,2.9K,8.5K,232.5M,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-revolutionary-technologies-that-could-transform-the-world-in-the-next-5-10-years
