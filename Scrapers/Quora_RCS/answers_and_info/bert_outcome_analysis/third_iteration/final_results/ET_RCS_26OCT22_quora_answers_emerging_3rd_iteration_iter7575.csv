Let me explain you in a simple liner. Clearing/ Authenticating of Blockchain transaction will reward you the cryptocoins (as you are contributing hash power to resolve the blocks)You have to make choices before mining Cryptocoins. Such as Bitcoin (Most popular), Dogecoins, Ethereum, Dash, Ripples, Monero, Litecoins etc.The next thing which you should be aware about the Hashing Algorithms. SHA~256 is the general algorithm followed by many coins. But there are other trending algorithms like Scrypt, Cryptonight, Double 256, ECDSA etc. All these algorithms have different mining complexities. Some are easily resolved whereas others require more computation power.After deciding Cryptocurrency & determining algorithm, now comes the Hardware. Again there are several hardwares available such as Antminer (popular one), Ledger IWN solo, Zotac etc. Some can mine multiple coins, others are intented to mine dedicated Cryptocoins (Make sure that the chosen hardware offers good hash rates/sec).Besides all these, there are many other things which should be taken care of.* Its better to join an existing mining pool, so on completion of a block (transaction list), the entire team woukd be rewarded. All your pool need is your computation power (You can communicate miners via Stratum Protocol).",0 followers,Daniel Nwachukwu,4.1K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-earn-rs-10k-per-month-from-mining-of-bitcoin-I-am-having-free-electricity

I am a veteran Bitcoin (and altcoin) miner of 7 years, since the start of crypto pretty much, I used to mine solo, but cloud mining has been the answer for me as far as a living income.BetweenWhen you choose a cloud mining pool, you are making a smart choice because you will be mining more efficiently as a pool. You won't have dents in income from downtime and so on. It's a hot start, with income coming in the very first day and you will make profit in line with your investment. You can scale up pretty easily if you aren't able to afford much to start with.Mining a variety of coins allows you to have backup income streams rather than relying on one coin's value. Of course, the freedom is what really sold me on it all, now I don't have the headaches of ownership. All I do is log in, even on mobile, and check on my coins etc. Crypto won't go away and established cloud mining services add new, reliable coins to their selection often so you can pick what you mine for best results.I consider myself wealthy now but I didn't start out that way as a solo miner, mining Bitcoin in my room in a rental shared apartment!

The number of advert views, (i.e. hits or views your monetized video gets)The pay for the number of advert views is known technically as CPM. Now to make it trackable and easier, advertising companies such as Google, YouTube pay you for every 1000 views i.e. A particular amount is given to you for every 1000 views.Note: The amount depends on the niche the youtuber is into.Eg A gaming YouTuber might receive $4 for every 1000 views, while a real estate youtuber might receive as high as $15 per 1000 views.2. The number of Advert clicks;This second measure for payment is also known as CPC. Every time a viewer clicks on the link to the advertisers site, YouTube pays you an amount of money.This also includes the number of viewers that watch the video past the '5 seconds skip to video' time. Note that it's quite different from CPM we talked about above. You will be paid for this also.Note: This amount paid depends on the viewers region. And also depends on the niche your into!Eg YouTube would pay a tech youtuber up to $1.2 for an American viewers click, but from Canadian and Indian viewers click, it would be about $0.90 and $0.09 respectively.And like I said, it depends on your niche/area and type of advert. An advert for a game would pay less than an advert for cars or online trading.I'm a youtuber, that's why I can give some degree of exact figures._____________________________________For ExampleA youtuber with a monetized video of 1million view...",19 followers,Eric Muller,709,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-earn-rs-10k-per-month-from-mining-of-bitcoin-I-am-having-free-electricity

In 2009 you still had a reasonable chanche of find a block with a good gaming computer. In 2011 you needed a mining rig with several high end GPU’s and soon after that they created ASICS specialized computer cards build for solving the block algorythms.Today only the big boys are making a decent chanche of getting those rewards frequenlty. The big boys have now not a room full of ASICS but complete factory halls full of dedicated hardware.As you can imaging those ASICS are way more expensive than a ordinary gamecomputer. So your initial investment is pretty high. Which need to be earned back within a limited time because the arms race continues with even more expensive and more powerfull hardware.But let’s say you have acess to free or cheap hardware. Than you could start mining right ? Yess but there is another race running. The race of electricity prices.As you can imaging those powerfull hardware use a lot of power so much that a single mining rig could use more power in one hour than a normal household in a day ! Due the high cost of the inital investment (hardware) there is just a small margin to make real profit from cryptocurrency mining. The electricity bill has also to be paid from this small margin.Because this is a global thing the electricity prices vary wildly. The people that can still profit from this smal margin are living in countries with very low electricity prices (mainly china,island,some states in usa).",242 followers,Sumit Kumar,2.2K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-earn-rs-10k-per-month-from-mining-of-bitcoin-I-am-having-free-electricity

I run a small mine as an educational hobby in my garage. Using equipment purchased in 2014, I am currently running at 6,106 GH/s. This means on average I mine 0.04952418 BTC per day, using 5,442 watts of power. My marginal electricity cost is USD $0.1139 per kWh, so at the current (at the moment) bitcoin price of $380.99, I am making a profit of $3.99 per day. The reason I call it an educational hobby, however, is that the total return on the project since September, 2013, is -27.2 percent if I turned everything into dollars today. I keep the bitcoin I mine in bitcoin, because only an increase in the value of bitcoin could make the project profitable overall. My expenses so far are 72% equipment and 28% electricity, but of course that puts no value on the (large) amount of time I spent working on this. I've learned an amazing amount about bitcoin in the process, so I consider it a win either way.Update December 29, 2015: Bitcoin mining difficulty has increased significantly, the worldwide network is now making 786 quadrillion mining guesses per second. I am now mining 0.03299220 BTC per day, my marginal electricity cost has risen to USD $0.1152 per kWh, and at the current bitcoin price of USD $430.73, I am currently overpaying for the bitcoins I mine to the tune of USD $0.85 per day. My mine uses USD $455.56 worth of electricity to mine one bitcoin. On the other hand, the garage keeps the rest of the house warm in winter, so it's roughly a break-even operation for the time being. The overall operation would be -16.8 percent if I turned everything into dollars today, expenses so far are 70% equipment and 30% electricity. If bitcoin prices rise to USD $518 then I'm in the black.Update January 10, 2016: Rising bitcoin mining difficulty is taking its toll. Mining 0.02967912 BTC per day, but it costs USD $15.08 in electricity per day to operate the mine, so my effective BTC cost is USD $508.10. With the current market price of BTC at USD $440, it doesn't make sense to run much longer unless bitcoin prices rise. The whole project is -14.9% if I stopped right now and turned everything back into USD. The upside is that my hobby has returned 85.1% of its costs. Adding some pictures of the effort.Update June 11, 2016: Current mining operation is running at a loss, but whole project is now 11.6% in the black. ...","7,451 followers",Liya Sah,15K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-earn-rs-10k-per-month-from-mining-of-bitcoin-I-am-having-free-electricity

This convention is meant to keep Bitcoin users honest and was conceived by Bitcoin's founder, Satoshi NakamotoBy verifying transactions, miners are helping to prevent the ""double spending problem.""Double spending is a scenario in which a Bitcoin owner illicitly spends the same bitcoin twice. With physical currency, this isn't an issue: once you hand someone a $20 bill to buy a bottle of vodka, you no longer have it, so there's no danger you could use that same $20 bill to buy lotto tickets next door. While there is the possibility of counterfeit cash being made, it is not exactly the same as literally spending the same dollar twice. With digital currency, however, as the Investopedia dictionary explains, ""there is a risk that the holder could make a copy of the digital token and send it to a merchant or another party while retaining the original.""Let's say you had one legitimate $20 bill and one counterfeit of that same $20. If you were to try to spend both the real bill and the fake one, someone that took the trouble of looking at both of the bills' serial numbers would see that they were the same number, and thus one of them had to be false. What a Bitcoin miner does is analogous to that—they check transactions to make sure that users have not illegitimately tried to spend the same bitcoin twice. This isn't a perfect analogy—we'll explain in more detail below.Once miners have verified 1 MB (megabyte) worth of Bitcoin transactions, known as a ""block,"" those miners are eligible to be rewarded with a quantity of bitcoins (more about the bitcoin reward below as well). The 1 MB limit was set by Satoshi Nakamoto, and is a matter of controversy, as some miners believe the block size should be increased to accommodate more data, which would effectively mean that the bitcoin network could process and verify transactions more quickly.Note that verifying 1 MB worth of transactions makes a coin miner eligible1MB of transactions can theoretically be as small as one transaction (though this is not at all common) or several thousand. It depends on how much data the transactions take up.How to mine EthereumMiners play a crucial role in the Ethereum network by ensuring transactions between users are verified and added to the blockchain public ledger.Miners also enable new coins to be generated without the need for a third party central authority.In return for mining blocks, you’ll receive ETH as well as fees associated with the transaction.There is a lot of debate about how profitable Ethereum mining is, but if you believe ETH will continue increasing in value or simply want to play a part in the Ethereum network, these are the steps you need to take.Choose a GPUTo mine Ethereum, you’ll need to buy special computer hardware called a Graphical Processing Unit (GPU). When choosing a GPU, it’s important to consider the cost of the actual hardware itself, as well as its power consumption and hash rate.The hash rate is the speed at which the mining device operates. In cryptocurrency mining, speed is important because miners are essentially trying to solve a question and get rewards before anyone else. The higher the hash rate, the greater your chances are of finding the next block and receiving a reward.Some miners decide to set up a mining rig, which is a machine composed of several GPU units. A mining rig will increase your hash rate and therefore boost your chances of successful mining.Install softwareOnce you’ve bought your mining hardware, you need to install the required software. Drivers for your graphics card are either provided with the card itself or available on the manufacturer’s website.The next step is to download the Ethereum blockchain and connect your node to the network. You can use a service like Geth, which continuously attempts to connect to other nodes on the network until it has peers.Once installed, your node will be connected to all the other nodes and the Ethereum network itself. This allows you to start mining, deploy your own smart contracts, build decentralised apps, and send transactions.Test your mining capabilitiesBefore you start mining, you can mine test Ether on your own private network. This enables you to test your mining capabilities, experiment with smart contracts, and try out new decentralised apps.You don’t need any special hardware to mine Ether on a test network – you just need your home computer with Geth, or a similar client, installed. You are the only user in a private test network, meaning you are responsible for finding all the blocks, validating transactions, and executing smart contracts.Join a mining poolIf you join a mining pool, you can pool your computational power with other miners to improve your chances of solving the cryptographic puzzles and earning Ether. Being part of a mining pool tends to be much more profitable than trying to mine Ether on your own. Profits are split between all the miners in the pool according to their contributed computational power.Install EthminerOnce your node is connected to the Ethereum network, you need to install mining software called Ethminer. This acts like an intermediary between your hardware and the mining pool. Ethminer is an Ethash GPU mining worker, which enables you to mine every coin that relies on an Ethash Proof of Work – for example, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Metaverse, Musicoin, Ellaism, Pirl, and Expanse.Ethminer is a command line programme, so you can launch it from a Windows command prompt or Linux console or create shortcuts to predefined command lines using a Linux Bash script or Windows batch/cmd file.Get paidOnce you’ve successfully mined a block, you’ll get paid ETH and the fees associated with the transaction. The reward is almost instantly transferred to the Ethereum wallet linked with the miner or miners’ pool.You can use an Ethereum profitability calculator to work out your approximate income. Your estimated income is based on factors such as your hash rate, electricity consumption, and initial set-up costs.Ethereum’s core team is currently working on implementing a new mining algorithm called Progressive Proof-of-Work, which is designed to make mining more accessible to the wider community. There is no fixed plan for its implementation, but the developers hope it will make mining via a GPU more profitable in the future.[ATTENTION!!]Bitcoin or Ethereum mining can be really expensive and can cost upward of $15,000 but you can trade this coins and earn high return on investment weekly with a minimum startup capital of using your mobile phone or PC",356 followers,Gordon Miller,598,10K,165.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-earn-rs-10k-per-month-from-mining-of-bitcoin-I-am-having-free-electricity

Some experts even muse that ether has the potential to overtake bitcoin in the future.What are the reasons behind the expected rise of the world’s #2 digital currency?Will Ethereum Induce “The Flippening”?“Olaf Carlson-Wee, CEO of Polychain Capital hedge fund, is one who believes ether will surpass bitcoin’s market cap as early as this year.“Last time I was on here, I said Ethereum would pass bitcoin by the end of 2018. I would actually hold to that right now,” he toldThe more prevalent prediction is that the value of ether should settle around US $1,500, according to research conducted byWhile it’s impossible to know exactly what chances ether has of overtaking bitcoin, there is little doubt that ether’s price is ready to move upwards. After exuberant heights, it now seems undervalued, even vis a vis bitcoin.One of the differences between ether and bitcoin is that ether is faster, with transactions settling in seconds as opposed to minutes. Also, Ethereum is more versatile: it is a platform and operating system for distributed computing with its own currency. Its blockchain is more sophisticated, capable of storing computer code, while the bitcoin blockchain is more like a database of wallets with an amount of currency in each.The Surge of Dapps on the Ethereum NetworkThe Ethereum network appears to be well-positioned to remain the leading platform for launching ICOs in upcoming years. Decentralised applications known as “Dapps” are also ceaselessly popping up on the Ethereum network.“What you’re seeing with Ethereum is exponential increase in the number of projects — there are billions of dollars being poured into the ecosystem right now — maybe 10 times more projects this year than last year, which could easily lead to a doubling, probably a tripling in price by the end of the year,” saysMoreover, the research team at“Ethereum’s usage in decentralised blockchain applications will go up 20- to 30-fold over the next 5 to 7 years. That is not an overstatement, but rather an understatement,” says the team.Smart Contracts & Proof-of-StakeSmart contracts are one major reason why Ethereum’s popularity is spiking. For the uninitiated, these are blockchain-based digital contracts that are executed automatically without a third party’s involvement and risk of fraud. “It is the foundation of the majority of past and current ICOs in today’s cryptocurrency market,” notesEthereum is also planning to switch this year from its current proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake algorithm. Although the switch will be partial at first, it has the potential to address scaling issues.“The Ethereum network expects big changes in the next few months. Ethereum officially announced plans to change to proof-of-stake. Now they’re testing proof-of-stake technology. We will have to see how profitable operations will be after the change,” saidIsMiner One’s business plan includes the option to upgrade mining hardware and start mining ether when or if this becomes more profitable. For now, according to Slusnys, bitcoin remains the most profitable mining option.

Since analysis and verification are tedious, they employ the services of miners and give them rewards.Miners utilize their computer power to skim through the transactions and sort them out. This sorting and verification involve solving complex mathematical problems trying to get to the correct hash. Once a miner or a group of miners hit the correct hash, they present the solution to the developer, who rewards them with a block of coins. The miners also receive a commission of the transaction fees. This process is what is referred to as the proof of work (PoW).Mining of any particular coin becomes increasingly difficult with time.The Best Coins to Mine With GPUGPUs are graphics cards specialized for solving the cryptographic problems involved in the mining process. The graphics cards are much faster than the CPUs or Central Processing Units that were used in the initial stages of cryptocurrency development. These graphics cards are of different types. Certain GPUs mine various algorithms/coins better than others. It is important that you get the right GPU depending on the coin/s you want to mine.Zencash (ZEN) is one of the best cryptocurrencies to mine using GPUs in 2018. This coin runs on the Equihash algorithm.

Generally every 6–12 months you can expect to cycle out the older miners and replace them with a fresh batch, usually this is done over time so that there is no disruption in hashing rate or earnings.Like any business, this takes hard work to setup and maintain, however, the profits can be very lucrative if done properly.Hope this helps.

17,"You’ve probably heard of cryptocurrency (orYou’ve probably heard of cryptocurrency (orYou might have done some research but thought it looked too technical or complicated. We’re here to tell you that it’s not!Read on as we walk you through it and cover several great ways of earning an income with cryptocurrency.– 1 –Buy and holdBuying and holding is the method you’re probably most familiar with when it comes to investing and making money with cryptocurrency: You purchase some sort of asset (like stocks), you let interest build up, and then you eventually cash out.It’s the same idea in buying and holding with crypto, except you are waiting for the price of your chosen currency to go up so you can sell at a rate higher than when you bought. This is one of the best and easiest ways to focus on how to make money in cryptocurrency.For example Bitcoin was worth around $13 in 2013, and at the most peak price we’ve seen so far was nearly $20,000 in 2018.If you’d like to know how to make money with cryptocurrency by using buying and holding, we have some articles ready for you so you can get your coins and get started!How to buy bitcoinHow to buy liteconHow to buy ethereumHow to buy rippleWhile there are MANY different coins out there, we recommend you stick to the 4 mentioned above. These are the safest and have been around for a while. If you invest in a new coin it might be cheap to buy lots of them, but there’s a very high chance the coin could just disappear. Coins that have been around a while don’t have that same risk.If you’re ready to buy, we recommend that you visit Coinbase, which has been ranked as the most “beginner friendly” exchange.– 2 –Buy and hold for dividendsThe strategy and currencies above will pay you when you eventually sell at a higher price than when you bought. However, some currencies will actually pay you just for holding them, which makes this a very lucrative method of making money You don’t actually purchase or own the cryptocurrency…you simply hold it and keep it in circulation. Some examples of these coins are:– 3 –Staking cryptocurrenciesThis strategy combines the first two we mentioned: you buy a currency, hold it, plan to sell it for a profit at a later time, AND you also receive dividends from just holding it. This is a great secret in making money with cryptocurrency.Some examples of these currencies are:– 4 –MiningWhen considering how to make money with cryptocurrency, mining is one of the methods that always comes up. Mining cryptocurrency is one of the best ways to make money with altcoins as it’s extremely passive:But there’s the only possible issue…investing in the equipment. While you can mine cryptocurrency without extremely high end hardware, the better the hardware, the faster it can create more coins for you and the better your chance of actually making money. Mining works by having computers solve complex mathematical problems, and when they solve them, you are rewarded with cryptocurrency.The thing is that as more cryptocurrency is created, the problems get harder and harder, and so if you don’t have a high end system, it can take a LONG time to solve things. You might also need cooling units, extra electricity upgrades, and more to support all this.Also MANY different people are trying to solve the same problem at the same time. If your computer is too slow and someone else solves the problems first, you get nothing, so investing in a high end system is almost always needed.– 5 –Day tradingThis method is a bit more advanced and involves looking for patterns in financial trading charts every day. Because cryptocurrency is very volatile in that the price can change drastically over a day, someone who constantly tracks the price over a day can make a very large return on investment by buying some coins in one hour, and selling them an hour later.We wouldn’t recommend this if you’re a beginner, or if you don’t want to follow charts every single day. If this sounds like you, it would be better to consider the other options. But if you have experience in trading or previous knowledge in crypto, this could be– 6 –MicrotasksIf you’re wondering how to make money in cryptocurrency, you should consider microtasks. These are small services you do for someone and you receive payment in cryptocurrency. You might fill out an online survey, test an app, debug a website, or something similar.Cointasker estimates that a single microtask will, on average, pay out 0.00001426BTC, or around $0.90 (as of July 2018), for around 10 minutes of work.Some websites where you can find lists of microtasks that pay out in cryptocurrency are:You can also apply for freelancing jobs on sites like Upwork, and ask to be paid in cryptocurrency. Be sure if you do this that you respect the terms of service and rules of the site though.– 7 –Work for cryptocurrencyAs we mentioned in the microtasks section, many employers are happy to pay for work in cryptocurrency. If youBlogs that are specifically dedicated to cryptocurrency are also happy to pay writers who want to work in crypto as well.Here are some sites you can browse:– 8 –Currency and exchange arbitrageCryptocurrency exchanges are simply online platforms that allow you to make accounts, and login to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. But, the price of a currency in one exchange might be different to that in another, and the prices of all the currencies are also always changing.By tracking these numbers you can make a profit: You might buy low on one exchange and sell high on another. You could also buy one cryptocurrency and then invest into another that has a lower dollar per coin value. This way you’d own more coins overall with the hope of the higher number of coins making you a profit compared to if you had stayed with the other coins, and owned less of them.– 9 –FaucetsYou should know that there are various apps and websites that offer bitcoins as a reward for completing a designated task. These websites or apps are known as bitcoin faucets and there are thousands of them online. The only catch is that the amount of bitcoins they give is very small, and it varies from 100 Satoshis (0.000001 BTC) to 10,000 Satoshis (0.0001 BTC).The tasks you usually complete range from things like clicking on ads, watching videos, and filling out surveys. Here are a list of bitcoin faucets you can look at.– 10 –Affiliate marketingIf you own a website or business, this might be a good way of making some extra money. In simple terms, affiliate marketing is where you’re paid a commission when someone from your website clicks a link of another company, and purchases one of their products. If the company offers payouts in coins, you can choose this instead of getting paid in cash.– 11 –Trading botsFor strategies like day trading, you need to be looking at charts and your computer constantly, manually buying and selling when you think the time is right. This involves a lot of work using your own brain to come up with predictions based on the data…not to mention staring at complex financial charts for hours on end. When you’re still figuring out how to make money with cryptocurrency, this can definitely be exhausting and tedious.As with most things in the world today, this process has been automated in a great way: computers can perform thousands of calculations much faster than you or I, and use algorithms as well as data science to predict crypto pricing strategies.By investing in a crypto trading bot, you can have something automatically buying and selling at the right time based on thousands of data points instead of having to manually guess or look at a screen 24 hours a day. The bot will do the trading for you.","358,993 followers",Sean Kernan,5.5K,5.6K,727.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-earn-rs-10k-per-month-from-mining-of-bitcoin-I-am-having-free-electricity

Many think that mining cryptocurrency means you can pick up all the digital currencies you have mined and keep them as yours. But unfortunately, that is not the case in the practical mining process. Miners use their computers to solve complex mathematical equations that validate blocks of transactions. Cryptocurrencies are already created inside a protocol that gets on to the market when it is cracked with valid keys. As a result, the person who engages in the mining process gets a reward. Interested candidates usually join mining networks and engage in mining work with other members.Engage in DeFi Yield FarmingSimilar to crypto mining, decentralized finance projects also need somebody to work for them. But unline mining, is a process of locking the funds in the network. Yield Farming, also known as Liquidity Mining, is a method of locking funds and granting liquidity to a DeFi token.

Mostly, the reward comes in form of a digital token.Just Shop and get ‘Bitcoin Back’In a move to promote their platform and fulfill cryptocurrency enthusiasts’ needs, many online sellers are leveraging disruptive ways to attract consumers.

You just need to buy some cryptos and hold them for a while. In exchange, developers pay you for holding their digital assets. Besides, you don’t even have to stake them in your wallet, just holding them for a while will do the work. The mechanism behind this is that a digital currency’s value goes up based on the number of buyers it gets. Therefore, developers try to attract more buyers by showing that they have a good amount of investors already. COSS, CEFF, KUCOIN, and NEO are some of the famous dividend providers.Get Employed at Cryptocurrency CompaniesThere is a never-dying need for workers in the cryptocurrency sphere. Cryptocurrency companies are always looking for candidates who can fill digital marketing, content creation, and web designing profiles.
