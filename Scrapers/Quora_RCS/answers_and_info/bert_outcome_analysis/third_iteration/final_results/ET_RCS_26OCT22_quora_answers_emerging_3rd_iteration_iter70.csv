Why did I pick 7 years ? Beause after 7 yers experience, a hardcore CS degree and having argued with Microsoft over how opertating systems should work for IBM at its Labs, I got an email telling me that I was now a Programmer. not senior or anything, just ProgrammerAs a heahunter, I’ve seen people taken on as associate directors who are new graduate software engineers.So the deeper question is whether as developers get better at their craft the curve of average earnings diverges according to gender rather than abiity.I simply do not see that at all in terms of pay offered to peple taking new jobs.I see the reverse, that most firms HR areYou may find the idea that there is not discrimination in this situation offensive, for which I apologise.That being said, most firms do not have good methods for evaluating developers they hire, some have so little regard for quality that theyAlso pay is not very well related to ability and that’s not a gender thing. Any measure of developer productivity shows that within a group of say 20 programmers the average willWhere there is a gap is how your pay evolves over the time in a given job.Although as it says at the top of this answer that I’m a headhunter, you can find me also as a journalist, like here. I understand that what you say is not what people hear and that what you want to say to feel good about yourself is not what persuades people to act the way you want them to.So I have to endureIf you’ve been to a diversity in the last few years you may have seen a grey haired white cis straight male leaninng forward and sighingI don’t seem women staying much longer in banking and tech jobs, maybe it’s true, but for me not to see it, the difference must be relatively small.I do know,Telling employers (over and bloody over again) that women are less likely to quit, is heard as the employer realising he doesn’t need to offer as much money to make them stay. This doesn’t even have to be true, all you need is for employers toThat’s why when they transition, they don’t experience a pay gap, but when they stick in the same job, they do.","1,201 followers",Yad Konrad,1.6K,586,3.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-wage-gap-between-the-top-technology-companies-and-smaller-companies-for-software-engineers
