4,"So you’re looking for the most OP combination in the universe huh?Let’s keep this simple. I will choose one character with a lot of power, one character with a lot of learned/acquired abilities, and one technological weapon to combine to create the most OP MCU character imaginable.1: Power–Thor OdinsonFor pure power, the most OP MCU character that comes to mind is Thor. With his new axe and his increased control over lighting, he is arguably even more deadly than Scarlet Witch.2: Learned/Acquired Abilities–Ancient OneTechnically speaking, all the power Ancient One has is from learning.

With his new axe and his increased control over lighting, he is arguably even more deadly than Scarlet Witch.2: Learned/Acquired Abilities–Ancient OneTechnically speaking, all the power Ancient One has is from learning. She has learned to manipulate the very building blocks of the universe, and has the ability to not only extend her lifespan but also manipulate reality to an extent.3: Technological Item–Infinity GauntletFrankly, this weapon makes any other OP combination unnecessary. With the full power of the Infinity Stones, anything is possible. Time, reality, nothing is off limits. The only limitation is that the Infinity Gauntlet might burn out if it is used to much. However, the power of the Ancient One could probably restore it if necessary.So what we have is Thor, with the acquired reality manipulation of the Ancient One, Stormbreaker, and the fully powered Infinity Gauntlet.That (in my opinion), is the most powerful combination in the MCU.","5,999 followers",Johan Torres,6K,1.8K,24.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-locations-not-countries-had-the-most-advanced-technologies-and-or-magic-in-the-Marvel-Universe

To Asgardians, space travel, force fields, laser guns, etc. are all commonplace and perfectly normal technology.Just look at the Bifrost:This invention could propel multiple people through space to precise points at ridiculous speeds, to the point you could almost call it teleportation.Wakanda has nothing to compare to that.Even the medical technology of Asgard is superior to Wakandan technology:The main reason Wakanda is considered so advanced is because of their vibranium, an element somehow useful forAsgard.The technology of Asgard is so advanced, to people from earth it looks like magic.

6,"I’d have to say Hawkeye.Someone had mentioned that he’s got no powers AND fights with ancient weapons. That’s pretty much spot on if you take out the tricked-out arrows.And yet, he’s deadset in the middle of everything.He soloed a helicarrier carrying the Avengers and actually won.(And yes he did win! Don’t argue with me. That big-ass floating castle was going down before the Avengers saved it.)He was the “eyes” in the New York Battle and also hit Loki with an exploding arrow that led him into that iconic scene with the Hulk, and eventually being captured.He took out Wanda after she had mind-fI’d have to say Hawkeye.Someone had mentioned that he’s got no powers AND fights with ancient weapons.

It was a nice touch to the film.)He gave Wanda the pep talk she needed to realize what being an Avenger meant in the battle against Ultron in Sokovia.He was willing to shield a child he knew nothing about, with his own body knowing full well he was gonna die from it. Remember, this is a man with a wife and kids and he was willing to give all that up, to save a stranger’s life.(Yes, I know QS ended up saving him BUT he was willing to do it with no knowledge of anyone coming to save him. I mean look at that face ^. That’s the face of a man whose ready to face death to save that child. If that’s not a Hero, I don’t know what is)Did I mention that he did all this without powers? I did? Oh ok. Just checking.Anyway, in Civil War, he plays a crucial role in helping Wanda break out of her house arrest.He then goes on to help Team Cap by bringing in Ant-Man(Scott Lang) AND fighting in the Airport team brawl against IRON MAN, WAR MACHINE, VISION, SPIDER-MAN and BLACK PANTHER!!Are you serious? That’s absolutely nuts! Think about it. If I told you to go pick up a bow and a couple arrows because in half an hour you’re going to fight 3 guys with high-tech suits, an Android powered by an infinity stone and a super human with the powers similar to that of a spider, would you? Or would you think I’m off my meds?(I’m not btw, I take em every day at 11am) And what does Clint do? He picks up above mentioned bow and arrow, and joins.Anyway, that’s why I think Hawkeye is legit underrated.Hope this helps.Cheers.","1,039 followers",Ramtin Mesgari,4.2K,196,6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-locations-not-countries-had-the-most-advanced-technologies-and-or-magic-in-the-Marvel-Universe

8,"The Asgardians aren’t really “gods” since they feed off Idunn’s Golden Apples of Immortality to sustain their lifespan, strength and durability.
