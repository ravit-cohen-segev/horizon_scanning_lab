1,"First of all let me grab this opportunity to congratulate you on this achievement. It is not easy to get placed in the Top IT company of India.Now let’s move on to your question.First of all I would like to say that your question itself was incorrect. Instead of asking if you should join TCS or search for other job you should be asking what skills do I need to learn in order to outperform in TCS.In IT industry it doesn’t matter if you are from IT background or Non-IT background. The only thing that matters is that do you have the skills to perform your job satisfactorily, do you have the rightFirst of all let me grab this opportunity to congratulate you on this achievement.

2,"Hi,Once you're in TCS, you're no more a mechanical engineer. You are now a “software engineer”.Just learn the IT roles and new technology and grow. If you don't want to be a part of IT, then it's better for you to do something what you like.If you're looking something specific to mechanical engineering in TCS, then you're in wrong sector.",419 followers,Bikramjit B,595,51,427.4K,2016,https://www.quora.com/I-am-Mechanical-engineer-placed-in-TCS-IT-stream-Should-I-join-or-search-for-other-job-Is-there-growth-in-TCS-in-IT-for-mechanical
3,I myself am mechanical engineer and was got placed at tcs. But I eventually didnt took job in it. We have studied 4 years in mechanical then y waste our knowledge going after an IT field. I know its hard to get core jobs nowadays but either you should go for further studies so that u can get better future opportunities or you can take a job in small scale industry and get experience for few months and then do further studies like masters program. It will be very helpful to you in sense of progress rather then staying at an IT firm.,240 followers,Sean Carron,1K,0,0,2016,https://www.quora.com/I-am-Mechanical-engineer-placed-in-TCS-IT-stream-Should-I-join-or-search-for-other-job-Is-there-growth-in-TCS-in-IT-for-mechanical
