However, astounding technical ignorance is not limited to the cops. Their adversaries aren’t too smart either.Some officers at another cop-shop found themselves up against a suspect who was even more technically inept than they were. They told him they had a new LIE-DETECTOR, then placed a colander (the kitchen utensil that strains veg) on his head. The colander had a wire attached to it that ran to their copier, in which was a piece of paper with the words “HE’S LYING” printed on it.Every time he answered a question, they solemnly pushed the “copy” button and of course, the machine spewed out a piece of paper with the words on it.Eventually, the suspect CONFESSED!One can only imagine the ribbing he took from his fellow inmates, once justice had taken its course.

3,"Essentially, in ‘escalation order’.Essentially, in ‘escalation order’.This, really, is where the “normal”process pretty much ends. Further note that not all steps might happen in order. Any department can directly call the national guard if they need too. In reality, outside of comic books, no criminal is going to be able to deal with the national guard. Hell, state police is almost always the end of it. (Off the top of my head, I can’t think of a time that the national guard was actually used because of an individual or small group of criminals being “more than the police can handle” Usually they are called up for things like riot control, when more manpower, not technical capability, is needed. The closest incidents I can think of are the “killdozer” incident in colorado, and the Tank Rampage in San Diego, where calling the national guard was at least considered. However, in both cases, regular law enforcement was able to deal with the problem.)If things are past that point, it’s the pentagon.

In this context we follow the story of a US journalist escorting his bosses's daughter through this area to the United States.*Spoilers alert*Alien invasions in movies are basically all the same : a race of super advanced extra-terrestrials come to Earth to take its resources, and human beings have to defend their home. And because they’re the good guys, they win.That’s basically it.It’s like any invasion done by one country to another, but from space. So they are all realistic on this point. That is, if we consider that a super advanced civilization that can travel light years away from its home world has to depend on resources from other planets to survive, or doesn’t have the technology to wipe us out well before we even realize they’re here. So, actually, none of them are realistic, I guess.I chose Monsters because it has one big difference : the aliens are not advanced beings. They are animals. They were brought on Earth and lost by accident, and then, they just did what they do. Just like any other being on the planet, they multiplied and adapted to the environment, and it happened that they were good at it and invaded half of Mexico.But they are not “evil”. They just are. They do what they evolved to do. The invasion, in this case, is a natural process. The creatures need territory to live in and reproduce, so they expand it. They “infect” trees because that’s how they are at larva stage.The problem being of course that this is detrimental to us. These creatures are attracted to electric appliances, which means they enter in conflict with humans when entering their territory. They are also gigantic, which means they wreck havoc when they do and may kill some people in the process.This is the most realistic “invasion”, because we see it all the time. A species migrate to a different place for some reason, and enter in conflict with other species that are already there. Humans went to new places and introduced animals who destroyed endemic species. This still happens now. Humans themselves destroyed countless living creatures without even trying, because they had an evolutionary advantage. It is not far fetched to think that it could happen to us as well.We have no idea what life on other worlds would look like, if it even exist. It may or may not be intelligent. If advanced beings come to us, it may be in peace or not. They may treat us as intelligent creatures, or no better than how we treat insects. We have no way to know. On the contrary, if they are not advanced, we can be sure of one thing : nature will just do what it does.",114 followers,Nafis Mustafa,609,101,92.5K,2020,https://www.quora.com/Do-the-police-possess-advanced-technologies-like-portrayed-in-the-movies

Were they wrong, 50 years ago? I don’t think so - a lot of jobsThe problem is that many of those new jobs are useless. A recent poll in the UK found that as much as 37% of British workers think they have an utterly meaningless job. They could go on strike, and no one would care (in my book ‘Utopia for Realists’ I tell the story of a strike of bankers in the 1970s in Ireland - it lasted for 6 months and nothing much happened).Time and time again, we underestimate capitalism’s extraordinary ability to come up with new bullshit jobs. It’s 37% in the UK right now, but it could be 50%, 60% or even 100% in the future.Again: it’s not about the technology, it’s about the choices we make as a society. When it comes to universal basic income: we don’t have to wait for the robots. We are more than rich enough to do it right now - in fact, we should have done it 40 years ago! In the book I tell the story of how Richard Nixon (!) almost implemented a modest basic income at the beginning of the seventies. His plan didn’t fail because of technological reasons.

Just about everything I research on the subject is only talking about the upsides of such innovation. Everything has a price, and is this a deal we're willing to make?Of late, I've been researching all I can about future technology, and I'm completely unsatisfied with the notion that technology will solve our problems. It won't solve our problems—it's steadily making them worse. What was the cost of the current modern world? Nuclear war, global warming, and a perversion of our culture.The debt will only increase, and as we continue to reap the benefits from technology and congratulating ourselves on our ingenuity, we will become hopelessly addicted and enslaved to its magnetic screen. I'm not discounting that it's already happening, and we are in the beginning stages of it. The consequences will only become more severe, and we may have to abandon the Earth because even Mars looks more promising than a war-torn planet.Right now, it's easy to see an idyllic future, as humans are optimistic by nature. Our capitalistic system makes it seem that 'new' equals 'better' when this isn't necessarily the case. Products made in earlier generations lasted longer for one. My cheaply made desk collapsed within two years of purchasing, while my current desk was manufactured in the 19th century, and it serves me well. Are things that are made with machines necessarily better?The increase in interest toward STEM showcases this point. In humanities, we're hopelessly out of ideas, and we've all but given up on the cultural aspect of society, opting instead for a universal, bland culture. Politics is almost sickening, and we've already tried every political system possible—what's the point? You know we're a sick society when a Montana leader body-slams a reporter and he managed to win. STEM is practical, while the humanities are so controversial, if you say anything remotely original, you're a bigot, and get the hell off of my screen. Something like math is the most uncontroversial way you can be smart, because with math, there is either a right or wrong. Humanities? Open to interpretation and unique to its population.With STEM, I've noticed a stigma with ideas that don't align with the perfect future agenda. Whenever people warn about something that isn't mainstream, people ignore their warnings and continue to innovate as if nothing bad will become of it.Eventually, this illusion will fade when we're confronted with the issue. AI has been nicknamed the last invention, which may become all too true. People neglect that pesky detail, and they only focus on the positives, making it seem like we'll invent our way to a utopia.Technology has disastrous consequences, and we're running into a brick wall with our eyes shut. When we crash is the question, and how much will we be hurt? Will we be merely dazed or will it stupefy us? If we are successfully knocked unconscious, AI could either nurse us back to health, or do unspeakable things while we’re vulnerable? With the previous blunders by the human race, at least we knew that another person would either help or hurt us, not something as foreign, emotionless, and super intelligent as a computer. For the first time in eons, another thing could replace us on the food chain. We would no longer be the most intelligent beings on The Earth.So no, we're a few Jenga blocks away from tumbling our society.

That’s not my role in life, so I am less familiar with the companies you describe and their offerings. Time and attention are scarce, so I would rather myself at this point concentrate on unfolding my own approach than worrying too much about what others are doing.If Kensho offer a tool for hedge funds, who is it that is going to be using it, if not hedge funds ? The boundary between traditional and quant hedge funds is not necessarily so pronounced. I understand that Louis Bacon didn’t really use Bloomberg (let alone more sophisticated third-party analytics) till about 2000 or a little after that, but it’s been many years since a purely discretionary approach without the use of quant tools has been anything more than a somewhat exotic minority - for risk management purposes, if nothing else.Some people wish to replace human capability by machines - I think that’s a valid approach up to a point in certain domains, but that in the end a human aided by a machine will do better than a machine on its own when it comes to financial markets because I do not believe that machines can be creative in the same way that humans can, and if I am wrong I do not think it will happen in my lifetime. (I have written elsewhere about the difficulties of extrapolations based on Moore’s Law).That doesn’t mean that technology won’t have a massive impact on the industry and on the careers of people within it. The tale of the handloom weaver is a sobering one, and technology will change the skill sets that are in demand and that are well-compensated. One thing is clear - if you are doing a job that can be better done by a machine, then the outlook is not very bright. That implies a two-fold strategy: if you can’t beat them join them (become directly involved in systematising what can be systematised, and in building tools to help with discretionary investing), and doing the quintessentially human thing better. If there’s something a little robotic and reflexive about much discretionary work, perhaps now is a time to move beyond that and develop what is most human about how one approaches markets. As Peter Thiel says, competition is for losers, and that means that one will do best developing approaches that are to an extent intrinsically part of who one is and that cannot therefore be easily copied or imitated algorithmically. People can copy an idea, but they cannot copy the understanding of the world and way of thinking that led to coming up with that idea. That requires a certain tolerance and encouragement of less conventional thinking, approaches, and people, something that isn’t always easy when people feel besieged.I am happy to see competition in the provision of tools, because what we have right now on the market is pretty poor - compared to other industries I feel embarrassed, as finance has been lagging. It was common-sense in 1996 when I graduated and started working in trading exotics that depending on spreadsheets had severe limitations, and years later on the proprietary side we are still using spreadsheets (and on the sell side, the JPM Whale affair - something exacerbated by an error in a risk management spreadsheet - and most spreadsheets have errors).I started working on building tools to help me with discretionary investing in late 2013 - many people I knew looked at my like I had three eyes when I told them about this, and it was only a few weeks ago that, for example, Tudor (still a leading fund) appointed someone senior to be in charge of discretionary trading technology. Ken Griffin hired a big data guy from Amazon only a couple of years back.There’s a long way to catch up even with what’s implicit in the basic technology, let alone accomplishing truly ground-breaking stuff. Of course, the future is unevenly distributed (William Gibson), which means that to a certain extent the old and new co-exist.For the time being, I think better technology is an opportunity for those who are able to adapt and to think about how to solve their problems better using technology, and to build entirely new tools.

Indians were known for constructing multi story buildings, just read the xuanxang accounts of nalanda university who’s walls were so high that the rain would fall from the top due to condensed vapours, this is not stated by indians by by foreign visitors to india. all these gigantic constructions didn’t survive because of 1) war, 2) climatic conditions of india 3) they used bricks, they didn’t use slaves like romans to tow gigantic rocks to construct roman temples.regards","29,946 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,1.6K,7.7K,249.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Do-the-police-possess-advanced-technologies-like-portrayed-in-the-movies

In my article, I talk about the Greek historian Thoukydides (lived c. 460 – c.  400 BC), who rejected the idea of an ancient Golden Age. Instead, he believed that humanity was growing steadily more advanced and that the Greeks of very early times must have been exceedingly primitive compared to Greeks of his own era.There were certainly Romans who thought similar things, although I cannot think of any specific examples off the top of my head. Nonetheless, I’m sure that even the ancient Romans who did realize that humans were growing more technologically advanced probably wouldn’t have imagined the kinds of technologies we have today.Back then, technological progress was moving much more slowly than it is today and I’m sure that even most progressive-minded Romans probably would have assumed that it happened at a constant rate. As it turns out, though, technological progress is exponential; every new invention makes the next invention come a little bit faster. Consequently, we have technologies today that few people in ancient times would have even dreamed of.ABOVE: Image of a man dressed in a less-than-historically-accurate Roman soldier costume riding on a Segway poorly disguised as a chariot","1,413 followers",Sven Jeske,2.3K,635,2.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Do-the-police-possess-advanced-technologies-like-portrayed-in-the-movies

These regions are roughly comparible in size, have broadly similar advantages and disadvantages and each enables the formation of a major power that would be comparibly strong to the other three. This is exactly what happened historically, at different times.East of the Rhine you have Germany and beyond that the Eurasian steppe that also allows for formation of major agricultural powers at least, although it’s not as neatly enclosed as those four.You have the Mediterranean, an almost enclosed inland sea, with just a tiny breathing hole at the western edge and clearly separated into several distinct regions: western and eastern Mediterranean, Adriatic sea, another tiny breathing hole into the Black sea and of course a major city closing the Bosphorus and acting as an ancient capital. You have islands of enormous strategic value, Sicily is rich and fertile, Cyprus is essential for naval control of eastern Mediterranean. You have Balears, Greek islands and Malta, each with strategic value. South of that you have northen Africa, a narrow fertile strip of land on top of the Sahara desert that is not as rich, but still valuable to hold and as the same time not at all easy to take. You have Egypt, an agricultural powerhouse right nexto Jerusalem, a city coveted for spiritual reasons.You have Balkans, a tough land with marginal resources, limited by a major river - the Danube - which enables significant seaborne trade between the Black sea and the Eastern mark (Austria) and enables what would otherwise be an agricultural backwater to grow into a potential superpower.To the north you have Scandinavia, agriculturaly poor but endowned with vital mineral resources and well protected by frigid seas and harsh climate both.All this is before we even begin to consider the human geography, with Christianity and its own anticts of disunity of 1000 C.E., a later introduction of Islam who did the disunity thing even better, then the Protestant reformation. Linguistically you have three major groups (Germanic, Latin, Slavic) and at least three minor but nonetheless important groups (Greek, Ugro-Finnish, Baltic), before you even consider Turkish and Arabic (you might not count them under Europe). On top ofMost of this existed and was relevant in some fashion when Western Rome was still around.China is boring by comparisonBy contrast, China has a simple geographical map with one major flat region lining the coast from Bejing almost all the way down to Vietnam. Mountain ranges are all inland and do not separate the region into distinct areas of similar power. Major rivers all run west to east and do not open up areas for trade that would otherwise be locked in by mountain ranges. There are no regions that would be exceptionally different from the others and there is no way to create solid kingdoms closed in by solid mountain barriers, like with Spain and Italy, or else viable island kingdoms, such as the British isles. Korea and Japan could act in this manner, but both were tributary states to China, not parts of their empire and never able to challenge Chinese supierority anyhow.Human geography follows suit, with some 90% of population being Han chinese. Religion plays a far less important role in politics and society at large. There are occasional invasions of nomads from the north, but they usually just take over and get assimilated into the far larger agricultural society.In other words, whenever China fell apart like Rome did, there would eventually form a faction that would ultimately be able to unite the rich lands under one banner. In Europe this is far more difficult to achieve, for a myrad of reasons.

The Greeks did have a wonderful system of sciences and technology but Indians and Chinese were at par with the Greeks. Indian philosophy had deeply affected Greek thought. Greeks adopted Egyptian, Mesopotamian and Indian sciences and developed them to New levels. Indians later on used this Greek base to develop even more advanced concepts in the 6th century and afterwards. At the time of Roamans, Indians and Chinese had pretty advanced scientific and technological achievements. The fact about Rome importing more from India than exporting proves many things without doubt. During the time of Greeks, India and China were pretty advanced and nowhere behind the Greeks. Later on, during the Romans, India and China went ahead in areas of spirituality, chemical and mathematical sciences, India specially in astronomy and civil engineering and other Industrial technologies. Production of fine textiles, sugarcane refining, spices etc. Were prevalent to a really advanced level in India. There are mentions of Atleast two expeditions sent by Chinese to India to learn about sugarcane refining and other such industrial technology. India at that time was undergoing rapid industrialisation. It was influenced by the kushans culture, and by the Greek culture as well. India at this time was the richest country. Many people think of gdp per capita as the sole basis of richness. The amount of gold and precious gems India accumulated during this time is enormous. Romans tried to ban Indian goods but as I mentioned, Indians were too good at smuggling. This is all mentioned by historians. Romans used to believe that Indians have an indefinite appetite for gold and other precious gems.

In fact, in the armor and shOf all the answers I’ve seen,A bloody draw is a likely answer.Technology-IntroductionRome was past Iron Age at this point. Certainly, their ability to construct siege weaponry, fortifications, and armor put them quite ahead of the pack. In fact, in the armor and shielding category, I’d put them ahead of the Chinese.However, to counter this, Chinese crossbow and ranged fire technology is significant. I’m not sure about the armor-piercing power, but as the Parthians have proved before, Tetsudos are not invincible. You can whittle them down with enough discipline and firepower.In armor, the Romans used segmented plate armor, which in my personal opinion offers a greater deal of protection compared to the lamellar armor commonly found in China. While both are very, very effective, I’d give the edge to the Romans here.Technology-SiegeIn terms of siege weaponry, while Rome was certainly more specialized with greater amounts of recorded weaponry, the common, near-constant occurrence of war in China, especially against border tribes and each other, did propel Chinese siege technology forward significantly. Rome was stronger on the offense; being a force with catapults/ballistae (Caesar used the terms interchangably in hisHowever, in terms of the Chinese, almost all ancient cities in China were walled and protected, unlike those of the Romans. Moreover, Chinese armies also constructed fortified camps. From records seen in the Three Kingdoms to battles during the Warring States, entire military texts covered how to protect your armies on the march and in entrenchment. In defensive capability, battlements and towers, barbicans and moats, were often city-wide in scale, something only rarely seen during late Rome, when the capacity of moving Roman infantry was no longer enough to stop invasions. Moreover, Chinese walls were thicker, by a considerable degree. Seen today, some of these walls reached over 20 meters thick, considerably greater than than 3 to 4 meters seen in the Severian walls.It would take considerably more effort for Roman soldiers to fight their way through these defensive cities.Technology-MetallurgyRoman and Han metallurgy both reached high states of sophistication at this point. The fact that we can still find Qin halberd heads that are apparently still sharp is a testament to Chinese military technology of the period. Certainly, I doubt that either side would hold too much of an advantage in this category. While the Roman thrusting sword might be able to get through Chinese armor in a direct strike, the same can be said of a heavy halberd tip striking a Roman helmet.Armor-wise, Rome holds the advantage with its superior design. While the Chinese design is certainly effective, combined perhaps with silk underneath, it nonetheless had not reached the highly specialized degree available to Rome. It should be noted, however, that the Han have access to stronger iron shields, though the weight might end up as a disadvantage.Technology-CavalryHere, the Han hold the distinct advantage. Stirrups. These were what gave birth to the powerful shock cavalry seen in Medieval Europe, and they were widely available to China, whose northern plains were essential breeding grounds for warhorses.Rome was never particularly good against cavalry, having neither the long pike formations available to the Greeks or heavy cavalry of their own. In fact, it is likely the reason why they could never truly defeat the Parthians. Open combat across such wide desert, where the enemy’s speed and range is so far above yours, is detrimental to Roman forces.Technology-NavalRoman forces were certainly superior in navigation, having inherited Carthagian technology (by stealing it), and with experience against the Greeks. In the open sea, I doubt the Chinese would stand a chance, since they have no enemies on the outside. The battle at Actium, at least, show that the Romans were certainly capable of using and fighting in the open sea. Ramming would be a common tactic, as would be boarding.In river combat, China could prove superior. River systems in China were longer and more developed, leading to far more conflicts centered around control of flowing water. The result was a highly developed brown water force, seen in full force at battles such as the Red Cliff (though this is a little later than the Han dynasty). Boarding and setting fire to enemy ships were both common tactics.Open Battle-IntroductionWeapons-wise, China holds the range advantage. Used to open plains combat and combined arms of a higher degree than seen by Alexander, China’s forces are highly effective at dealing with all sorts of enemy forces. A focus on heavy cavalry and ranged cavalry is prominent, along with liberal use of chariots; However, it certainly does not mean that the Han’s infantry is lacking. In particular, ranged infantry offers a higher degree of discipline and skill than Roman equivalents, who are forced to rely on auxiliaries.TrainingContrary to expectations, Chinese military training was nationalized by the Han dynasty, with at least a year’s worth of training. However, volunteer forces were available, and likely trained to a far higher degree. This does, however, pale in comparison to Rome’s legionary training, which could take over a decade of service.Roman training was highly specialized, and their ability as engineers, forces on march, and organized formations was superior. However, as the Chinese have codified and extensively expanded their military theory by the Han period, it should be expected that higher-level commanding officers should be superior on the Chinese side. Rome, on the other hand, is less well-known for their theory-craft, something which can prove surprisingly lethal on the campaign. In conclusion, we should expect Roman troops to be better trained with higher morale, but Roman officers to be worse than their Chinese counterparts in combat. Military law seems to be equally well-developed on both sides, with codes and regulations being a regular matter.TacticsThis is the trickiest part, since in a large aspect, these depend on the commander. Romans, contrary to their image, are quite effective at multiple forms of combat, from open field battle to sieges and ambushes. The battle of Alesia, the siege of Carthage, and others remain hallmarks of Roman success. Roman ingenuity allowed their navy to develop and grow, as did their use of auxiliary forces.However, Rome’s performance is best in lightly-wooded, hilly regions, where terrain makes the use of medium-sized, organized formations effective. In heavy forests, Roman troops perform rather poorly, unable to use their logistical advantage or their formations fully. In open plains, the crippling lack of cavalry means any organized enemy cavalry force could make mince-meat of them.China, on the other hand, does best in the open plain. The Han, being a prominent Northern power, specializes in heavy cavalry. Used to fighting nomadic tribes such as the Xiongnu, and each other, Chinese forces were effective combatants both in open plain and in ambush. However, without steep mountainous terrain or in mud and swamps, Chinese forces are likely to flounder, since they rely on a combined arms strategy with high levels of planning and coordination.China was familiar with formations such as shield wall, pike lines, and even turtle formation. It would not be too difficult for them to whittle down Roman formations, perhaps even pitting a halberd line against a Roman maniple. Romans do hold an advantage in close combat, since practice with the gladius and scutum would make Roman soldiers better close combat forces, but the Chinese, again, have the cavalry advantage, able to both shoot from range and charge into unbraced Roman formations with no long spears to hold them at bay.LogisticsRoman logistics are more efficient. Their ability to move troops rapidly around their empire and to construct buildings and cities in standardized fashion was superior to that of the Chinese. However, the Chinese hold advantages in agriculture, as their default crop of rice provides better yields than corresponding wheat. Moreover, Chinese cities are far better protected, with garrisons of thousands defending thick walls and tall towers. This would mean, in a total war, it’s harder for Rome to defend its territories, as Chinese armies could face the Romans in open combat without fearing the loss of their cities, while Roman forces must choose between constructing heavy fortifications (and these fortifications cannot be simply wooden walls or small camps, since the Chinese hold significant siege technologies in siege towers, mangonels, and the like), and facing the Chinese in battle with their cities unwalled. Rome, for example, was an open settlement before the Severian Walls were put in.In terms of willingness to fight, both sides seem to be able to suffer huge casualties without losing their morale. Rome demonstrated this during the Punic Wars, and China’s long history of civil wars and battles against nomadic tribes is good evidence of this on their side.China can put up a huge number of soldiers. But the ability to maintain that army in the field depends, on a large part, on the ability of the commanding staff of the Chinese general. It seems that while officers were trained in military theory, the resulting application was not as uniform as the Roman legions’ doctrine.ConclusionsWhile both Rome and China hold individual advantages in a hypothetical war, it is likely that neither side could gain a true edge over the other in battle. Along the coast, in hilly terrain such as in Greece, and in any sea battle, the Romans hold the edge. Their discipline would mean that their troops could be deployed rapidly and with high efficiency.On large stretches of terrain or in river combat, however, the Chinese hold the advantage. I find it likely that the Chinese could have pushed further north into Germany if they were in the same situation as the Romans. In the deserts of the Middle East, where any combat would be likely to happen, China holds the advantage. I surmise it may be possible for China to push through what used to be Parthia toward the Mediterranean, while Rome holds the coast and is able to successfully block any further ingress that way. A subsequent campaign by the Han northward around the Black Sea would falter due to logistic issues, or an attack on Constantinople could be stopped by the Roman navy. A counter attack southward through Egypt by the Romans will fail for similar reasons. The length of supply lines on each side would be so great that frankly, any war would end up in a begrudging agreement that a few scraps of land past the wealthy cities of the East would hardly be worth it.",UNKNOWN,Dimitris Almyrantis,2.1K,2.4K,21.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Do-the-police-possess-advanced-technologies-like-portrayed-in-the-movies

A safe estimate would put it at between 35–45 million people.The Indian Gupta Empire at its peak; not as mighty as the Ancient Mauryans, but arguably lasted a lot longer.The Roman Empire and the Han Dynasty were certainly more populous than the Gupta Empire, but that is partially because the Guptas failed to conquer all of India.

No matter how well he did, RomeTHEIR EQUIPMENT:The Romans all had iron armor, iron weapons and strong shields, with every Legionnaire given a helmet, sword, large shield, iron chest armor, iron grieves and iron arm guards. They were among the most heavily armored armies in history.Most armies at the time were made of up of roughly 90% Militia and 10% armored warriors. The Militia had light equipment, no armor, and maybe a spear, while the armored warriors sported a small amount of bronze or iron armor. The Romans were more of a 70/20/10 split, though: 70% would have extremely expensive and high-quality equipment, 20% would be Archers and have no armor, and about 10% would be Cavalry. Man to man, they were far better equipped than any other army on earth at the time.THEIR TRAINING:Roman Legionnaires were trained — this wasThe barbarian tribes and other empires would have a small core of trained warriors, but most armies were really just hordes of peasant farmers given a spear and a shield. The Roman Legions, on the other hand, were actually trained before they took to the field. They would drill fighting techniques, working as a unit, how to build forts quickly, and how to take commands on the fly.It is hard to overstate just how important this was. Most nations fielded armies with virtually no training; their men were given spears and pointed in the right direction. The Romans could form complex formations on the fly. They could retreat, turn or advance with only the wave of a flag. They could form into aTHEIR TACTICS:We often have this image of two armies just smashing into one another and the battle being pure chaos. This is actually false, and armies would instead meet up with their men in tight formations.The Romans had a great method for fighting battles:What they would do was organize into big squares, basically. The man at the front would stab and fight for 6 minutes, and then a signal would sound. Once the signal sounded, the Legionnaire at the front would swap with the Legionnaire behind him and move to the back of the square. While there, he could get treated if he were injured, get some water, and then rest for a while.For every hour of battle, a Legionnaire would only have to fight for 6 minutes. This meant that the front ranks of the Roman army were always rested and ready to fight. Other armies did not do this, and after 10 minutes, the men at the front were exhausted and usually killed. While the other army got tired and started to break, the Roman Legions could keep pushing forward all day. These Legions could literally fight for twelve hours andTHEIR ABILITY TO BUILD:Roman Legions could throw up a fort in an hour or two, at the most. This seems crazy to us, but it was true…Roman Legions would travel with all of their equipment. Each small unit of men had their own pack animal, tents, wood, food, water and equipment. Every night the Romans would stop, throw together a makeshift fort with walls, watch-towers and gates, and then rest in the safety of their fort.Just imagine trying to fight an enemy like this. If you gave them two hours, on top of a hill there would suddenly be a fort up there. Taking forts is costly and difficult, and many armies lost to the Romans because of this.At theThere are countless examples of this: they built bridges, massive towers, huge ramps and underground tunnels. They could out-engineer engineers, and were a mobile construction crew that carried their materials with them.THEIR AUXILIARIES:The Romans had fantastic Heavy Infantry, and they knew it. In a stand-up Infantry brawl, Rome was nearly unbeatable, and they conquered nearly all of Europe on the back of these Heavy Infantrymen.However, Rome did not have greatAn auxiliary soldier was a non-Roman soldier that served in the Legions in a specific role. For instance, Caesar utilized Gallic auxiliary Cavalry to great effect, as the Gauls were fantastic horsemen. When Rome conquered some new tribe, they were usually very gentle and non-invasive. They would require men to fight in the Legions, though, and were keen to find good Horsemen, Archers, or other types of Infantry.Rome would go on to utilize these various Auxiliaries to great effect. Sarmatian Cavalry, Numidian Cavalry, Spartan Hoplites, all could be found in the Roman Legions, and this filled any gaps left by Rome's over-emphasis on Heavy Infantry.THEIR LOGISTICAL ABILITY:As I said, the Romans were able to bringFood is often overlooked in the history of warfare. PeopleTHEIR ORGANIZATION:The Roman Legions organized themselves in fascinating ways. The name of the game in all warfare isHere is how the Roman Legion was generally organized:In every Legion, there was a mix of bottom-up and top-down leadership. There were leaders selected by the People, by the Senate and by the Legionnaires. Whenever a decision was made, all three of these groups were represented, and this was an incredibly versatile and organized structure — it allowed for good decisions to be made, and ensured noROMAN MEDICINE:During the life of the Roman Empire, the best most doctors could hope to do was to not make things worse. There were many, though, that were able to make things noticeably better…When injured in battle, Roman soldiers could expect to have their wounds treated, provided they were not too severe. While Roman medicine was primitive compared to our own, it was on the cutting edge of medical technology for the time. Roman doctors took after the Greek tradition of medicine, and approached healing from a scientific perspective, rather than spiritual.Doctors would have a set of seemingly modern instruments (pictured below), and would be able to perform basic procedures to help relieve pain and heal injured Legionnaires. You could even compare this style of medicine to that used in the American civil war.The tribes and empires that Rome faced were not as competent when it came to medicine. The Persians would go on to lead the world in medical technology after the fall of Rome, but this was in large part due to Roman and Greek influence*IMPORTANT NOTEMany people have pointed this out, so I will add it briefly: the army I described above is theI am going to shortly cover it all here, so that everyone can at least have a glimpse of how the Roman military changed over the years:• 509 BC — 300• 300Now, here is the kicker: not only were these men unpaid, but they also bought and financedOnly land-owning citizens could join up, and buying military gear and going off to serve was seen as honorable and noble. The richest families who could afford horses were Equites, while the average land-owner was a Hastati — and the poor, the Velites.Not having to equip or pay for an army obviously had its advantages, but at the same time, good luck keeping a 100% unpaid, volunteer army in the field for very long — also, when only land-owners can serve, your recruitment pool is very limited…• 101 BC — 290 AD:• 290 AD — 476 AD:",0 followers,Henrey Bradley,740,390,32.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Can-advanced-technology-create-a-utopian-society
