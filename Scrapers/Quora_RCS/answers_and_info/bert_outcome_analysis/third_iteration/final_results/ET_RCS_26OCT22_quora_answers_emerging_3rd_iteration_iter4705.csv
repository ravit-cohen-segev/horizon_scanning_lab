You just don’t want them to be costly mistakes.After you’ve made a few shorts or have acquired a gig with a professional film crew save some money and buy some decent equipment for your own projects: a good camera, some lighting and sound equipment. Things are too expensive so keep it minimal. The smaller and more mobile it is the better.","12,893 followers",Aditya Simha,1.4K,1.6K,92.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-should-a-newbie-to-movie-making-spend-his-equipment-budget-on

2,"That’s a hard question to answer without knowing more about your project; however, based on years of seeing new filmmakers in action—-including myself—I would highly recommend that if you’ve never tackled a film project of any kind, minimize your investment. The excitement of having all the bells and whistles of filmic creation will quickly sour when you realize how much you’ve bitten off once you engage. Technology being what it is today will limit you only by your skill and knowledge, so shooting on a DSLR package is quite sufficient for a first film.

The excitement of having all the bells and whistles of filmic creation will quickly sour when you realize how much you’ve bitten off once you engage. Technology being what it is today will limit you only by your skill and knowledge, so shooting on a DSLR package is quite sufficient for a first film. I’ve shot 2 movies on DSLR and they look great. Even outdated Canon 5D cameras still shoot amazing footage, so don’t be tempted to pour money into high end gear. It’s best to go basic first time out so that you can concentrate on the craft of filmmaking. If you have a lot of gear you’ll want to use it, and if you don’t know HOW to use it frustration and even panic will ultimately have their way with you. In the end, first projects are learning projects. It’s best not to try to fly before you learn how to walk; ie, your first film will NOT be a masterpiece. To quote my uncle, “Ain’t no way, no how, it’s gonna happen, boy.” You’ll consider your first project crap after a few years, I promise you. BUT the experience will be priceless, and getting your first film completed is victory in and of itself—regardless of the quality. A film is a huge undertaking no matter how elementary, and completing it is to be applauded. It’ll make the 2nd one easier. And better.

3,"Lighting, in my not-very-expert opinion (except as an actor from in front of a camera but a still photographer with decades of experience).It really makes a big difference if you have a creative and well-lit scene, and can create the precise mood you want. To me, it makes less difference if you’ve got the latest lens-body combination with terrific mics than if you have a crappy iPhone 5 but superior lighting.",UNKNOWN,Ariel,1.1K,128,1.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-should-a-newbie-to-movie-making-spend-his-equipment-budget-on

Because I don’t know your budget, I won't recommend one to you. However, every camera deals with the same mechanical limitations:These three mechanical limitations will apply to any DSLR, Pro Consumer, or Professional camera on the market. With that said, whatever camera you pick, make sure that it will record at least 1080P and that it has an 1/8″ microphone jack and/or a 3 pin XLR jack so that you can attach a microphone to your camera. Some cameras may come with built-in microphone but never rely on those if you are serious about making the best film you can.Whatever lens you buy, I would recommend a zoom lens. This will give you plenty of focal length options. Don’t worry about which is the best, just buy what makes sense for your budget. *NOTE* Some cameras have a fixed lens, meaning a lens is permanently attached to the camera body. These are fine options as well.As for a microphone, this will depend on what kind of microphone inputs your camera supports. Good brands are Rode and Sennheiser.In the beginning, I would recommend to not let yourself get caught up in the gear. At this point, cheap is just fine. Right now, focus on developing your creative eye. Any camera can help you do that.",131 followers,Viraat Das,8.9K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-should-a-newbie-to-movie-making-spend-his-equipment-budget-on
5,"Two identical cameras, wireless quality mics, a monitor or flatscreen to really see everything, control lighting, a couple of c-stands with extra knuckles.Bonus for green, blue, white, black screen.Most people start out using one camera but think about it. Twice the coverage in half the time, Editor gets a great shot but on every next take they can't deliver it the same so now you can cut angles and keep the great audio.

6,"7 Habits That Changed Indore:The residents of Indore have adopted simple yet effective means to deal with garbage problem of the city. Their efforts could be summed up in seven habit-changes and four socio-administrative formulae.1.Everyday garbage disposalThe municipal corporation earlier had garbage bins placed across the city and expected residents to throw wastes in the colour-coded boxes. It did not work.The corporation then shifted to door-to-door garbage collection mode. This simple change changed the way garbage was hitherto disposed in the city. People started cleaning their homes and7 Habits That Changed Indore:The residents of Indore have adopted simple yet effective means to deal with garbage problem of the city. Their efforts could be summed up in seven habit-changes and four socio-administrative formulae.1.Everyday garbage disposalThe municipal corporation earlier had garbage bins placed across the city and expected residents to throw wastes in the colour-coded boxes. It did not work.The corporation then shifted to door-to-door garbage collection mode. This simple change changed the way garbage was hitherto disposed in the city. People started cleaning their homes and shops to handover garbage to municipal workers. Dry wastes were kept separate from the wet ones making their disposal easy.2.Garbage To CompostMany localities adopted another method to keep the area clean. They started making compost from the waste products. One such example came from Lokmanya Nagar where close to 750 families are in the business of making compost from terracotta pot. These families give garbage to municipal workers only twice in a week.The different localities of Indore are increasingly becoming self-sufficient in garbage disposal. Wet garbage is separated and used for compost making. More than 700 compost making units are working at gardens, hotels, schools and other places across Indore.3.Discouraging Use of PolythenePolythene is considered as a big reason for litter. People of Indore made a shift in their polythene using habits discouraging its use. Shopkeepers, too, started using polythene bags of permissible thickness.4.Dustbin On The WheelsThis was a novel idea to keep a check on litter. People started carrying small dustbins in their cars so that they don't throw their wastes on streets. Those who chew paan and gutka are seen carrying similar bins in their vehicles.5.Awareness Among ChildrenTeachers in schools and parents at home made it a point to make their wards aware of the dangers of littering. Children living in Indore have become so aware now that if an elder person is seen throwing garbage on streets, the kids try to discipline them.6.Public And Social FunctionsAs a norm, wastage defines the scale of an organised social event - from a public rally to festivity or a religious function. But the residents of Indore corrected this age-old mentality and made a conscious effort to carry out cleaning work after every community event.7.The Eighth PledgeTraditional Indian weddings are solemnised with seven pledges - one each corresponding to every round of the sacred fire during the ceremony. In Indore, eighth pledge was added in the wedding rituals. The newlyweds are administered oath of cleanliness. Dustbins are distributed during wedding ceremonies in Indore.The Four Formulae:Besides the seven habit-changes, Indore worked on four formulae to keep the city clean.1.Removing Garbage BinsThe garbage bins were the places for stray animals. They all were found loitering around garbage bins in the hope of getting food turning the surroundings into a filthy zone. The administration decided to remove all the bins and started sending municipal workers door-to-door for garbage collection.2.Night CleaningEarlier, municipal workers used to do all the street cleaning only in morning. But the corporation changed this system. Workers were employed for collecting garbage from shops in the evening and cleaning the markets at night.3.New-design Municipal TrucksWhile rest of the country employs garbage collecting trucks of 1.8 cubic metre-capacity, Indore Municipal Corporation uses vehicles of 3.3 cubic metre-capacity. The former can collect garbage from around 300 homes, an Indorean container can cover nearly 1,000 homes.4.Children Made Brand AmbassadorsChild is the father of man. Indore put the philosophy contained in this William Wordsworth poem to effect. Children were made brand ambassadors of cleanliness. Committees have been constituted in schools and colleges to ensure cleanliness in the neighbourhood.Cities like Ghaziabad and Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh and Ahmedabad in Gujarat have tried to emulate Indore's experiment in their own cities to deal with garbage menace.","3,134 followers",Ugam Kamat,2.2K,162,2.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-should-a-newbie-to-movie-making-spend-his-equipment-budget-on

We got pizza and watched movies and had the best day ever, along with our adorable German Shepherd dog called Chaka. When it got dark some boys from school showed up at our front gate calling for me. My brother stayed inside, peeking through the curtains as I went outside to greet them. I knew them well from school and was puzzled by their appearance, since kids didn’t usually go out in the neighbourhood after dark.There was an older guy (about 19 or 20?) with them that immediately made me feel uncomfortable. He leaned against our fence and eyed my body, biting his lower lip. One of the boys hurriedly said it was one of his cousins and I should ignore him.“Come on out with us,” the boy said. “We want to show you something.”“No, it is late,” I replied, remembering how I boasted at school that I’d be home alone.“Okay, wait we have something for you,” the other boy said as he turned around and got something that he had hidden behind the lamppost. He returned with a brown bottle, filled with liquid, with the label removed. It was already open. “Here, drink this.”“No,” I said and they just kept insisting I drink it, saying it wasn’t that strong, tasted good and that I’d be fine. My heart was beating in my chest. I felt nervous as the older guy kept looking at my bare legs, playing with the latch on the fence door.Suddenly Chaka, our dog, appeared from behind me and planted his bottom on my feet. He was a huge, wolf-like dog and this low, deep rumble started to grow louder and louder as he growled. He stared the guy down who hastily let go of the latch and backed away. The two boys also backed off quickly. It was as if Chaka sensed my fear and came to give me his strength; he would fight for me. I told them to go away and leave, I didn’t want to drink their stuff. My dog sat like a statue on my feet, until they disappeared back into the darkness. My brother said he was watching the entire time for any signs of trouble, and couldn’t believe how brave Chaka had been. When my dad heard about it, he gave Chaka a big steak as a reward.Chaka was my guardian angel. I still love him and think of him. He died in 2008. What could have happened if he weren’t there?*Wow! Thank you for all the upvotes! Thank you for taking the time to read about my sweet Chaka!EDIT - I found a picture of my boy for anyone curious about what he looked like. He was starting to go grey around his mouth and on his back when this picture was taken. Chaka loved snoozing on the kitchen floor as seen here. Whenever I was alone at home Chaka would follow me all around the house. He would even escort me to the bathroom or relax in the doorway with his eyes always watching the front door. He had a good, long life and was an amazing friend. We all still love him dearly.","3,355 followers",Cathy Rais,41K,252,5.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-should-a-newbie-to-movie-making-spend-his-equipment-budget-on

But I still needed an income, so my mother had hired my younger sister and me to do the dirty, back-breaking work in her shop while she took care of her first infant granddaughter.My sister and I were working at our mom’s antique store one summer day. Mom had just gotten a truckload of European oak furniture that needed to be cleaned and polished, have the handles screwed on and so forth.A nice-looking young man came into the store and started talking to my sister, who was 17 at the time. He introduced himself as Ted Smith, and we laughed and said we must be related as mom’s maiden name was Smith also. He chatted both of us up, but focused on sis for the most part.He purchased an armoire, but said he’d have to go get his truck, since at the moment he was driving his VW Bug—an old VW Bug. He then asked my sister and me if we wanted to go out to dinner that night with him. We were sweaty and dirty from work, I had a baby to care for, and sis already had a boyfriend, so we said “Thanks, but no thanks, Ted”.He asked me to ride with him to get his truck so he could drop his Bug off at the auto shop for repairs, but by that point I had to get home to my infant—-right away, because I was still nursing her and I thought my breasts were going to begin leaking at any minute.However, he wouldn’t give up trying to get one or both of us away from the shop.He said he could come back about 10:00 that evening for his armoire and asked whether one or both of us be there. We replied, “No, we close the shop at six, and we both have places to be tonight.”He was persistent. “How about tomorrow night?”“No, we close at 6:00, except on Saturdays, when we close at 4:00.”He asked whether one of us could meet him early in the morning, like at 5:30 a.m., but neither of us wanted to.He was getting to be a bit creepy and sis and I were eye-rolling at each other.Eventually, he said he was sorry but he couldn’t buy the armoire if we couldn’t be flexible.We hated to give up the sale, but after he had been there for two hours, we thought he was just looking and taking up our time. We still had a lot of work to do on the furniture that had just arrived in the shop.Finally, we just wanted to finish our work and go home.At 6:00 p.m., as we were leaving, his VW Bug was parked outside and he asked us whether we want to go for coffee; he especially wanted my sister to go.We said, “Thanks, Ted, but no thanks, like we said earlier, we have plans,” but he continued to be insistent.Finally I said, “Sis, let’s go—I’ll take you home.” Even though she had her car there, for some reason I didn’t want to leave her to drive home alone with this guy around.So he drove off in his Bug and we really didn’t think of it again…Until the next year, when this picture appeared in the paper:Ted Bundy.It still sends chills up my spine, writing this, and sis and I talk about it occasionally. We were two lucky young women that day. If either of us had agreed to go, we would have been raped and murdered like the at least 30 other women Bundy kidnapped.",0 followers,Feef,53.3K,694,43.3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-should-a-newbie-to-movie-making-spend-his-equipment-budget-on
12,"See this dog? She’s a little thick and weighs 115 pounds. She’s not real good with strangers in the house. I had a guy in to clean the carpet—real nice guy, but Mollie was having none of it. That’s why I took her and her two doggie sisters for a walk in a light rain that day.I planned a short walk, but soon we found ourselves on the other side of the small lake next to my neighbor’s house. Of course, the rain intensified.“No problem.” I said to myself. Perhaps to the dogs, as well. “We will take the short-cut across the dam and get back before we are all soaked.”Well, it turns out that since ISee this dog?

That’s why I took her and her two doggie sisters for a walk in a light rain that day.I planned a short walk, but soon we found ourselves on the other side of the small lake next to my neighbor’s house. Of course, the rain intensified.“No problem.” I said to myself. Perhaps to the dogs, as well. “We will take the short-cut across the dam and get back before we are all soaked.”Well, it turns out that since I had last been in this area, a neighbor had fenced his property, and easy access to the dam was gone. I walked back and forth, thinking I would have to take the long way around, but then I noticed that the recent drought had caused the lake to be dry at the base of the dam.I happily walked across the relatively dry, crusted lake bottom for about 30 seconds. Then, my foot sank into thick, goopy black mud. I suddenly noticed that all three dogs had avoided the area and were pulling on their leashes. One slipped her collar and was gone for home. The other little dog was whining plaintively. Only Mollie was stoic.I cursed the disgusting mud and took another step, sinking up to my ankles. “Damn,” I cursed, “now I am getting my shoes messy!”.I stopped for a moment to consider my predicament. I looked around at the houses surrounding the lake, and was so thankful that no one was witnessing my folly. What an idiot!“Oh, no”, I muttered, “I think I am losing a shoe!” Angrily, I struggled to begin walking with a purpose toward the shoreline. Angrily, the mud sucked on my feet and legs. Nothing budged, I was stuck.Reluctantly I looked up at all the homes. I could even see my own home, across the way. Maybe having some help would be a good thing. Unfortunately, there were no lookie-loos on this chilly, rainy day.I took a few more tentative steps, and sank with each one. A chill ran through me as the gravity of the situation began to sink into my head. I. Couldn’t. Get. Out.Then I chuckled. This was ludicrous. No one drowns in quicksand like mud in a lake with only 4 feet of water. I wasn’t even in the water. I was in the suburbs, within sight of my home. Crazy. I frantically searched the coastline but there was still not a soul. I looked at my dogs. Little Taco was still whimpering as she uneasily glanced my way. Mollie, well, she looked preternaturally calm. I swiped at the tears that had somehow formed on my cheeks. I was actually going to drown in this horrible gooey black mud.I had been perfectly still for the last five or ten minutes. Yet, oh my God. Oh my God! It was past my crotch, now. Oh yuk, what a disgusting way to go! That awful, infectious goo was on my crotch now! I looked at Mollie and, defeated, I whispered, “Mollie, what am I going to do, now?”She looked deeply and long into my eyes, nodded twice, and turned around. She was directly beside the steep dam wall, which was covered with thick tree roots. She moved one paw to the left, and hooked into the roots as I watched, mesmerized. The right paw followed on the other side, again wrapping around the tree roots and then she leaned forward until she was flat on her belly. She clumsily clambered upward with her back legs digging deeply. She repeated the motions, and I felt the leash go tight. I wrapped it around my wrist twice as she continued.Reaching, pulling, crawling again and again. I let her drag me flat on my stomach, across and through the mud—-saturated from head to toe with thick, black, goopy mud. Suddenly it was my turn to grab the roots, and I did so, pulling myself up the dam and onto firm soil. At the top of the dam, she turned toward me as if to tell me to get up, she was done pulling. In a daze, I got up and we returned to our home, this time by the long way around.I had heard that a dog’s strength is roughly similar to that of a man weighing triple the dog’s weight. I have to say that I can certainly believe it. Otherwise, how could she have had the strength to pull me out of the muck, which had finally reached my waist? More to the point however, how on earth had she known what to do? She had used the roots as tools to pull herself upward —that just wasn’t possible.Now when I look deeply into her beautiful amber eyes, I see another being in there. An incredibly intelligent creature who actually loves me so much that she saved my life.",326 followers,Katie Delap,53.3K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-should-a-newbie-to-movie-making-spend-his-equipment-budget-on

Why was there a complete stranger in my house at 1 a.m. when I desperately wanted to go to bed? Out of respect for my husband and his new-found friend, I’d have to stay up and exchange pleasantries, which I was in no mood to do.They both looked up at me in awkward silence, Agassi holding his glass of whiskey inches from his mouth.‘Hello,’ I said, hesitantly, waiting for some kind of introduction or explanation.They said nothing. Just grinned at me like two idiots. I felt like I’d walked in on some secret meeting.‘So? What’s going on then?’ I asked, politely.My husband, still grinning, said ‘I made a new friend at the pub. It’s Andre Agassi!’Very funny. I was now annoyed. It was late and I had to be up for work the next morning. This was no time for childish shenanigans.They carried on with their silly, evasive charade for a while longer. Frustrated, I announced I was going to bed.Agassi got up and sat next to me on the sofa. He looked at me intensely. It made me nervous. I really wanted to punch him.He reached into his back pocket, pulled out his wallet and fished in it for something. He pulled out a photo.‘I’m not Andre Agassi, but you do know me.’‘O...kay...’‘The last time you saw me,’ he grinned, ‘I looked like this.’ He held up a small, black and white passport photo of my cousin, Ali, at age 5. I had not seen him or spoken to him since my childhood.At age 12, I’d left my entire family behind to escape the revolution in my country. My mum, four grandparents, four aunties, three uncles and five cousins. We were a tight-knit family. Always together.My parents were divorced, my father had custody, and he’d decided to take my brother and me to America, for our own safety. It was the right decision, but it meant having to say goodbye to the whole lot of them.It was hard. I was homesick for a long time and missed them all terribly. They would occasionally come to me in my dreams, where we’d be joyously reunited. I’d wake from those dreams in such a state. Happy, but tearful. Lost.Gradually though, the gulf between me and my old life grew wider and quieter. The letters and phone calls stopped. Eventually, as I delved into my new life on a different continent, they all became a distant memory, locked away in that box of sentimental items in the attic of my mind. They were characters from another life. A life that no longer existed.For nearly two decades, I had no family. I never spoke of them or to them. It was easier.Ali had been the baby of our family back then. A darling little angel. He once had a passport photo taken. He looked so cute in it; his expression was so serious, like someone facing the Spanish Inquisition! This photo became a favourite within our entire family. Everyone got a copy to keep on their fridge or in their wallet or scrap book. I had one too, which I’d ended up taking with me when I left my country twenty years earlier.And now, here was this grown man, sitting on my sofa, holding up that very passport photo in front of my face. He had known that I would immediately recognise it.I didn’t say a word. Not one.Instead, I buried my face in my hands and just sobbed. I cried and cried. My heart felt like it could explode. I can honestly say that, second to the birth of my son, it was the most emotional moment I’ve experienced.Ali and that little photo he was holding represented my old life, my entire family, my history! And here he was, sitting an inch away from me.Apparently, my husband had come home from work that afternoon to find a strange man with a rucksack sitting on our front step. Ali had got my address from another relative and had decided to come to the UK, where I now lived, and pay me a surprise visit. It was pre-mobile days, so my husband couldn’t get in touch with me to tell me to hurry home.All they could do was wait for me to return. So, they went to the pub, drank too many whiskies and concocted their Agassi ruse.When I’d finally stopped crying, we hugged and hugged and talked and reminisced the rest of the morning.Suddenly, there was a bridge connecting me to all of them again. They were all real once more, no longer a fairytale or vague memory.I have since reunited with several more members of my family, including my mum. But none of them made me as emotional as Ali, because he was the first.He broke the dam.Edit:",45 followers,May Lam,51.9K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-state-or-city-has-topped-in-the-list-of-Swachhta-Sarvekshan-2020-and-what-rules-they-imposed-in-the-state-or-city-to-achieve-this-rank

I asked this daughter (who had never been boy-crazy like her girlfriends nor ever had a boyfriend or date).""Because I've been asking and asking God who I would end up marrying, and this morning when I was praying, he told me I would meet my future husband today!"" she answered matter-of-factly.Needless to say, fear struck my heart. My impressionable daughter believing this crazy idea would make for an interesting - if not scary - day! Today, I would definitely keep her close to me and keep a strict eye on her!That night I knew we had plans to take my daughter and her friends to a haunted house. I asked her if she thought she was going to marry one of her friends. She said ""No, I'm sure it will be someone totally new that I've never met before."" (Yikes, fear again.)Nothing eventful happened all day. But that evening the line waiting to go into the haunted house went down the street and around the block. The kids didn't seem to mind the long wait and goofed around in line and talked to others nearby. I kept a very close eye on my extremely attractive daughter (Come on, I AM her mom, but others think her attractive too). I suspiciously eyed every boy who talked to her!!!Finally, our group of teens got to enter. I was behind the group & directly behind my daughter. Dark, scary, fun, and long was the walk in the pitch-black, winding corridors. Suddenly a man dressed as the Grim Reaper jumped out right in front of my daughter and scared her so badly she screamed and fell backwards - on top of me and those behind me - toppling all of us over! The (now kind & sorry) Grim Reaper helped us all up, and, noting her extreme reaction of fear, he came out of character long enough to offer to sneak us out a side exit. She said 'no, its okay' and we moved on - embarrassed.That night my daughter was SO disappointed when she said ""I was so sure God told me I would meet him TODAY.""Fast forward 10 years. My daughter was the maid of honor for her best friend's wedding and gave a beautiful toast and prayer at the wedding. One of the men attending the groom was from out-of-state and took an interest in my daughter, emailing and calling her after the wedding. Eventually they engaged and married.After they were married, we were sitting around talking and the subject of haunted houses came up. My SIL said he had once helped construct one in an old grocery store building when he spent a year in our town! ""Really?"" ""Yes,"" he said, and I got to be the Grim Reaper for it and carry a fake scythe!""Comparing notes, they figured out that the exact year he had spent in our city was the year my daughter was thirteen! When asked if he remembered an incident at the haunted house with a frightened girl, he wasn't sure - as all young girls scream. But when he heard she toppled me & others over and he came out of character to offer assistance out a side exit, then he said, ""That was you?!? But that was just a little girl I offered help! Usually I pride myself in never coming out of character, but she was so scared and I worried people might have fallen and gotten hurt!"" (Lol Yes, a 13-year-old, 5-foot tall girl IS 'just a little girl' to a 19-year-old, 6 foot 2 inch young man - as it should be!)So my daughter did, indeed, meet her future husband that day!!! Amazing! Out of the mouth of Babes...!(They have been married now for almost 13 years and have 5 children.)","6,403 followers",Tomer Amrani,7K,1.1K,42.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-impressive-ad-targeting-you-ever-experienced

Think about life. Run a few rapids. Hike a little. Try to ignore the pain in my body, the emptiness in my soul, and the lack of a real future.I’d packed everything the afternoon before so I could just get up and get on the road, so I was very annoyed when I turned the key and didn’t even get a click from the starter. I tried the lights, nope. I tried the horn, it made a weak squawk then died. Totally dead battery.Crap.Grumbling to myself, I got the battery charger out of the box marked “garage” on the porch of my apartment and hooked it up to the dead battery in my car. With an hour to kill, I went inside to check e-mails and cruise the net.There was the usual pile of low priority semi-spam in my inbox, including a notification from the NY state public school teaching job message board. I hadn’t seen anything useful on the site for over a month; it was past the main April/May hiring time and before the August panic. The body of the message didn’t show anything, but on a whim I clicked on it to check out the full listings.Near the bottom of the list there was an ad for an opening for a Physics(Chemistry/Biology) teacher, 5+ years experience preferred, deadline for applications this coming Monday at 8 AM. Somehow I’d missed hearing about this opening; it had been on the board for almost a month. I checked out the location… rural school, about a half hour away from Albany, in the foothills of the Green/Berkshire/Taconic mountains. My kind of place. I checked out the travel time… about two hours away.If I could get cleaned up, get my professional things together and get my car to start in less than an hour then I could just about make it there before everyone left for the weekend. If nothing else, I could take a look at the place and I could make sure that my application was on the top of the pile in the principal’s inbox for the Monday morning deadline.My car didn’t start until after a full hour on the charger, so I got to the school just as all of the kids were stampeding out the door and onto the buses. The first person I talked to out in front of the school just happened to be the principal. He noticed the kayak up on top of my car, and since he is an outdoors-person we hit it off immediately. What followed was the best non-interview interview of my life; I was the man with all of the right answers.“We’re replacing a third of the staff next year, we could use someone with experience.”“I’ve been teaching eleven years.”“This is a rural school. It’s not like teaching in the suburbs.”“Yeah, the school I taught at was in the middle of the Adirondack Mountains… much smaller than this place actually.”“The listing says Physics, but the person we hire will need to cover another science. We’re not sure which one right now, either Chem or Bio.”“Not a problem. I’m certified in all three of those. And Earth Science. And General Science too. And I’ve taught them all. Several times in fact.”It went like that for the entire hour that I was there, and after it was done I drove away with a very good job in my pocket, the day before it was going to go away. After ten years in this job I still think I am one of the luckiest teachers in New York State. I have a great administration (both are former science teachers), a very supportive community, easy students to work with, excellent co-workers, a great workspace, lots of materials and supplies, and the freedom to innovate. Every morning I wake up to fresh air and a view of the mountains. My commute to work is 5 minutes by car, 8 minutes by bike, and 10 minutes by hiking through the woods. I do not need to lock my house when I leave, or lock my car or my bike on the end of the commute. I live close enough to a city that I can get a dose of culture or find things that I need when I want them, but far enough away that I don’t have to deal with the drawbacks of urban or suburban life.Ten years later I still think that I’ve found my perfect job.And if my car had started that morning, I’d never have found it.",101 followers,Karen Ronshausen,4.9K,221,610.5K,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-impressive-ad-targeting-you-ever-experienced

If you have a minute or two, I’ll share the story with you.A few months after I got to in India I went to Manali, in the lush, mountainous state of Himachal Pradesh. I made my first really good local friend there. His name was Raju and he worked at a café owned by an expat American, where he was taught to make what might have been the best chocolate chip cookies I’d ever had—even compared with those in the US.Raju taught me basic Hindi words and phrases like acchhaa and thiik hain. He got me started on a path that led, many months later, to fluency in Hindi.He also showed me how he performs a puja, or worship, in the café, with incense sticks and mantras, and he took me to the local temple.He was short and pudgy and had a mustache I admired. When we walked down the street we slung our arms over each other’s shoulders, laughing and smiling as we joked around.I had heard from fellow Israeli travelers about a synagogue in Manali, run by Chabad—an orthodox Jewish organization from Israel—replete with a rabbi dressed in all black with corkscrew locks dangling from the sides of his head and a black hat. The synagogue offered Israeli Jews an opportunity to practice their religion while traveling in India.I wanted to take Raju for Shabbat, the Israeli prayer on Friday. I’m not religious and I don’t practice Judaism, but I thought that just as I had enjoyed visiting the local temple with him, he’d enjoy going to a Synagogue together. He had given me a glimpse of his culture, his religion, and I wanted to return the courtesy.“Are you sure it’s alright?” Raju said when I invited him, raising a questioning eyebrow, as if intuiting that things might not go as well as I thought.“Why wouldn’t it be?” I smiled and slapped him on the back affectionately.“Okay, okay,” he said. “chalte hain.”That evening we went to the synagogue. Ten seconds after we had entered, the rabbi, with his long pointed beard and frameless glasses, approached us with quick steps and told me in Hebrew that my friend is not Jewish and is therefore not welcome there.“Seriously...",0 followers,Sandeep Kaur,4.3K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-impressive-ad-targeting-you-ever-experienced

After 1.5 years I was transferred back to India and this is where the most miserable day of my life happened. I was in a board meeting when I was informed by foreign registration office that on a complaint of my ex husband my visa had been cancelled and I needed to leave the country in 48 hours. I put the phone down and I recieve another call from a relative who worked in our embassy in India that I have been reported by my ex husband that I have converted to Sikhism and I should never go back home till investigations are complete.So I was there in a board meeting, had 48 hours to leave the country and I had no country to go to.I am so grateful to my ex,because of him I learnt so much and became a very strong woman. A woman that no one can mess with anymore and a woman who knows her rights. When I won that battle I was a new person. I blossomed to my true self.

This type of earning is called a revenue share or in the industry a rev share.I only know this because I work in the digital marketing industry. This is very much like all of the other programs that do rev share. Another good example of a program that does this is Google AdSense, however there are many advertising firms that do this as well.

It was a love marriage. We had been dating since 1.5 years.As a girl from Uttar Pradesh(Mathura), I know the amount of dowry we give to the groom. When my sister was married we gifted the groom a Maruti Suzuki Swift Desire though they had not demanded it. We also gave them cash of ₹ 5,00,000 in dowry. This is not because the groom's family members demand those things. But it's in our blood to gift that to him. Many in UP say that if a girl doesn't take anything to her husband's home, it's a shame to her. All the neighbours shame on her. People tend to believe that there is some problem with guy and so he couldn't fetch enough dowry.Having said this, as I broke the news of my boyfriend, my family members first were bit concerned about boy's background. As I come from an upper class, they thought it would be a shame for me to marry a lower class/caste. But fortunately he turned out to be from upper class in Maharashtra and this gave relief to my parents. So they agreed for our marriage. The next thing that came to our mind was dowry. We sat for whole night just to discuss what we should gift the boy. My several uncles and aunts participated in this discussion. Finally the we decided to personally speak with boy's parents if they have any demand concerning this.In the meantime, my boyfriend too broke the news to his parents. Though they initially refused to marry him off to a UP girl, he eventually convinced them and we decided to arrange meeting of both families a week later in my home.Then came the D-Day. Boy's parents and one of his aunts and uncles showed up in our house. Looking at me they were very happy as I was very well dressed up. After some basic discussions came the point of dowry. Everyone from boys family members refused it. I thought it is casual Indian thing to initially refuse the offerings. They said my parents to just give their daughter to their son with a Mangal Sutra (A sacred necklace they signifies marriage bond) and a coconut. Usually Mangal Sutra is made of gold but they said that if we cannot afford that, a Mangal Sutra made up of black beads may work but they would never accept anything in dowry. They warned us to not even to try to offer it. Otherwise they would break the marriage. This literally shocked us. We tried to explain them our culture of dowry but they were stuck to their principles. Even my boyfriend warned me to not to try ways to present dowry. Finally we had to agree. My family members were first furious over their arrogance over this matter. Many of my uncles and aunts said that there is some defect with the groom and so they behaved like this. Everyone was thinking of what my to be neighbours and family members would say about me for not bringing dowry. But as we were committed, we eventually got married off without any exchange of dowry though my parents gave around 50 grams gold on Mangal Sutra.After I came to my husband's home, it was a cultural shock for me to notice that no one asked what I brought from my home. In fact after I discussed with neighbours about what they got from their homes. I got to know that there was only exchange of Mangal Sutra from girl's home. Plus some got costly sarees or some jewelleries from home. But I noticed a thing that whatever they got from their homes was solely for them. That is sarees were used by brides and so were jewellery. They hardly presented a gold ring to groom's home 'for the groom’. There was no exchange of cash, vehicle, property etc. as a part of dowry. I feel proud to be a part of such society now.Note: I'm anonymous here because my sister to whom we gave a lot of dowry is active on Quora. As section of IPC 498a criminalises dowry, I don't want to risk anybody's life by providing witnesses to a crime and spoil their happy lives they are living today. I personally feel that those regions who still think dowry is part of their culture need to change a lot.",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,3.5K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-impressive-ad-targeting-you-ever-experienced

Think of the space and the maintenance costs of a carrier being able to do away with those systems. It would mean the complete redesign of the carrier as we know it.The need for large, exposed flight deck surfaces would no longer be necessary either. They only exist to stage aircraft for the catapult to launch, and to act as a micro landing strip with the arrestor cables. Neither of which are now necessary, so the deck isn't needed anymore either. The carrier would evolve into more of a Battlestar Galactica design, with the planes launching out of garage doors that open to the sides, leaving a smaller deck profile.Insanely useful.For the Air Force, this would mean the elimination of all air force bases on foreign soil.Let me say that again.This would mean the elimination of all air force bases on foreign soil.Why bother when you have a plane that can take off from the US, achieve orbit, and drop in on any country they need to attack or defend in a matter of minutes? The cost savings for the DOD would be in the trillions over the course of 10 years. It would also reduce the number of planes we need to have in the inventory.No need for spy planes like the U-2 or the SR-71. Strap a camera package on the bottom of an x-wing and you're good.X wings in the movies seem to be able to take off, achieve orbit, fight and then return to base without any pilot ever once having mentioned their low fuel state or the need to get some gas.They would be nigh invulnerable when acting as bombers, since they can attack their targets from orbit, far beyond the range of any ground based AA missile batteries. Once those are eliminated, they can roll around the airspace uncontested, as any enemy aircraft would have been long eliminated from orbit as well.It frankly doesn't matter if its actually a good fighter compared to an F-15 or an SU-27.No other fighter base could stand up to orbital bombardment. A single squadron could achieve air superiority over any country in the world in a day.It could destroy entire enemy air bases in one shot, by bringing up a telephone pole sized rod of steel or tungsten, and then diving on the enemy base from orbit and letting the rod impact at hypervelocity speeds. Look up the Air Force project “Thor.”An X-wing dropping these tungsten rods would be the most devastating weapon on the planet, with the exception of the Nuke, but a lot more useful.And we aren't even talking about reverse-engineering its engines, repulsor lifts, hyperdrives, or laser cannons.

An X-wing (apparently) can’t do that.So, it would be weird.An X-Wing could fly into the atmo, get into firing position, and then would be killed by some random fighter fifty miles away that it never saw.Silly, really.Not as silly as gravity bombs in space, but, silly.EDIT: Oh man. I have hilariously upset the Star Wars mafia on Quora with this one. That’s funny.Just to respond a bit:No, I didn’t forget that star wars ships have shields. We see again and again that shields can be penetrated with sufficient force. If you are fighting ships with shields, you just need a larger warhead or more missiles. In any case, long range (BVR) weapons will win all the time over visual range weapons.The reason why modern air to air missiles have dinky warheads is that modern planes are fragile things. You don't NEED a larger warhead so why put one on? However, that is just because of current targets. If you are shooting at a heavily shielded target, you would use a NUCLEAR TIPPED missile. In the movies, we see nuclear weapons you can hold in your hand:(Thermal Detonator)And before you complain, nuclear tipped air to air missiles are actually a thing (or it was):You are not going to survive that in an X-Wing. Sorry.Someone also pointed out (fairly) that Star Wars ships might have sufficient electronic warfare capabilities to make targeting from precision weapons impossible. OK, that’s fair and could be a good in-universe explanation. Of course, that explanation isn’t actually used in the movies and we do see long range detection several times in the original movies (“FIGHTERS! Coming in!”) so we know that some form of detection is possible. It also doesn’t explain why precision weapons aren’t used on static targets like the battle of Hoth. Automated warfare and long range weapons are very intentionally excluded in the movies to make them more interesting.Also, for those who said that the X-Wing would just fly away from the modern fighter, that’s perhaps sorta true, but not totally. The issue that the X-Wing has is that it has a straight wing. That wing isn’t going to survive above Mach 2 for long. In the movies, you see them moving fairly slowly in atmo. That’s probably done for cinematic purposes, but we don’t actually see them flying at high mach numbers in the movies. They’re not optimized for operations down low.Finally, yes I’m aware of blasters and yes I understand that blasters carry an immense amount of energy. However, in the movies we see that they move fairy slowly and are line of sight only. The entire trope of long running aerial gunfights that we see in the movies is pretty silly and those ships would be destroyed in real life by longer ranged weapons.Someone actually calculated the speed of blaster bolts and turns out they’re pretty slow:At longer ranges, this means they’re not an effective weapon because your target has moved before the bolt gets there.ANYWAY. It’s a movie and they’re fun to watch, just don’t over-think them or try to play real world scenario games, they don’t hold up to scrutiny like that.The point I was trying to make was that long range BVR weapons would rule the Star Wars universe if a realistic lens was applied. The lack of these weapons is simply a storytelling device because Lucas liked the WWII style dogfights that he saw in movies when he was a kid. It’s not based on any sort of logical analysis of how these things might work in an advanced technical society that we see in the movies.","2,107 followers",Alex Jauch,1.9K,1.3K,15.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-should-a-newbie-to-movie-making-spend-his-equipment-budget-on
