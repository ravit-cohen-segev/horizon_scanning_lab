The computational cost and memory consumption of my initial algorithm, is quadratically and linearly with system complexity. Hence, for very large systems the cost computational cost start to be extreme and this is why I used GPUs. His algorithm on the other hand, scales quadratically for memory consumption and linearly for computational cost, so it works exactly as opposite of mine.Now, I have implemented the two versions in a very efficient way, so if you have a couple extra TB of RAM or a couple unused millions of cores, you could help a poor man to achieve his dream of performing the largest quantum transport simulation of the world :)",9 followers,Andrew McGregor,2.9K,13K,67.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-process-of-attaining-a-professorship

These large memory machines are a necessity for certain types of workload such as genome or metagenomic assemblies, which must be done in a single machine. I have yet to see them use MPI approaches to divide and conquer the problem. The reason being is simple: 1) the algorithms build giant graphs in memory and walk through them 2) the algorithms are written by bioinformaticians and scientists that don't optimize the algorithm. Without having all the memory in one sever, these algorithms simply crash the server when free memory runs out (called thrashing). These assemblies can take days or weeks to complete even in RAM. So, even if we are using SWAP space backed by FusionIO SSDs, the performance is degraded by an order of magnitude or more. These servers run like dogs day in day out for the remainder of their 5 to 7 year life. At a cost of 85K CAD each, they are a bargain for what they provide in enabling scientific research.Another application is large in memory databases to optimize large table joins. Think hundreds of millions of records. Reading all that data from disk for every query would take forever.

Reference:I have known some folks who used to purchase server versions of the Windows OS for personal use just so they could install more memory, but that was a few years ago when upper limits for Windows Desktop weren't as high as they are now.Second, even though the OS can recognize that much memory, that doesn't mean your individual applications can take advantage of that much memory. With lots of RAM you can run more applications at the same time. All modern operating systems use ""Page Files"" where memory is swapped to disk when the OS starts to run low on memory, and compared to pure RAM access, disk access is very sloooooooooooow. More memory means fewer (or hopefully no) disk swaps. But the individual applications themselves probably can't access anywhere near the memory you have available, except *perhaps* in the gaming world.The exception to this is in critical business applications that were designed to use lots of memory. I'm not sure if any of these have upper limits (I didn't really feel like researching individual requirements), but things like architectural and 3D modeling programs (like AutoCAD, etc.), database programs (like Oracle), virtualization hosts (like VMware vSphere), video editing, and such are often written to use excessive amounts of RAM.You could create a virtual hard disk (Finally, you also have to consider how much RAM your physical computer can accept. Most home systems aren't going to provide anywhere near the ability to add that much RAM. You'd need ""workstation"" class PC that can handle more memory, but even then I'm not sure if any off-the-shelf workstation-class hardware can handle that much. Much like the OS, you'd probably have to purchase server class hardware to provide access to that much RAM.How much RAM do you really need?

Even the other programs that *can* use that much RAM probably couldn't justify the expense of actually installing that much RAM.

The notion of psychohistory, by it’s very nature, rejects the “Great Man” theory of history, which is the notion that history is made by powerful and ambitious individuals bending the world to their will. Instead, it assumes that the “trends and forces” theory of history is the correct one. It assumes that most things that happen in history (if not everything) are a consequence of historical forces: social trends, economic incentives, population pressures, and so on and so forth.Psychohistory assumes that the choices made by individuals are ultimately irrelevant to history: if George Washington had stayed loyal to the British crown, someone else would have led the revolution, or the United States would have become independent in some other way, because history demanded it. If Genghis Khan had renounced violence at an early age, the Mongol Empire (and their subsequent conquests of Asia) would have happened anyway, and would have been just as short lived. If Adolf Hitler had been hit by an artillery strike in World War 1, fascism would have arisen in Germany anyway, and would have led to a new world war in any case.Within the universe of the Foundation series, this interpretation of history is assumed to be true (with some wiggle room for the Second Foundation meddling that we find out about later). But the Mule throws all of that out the window. Why? Because he has what is arguably the most powerful single ability in all of fiction: mind control.I mean, technically it’s emotional control, but it comes down to the same thing. He can alter anybody’s motivations and feelings and drives to whatever he wants them to be, fundamentally changing their actions. That notion is absolutely terrifying, because it gives a person basically unlimited control over others. He can take over entire societies, simply by making everyone in a position of influence loyal to him. And then he can conquer other societies, simply by making all of their leaders want to surrender to him as well. He’s effectively an unstoppable force.That’s something that psychohistory can never account for. The plan assumes that no one person can chance the course of history, and the Mule can. The plan assumes that the way humans react to events will remain the same (the ‘psycho-’ part of psychohistory), and the Mule can change how people react on a whim.And, by the same token, if the Mule changes his mind about what he’s doing, or becomes more aggressive, or dies, any of those things will change history, because he’s the only one with that power. Which means that a person who could kill him has the power to alter history as well.The Mule’s unique and fantastical abilities would make him potentially the most powerful person in real life as well. In the Foundation universe, they make him the one person who can completely disrupt the Plan.","135,561 followers",Hector Quintanilla,27.8K,1.2K,88.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-can-you-do-with-1000-GB-of-RAM

Oh yes, Asimov knew his Richard III, no question.Second, at the end of the story involving the Mule, we learn all about him as he gives a kind of monologue to his friends — people who liked him but did not realize, at first, that he was “the Mule”: he is a kind of super being who can control the emotions of other people. They thought at first he was just a funny looking little clown.I am heavily paraphrasing for now. I’ll go back and look up the exact words:I was teased, mocked, put down by others…It took me a while to realize I had special abilities. It took me even longer to realize no one else had them…Then I conceived of a plan to get revenge for my first few decades of life. The Universe had its innings. Now it was my turn.And what is the Mule’s revenge? How does he get back on the Universe for his having had an unhappy childhood and young adulthood?(In particular, the Mule realizes he can never have a normal love live—compare to the lines from Shakespeare below!—he can gain the feeling of “love,” but only artificially, which he does not value.)So the Mule decides to get his revenge by becoming Supreme Ruler, of course, just like any good James Bond villain. The prototype for all such villains is Richard III. Richard, in Shakespeare’s play, comes out in the first scene and says the exact same thing. “Everybody is having a party, while I, a hunchback, am spat upon. So now I’m going to get revenge by taking over the kingdom and becoming the ruler. Everyone who once reviled me will now have to bow to me.”)The similarity is so great, I am certain that it must have occurred to Asimov himself. The Mule is a mutant, and is funny looking, not a “leading man” at all… whereas Richard III is likewise a hunchback and also considered funny looking. Consider the exact words that Shakespeare gives him:But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majestyTo strut before a wanton ambling nymph;I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my timeInto this breathing world, scarce half made up,And that so lamely and unfashionableThat dogs bark at me as I halt by them;Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,Have no delight to pass away the time,Unless to spy my shadow in the sunAnd descant on mine own deformity:And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,To entertain these fair well-spoken days,I am determined to prove a villainAnd hate the idle pleasures of these days.",636 followers,Masrur Amin Ahmed,3.9K,254,2.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-can-you-do-with-1000-GB-of-RAM

When every single national strength that won the Cold War - including alliances - is being dismantled, I think we can safely say that the residual masses who succumb to the mules (several, not just Two Scoops) are operating in modes that are no longer either logical or American.",18 followers,Bob Rush,951,224,3.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-can-you-do-with-1000-GB-of-RAM

22,"Want to know why we can’t send humans to the Moon today? I can answer that question with one word and one number:NASA had plans for three more lunar landings after Apollo 17. Most of the equipment for them was built. Two of the Saturn V rockets that would have taken them to the Moon were built. The crews had been tentatively selected. Apollo 18 even had a mission patch!But those missions never happened. In January, 1970, NASA cancelled Apollo 20. In September, 1970, Congress cut off funding for Apollo 18 and 19 as well. The decision boiled down to three main reasons:Want to know why we can’t send humans to the Moon today?

The decision boiled down to three main reasons:The immediate savings from canceling Apollo 18 and 19 were negligible, just $42 million, since all of the equipment and personnel were already in place for those missions. So the real rationale can be found in reasons #2 and #3. Basically, public support for the Moon landings had always been mixed (except for the burst of excitement around the historic Apollo 11 touchdown), and politicians saw little upside to keeping the program going.Now back to your question. The U.S. couldn’t even go back to the moon in 1973,The same is true today. If the public was clamoring to go back to the Moon, and if the president and Congress were willing to spend the $100 billion or so needed to do it properly, and if there were a goal-oriented plan in place to make it happen, it would happen. Quickly. We would easily make Trump’s 2024 target. Technology is not an obstacle—certainly not computer technology.Instead, NASA has been given trickles of money for human spaceflight. Most of that now supports the International Space Station (a worthy project, in my opinion) and the SLS rocket (a boondoggle designed mostly to create jobs and keep up appearances, in my opinion). The political leaders in the US give NASA a new direction every 4 years, sometimes every 2 years, sometimes changing their minds daily. There is no way to establish a viable human spaceflight program without a consistent set of goals.The real reason we haven’t gone back to the Moon has nothing to do with RAM or computing power, and everything to do with human nature.",UNKNOWN,Corey S.

And this was just a few years away. And USA had absolutely nothing.Then USA, paranoid as always, never thinking anything is urgent until it knocks on the door, really put everything into high gear. They took probably 10% of the national economy and put it towards putting a man on the moon. And the results of basically no budget, a blank check, did not fail. Within a year USA was right there up with the Russians. Space satellites, men floating around earth. You name it.Then JFK decided he wanted a man to walk on the moon before 1st Jan 1970, as in sometime in the 1960s.Hundreds of thousands of people were involved, even Canadians. The immigrants from Europe paid off, many of the Jews that were allowed in were mathematicians, physicists, scientists and they han Werner von Brain. This was a team no money could have paid for, just a homicidal maniac in a European country could accomplish.And with this the Apollo space mission came to be. A man on the moon.Through hard negotiations it was agreed by the countries of earth that no country would own the moon, it was for earth.After 6 successful missions to the moon, 12 men walked there and did experiments, only 1 failed mission, Apollo 13.Then people of USA got tired of paying really high taxes and people had lost interest in space travel. USA stopped their missions. Nasa had their budget reduced dramatically.This had also basically wiped out the money the Russians had to use on space travel. Even though they did eventually make real habitable space stations and did many other things they never landed on the moon. Not because they could not, but there was nothing left to do there.We can go to the moon. You don't need a powerful computer to do this, it isn't even important. What is important is money. This costs significantly more than just going to space. Like many hundred times more.Currently, for USA, there is no imminent threat so they really have no interest whatsoever. European space agency just does not have the money. Russians still have no interest.It is quite limited value you get by sending people to the moon. It is much cheaper to send robots, way way way cheaper. This is why we send robots to Mars, without problems. Mars is currently much more interesting than the moon. We have sent probes to some moons around Jupiter and Saturnus which have changed our view on life in space among other things.It is just money.It is just laughable when these morons claim we can't get there today, with the agenda that we never went there. These are the same idiots who claim we could not build the pyramids of Egypt today. We would have absolutely no problems doing this.

These are made up numbers, don’t get hung up on them, they are just to show you the shape of things.Let’s say it takes nine tons of fuel to get one ton into Earth orbit. So, at launch, that’s a 10 ton craft.Further, it takes one more ton to return to Earth. So now you need a twenty ton at launch vehicle, so you got one ton of capsule plus one ton of fuel up there.But it’s going to take nine tons to move one ton from Earth orbit to Lunar orbit. So you need eighteen tons of fuel to get your one ton of capsule plus one ton of “landing” fuel into that orbit. But that means you need to get twenty tons total (fuel plus craft) up from the Earth’s surface, so you need 180 tons of fuel, that’s a 200 ton launch vehicle.That’s a one way trip, no return ticket, bare minimum to meet your “send a person to the moon” requirements.Nobody is going to send that suicide mission though.So, now you have your one ton capsule on the lunar surface, and you need to get it home. Well, it’s going to take two tons of fuel to get one ton back to lunar orbit. Then it’s going to take nine tons of fuel to get back to Earth orbit for every ton… but that means you need to move a ten ton craft from the lunar surface, which means you had to bring twenty tons of fuel down there. So that’s a 30 ton craft on the Moon, and it took 30 tons of fuel to land it, so that’s a 60 ton craft, and to get THAT from Earth orbit to Lunar orbit took 540 tons of fuel, a 600 ton vehicle, and that means your “launch from Earth’s surface” fuel requirements were 5400 tons, a 6000 ton launch vehicle.What’s that, you need to land that capsule on Earth still? OH, well you need a ton of fuel to get that one ton capsule down. So just double everything.12,000 tons per ton of capsule.Now, the Apollo program didn’t do it that way, it left the “return to Earth” fuel in lunar orbit and sent down just a lander with enough fuel to get the lander itself back up to Lunar orbit. So that helps, if we do it that way. They also skipped the “return to Earth Orbit” part, going in directly to landing, which shaved a significant amount of fuel mass at the end of the day, which matters a lot at the start of the mission.But we also don’t have a lander, we don’t have an ascent from the moon vehicle. Our craft are designed to land in an atmosphere, so we don’t need to go full rocket-only brakes to slow from the 4000mph or so speeds of lunar orbit to a nearly 0 mph landing (again, numbers made up)Could we do it? Yes, we could. We are much better at orbital rendevous now, we have most of the engineering figured out, we could do an assembly-in-Earth-orbit using multiple launches instead of doing everything in one go like the Saturn V. But it would take several years to do this, and that’s good because it would also take several years to train the crew.The US political system has a problem. It works in 4 year increments. So, someone gets elected president, proposes a Lunar mission, people start working on it… and someone else gets elected, cancels it, announces a Mars mission. People start working on that. The next guy gets elected, cancels, announces a Lunar mission. This has been going on for decades, and we’re no closer to either than we were when we started.Someone might do it.

If we restrict ourselves to solely to prismatic shapes (tall columns) then our height would be limited by the compression and tension strength of the material (assuming it is subjected to lateral loads as well gravity loads)","359,012 followers",Sean Kernan,5.5K,5.6K,727.2M,2014,https://www.quora.com/What-can-you-do-with-1000-GB-of-RAM

41,"That’s a more contentious question than it may seem, and I would argue that there are four contenders, each with a solid argument for being considered the world’s tallest mountain.Text-based though our conversation may be right now, I can see your look of confusion. Everyone knows the world’s tallest mountain, right? This ought to be a one-word answer, no?Well fret not, dear reader, for I am about to explain myself. I might as well begin with the answer that everyone knows.EverestReaching an elevation of 8848 meters above sea level, the peak of Everest is traditionally held to be the highest pThat’s a more contentious question than it may seem, and I would argue that there are four contenders, each with a solid argument for being considered the world’s tallest mountain.Text-based though our conversation may be right now, I can see your look of confusion. Everyone knows the world’s tallest mountain, right? This ought to be a one-word answer, no?Well fret not, dear reader, for I am about to explain myself. I might as well begin with the answer that everyone knows.EverestReaching an elevation of 8848 meters above sea level, the peak of Everest is traditionally held to be the highest point on Earth. This is because our traditional measure of height is elevation above sea level, and no other mountain can match Everest in that regard. By traditional metrics, Everest stands supreme.So why do I claim that there are other contenders? The answer has to do with the bases of these mountains.As you can see in the picture above, Everest doesn’t exactly stand alone in its neighborhood. It is in fact merely the tallest pointy bit of theSo let me ask you this: who is taller, a six-and-a-half foot man on four-foot stilts or a seven-foot man in normal shoes? That metaphor brings me to my next claimant.Kilimanjaro(Image source:While the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro is nearly three-thousand meters below Everest’s in terms of total elevation, the tallest mountain in Africa is remarkable for not being part of any mountain range. Everest is merely the longest tooth of the Nepalese Himalayas, but Kilimanjaro rises directly out of the East-African plains. Measured from its base, Kilimanjaro rises about 5600 meters, while Everest’s rise from base is only about 5200. The argument is a shaky one at best, but I still feel it gives Kilimanjaro a claim to being the tallest mountain on Earth by at least one very specific measure.But if we are going to measure from the base, we can actually go much deeper than the African savanna, which brings us to our next claimant.Mauna KeaThe peak of Hawaii’s Mauna Kea stands below even the base of Everest, which might make it seem an odd choice for this list. The base of the mountain, however (as of its sister-peak Mauna Loa), lies at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean’s abyssal plain, giving it a rise that dwarfs all of the above. Measured from its deep-sea base, Mauna Kea rises over 10000 meters, nearly doubling both Everest and Kilimanjaro, though only a tiny portion of the mountain is above sea level. Nonetheless, it is another claimant.So to recap, here is a visual representation of the mountains we have looked at so far:(Image source:But I said that there were four contenders. What is the last one?Our final claimant is one you’ve likely never heard of, but its summit holds a very serious claim to being the highest point on Earth.ChimborazoThe summit of Chimborazo, in Ecuador, holds the interesting distinction of being the farthest point from the center of the Earth. If you are confused, I understand. After all, shouldn’t that be the same as the highest elevation since the Earth is a sphere?As it happens, the Earth is not actually spherical. The centrifugal force of its spin gives it a significant bulge around the equator. In other words, if you shrunk the Earth down to the size of a desktop globe and measured its circumference, you would find that if you stretched your measuring tape around the equator, it would be noticably larger than if you wrapped it from pole to pole. Chimborazo stands at only a single degree of latitude below the Equator, making its peak very slightly (about 2 km) further from the center of the Earth than Everest’s. Here is a super-duper scientific image to demonstrate the difference:(Image source:So in conclusion, while Everest is certainly the tallest mountain by the traditional measuring system, one can certainly build an argument for other peaks being even taller.Thanks for reading, and don’t be afraid to think outside the box.(All images not otherwise sourced are from Wikimedia Commons)",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,8.1K,9.4K,195.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-can-you-do-with-1000-GB-of-RAM
