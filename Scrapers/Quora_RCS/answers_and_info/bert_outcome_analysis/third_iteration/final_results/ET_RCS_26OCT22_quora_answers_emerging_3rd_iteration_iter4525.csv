0,"I'm going to answer this with a story. And then more directly. But I think the story is helpful.When I was near to graduating with an English Literature major and a Classics minor (which, frankly, was a minor focused on Greek and Roman lit and philosophy), I emailed my best friend (who had also been an English major, then done a master's degree in educational philosophy) in a PANIC. I was graduating without any marketable skills if I didn't want to be a teacher! I had wasted a lot of time and money on a degree that was useless!! I am disabled, what employer will take me on with two strikes (heI'm going to answer this with a story. And then more directly. But I think the story is helpful.When I was near to graduating with an English Literature major and a Classics minor (which, frankly, was a minor focused on Greek and Roman lit and philosophy), I emailed my best friend (who had also been an English major, then done a master's degree in educational philosophy) in a PANIC. I was graduating without any marketable skills if I didn't want to be a teacher! I had wasted a lot of time and money on a degree that was useless!! I am disabled, what employer will take me on with two strikes (health and a background in a soft discipline) against me??! What would happen to me??!She wrote me an email full of confidence in me and promises that we would figure it out. I was soothed, but remained quite frightened. (This is not uncommon for Millenials and generations that follow. Job insecurity is rampant. People feel this way all the time, no matter what degree they choose. Still, the fear was very real at the time. Be prepared that you may feel it, too, no matter what you choose.) It is worth noting that my best friend lives in a country where healthcare is not dependent upon landing a good job. She simply could not comprehend the urgency I felt on that score.So, I turned to my father, who is very wise and very tender. He also has always known how to speak in a way my brain will hear through my anxiety. I am INCREDIBLY lucky. I called him and expressed all my fears about what I would do and how I thought I had set myself up for failure by foolishly choosing to study what I loved, rather than something practical.My software engineer, highly-educated father then told me how jealous he was of me. Of what I knew. He told me that there would come a time when the knowledge he had accrued would simply no longer be useful. He would not be a software engineer forever. And once he was no longer working, his skills would see far less use, and be far less applicable in day to day life. He wasn't sorry for choosing to study what he loved, but he was aware that there would, eventually, come a time that it was no longer necessary or useful.He reminded me that I would never see that day. That what I learned—whether it was communication skills or writing skills or how to cogently present and defend an opinion or how to process lots of data into a conclusion or how to interpret information in myriad ways or even what I had learned about humanity through studying their art (both the fictions and truths they told in that art) —would NEVER be useless. My education would serve me in both my vocation, whatever it may be, and my life. My father told me how wonderful he thought that was. My fears didn't go away, but they quieted enough for me to see possibilities and futures that the tunnel vision of fear had obscured.When you study English, you study so much more than stories. In order to understand the symbolism, you have to study culture, law, science, philosophy, religion, history, etc. As you study these other things, even just the small slices of them that allow you to understand, you start to study new ways of thinking and perspective. This is on top of the foundation of grammar, critical thinking, analysis, and communication of ideas that is inherent to an English degree. These are VITAL skills in the workplace.So, returning to the initial question: what are the opportunities for English majors?What opportunities aren't there?Some will require more training, some you will be able to access with the skills you leave the degree with. I have been a customer service professional, where communication and grasping different perspectives is mandatory. I was into non-profit project management for a while (no business degree, but organizational, communication, and analytical skills that I had learned throughout my degree). Now I've moved to finance (still no business or finance degree, but plenty of licensing). I'm using skills I learned in my degree constantly—my dad was right, as he so often is.You will hear a lot of people tell you that an English major is a degree with limited usefulness. F*ck 'em. My fellow graduates have gone into library science, law, teaching, writing, editing, public service, and fundraising. If you really dig in, if you dedicate yourself to learning not just enough to slap together a paper that will make your teacher happy, but about everything I listed above, you will have a degree of LIMITLESS usefulness and opportunity.Good luck, denizen of the internet. I hope you find the right degree and opportunity for you.",20 followers,Rupayan,1.7K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-career-business-do-you-want-to-engage-after-you-graduate-in-your-degree-of-agricultural-technology-Why
1,"Unfortunately our higher education systems have increasingly abandoned the idea of a generalist approach to knowledge and analysis - an approach that has stood western civilisation in good stead for around 800 years - and turned our universities into vocational training centres.   Thus the ignorant reaction that a degree in history is somehow ""useless"" because it doesn't train you for an obvious career or profession on graduation.This is dumb.  Speaking as someone with such a degree, I use the skills I learned while studying obscure corners of Medieval history every day in my corporate job:  aUnfortunately our higher education systems have increasingly abandoned the idea of a generalist approach to knowledge and analysis - an approach that has stood western civilisation in good stead for around 800 years - and turned our universities into vocational training centres.

Speaking as someone with such a degree, I use the skills I learned while studying obscure corners of Medieval history every day in my corporate job:  analysis, research skills, judicious assessment of parsimony, scepticism, persuasive argument, communication etc.I once had a manager who did some dry business degree query why I had ""wasted"" my time at university studying ""irrelevant"" stuff about people long ago.  I responded by pointing to the copies of Sun Tzu and Machiavelli on his shelves of management textbooks and asked if they were ""irrelevant"".  He sheepishly admitted he'd never read them, but acknowledged the point.You use your history degree by applying the keen skills and perspectives you gain in achieving it in any endeavour you undertake.  More great empires and companies have been built by men with degrees in Classics, history and Latin than by any soulless yuppie dorks with frigging MBAs or programmer nerds who think a ""great book"" is one with pictures of superheroes.

3,"Yes, there's a form of democracy that could achieve the goal of the common people being ""sufficiently educated about democracy"".When Dewey mentioned common people engaging in politics, he was not referring to methods of communication, he was talking about what Alasdair MacIntyre called the ""practice of politics"". He was talking about common people interacting directly with their peers to agree on and resolve common problems.In Dewey's time, as at all times since the Federalist and the Democratic-Republican Parties were set up to compete for control of the national and state governments, the poYes, there's a form of democracy that could achieve the goal of the common people being ""sufficiently educated about democracy"".When Dewey mentioned common people engaging in politics, he was not referring to methods of communication, he was talking about what Alasdair MacIntyre called the ""practice of politics"". He was talking about common people interacting directly with their peers to agree on and resolve common problems.In Dewey's time, as at all times since the Federalist and the Democratic-Republican Parties were set up to compete for control of the national and state governments, the political process in the United States has excluded the people. The party system, which George Washington warned, lets ""cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men subvert the power of the people and usurp for themselves the reins of government"", reduced the people to putting one or another political party in power instead of governing themselves.When Dewey wrote in 1926, ""The old saying that the cure for the ills of democracy is more democracy is not apt if it means that the evils may be remedied by introducing more machinery of the same kind as that which already exists, or by refining and perfecting that machinery "" , he was pointing out the need to give the people the machinery they needed to govern themselves.As Archon Fung wrote in Creating Deliberative Publics in 2002, ""the solution to Dewey's conundrum requires devising governance institutions that are more immediately by the people, of the people, and so for the people.However, truly democratic machinery has no champions. There are no flag-wavers, encouraging the people to adopt the machinery, because such a process will not give any individual, group or party an advantage over others. Power-seekers have no interest in letting the ""common people"" resolve their problems by interacting with their peers.There is a form of democracy that would achieve the goal of the common people being ""sufficiently educated about democracy"", but, so far, we've failed to achieve it. It is nothing more than letting the people actually participate in the practice of politics.As far as the internet and bitcoin technology are concerned, I'm amazed they would even be suggested. More than 10 years ago, Ed Nisley, writing in Dr. Dobbs Journal, described the danger of technology when he wrote:~~~o~~~ ~~~o~~~ ~~~o~~~""We will see national-scale attacks produced by teams with national-level resources, simply because the stakes are so high and the result is so attractive. Whether those teams work abroad or within our borders remains to be seen.""In reality, we probably won't see those attacks unless we're very, very lucky. We might, possibly, detect an attack after the fact, but the current security ... makes even that fairly unlikely.Remember: They're smarter, have better resources, and display more motivation than anyone you can hire.""~~~o~~~ ~~~o~~~ ~~~o~~~Since Nisley's warning has been borne out, in spades, it will be worth your time to read the complete article, at:http://www.ddj.com/embedded/196603544I'm not sure how the bitcoin reference could apply to democracy, except as an example of the flood of disappointment flowing down a mountain of myth that is the so-called democracy we presently endure.Fred Gohlke","1,610 followers",Thanos Papangelis,1.5K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-career-business-do-you-want-to-engage-after-you-graduate-in-your-degree-of-agricultural-technology-Why

6,What has one got to do with the other? Democracies are ubiquitous - 210 out of 220 nations have them. America is an Oligarchy - leadership not for the people - primarily because democracy laws here were established when the US was 2 million people. Democratic Republics work well up to around 15-million and then you need controls in place to protect from the rich running the country for special interests.,"68,792 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,918,17.3K,413.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/John-Dewey-answered-critics-of-democracy-with-a-belief-that-common-people-could-become-sufficiently-educated-about-democracy-by-engaging-in-it-With-the-help-of-the-internet-and-bitcoin-technology-can-direct
