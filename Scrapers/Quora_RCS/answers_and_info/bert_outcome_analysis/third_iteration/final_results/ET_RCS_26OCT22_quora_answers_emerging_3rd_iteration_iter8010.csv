0,"Lots of RH/Centos, Scientific Linux and Suse, with some Debian variants like Ubuntu thrown in for no particularly good reason.The distro is generally unimportant for SC, since distros are distinguished primarily by desktop junk like window manager, file browser and color schemes. None of those matter on SC, and it’s very common to recompile all the important user-space (computational programs/tools) anyway. It’s pretty common for SC to not even use GCC for most things, and even to avoid use of glibc.In other words, distro is basically irrelevant for SC.",38 followers,Scott Rainey,2.3K,2.5K,6.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-Linux-distro-do-super-computers-tend-to-use-and-why
1,"LLNL uses a local re-spin is RHEL called TOSS (Tri-lab System Stack) for capacity clusters. Capability clusters tend to rely on specialized operating systems provided by the vendor.My guess would be that SuSE and RHEL variants predominate, but I don’t have any hard data for that.",220 followers,Marvin Varela,889,218,851.7K,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-Linux-distro-do-super-computers-tend-to-use-and-why
2,"Depends which sector the supercomputer is being used in. For example, in the commercial/industrial sector I generally find RedHat distros, in the education sector often one may find Scientific Linux or Centos, the government labs usually choose Centos but often add their own “masala” (mix of spices) to suit their needs and in the rest of the world - it is often a wide and diverse mix.The major reasons for choosing any distro has *everything* to do with the primary mission and the applications they run on it.

A few of course worry about security so they choose the one which supports their hardening add-ons and many times you might find SELinux or distros with their security model implemented on top of it.","3,124 followers",Becca Royal-Gordon,1.9K,4.3K,12M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-Linux-distro-do-super-computers-tend-to-use-and-why

4,"Visiting? Yes, but it’s a low probability.Living on? If you mean permanently, then the answer is probably no.We last visited the moon in 1972. No one has ever “lived” there. We have no real plans to go back.All of the emphasis is on Mars, but we can learn somthing from our trips to the moon: Going is much easier than staying.When we went to the moon, we didn’t worry about a lot of really important stuff. We ignored the long term food, water, and oxygen supply, for example. If the astronauts needed to stay for an extended period of time (for some reason) they were going to die.

We ignored the long term food, water, and oxygen supply, for example. If the astronauts needed to stay for an extended period of time (for some reason) they were going to die. That was just part of the mission. And that is a good thing - it was already massively challenging to send as much stuff to the moon as we did!ToMars is about 150 times farther away from us than the moon is, at its closest. As a very rough approximation, it’s fair to say that going to the moon is 150 times harder and 150 times more expensive. I know all you super space nerds are salivating at this statement, but I saidIn simple terms, we’ll need a lot more food, water, and air. Astronauts will be exposed to lots more radiation, which makes the ship design significantly more complex. Mars is more massive, so leaving is much trickier. And the change in speed required to get there and back is much greater than what was required to go to the moon and back.Now, realize that all of what I just said refers toI think you can see where this is going.StayingSo how do we ever establish colonies?We wait. The technology to affordably stay on Mars (or the moon, for that matter) simply doesn’t exist yet. But technology keeps advancing at a blistering pace. It may not be too long until we can build machines that can make food, water, and oxygen out of rocks. All the elements we need are there - they’re just arranged “incorrectly”. Right now that idea seems almost magical, but think about what Edison might have thought upon seeing a computer…Sadly, you may have been born too early to wait that long. You will (hopefully) live to see humans walk on Mars. You might even get to be one of the lucky few to go yourself.But there were only 12 humans that ever walked on the moon, and chances are they’ll all be dead before a human steps foot on Mars. That should give you an idea of your odds.",0 followers,Wayne Boyd,923,5.1K,13.7M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-Linux-distro-do-super-computers-tend-to-use-and-why
5,"Well, strictly speaking, you can't. Mars is a completely hostile environment to human life, combining extreme cold with an unbreathable atmosphere and intense radiation.

6,"The entry of private enterprise into the business of space travel—SpaceX, Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic and others—means that in just a few years access to space will open up like never before. Their ultimate goals differ—Only SpaceX and Elon Musk have a longer term goal of providing the means to initiate colonization of Mars beginning by the middle of the next decade. In fact, Musk will be revealing more details about his Mars plans at a conference in September.There’s no guarantee, of course, but you can be sure that you were born into an era where visionaries have the means to make things haThe entry of private enterprise into the business of space travel—SpaceX, Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic and others—means that in just a few years access to space will open up like never before.

In fact, Musk will be revealing more details about his Mars plans at a conference in September.There’s no guarantee, of course, but you can be sure that you were born into an era where visionaries have the means to make things happen in space beyond the political and financial limitations of a single government agency. Don’t focus on NASA alone.My personal opinion is that once lower cost, safer access to space is developed, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson won’t be the only billionaire businessmen to invest in space. Technology, exploration and exploitation of resources will happen fast than anyone anticipated.It remains to be seen whether Musk will be able to send a manned mission to Mars by the middle of the 2020’s, but I’m sure it will happen eventually, with or without SpaceX.Will you get your chance? It’s impossible to know—but you have a better chance of living into that age than any previous generation.In the meantime, I suggest you take the initiative to express your passion for Mars and space to Musk, Bezos, Branson and other space visionaries.

That game got 7,000 download daily on its peak and I sold it to an investment firm. That money allowed me to buy a newer laptop and from then I could make games much faster and endlessly.I kept making games non stop and eventually even got a game onto Steam, which took 1–2 years to make! During this time I hired professional coders and developers to help speed the progress. However I kept making more games and more platforms and now I have another game on Steam which I plan on perfecting over the summer and publishing it.Here is my current workstation. I love using laptops and though I understand the power difference I still prefer them over desktops.But after I kept growing I even got featured on National News and that boosted the interest and increased the downloads by a bit. But it also boosts your morale and keeps you going so make sure you share your work with others for free marketing and awareness.As I mentioned earlier I started as one person on a laptop and now have dozens of games published and working on the second one with Steam.Here is a picture of my first game Apartment 666 ( in game play).Here's a sample of my second game on Steam I plan on calling it “The Cemtery”.",1 follower,Chris Nash,681,5K,30.7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-Linux-distro-do-super-computers-tend-to-use-and-why
9,"No.Generally they don’t need a lot of hands early in new game development. That’s because the design isn’t completely clear yet and things are still changing quickly.When development ramps up after about 1/3 into development and the dust has settled, they generally need more hands. Near the last third of development they need the most people for all roles, but especially test.It depends on the game, the studio and the current staffing. But generally early in development, they don’t need a huge team yet. Once they know what they’re building, they’ll start hiring.

They get publishing deals that pay on a monthly milestone. This is why many of those studios do full layoffs at the end of the project (and before the next project is signed) - which, coincidently, is why we LOVE DLC so much. Having to keep a chunk of the team working for 3–6 months after shipping - with pay - is a great feeling of job security.","37,922 followers",Ron Rule,749,2.7K,51.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-Linux-distro-do-super-computers-tend-to-use-and-why
