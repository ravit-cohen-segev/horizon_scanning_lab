They were told that America had lost a national resource. American schools, no longer produced Scientists and Engineers that have the ability to compete on the world stage in terms of technology and creativity, the advanced technology and high ability levels needed for the most creative innovations in the Defense industry. They, DARPA, began two 10 million dollar a year programs to help high school students, and high schools, reach for this level of achievement in Robotics. It was estimated that Japan’s “Asimov” robot technology is about 50 years in advance of American robotics technology. Israel produces more advanced tech than America.In 1983 the President requested a report called, “A Nation at Risk”. It says that, “If this much damage had been done to the American education system by another country it would be considered an Act of War. That report does not support your claim.In 1993 I found a quote from the people that conduct the national assessment of education program, NAEP and I took it to my local School Board. It said, “In America 50% of math students drop out of math each year, and by graduation only 5% are at grade level.” I think they meant “a drop out” was a person that had become unable to learn - math. The article went on to say that by the time math students graduate with a PhD in Math, only 600 students per year remain. This idea applies to all levels of math, and I think education in America. When I took my concerns to my local school board I placed the idea of the quote into a line on a graph and asked them to provide the community with similar graphs showing the actual data from our school for starting grade 1 through completing grade 12 for Math, Reading, Writing and Science. They would not do that for the community, nor privately to me.Any questions?Leon",4 followers,Matthew Bates,1.4K,9.8K,292.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-so-many-people-criticise-joke-about-the-American-education-system-yet-it-produces-the-most-advanced-technology-in-the-world

3,"People look at the headlines about, for example, the PISA international tests. There they see that the US lags far behind the schools of other nations.

Most of the world begins to track students into vocational vs. university categories by age 12, and those students in the voc tracks do not take those tests I mentioned above. Because we assess everybody, our scores drop. But there was a study done 5 or 6 years ago - I think by NAEP? - that compared our elite public high schools, and our students there, the ones who are most like the uni track students in the rest of the world, were right in there with the same scores.So why do so many people criticize/joke about the American education system? Either because they don’t understand the system, that ALL have the opportunity, or because it makes them feel better about themselves.Either way, I don’t need to worry about them. I just need to ensure that the students in my care get the best education we are able to provide.","84,233 followers",Igor Markov,669,3.9K,49.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-so-many-people-criticise-joke-about-the-American-education-system-yet-it-produces-the-most-advanced-technology-in-the-world

Another data point, DARPA: of course DARPA would say that; they were gathering funds and partners to further their agenda.

7,"Here’s my perspective as a former public school student and current private school teacher. What education in America needs, more than anything else at this point, is a lot more truth in the conversation. Once that happens, the solutions will be obvious.Truth: Most problems with education today originate in students’ homes, and there is little to nothing schools can do to help students who have little to no support system inside of the home.Solution: Just accepting this fact will help bring other solutions to the table. PoliticiansHere’s my perspective as a former public school student and current private school teacher. What education in America needs, more than anything else at this point, is a lot more truth in the conversation. Once that happens, the solutions will be obvious.Truth: Most problems with education today originate in students’ homes, and there is little to nothing schools can do to help students who have little to no support system inside of the home.Solution: Just accepting this fact will help bring other solutions to the table. PoliticiansTruth: Public schools, on average, spend more per student than private schools, yet private schools usually get better results. A lot of this is because private schools can be selective in who they let in. The best schools in the country are selective one way or another: because they’re magnet schools, private schools, or draw their students completely from affluent areas, so their students are de facto selective based on ability to afford that area. The worst schools are the schools that have to take all students, and a majority of those students come from impoverished areas.Solution: School choice. Allow parents to tell the government which school should be paid for educating their child, even if it’s a private school. It’s the best life preserver to throw to the students with potential who are drowning in failing schools that we have right now. Any other solution would take decades to implement, has probably already been tried and failed, and would lead to unintended consequences that would make things worse for many. A $1:$1 tax rebate for private school tuition would also work here.Truth: A significant amount of teacher’s time is spent documenting bad behavior from students, and a significant number of students will not behave unless they are being watched constantly.Solution: Security-style cameras in the classroom. Instead of wasting time trying to write exactly how a student “was giving attitude” to a teacher, knowing that “giving attitude” is never enough to write, a teacher could just write the time and the classroom the incident happened, and let the administration and parents see it for themselves. This would also help a lot for my next truth:Truth: In most places, a student can give up and drop out of school at age 16, but a school district is required to provide some sort of educational services to a student until they’re 21. A lot of taxpayer money is essentially wasted on older students who’ve shown zero interest or ability in being educated and cause disruptions for other students.Solution: Just as a student can give up on school at age 16, a school should be able to give up on a student at that age. There should be a “push out” age, just as there is a “drop out” age. The criterion for being pushed out should be based completely on discipline records, not academic ability. If a student only seems to come to school to cause problems, the school shouldn’t have to deal with them.",2 followers,Himanshu Chavhan,20.4K,71,659.6K,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-so-many-people-criticise-joke-about-the-American-education-system-yet-it-produces-the-most-advanced-technology-in-the-world

The quantum computer was a bit like the early NASA computers: large, expensive, strangely complex, and not well understood. The design was out there, of course, but nobody had perfected it so it was expensive and specialized.In 2017, the field of quantum computing experienced massive growth. Quantum computers, for the first time, began to experience impressive advances in technology. They got faster, more efficient, more powerful, and most importantly, a lot cheaper.If advancements in quantum computing continue at the rate that they’re happening now, then by mid-2018, we might see quantum computers start entering the consumer lifestyle.Why is that cool? Well, imagine playing a really good video game, like Civilization 5 or Starcraft 2. With a normal computer, you get decent graphics, a few hundred troops max, and somewhat limited maps.An advanced quantum computer could destroy those specs. You would get insanely fast gameplay, no lag, and near perfect graphics. In fact, a quantum computer could probably be playing five of those games at once, because it has such an incredible supply of processing power. (The AI for those games would also experience a massive boost as well.)The future of epic computers has nearly arrived. A world without overflow errors, 504 errors, or 30 second loading periods for websites.

In my article, I talk about the Greek historian Thoukydides (lived c. 460 – c.  400 BC), who rejected the idea of an ancient Golden Age. Instead, he believed that humanity was growing steadily more advanced and that the Greeks of very early times must have been exceedingly primitive compared to Greeks of his own era.There were certainly Romans who thought similar things, although I cannot think of any specific examples off the top of my head. Nonetheless, I’m sure that even the ancient Romans who did realize that humans were growing more technologically advanced probably wouldn’t have imagined the kinds of technologies we have today.Back then, technological progress was moving much more slowly than it is today and I’m sure that even most progressive-minded Romans probably would have assumed that it happened at a constant rate. As it turns out, though, technological progress is exponential; every new invention makes the next invention come a little bit faster. Consequently, we have technologies today that few people in ancient times would have even dreamed of.ABOVE: Image of a man dressed in a less-than-historically-accurate Roman soldier costume riding on a Segway poorly disguised as a chariot",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-so-many-people-criticise-joke-about-the-American-education-system-yet-it-produces-the-most-advanced-technology-in-the-world

In male life expectancy Israel is ranked higher than both, if you factor out war related deaths and terroist attacks Israel takes the first place in the world with ease [3]. In air force[4] and intelligence? Yes . I would argue that israel is even more advanced than the USA in Cyber and intelligence[5]. It's just that Israel does much more classified work which is desperately kept discreet. Israel is more advanced than both in agriculture and farming related science and inventions. Israel is more advanced than both in terms of patents and creative scientific publications per capita. Israel has more academic educated people than both of them per capita. In the modern era Israel has put out more world first-class mathematicians, computer scientists, musicians and chess players than both[6] . Israel has many top class computer scientists and is a superpower in computer science [7]. Israel has won more Turing awards for computer science than both of them combined not even per capita ( per capita Israel is no. 1 in the world). The list goes on and on. The problem is that mostly these things are not so prominent to the average people because they are just good on measures of ‘per capita ‘ and ‘average ‘. But the fact that these countries are at least ten times Israel’s size confuse us and make them in some sense more prominent . For example, there are more academic degree holders in IsraelNow imagine how would Israel have looked like if it was 10 times bigger (80000000 ppl) ? Scarry , isn't it? Too strong to compete with.[1] From Wikipedia “Israeli engineers have been at the cutting edge of solar energy technology” it doesn't specify what it means. But it does provide a hint that Israel was a pioneer in solar energy since 1950. And Wikipedia states that “Israel is now the world leader in the use of solar energy per capita”[2] From Wikipedia “Israel is a world leader in medical and paramedical research, and bioengineering capabilities. Biotechnology, medical, and clinical research account for over half of Israel's scientific publications, and the industrial sector uses this extensive knowledge to develop new pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, and treatment therapies.[67] Among other areas of medicine, Israel is a leader in stem cell research, with the largest number of articles, patents and research studies per capita,[68] as well as research into regenerative medicine and medical marijuana.”[3] Israel is ranked no. 2 in the world for male life expectancy. Wars in Israel are far more common than in Germany and Japan. Wars take the average down pretty significantly due to the relatively young age of 20. Once you factor it out Israel is by far first in the world for both male[4] Israel is definitely in the top 4 air forces in the world and arguably the best.[5] In both cyber and intelligence Israel is ranked in top 3 . But in recent years Israel has performed some real nasty hacking stuff that pro Americans and computer scientists admitted to be completely clueless on how possibly the Israelis could do it. Same in intelligence, Israel helped the usa far more than the usa did israel with intelligence information. Recently Israel informed the usa about the Russians using Kaspersky software for hacks[6] World first class mathematicians were classified by number of publications and citations. The one with the biggest publications happened to be an Israeli mathematician. Computer scientists were selected both by publications and prestigious awards like Turing and Godel prizes. Musicians were chosen by number of concerts hence Perlman, Zuckerman and Birnbaum (Who is ironically conducting the German philharmony) and many more. Chess players were chosen by the ELO system chess ranking.[7] In the Shanghai rankings of thousands of universities and academic institutions. Israel is the only country besides the usa and one Swiss academy which has an institution in the top 10 in computer science. The Weizmann Institute of Science is ranked tenth in the list!!!
