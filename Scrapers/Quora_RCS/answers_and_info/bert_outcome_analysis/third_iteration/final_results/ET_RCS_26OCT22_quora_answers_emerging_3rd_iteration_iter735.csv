Learning is the ultimate source of intelligence, so solving learning in machines is just the same as solving intelligence in machines. This makes ML a somewhat final frontier to solve intelligence once and for all.ML can take various forms, today it may be a glorified mathematical optimization theory and tomorrow it might be something else. Gradient based optimization algorithms have dominated the way ML model parameters are updated in order to adapt the system to the task at hand. But maybe that is not how it should be done, in fact, in the human brain there is no evidence of such backpropagation of errors during learning. ML can thus involve any learning algorithm that improve a model given a goal or some data to model. Thus in the future ML might take a totally different form from what we have today. Most likely non-differentiable models will start to become more attractive and methods to optimize such models will start to scale up to larger non-differentiable systems.But multiple levels of representations, the basis of deep learning (DL), is more likely to survive through out the evolution of ML as a field. This is because deeper representations are also present in mammalian brains which tells us that casting problems in terms of simpler constituents and build up from there is a very powerful way to solve problems. We do it even when developing software systems with different layers of representations. Thus expect DL as a field to also evolve overtime but carrying with it the basis of compositional nature of representation.Thus as a field ML will most likely stay but the algorithms will shift overtime and as the field become more broader, just like artificial intelligence (AI), it will just split into more sub-fields to allow for specialization. Think of it as a tree, the first was AI and overtime AI became too broad and so we have ML as a child. So as ML gets older it will simply just have children.Thus ML might have child fields involving the study of conciousness in machines such as freewill, independent thought and emotions. This makes things interesting because after solving intelligence the next problem is of course conciousness, we will probably wonder if our algorithms are conscious and how we can study their ability to possess independent thought, reasoning and freewill, it will be more like machine life. It will also be more like machine psychology.But we are far from that, as a very young field itself, ML is far from thinking about having a family of its own. There are a lot of unanswered questions in ML such as:Hope this helps.","10,686 followers",Daniel Tunkelang,822,685,4.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Which-companies-according-to-you-could-lead-the-next-technological-revolution

This improvement owes so much for the idea of learning the representation behind the raw data and this is I think the most important aspect in deep neural networks.In the era of ML we were feeding the system according to our limited vision which is technicall called “hand crafted features”. In those days, AI and ML related studies were struggling about pre processing/feature extraction and better discrimination through better optimization techniques. However, the representation was still being shaped via our limited foresight. As i said before, thanks to DNNs we have achieved to let the computers learn to learn. Likewise, the revealing the underlying representation has been unleashed. But is this the end?No. Because, though representation learning achieves good targets, computers still have luck of inferring capability. Reasoning is also another problem. For instance, an LSTM network could be good at text generation but the understanding the meaning of objects still needs research on it.What if a computer was able to write its own core code for new virus threats? Does it sound nice??At this point reasoning focused studies will become much important in near future. Researchers wish to find a way for computers to let them understand the problem and come up with an algorithm to solve it. The future of AI will be on this hot topic i think.Related to your question, if you point out the sentiment analyis sourced from the textual/imagery data, i can say that, emotion classification will be improved. But if you talk about the emulation of human emotions, i could truly say that emotions are much more complicated than the thoughts themselves.By the way, i can sugget you to search differantiable neural computers and generative adversial neural nets","50,704 followers",Håkon Hapnes Strand,1.7K,4.4K,85.8M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-will-the-next-technology-bust-in-silicon-valley-look-like

I expect we'll see remarkable innovations in both material science and automated inspection as part of this.  Being able to recapture and recycle the first stages economically will drastically reduce the cost of getting to orbit.While this is work is ongoing SpaceX is also working on the Falcon Heavy.  This is a larger rocket with much higher payload capacity.  The Falcon heavy will directly benefit from the recovery and recycling work.  One huge benefit is that the engineers can view a flight-tested engine without fishing it off of the bottom of an ocean.  Cheaper recycled stages should enable more test flights as well.The last piece of the puzzle is the manned Dragon capsule.  This exists today, and has completed some testing.
