This above mentioned is based on my own experience dealing with CryptoFXnetwork.But its fortunes continue to fluctuaNevertheless, that’s still a huge climb from the £6,653 it was valued at preceisely a year ago,The decentralised electronic currency has come a long way since its conception in 2008, when idealistic early adopters, angered by the latest financial crash, saw it as a means of bypassing the crony capitalist institutions that had dropped society into recession through greed and negligence.Born of the same anti-establishment spirit of “taking back control” that inspired such movements as Anonymous, Occupy and WikiLeaks or the more recent GameStop war on Wall Street short-sellers, Bitcoin’s practical problems and inefficiencies have gradually come to light, from its lack of consumer protection to facilitating crimes like black market trading, money laundering and tax evasion.Perhaps its most glaring issue is the huge environmental impact of Bitcoin mining, the process by which virtual coins are generated.Even though Bitcoin is unregulated, it still needs to verify all transactions carried out between traders to keep the playing field honest and does so by leaving the responsibility with “miners”, who effectively act as auditors updating a ledger, an idea originating with the cryptocurrency’s mysterious architect, known only by the pseudonym “Satoshi Nakamoto”.To do this - otherwise thought of as adding a block to the blockchain - miners race to guess a random number, one of which is released approximately every 10 minutes, a chase that involves huge quantities of computer processing power as their machines strive to solve complex but arbitrary mathematical equations in the hope of getting there first and being rewarded with a highly lucrative coin.As the blockchain becomes ever longer, the calculations become ever more complicated, requiring the use of supercomputers to carry out the trial-and-error hunt for the solution.More than 150 quintillion attempts at guessing the number are now carried every second of the day all around the world, with sprawling aircraft hangars filled with computers working 24-hours a day far from uncommon.These cryptocurrency farms require vast amounts of electricity to go about their business, given that a single Bitcoin transaction leaves a carbon footprint of 360kg, compared to 500mg from an average Visa transaction, according to Digiconomist founder Alex de Vries.As such, they are commonly set up in places where power is cheapest, most notably northwestern China’s Xinjiang Province - home to the oppressed Uighur minority - where coal is abundant and still accounts for two-thirds of the country’s energy use.Chinese Bitcoin mines are not only reliant on finite fossil fuel resources but their huge electricity usage results in carbon emissions that are said to be accelerating so rapidly, according to one new study, that they will soon exceed the energy consumption of Italy and Saudi Arabia if urgent action is not taken to rein then in.Unchecked, the annual power consumption of China’s Bitcoin industry is forecast to peak at 297 terawatt-hours (Twh) by 2024, surpassing the carbon emissons output of the Czech Republic and Qatar.For the planet as a whole, the computing power required to support Bitcoin’s underlying network now requires nearly as much energy as the whole of Argentina.Analysis by the University of Cambridge published last month suggests Bitcoin mining uses more than 121 Twh annually, which would rank it in the top 30 electricity consumers worldwide if it were a country.Power demand from crypto farms in Abkhazia in north westerrn Georgia has been so high in recent years that rolling blackouts became the norm and equipment had to be confiscated by the state.Another environmental impact of Bitcoin mining stems from the fact that the technology is still dependent on short-lived hardware to process its calculations, which inevitably burns out and needs to be replaced, prompting a spike in demand for microprocessing chips.“Semiconductor manufacturers Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company are the only companies capable of mass-producing the specific chips Bitcoin mining device manufacturers like Bitmain need, and these companies are already facing significant challenges in meeting chip demand, in addition to the pressure from Bitcoin miners,” says De Vries of the resulting global chip shortage and price inflation.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,1.4K,996,156.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-cryptocurrency-have-a-bad-impact-on-the-climate-Arent-the-coins-purely-digital
1,"Don’t confuse what’s true of Bitcoin for being true of all cryptocurrencies.Cryptocurrencies use an anti-fraud measure called hashing, which takes a set input and reduces it to an unintelligible garble, but it has a very useful feature; a small change on the input will completely change the hash, meaning the network can use it as a digital fingerprint.The internet uses hashes a lot, for everything from creating links to checking for malware. Every time you download a program, it will have a hash of your download file so you can manually check for malware. If the hash doesn’t match the downloadDon’t confuse what’s true of Bitcoin for being true of all cryptocurrencies.Cryptocurrencies use an anti-fraud measure called hashing, which takes a set input and reduces it to an unintelligible garble, but it has a very useful feature; a small change on the input will completely change the hash, meaning the network can use it as a digital fingerprint.The internet uses hashes a lot, for everything from creating links to checking for malware. Every time you download a program, it will have a hash of your download file so you can manually check for malware. If the hash doesn’t match the download site’s stated hash, you know your download has been compromised.Cryptocurrencies require a genesis block—the start of the whole cryptocurrency process—to start with specific hashes. Again, this is a security device so the flow of information can be tracked all the way back to its creation. And here we come to the environmental impact; because these blocks must start with very specific hashes, you have to burn a whole lot of processing power to find valid strings for a genesis block.This is typically called “mining,” because a genesis block is something which is found with processing power, not made.The machines which can be used to search for genesis blocks can get very large, use a whole lot of electronics, and are exceptionally power-hungry.However, the quest for genesis blocks is short-lived.Ethereum—the #2 cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin—is hoping to transition away from using miners in favor of proof of stake transaction validators inEven Bitcoin will not have miners forever. Bitcoin’s halving cycle reduces the Bitcoin reward for mining every few years and finding genesis blocks becomes more difficult as people find more of them.Last, just because cryptocurrency mining operations use power does not necessarily mean that they are using fossil fuels. That’s usually the case, I grant. But cryptocurrency miners are also mobile, and can encourage hydroelectric and geothermal plants to be made where it would normally not be cost effective. Cryptocurrency doesn’t care where you are so long as you have an internet connection.Lastly, some of the claims about cryptocurrency energy usage are…flat out untrue. I suggest you watch Guy’s presentation on this to get the scoop.The bottom line is that yes, cryptocurrency does use energy and consume a lot of electronics manufacture, but that doesn’t have to translate to environmental damage (in fact, it’s sometimes the reverse) and this is not an immutable aspect of the industry. Developers are working to change it as we speak.",2 followers,Kelly Pearson,1K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-cryptocurrency-have-a-bad-impact-on-the-climate-Arent-the-coins-purely-digital

3,"Year to date, Litecoin has enjoyed a pretty impressive performance.

This above mentioned is based on my own experience dealing with CryptoFXnetwok.In keeping with other cryptocurrencies, Litecoin suddenly embarked on a massive surge – managing to smash through $50. This had long served as a psychological barrier for traders, much like $10,000 was once a difficult hurdle for Bitcoin to overcome. But the bull run was far from over. During November, LTC rose from $55 to $88 – resulting in gains of 60 per cent.December saw Litecoin finish off the year in style. As BTC smashed records by securing highs above $24,000, LTC reached a 52-week high of $123.76. For several consecutive days after Bitcoin’s journey beyond $20,000 began, Litecoin was even outperforming the world’s biggest cryptocurrency in percentage terms – consistently delivering double-digit gains along with the likes of XRP. That said, LTC did suffer a nasty correction on December 22 – with prices tumbling by 10.45 per cent over a 24-hour period.When it comes to Litecoin price predictions for 2021, there are a few interesting insights to take away from the recent market surge. The fact that LTC managed to outperform BTC so substantially indicates we could see a pattern of outsized gains if there are further rallies in 2021. It may also be the case that these healthy returns are linked to the block reward halving that Litecoin executed in August 2019. These tend to take 12 to 18 months to kick in, meaning that the timing is perfect for a bull run.The other factor informing Litecoin predictions for the year ahead is a fundamental one. Right now, there is renewed investor interest in cryptocurrencies overall. In the past, once newcomers start to get familiar with Bitcoin and how it works, they tend to branch out into other altcoins that show promise. LTC’s all-time high was set in 2017 and stands at $375 – meaning that prices could more than treble and still have further to go before smashing records. This could end up making Litecoin a tempting proposition for investors who are on the hunt for cryptocurrencies that could be undervalued.Last but not least, don’t underestimate the significance of Litecoin being supported by PayPal’s new crypto service – especially when it comes to the LTC price prediction for 2021. The fintech giant is gradually rolling out this infrastructure worldwide next year, enabling consumers to buy, sell and hold digital assets – and use them with merchants. This has the potential to introduce Litecoin to millions of new consumers.","1,772 followers",Thomas Y Graham,942,55,4.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-cryptocurrency-have-a-bad-impact-on-the-climate-Arent-the-coins-purely-digital

5,"What Is Litecoin?Litecoin was founded in October 2011 by former Google employee Charlie Lee. Like many other cryptocurrencies, it provides a peer-to-peer transaction system that is not managed by any central authority.“I wanted Litecoin to complement Bitcoin—not compete”, fortune quotes Lee as saying. “Bitcoin can be used for moving millions of dollars between banks, buying houses, buying cars. (…) Litecoin can be used for cheaper things.”In other words, if Bitcoin was like gold — a store of value — Litecoin is like silver: a currency created to be more suitable for daily transactions.A lot ofWhat Is Litecoin?Litecoin was founded in October 2011 by former Google employee Charlie Lee.

(…) Litecoin can be used for cheaper things.”In other words, if Bitcoin was like gold — a store of value — Litecoin is like silver: a currency created to be more suitable for daily transactions.A lot of opportunities are opened to cryptocurrency holders where they can double their cryptocurrency within few days by investing legitimately in platforms like www.coastminers.tech where they can get double of their investment in 7 days without losing them(thank me later).Similarities Between Litecoin And BitcoinBoth Bitcoin and Litecoin’s supply is finite. Bitcoin’s circulation will be capped at 21 million and Litecoin’s at 84 million. This doesn’t mean that once all of the supply is in circulation, you won’t be able to have access to the currency. In fact, based on the supply-and-demand principle, the value of Bitcoin and Litecoin will go up if more people buy into it.In addition to their supply cap, the two currencies also share the same production process, which is called “mining.” In order to release new cryptocurrency into circulation, the so-called “miners” must take a set of transactions and complete an algorithmic challenge to find a hash of their content.This hash, which is a long string of numbers, acts like a unique code identifying and verifying this set of transactions, also known as “block”. Once it’s found, the proof-of-work mechanism regulates which valid block is added to the blockchain.To generate new hashes with the same content, the miners add an integer, called a nonce (“number used once”).Finding and creating this code is so complex that miners — who could also be considered auditors — are forced to use custom hardware and mining software. Also, only the first miner who solves the nonce challenge will be rewarded with cryptocurrency, which in turn goes back into the system.The block is then recorded in Bitcoin’s or Litecoin’s “blockchain,” which is the public ledger. As a result of this block creation, more currency is being produced.Both of the currencies’ blockchain records are transparent and publicly available, which adds an important layer of security as anyone can audit transactions at any time.Why Buy Litecoin?There are three core factors that differentiate Litecoin from Bitcoin and they are transaction speed, mining ease, and numeric appeal.1. Transaction SpeedIt takes Bitcoin roughly 10 minutes to create a block and complete a transaction. Litecoin, on the other hand, produces blocks in only 2.5 minutes.In 2017, Litecoin introduced an even faster way to process transactions called “SegWit,” which stands for Segregated Witness. SegWit essentially introduces blocks that can accommodate more transactions with them. The first SegWit payment was made on May 11th and successfully completed a transaction from Zurich to San Francisco in less than a second.The speed of transaction definitely secures Litecoin’s status as more of a utility when compared to Bitcoin, and it will likely get the attention of merchants who strongly prefer fast transactions over slower, more complicated ones.2. Clear LeadershipLitecoin was created by Charlie Lee, who has supervised the development and evolution of Litecoin. Charlie Lee promotes LTC as a complementary cryptocurrency to Bitcoin and not a competitor. More importantly, Charlie Lee has been able to be the face of Litecoin in a way that Bitcoin has never had. As the Managing Director of the Litecoin Foundation, he oversees the development of the Litecoin cryptocurrency which shows a very clear leadership structure for those investing.3. Merchant AppealBitcoin will cap its circulation at 21 million and Litecoin at 84 million. This means that with more and more people investing in the currencies, at some point goods with smaller price tags will be charged at decimals. A book, for example, ends up costing 0.00009 BTC (Bitcoin).That’s not a very consumer-friendly number, and it will only become more difficult to distinguish or even understand these decimal price tags. With a significantly larger circulation cap — four times that of Bitcoin — Litecoin prevents this decimal effect from happening anytime soon.When Is The Best Time To Buy Litecoin?Litecoin has the potential to grow exponentially. In fact, “with a couple of exceptions, Litecoin’s price has toed the line with Bitcoin’s price,” says Investopedia’s Rakesh Sharma. And so far, only 64% of Litecoin’s 84 million coins have been released into circulation, with roughly 30 million to go.Judging by Litecoin’s growth in 2017 with gains of over 7,000 percent according to fortune, the time to buy Litecoin, or to start diversifying your cryptocurrency wallet, might be now.“No one can say how many tokens and coins and blockchain protocols will eventually win out, but the experts seem to think there’s room for a multitude,” Robert Hackett of Yahoo! Finance concludes.",0 followers,Glen Boston,653,71,1.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-cryptocurrency-have-a-bad-impact-on-the-climate-Arent-the-coins-purely-digital

Which is not good enough for a proper and long term investment.But as a trader and a business man, our main focus is making money, so if you have invested 10$ in 2020 while Litcoin was about 45$, one year later that's 2021 when it rose to 431$, you would have been 9x richer of any amount you have invested i.e for 10$ that's 91$.So yes Litcoin might not have all it take for a long term investment but yes you can still profit from it on a short-term, at least it's better than Dogecoin that's influenced by just one man",6 followers,Ryan Burner,1.7K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-time-to-buy-Litecoin

I almost gave up too until i came across CryptoFXnetwork Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www . cryptofxnetwork . com) where i get profit on my invested cryptocurrency after 10 trading days. Don’t be left out. Be like me. I still believe in Cryptocurrency.Note:The coin was launched on October 11 and its price was very low – about $3 for quite a long time. Only in November 2013, we can see the first significant price movements. LTC jumped three times higher and hit USD 40 within a few days. These days, Bitcoin grew to $1000 and then fell to its previous positions so Litecoin totally followed its price movements. However, in May 2014 Litecoin dropped to $10 and then in October to $3 per coin. After the correction, the crypto was traded between $1 and $4 for three years, until 2017.In March 2017 Litcoin announced the launch date of their SegWit protocol which affected the rate and coin achieved $16. In May LTC launched the protocol which pushed the price to $30. Also, the dev team implemented Lighting Network which attracted more attention to the coin. Later LTC will achieve $70 in September and then went back to $40. However, the whole market was bullish and Bitcoin set new price records. So in December 2017, Litecoin reached $100 per coin and at the mid of December even $350.Now we are in the bearish stage, the whole market is red so for the most part of 2018, the LTC price chart has been demonstrating a descending trend. Only in February and April the coin tried to break this tendency but couldn’t resist the market movement for long. At the end of 2018, it finally stabilized and started gaining momentum.In 2019 Litcoin continued its price growth and in June reached $130 per coin when Bitcoin was over $12000. Also, the upcoming Litecoin halving played its role and helped the rate to jump higher. Then it was followed by the correction, so today Litcoin cost about $62.What can determine the LTC future priceYou have probably already noticed that Litecoin price follows the Bitcoin price. If we take a look at the price charts of both digital currencies we will find out that they are almost identical.The second factor that affects the price of digital silver is new technologies. Litecoin was at the forefront of modern and relevant technologies. It was the first to implement SegWit protocol and Atomic swaps also, it has implemented the Lighting Network. All these technologies can revolutionise sphere of the cryptocurrency payments.Another important price factor is that Litecoin is designed as a payment tool. The coin is widely used by various businesses and merchants around the globe. You can pay with LTC for clothing and furniture, art and collectables, health and beauty services, etc. The full list of merchants can be found on their official website. New stores and services that will accept Litecoin may also positively affect the price of the cryptocurrency.Litecoin price predictionLitecoin price prediction for 2020 – 2025 by WalletInvestorLTC price prediction for 2020 – 2025 by DigitalCoinPriceLitecoin price forecast for 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 by LongForecastLTC price forecast for 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 by TradingBeastsLitecoin price prediction for 2020, 2025 and 2030 by CoinPrice Forecast",27 followers,Fernando Reyes,699,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-time-to-buy-Litecoin

When using Bitcoin for the first time people should get an idea of how it works. Digital money is different than the traditional finance world is used to. It offers three core values in which many currencies cannot attain: Decentralization, Open Source, and Peer-to-Peer networking. It is important to get an idea of how to use Bitcoin before investing in it or opening a wallet. AtBitcoin: What Is It and why Is It Important?Who Developed Bitcoin?The original Bitcoin code was designed by Satoshi Nakamoto under MIT open source license. In 2008 Nakamoto outlined the idea behind Bitcoin in his white paper, which scientifically described how the cryptocurrency would function. Bitcoin is the first successful digital currency designed with trust in cryptography over central authorities. Satoshi left the Bitcoin code in the hands of developers and the community in 2010. Thus far hundreds of developers have added to the open source code throughout the years.What is the Blockchain?Bitcoin is dependent on the blockchain that underlies and structures the system. The blockchain is the vertebrae of the protocol and the glue that holds the network together. It is simply a vast, distributed public ledger of account. It keeps track of every transaction ever made in the network, and all transactions are timestamped and verified by network miners. This is how it works: miners with specialized computers compete to solve mathematical puzzles with other computers, and once they solve a puzzle they are awarded with some Bitcoin, and they also add a “block” of completed transactions to the blockchain for future viewing and verifiability. Once a block is added to the chain the cycle repeats itself, and the computers continue to compete to solve these difficult problems. Every transaction on the blockchain is completely transparent and accounted for in its log. Anyone can see the public keys of any transaction they want (although there are no names associated with transactions). One could go all the way back and view the very first transactions ever made on the first block ever created; this block was called the Genesis Block.What is Double Spending?Double-Spending is the act of using the same bitcoins twice. There is only a 21 million set limit on the protocol and no more can be produced. So the network protects against double spend by the verification of each recorded transaction. The blockchain ledger ensures that the transactions are finalized by its inputs confirmed by miners. The confirmations make each unique Bitcoin and its subsequent transactions legitimate. If one tried to duplicate a transaction the original blocks deterministic functions would change showing the network that it is counterfeit and would not to be accepted.How is the Blockchain Different from Banking Ledgers?Why Bother with Bitcoin?That’s the million dollar question, and there’s probably a ton of answers you could give yourself. Are you fascinated by money and technology? Do you want to push the boundaries of money itself and participate in one of the biggest economic experiments of the past century?At some point you’ll hear people say “Bitcoin is great, but you’ll never use it to buy your coffee every morning”. It’s a sign they haven’t really sat down to think about what money is, or how different people around the world use it. In fact, people are already using Bitcoin to buy their morning coffee andAre youIf you’re a merchant – either online or brick-and-mortar – accepting Bitcoin is faster and cheaper than credit cards, and all payments are final. Fees are lower and there’s no risk of fraudulent chargebacks.Perhaps you think the value of Bitcoin will increase in future and want to invest in it. Or maybe you’ve been reading about the existing fiat currency/central banking and international financial system, realize something’s not quite right with it and want to place control of your money back in your own hands. Bitcoin allows you to do this.What is Bitcoin Mining?Bitcoin mining is analogous to the mining of gold, but its digital form. The process involves specialized computers solving algorithmic equations or hash functions. These problems help miners to confirm blocks of transactions held within the network. Bitcoin mining provides a reward for miners by paying out in Bitcoin in turn the miners confirm transactions on the blockchain. Miners introduce new Bitcoin into the network and also secure the system with transaction confirmation. They are also rewarded network fees for when they harvest new coin and a time when the last bitcoin is found mining will continue.How Can You Buy Bitcoin?Bitcoins can be bought from various sources. You can purchase them online using an exchange or brokerage service that will enable you to buy Bitcoin with a bank transfer using fiat currency, a credit card, and some services also offer buying opportunities using Paypal. Bitcoin Cash can be purchased locally usingBitcoin.com | Buy BTC & BCH | News, prices, mining & walletCan You Sell Bitcoin?Bitcoins can be sold in various ways. The currency can be sold online to an exchange or live in person locally. These same instances work similarly to the buying process. You can sell your Bitcoin to the exchange at the current price it's being sold for. More anonymously you can sell in person or use a localized 2-way ATM. ATMs can be found all over the world and these machines are mostly used for purchasing. 2-way ATMs can allow you to sell the currency. Most ATMs however only allow you to buy Bitcoin. There are also teller machines that require identification as well. Click here to to to see a list of verified exchanges.Bitcoin payments are easy to make with a wallet application and addresses. You can use a standard desktop or smartphone to transact with an individual, merchant and exchange. Addresses can be used in number form, in a QR code and contactless technology. Transacting with Bitcoin offers lower fees than any known remittance provider and credit card service. No bank, no state, no third party can offer this low amount of fees.Can stores accept Bitcoin?Brick and mortar outlets can also accept Bitcoin. Services like Coinbase and BitPay offer applications and hardware for the convenience of the store owner. Most of these businesses offer invoicing and accounting with their services. However, third party services are not required by physical merchants to accept the currency. Individual users can also accept Bitcoin directly and handle the transactions and accounting themselves.Why Trust Bitcoin?Bitcoin is a network operating by the three foundational principles of technological freedom: Decentralization, open source code, and true peer-to-peer technology. Bitcoin’s trust is based on the subjective valuations of human faith in mathematical algorithms, encryption and numbers. With the three pillars of technological principles Bitcoin’s blockchain is a peer-reviewed system of integrity.Is Bitcoin anonymous?Participants in Bitcoin transactions are identified by public addresses – those are the long strings of around 30 characters you see in a person’s Bitcoin address, usually starting with the numerals ‘1’ or ‘3’. For every transaction, the sending and receiving addresses are publicly-viewable.Since these numbers are virtually incomprehensible, difficult to remember without a computer and don’t contain a person’s name or identifying information, it is often claimed that Bitcoin is an “anonymous currency”. This is also often used as an argument to attack Bitcoin as a currency for example like with illegal transactions.But it’s not as simple as that. If you publish your address anywhere, it can be linked to your real-life identity. Even if you don’t publish it, simply re-using the same address many times can show a pattern that an analyst with basic skills could link to your identity by looking at transaction times, amounts and regularity – and connecting it to other data sources like receipts, exchanges, and shipped items.It’s recommended for privacy and security that you use a new address for every single transaction, and most modern wallet software is designed to do just that. But even though this increases the amount of effort and skill required to uncover your identity, it doesn’t make you 100% anonymous. Freely available blockchain explorers and analytical tools have been used to link addresses with only single transactions to other addresses, forming a chain or pattern that eventually reveals its owner. These have been useful in investigating cases of theft at companies like Mt. Gox and Bitcoinica, but can potentially be used to identify anyone.Due to all of this, it’s more accurate to say Bitcoin is “pseudonymous” and not anonymous. Think of it as a less memorable email address or online handle. Even if it’s not your real name, someone out there can potentially find out who the real person behind the pseudonym is.There are ways to make Bitcoin more private, but they come with risks. One is to use a “mixer” or “tumbler” which effectively takes your bitcoins and moves them around between a confusing array of addresses until it’s virtually impossible to trace. But do you trust the mixing service to spit your money out the other end, especially since most of them are run by anonymous entities themselves? Usually they do, sometimes they don’t.Another way is to trade Bitcoin for a digital currency designed to have“Blockchain forensics” is a growing industry with increasing levels of expertise and tool technology. The Bitcoin blockchain is public and permanent record. Your current OPSEC (Operational Security) may beat all methods of investigation available now, but will it stand up to scrutiny in 30 years’ time? How likely is anyone to look? If private transactions are something you care strongly about your operational security should stay as ahead of the curve as possible.What Can Bitcoin Do?The Bitcoin protocol can change the financial landscape we see today. The protocol can act as a currency, voting mechanism, global identification and reputation application, a micro-tipper, crowdfunding platform, initiate trusts, wills and contracts, decentralized domain names, future markets, and basically everything the financial system of today can handle plus so much more. The currency application is just the beginning of this evolution of world's finances.Also,the investment of bitcoin can be grown if one invest it in a good platform like cryptomax(www.cryptomax.tech)This platform doubles bitcoin after 7 days,It has really helped so many people that are into bitcoin.This is also part of what bitcoin can be used for.","99,918 followers",Alcatraz Dey,9K,1.4K,68.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-cryptocurrency-have-a-bad-impact-on-the-climate-Arent-the-coins-purely-digital

If all money is digital and controlled by the government then nefarious regimes could just block critical journalists and political activists from using the financial system and make them lose all access to their money. Bitcoin is the last line of defense in such a scenario. China will probably be the first to abolish cash money.This is not just a risk for Chinese people. Wikileaks is an example of bitcoin’s role as the freedom of speech currency in the west. Wikileaks would no longer exist without bitcoin. They were cut of from financial services like paypal, mastercard, etc and all they could accept was bitcoin. This made wikileaks very very rich because they started accepting bitcoin in 2010;)In short: bitcoin is about freedom. People are free to pay for their coffee with bitcoin but it is not what gives bitcoin value. Freedom gives it value.People can use it for whatever they want as long as they are willing to pay the miner fee. An example of a use case many people don’t know about is ‘proof of immutability’.

In spite of their reputation for creating price hikes, the lead up to the halving has witnessed a 25 percent decline in valuation over the last month.What is halving?Halving is a process that occurs when the mining reward for a cryptocurrency is reduced by 50%. Miners receive crypto rewards for solving problems that create each new block on a given blockchain. The rewards differ for each cryptocurrency. With Litecoin, miners are currently awarded 25 coins per block. After Aug 5, miners will only receive 12.5 Litecoins per block.A lot of people do not know there are so many ways to earn cryptocurrencies by investing legitimately in platforms like www.coastminers.tech where they can get double of their investment in 7 days without losing them(thank me later).Litecoin rewards halve every 840,000 blocks, a process that occurs every four years. The block speed for Litecoin is roughly 2.5 minutes, with around 576 blocks generated per day. One of the key factors to take into account is that, according to the coding behind cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Litecoin, only a certain amount will ever be mined. This distinct characteristic sets it apart from fiat currencies, which can theoretically be printed infinitely.Although it’s difficult to say when the final Litecoins will be mined, the Litecoin Foundation estimates that it will be around 2142, when the maximum of 84 million Litecoins will be reached. As of press time, there are 62,983,450 Litecoins in circulation, representing 74.93% of all Litecoins that will ever be mined. This leaves roughly 21 million coins left to be mined up until 2142. Comparatively, it’s estimated that the final few Bitcoins (BTC) will be mined around 2140.Halvings are closely followed by investors, as the consequent reduction in mining rewards affects the profitability. Accordingly, this has a knock-on effect on the price. For investors, this can be a mixed bag. According to the theory of supply and demand, halvings should drive up the price of the cryptocurrency. As they receive fewer coins per block solved, miners stop producing them until the work once again becomes profitable. As fewer coins enter circulation, the price consequently goes up, as demand — in theory — will overtake the supply. Although this sounds like a sure-fire win for investors, halvings can bring about even greater instability to an already volatile market.Previous halvings have stoked investor interest, and the upcoming Litecoin event is no exception. According to Google Trends, searches for “Litecoin halving” peaked between June 9 and June 15, although data shows that this trend is once again increasing.Searches for “Bitcoin halving” on Google are typically more numerous than entries for Litecoin, although this trend has reversed as of July 30.What could happen?In the time leading up to the halving, miners ramp up operations to maximize their returns until the whole process becomes unprofitable. Miners need to invest in powerful, specialized equipment to take on the computing challenges required for creating blocks. As the difficulty of mining blocks rises, so do electricity costs. Mining is no longer a game for individual hobbyists, with even the biggest mining farms struggling to remain profitable during the so-called crypto winter of 2018. Mining is now a big business, and businesses need to make a profit. So, when profitability falls, activities tend to cease.The fact that miners will feel the heat after the halving is no secret, with Litecoin creator Charlie Lee predicting that many will shut up shop after Aug 5. Lee told Australian crypto news site Mickey that halving the block rewards by 50% always has an impact on the Litecoin mining ecosystem:“When the mining rewards get cut in half, some miners will not be profitable and they will shut off their machine. If a big percentage does that, then blocks will slow down for some time. For litecoin it’s three and a half days before the next change, so possibly like seven days of slower blocks, and then after that, the difficulty will readjust and everything will be fine.”Despite the commonly accepted theory that a decrease in supply results in a corresponding increase in demand, Lee suggested that market sentiment also plays a role in ramping up the price:“In terms of the price, the halvening should be priced in because everyone knows about it since the beginning. But the thing is people kind of expect the price to go up. So a lot of people are buying in because they expect the price to go up and that’s kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy. So, because they’re buying in, the price does actually go up.”After Litecoin’s 2015 halving, the coin peaked in July of that year before losing nearly 50% of its value by the time of the reward reduction, culminating in a decrease of 75% in the aftermath, Mickey reports. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarketsFX, told Cointelegraph via email that reducing block rewards for miners is an effective filtering process and agreed that the effect on the price is usually positive:“Reducing the incentive for miners is good for LTC because only serious people will remain in the space. As for the price action, it is difficult and it depends a lot on the sentiment but usually this kind of action is positive for the price.”If the price bombs following the halving, the network hash rate will tail off as mining begins to shut down, leaving only the largest mining farms operational. Once the hash rate drops below a certain point, the mining difficulty will adjust itself and smaller miners may be able to begin mining once again.Supply and demand: Experts weigh inAlthough halving events are widely considered to result in a price hike for the given cryptocurrency, market experts do not foresee any dramatic changes in valuation. Mati Greenspan, a senior market analyst at eToro, told Cointelegraph that halving events are usually priced in before they actually happen:“It seems to be the case here as well. Litecoin has outperformed the rest of the market during this year's rally and some say that it was a root cause of the upward momentum in the first half of this year. It's difficult to say how or even if the price will react to the event in the short term. In the long term, reduced supply supports higher prices all else being equal.”Renowned crypto trader and technical analyst Crypto Rand also agreed in email conversations with Cointelegraph that the halving event has already been priced in:“I don't think the halving event will have much impact on Litecoin price, it's already priced in since one month I would say. LTC is looking pretty solid here. It just broke up the local downtrend channel after bouncing on the key $88 range support. If the downtrend of volume finally comes to an end I'm expecting a rise on the price back to $105-$110. Right now looks like a solid option among the rest of big caps.”For Aslam, those trying to jump on the halving gravy train are already too late:“The most important factor to remember is that these kind of planned events are already fully priced in and traders have already positioned themselves for this. Running up to the event, it is not usually wise to participate in that move because you are already too late for the party. Therefore, smart money always buy the rumour and sell the news.”Greenspan predicts that there won’t be many surprises in mining activity, due in part to Litecoin’s scrypt algorithm:“Litecoin's scrypt algorithm is pretty unique so the hardware used to mine it is not easily adaptable to mining other tokens. Therefore it doesn't have quite the same of competition over hashrate that some of the other cons have. My feeling is that LTC miners have had ample time to prepare for the halving so we shouldn't see any major changes.”When asked about what investors holding LTC should be doing, Greenspan had advice:“Holding. But more importantly spending. Litecoin's value proposition specifically involves being a more durable token for making payments. The more people use it for this purpose, the stronger the network gets.”Some members of the crypto community are commenting that the Litecoin halving can be viewed as a test run for the upcoming midyear 2020 BTC halving and that we can consequently expect similar results. For Greenspan, the comparison is sound, although he warned that results will not be identical:“The market has matured a lot since the last Bitcoin and Litecoin halvings. Though we couldn't possibly expect a mirror reaction, the LTC halving should give us some indication of what to expect when BTC does the same next year.”Crypto Rand is not so sure, however, stating that investor understanding and even awareness of Litecoin juxtaposed to Bitcoin is incomparable:“I don't think LTC halving can work as test for Bitcoin, I would say 95% of the traders/investors are not aware of the halving on LTC or they don't know what means. The coverage for BTC it's and will be a fully mainstream event, everyone will be aware of it.”Strix Leviathan says halving profits are a mythA blog post published on July 21 by institutional-grade algorithmic investment management platform Strix Leviathan reported that cryptocurrencies do not outperform the market in the months leading up to and following block reward reductions.The report found that the supply and demand theory, while “certainly feasible as a logical theory,” does not result in a rapid increase in price. Per the report, Strix Leviathan analysts found that LTC outperformed the market twice prior to a reduction in block rewards, yet fell to the bottom 25% of the market in the ensuing six-month period. The report also postulates that the performance of a crypto asset both in and out of halving periods are more or less the same:“What we find is that the return distribution of an asset’s halving periods versus the return distribution outside of its halving periods reveals that they are statistically the same at a 99% confidence level. In other words, we did not find evidence that a halving event results in abnormal pricing action and we are dealing with a circumstantial illusion. It appears more likely that the return behavior before, during, and after a halving coincides more with increasing levels of speculation than with an underlying shift in sell side pressure.”Merged mining could mitigate block reward reductionsA report published by binance Research, an arm of major crypto exchange Binance, found that the impact of halvings for both BTC and LTC miners could be mitigated by merged mining. Binance researchers analyzed Charlie Lee’s prediction that many miners would have to halt operations and looked into how merged mining could help keep miners on-board even after rewards have been reduced.Merged mining uses the work done on a parent blockchain and spreads it across other smaller “child blockchains” by using auxiliary proof-of-work (AuxPoW). The three most prominent examples of merged mining are the Litecoin-merged Namecoin (NMC), Bitcoin-merged Dogecoin (DOGE) and Myriadcoin (XMY), a cryptocurrency merged with both BTC and LTC.The report theorized that merged mining could help mitigate the impact of reward reductions by future block rewards scheduled for both Litecoin and Bitcoin. Binance researchers also reported that smaller chains could incorporate AuxPoW in future to support greater network security and reduce the need for an independent mining operation. The report did, however, find some potential shortcomings. Researchers said that miners may not turn to merged mining due to the risk of operational costs when supporting child blockchains and potential declines in the market price.The report cites Dogecoin as the most successful examples of merged mining, which adopted the model in August 2014. After the switch, the coin’s mining hash rate skyrocketed 1,500%. The report also found that, as of July 2019, 90% of Dogecoin’s total hash rate is sourced from Litecoin mining pools",27 followers,Fernando Reyes,653,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-cryptocurrency-have-a-bad-impact-on-the-climate-Arent-the-coins-purely-digital
