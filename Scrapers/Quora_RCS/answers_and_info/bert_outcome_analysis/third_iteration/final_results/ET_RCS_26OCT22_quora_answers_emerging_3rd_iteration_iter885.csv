2,"In my opinion, several emerging technologies are going to change the way we live in major ways:* quantum computing; we have noticed how wonderful it is to have ever more powerful computers, and the things they let us do. Quantum computing should take that to a whole new level. I look forward to my computer doing work for me that seems almost psychic, and at speeds that equate magic. I want more tIn my opinion, several emerging technologies are going to change the way we live in major ways:* quantum computing; we have noticed how wonderful it is to have ever more powerful computers, and the things they let us do. Quantum computing should take that to a whole new level. I look forward to my computer doing work for me that seems almost psychic, and at speeds that equate magic. I want more than my computer powering up more quickly and spending less time rendering things or finding things. I want my computer to be switched on before I know I need it, I want my computer to come to conclusions I may not comprehend right away within the time it takes to switch on a bedside table lamp, and I want my computer to understand who I am and what I want more than I do. Quantum computing may give us all that.","58,988 followers",Michael Wolfe,504,2K,17.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-technology-improvement-that-is-not-publicized-yet-but-coming-soon

4,"The next decade? It won’t take ten years for that to happen. Barack Obama would very much like to be the head of the United Nations and it will happen in the next few years. Once he becomes head of that worldwide organization he will conquer the United States by confiscating our guns and will not only control us but the world as well. And when he accomplishes that there is no one who will stop him from doing as he pleases. Our Constitution will be a thing of the past and all laws will go through King Barack.

5,"Contrary to most westerners, I know the Chinese are not interested in being a world leader.They are only interested in providing themselves with a peaceful, safe environment, a good standard of living and prosperity through trading. Peaceful co-existence is what they want from the US and the world.Thinking that China wanted to take over the world is a response by the Americans politicians mainly triggered by the fear of losing world leadership.These politicians tried to contain China through trade wars, sanctions, refusal to sell equipment, banning them from the International Space Station andContrary to most westerners, I know the Chinese are not interested in being a world leader.They are only interested in providing themselves with a peaceful, safe environment, a good standard of living and prosperity through trading.
