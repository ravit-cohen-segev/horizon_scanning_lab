Wells is one of my favorite sci-fi writers. A galloping socialist he may have been, but the man was remarkably prescient. Some of the technologies he prophesied in his novels and which later came to pass include:LASERS/DIRECTED-ENERGY WEAPONS.…in some way they are able to generate an intense heat in a chamber of practically absolute non-conductivity. This intense heat they project in a parallel beam against any object they choose, by means of a polished parabolic mirror of unknown composition, much as the parabolic mirror of a lighthouse projects a beam of light... it is certain that a beam of heat is the essence of the matter. Heat, and invisible, instead of visible, light. Whatever is combustible flashes into flame at its touch, lead runs like water, it softens iron, cracks and melts glass, and when it falls upon water, incontinently that explodes into steam.Not really a laser as we know it today, of course. And directed-energy weapons, while they do exist, aren’t exactly commonplace. But Wells’s descriptions of an invisible ray of light causing objects to heat up instantaneously doesn’t sound like a flight of fancy to the 21st-century ear.AERIAL WARFARE.TANKS.In that flickering pallor it had the effect of a large and clumsy black insect, an insect the size of an ironclad cruiser, crawling obliquely to the first line of trenches and firing shots out of portholes in its side.ATOMIC BOMBS.Few who adventured into these areas of destruction and survived attempted any repetition of their experiences. There are stories of puffs of luminous, radio-active vapour drifting sometimes scores of miles from the bomb centre and killing and scorching all they overtook.On a more optimistic note...VOICEMAIL/EMAIL.A message is sent to the station of the district in which the recipient is known to be, and there it waits until he chooses to tap his accumulated messages. And any that one wishes to repeat can be repeated. Then he talks back to the senders and dispatches any other messages he wishes.Something similar also shows up in Wells’s 1933 novelWIKIPEDIA.A great number of workers would be engaged perpetually in perfecting this index of human knowledge and keeping it up to date...…[it] will be made accessible to every individual...It need not be concentrated in any one single place...It can be reproduced exactly and fully, in Peru, China, Iceland, Central Africa.Wells, you magnificent beast, you predicted a crowdsourced, multilingual, web-based, free encyclopedia!(I know Wikipedia isn’t exactly “technology,” but you could easily imagine that Wells’s predictions about the Permanent World Encyclopaedia could be applied to the Internet as a whole. Minus the cat pictures and the porn, of course.)Okay, that’s all I can think of for the nonce. But jeez…ain’t that an impressive list?

They have a number of advantages over airplanes with internal combustion engines like piston, turbofan or turbojet engines. They are quieter, so they can operate closer to urban centers. They have lower maintenance requirements, so they are cheaper to operate. And of course, they don’t emit greenhouse gases or other pollution (though of course, if the electricity that powers them comes from dirty sources like coal or even natural gas, that advantage is reduced, though not eliminated.) So electric aircraft are being developed  [ https://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/aviation/cheaper-lighter-quieter-the-electrification-of-flight-is-at-hand ]specifically for short-hop flights close to urban centers. Within a few decades [ https://www.theatlantic.com/sponsored/thomson-reuters-why-2025-matters/electric-flight/208/ ], they should be common.<EDIT> Some people don’t seem to realize how soon electric aircraft will be flying.

Here’s a picture of the first, a retro-fitted de Havilland Beaver seaplane.(photo credit: Jonathan Hayward/AP)Greg McDougall, founder and chief executive of Alaska charter outfit Harbour Air, said [ https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/11/worlds-first-fully-electric-commercial-aircraft-takes-flight-in-canada ] “Our goal is to actually electrify the entire fleet.” On top of fuel efficiency, the company would save millions in maintenance costs because electric motors require “drastically” less upkeep, and improved performance is a bonus. “For me that flight was just like flying a Beaver, but it was a Beaver on electric steroids. I actually had to back off on the power,” he said.” </EDIT>But none of that has to do with aerodynamic performance. The improved aerodynamic performance comes from the characteristics of electric motors themselves. They have the unique characteristic that an electric motor of half the size will have half the power (or more), where a jet engine of half the size will have far less than half the power. In other words, power scales with weight.That means that instead of using a two large electric motors, you can use eight or ten small motors that weigh the same in total, and provide the same power. The concept is called distributed propulsion [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_propulsion ]. It allows you to build aircraft that look like this:This a rendering of NASA’s X-57 Maxwell  [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_X-57_Maxwell ]prototype, currently under development. Test flights began last year.So first, you will notice the large number of small motors and propellers (the distributed propulsion concept.) That has a number of advantages:* Increased redundancy, and therefore increased safety. The plane can lose many of its engines and still maneuver and land safely.And NASA’s design is relatively conservative, being based on a conventional Tecnam P2006T. [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tecnam_P2006T ] They are testing just the distributed propulsion model, and leaving all other aspects of the airplane the same. Actual commercial electric airplanes would look nothing like it.One such design is more radical: Onera’s Ampere aircraft.Notice that like the Maxwell, it uses many small engines instead of a few large ones. And like the Maxwell, the propellers blow the air across the top of the wing, for increased lift. But in the Ampere, the propellers are encased in housings or ducts. Ducted propellers or fans  [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducted_fan ]can have greatly increased performance over open rotors, but the weight and cost of the ducts usually make them unfeasible. But the Onera people feel that new advanced materials like carbon composites, as well as the reduced size of the fans that electric motors allow, will make this design feasible.Aurora Flight Sciences has an even wilder design called LightingStrike [ http://www.aurora.aero/lightningstrike/ ], partially funded by DARPA.This design blends wing with fan ducts. Both the main wing and the canard (the smaller wing up front) tilt, allowing the craft to take off and land vertically (VTOL), like...",0 followers,Hatice Aslan,570,164,11.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-examples-of-technology-that-emerged-after-it-was-conceptualised-in-a-science-fiction-book
