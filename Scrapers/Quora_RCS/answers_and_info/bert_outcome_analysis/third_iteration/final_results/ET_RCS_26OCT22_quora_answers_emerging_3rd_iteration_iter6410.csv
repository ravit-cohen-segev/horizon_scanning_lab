There was nothing wrong with that, it worked a hundred and one times. The real problem of the reform was:Within a hundred years the most powerful men in Rome were the leaders of her legions. How could they not, they had the armed, trained men who were in it for the money and the commanders were the ones who paid them in the first place. Ultimately this caused or at least greatly accelerated the downfall of the Roman Republic.The Senatorial class (significant landowners who also sat in the Senate to legislate) was the main cause of the problem in the first place. Roman approach to warfare followed that of the Greeks - citizen-soldiers, small landholders who provided their own gear from their farm mobilized to serve Rome. That only worked so long as you had enough small landholders to fight in your armies. After the Second Punic Wars significant consolidation of farms in the hands of a few rich Senators meant that class grew thinner until it was no longer possible to field sufficient armies to defend the country. The Senators had enough wealth and income to pay for the necessary troops for the Republic and then some, but since they controlled the laws they opted to pay less tax instead and have someone else deal with the problem.So how do I make the Marian legions better? I refuse to purse any change, until the Senate comes to their senses and agrees the rich Senators should pay sufficient taxes to cover from the new standing armies, with costs being paid for by the state.

There are manuscripts demonstrating that in those universities they knew that the planets revolved around the sun long before Galileo and were teaching complex mathematics, for example.The Arab muslim fundamentalist conquest of Africa led to the burning of African libraries across the continent starting in fits and starts from around the 7th -8th centuries CE, which they did after they translated many African manuscripts into Arabic and transported the knowledge to Mecca and sold and enslaved the people. This capture and destruction of African knowledge and the destruction of African knowledge systems was followed by the European colonial conquest of Africa led initially by the Catholic Church and her agents in Portugal and later by the Western European royals and the Church of England both of which sanctioned the burning and plundering of African manuscripts as the works of the devil.There was of course also the Trans-Atlantic slave trade which focused on the capture of skilled and educated labor to build the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean countries. Most of the enslaved had skills and knowledge. They were both craftsmen and learned men. One of the reasons that writing was forbidden in slavery was because so many enslaved Africans wrote Arabic, Kushitic (e.g. Hausa), Nsibidi and other alphabets used in Africa. For security and also philosophical reasons (How could one maintain the idea that African were non-human chattel, if it became known that they were literate and writing in their own languages?).Africa has still not recovered from these conquests and the destruction of her knowledge systems and the plundering and enslavement of her knowledgeable. All of that was followed by the post-colonial brain drain, through which most of her educated class leave the continent to work in the West as engineers, scholars, doctors, never to return.

In fact it is the first monumental stone building designed and constructed that we know of.WritingAlong with the Mesopotamians, the Egyptians were the first people to develop their language into a codified form of writing. All early forms of writing were pictograms – pictures. All writing systems developed in this way but their original forms become lost as the pictures are refined into abstract forms. What is interesting about the Egyptians is that although their writing changed to the abstract form of Hieratic they deliberately preserved the hieroglyphic pictures in their original forms.Papyrus SheetsPapyrus sheets are the earliest paper-like material – all other civilisations used stone, clay tablets, animal hide, wood materials or wax as a writing surface. Papyrus was, for over 3000 years, the most important writing material in the ancient world. It was exported all around the Mediterranean and was widely used in the Roman Empire as well as the Byzantine Empire. Its use continued in Europe until the seventh century AD, when an embargo on exporting it forced the Europeans to use parchment.Black InkThe Egyptians mixed vegetable gum, soot and bee wax to make black ink. They replaced soot with other materials such as ochre to make various colours.The Ox-drawn PloughUsing the power of oxen to pull the plough revolutionised agriculture and modified versions of this Egyptian invention are still used by farmers in developing countries around the world.The SickleThe sickle is a curved blade used for cutting and harvesting grain, such as wheat and barley.IrrigationThe Egyptians constructed canals and irrigation ditches to harness Nile river’s yearly flood and bring water to distant fields.ShadoofThe Shadoof is a long balancing pole with a weight on one end and a bucket on the other. The bucket is filled with water and easily raised then emptied onto higher ground.The CalendarThe Egyptians devised the solar calendar by recording the yearly reappearance of Sirius (the Dog Star) in the eastern sky. It was a fixed point which coincided with the yearly flooding of the Nile. Their calendar had 365 days and 12 months with 30 days in each month and an additional five festival days at the end of the year. However, they did not account for the additional fraction of a day and their calendar gradually became incorrect. Eventually Ptolemy III added one day to the 365 days every four years.ClocksIn order to tell the time Egyptians invented two types of clock.The PoliceDuring the Old and Middle Kingdoms order was kept by local officials with their own private police forces. During the New Kingdom a more centralized police force developed, made up primarily of Egypt’s Nubian allies, the Medjay. They were armed with staffs and used dogs. Neither rich nor poor citizens were above the law and punishments ranged from confiscation of property, beating and mutilation (including the cutting off of ears and noses) to death without a proper burial. The Egyptians believed that a proper burial was essential for entering the afterlife, so the threat of this last punishment was a real deterrent, and most crime was of a petty nature.“They went to the granary, stole three great loaves and eight sabu-cakes of Rohusu berries. They drew a bottle of beer which was cooling in water, while I was staying in my father’s room. My Lord, let whatsoever has been stolen be given back to me.” (Eighteenth Dynasty)Surgical InstrumentsThe Edwin Smith Papyrus shows the Egyptians invented medical surgery. It describes 48 surgical cases of injures of the head, neck, shoulders, breast and chest. It includes a list of instruments used during surgeries with instructions for the suturing of wounds using a needle and thread. This list includes lint, swabs, bandage, adhesive plaster, surgical stitches and cauterization. It is also the earliest document to make a study of the brain. The Cairo Museum has a collection of surgical instruments which include scalpels, scissors, copper needles, forceps, spoons, lancets, hooks, probes and pincers.WigsDuring the hot summers many Egyptians shaved their heads to keep them clean and prevent pests such as lice. Although priests remained bald as part of their purification rituals, those that could afford it had wigs made in various styles and set with perfumed beeswax.Cosmetic MakeupThe Egyptian invented eye makeup as far back as 4000 B.C. They combined soot with a lead mineral called galena to create a black ointment known as kohl. They also made green eye makeup by combining malachite with galena to tint the ointment.ToothpasteAt the 2003 dental conference in Vienna, dentists sampled a replication of ancient Egyptian toothpaste. Its ingredients included powdered of ox hooves, ashes, burnt eggshells and pumice. Another toothpaste recipe and a how-to-brush guide was written on a papyrus from the fourth century AD describes how to mix precise amounts of rock salt, mint, dried iris flower and grains of pepper, to form a “powder for white and perfect teeth.”MummificationThe Egyptians were so expert at preserving the bodies of the dead that after thousands of years we know of the diseases they suffered such as arthritis, tuberculosis of the bone, gout, tooth decay, bladder stones, and gallstones; there is evidence, too, of the disease bilharziasis (schistosomiasis), caused by small, parasitic flatworms, which still exists in Egypt today.Now apart from many prehistoric inventions by Africans which almost every body still uses, here are some modern Groundbreaking African Inventions in Technology ( by african people [ http://answersafrica.com/pictures-of-african-people.html ], answersafrica.com [ http://answersafrica.com/ ]).1. A jacket that detects pneumoniaProblem : Pneumonia kills 27,000 Ugandan children under the age of five every year. Most of these cases are due to pneumonia being misdiagnosed as malaria.Solution : Ugandan engineer Brian Turyabagye has designed a biomedical ""smart jacket"" to quickly and accurately diagnose pneumonia. The Mamaope jacket measures a sick child's temperature and breathing rate. It can diagnose pneumonia three to four times faster than a doctor and eliminates most possibility for human error2. Majik water systemThe Majik water system harvests water from the air and converts it into drinking water using solar technology. Beth Koigi, a 27-year-old project planner from Kenya is the brain behind the Majik water system that uses desiccants such as silica gels to draw water from the air. [ https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jan/01/africa-inspired-inventors-royal-academy-of-engineering-prize?CMP=share_btn_fb&page=with%3Aimg-10 ] The gels are then heated up with solar power to release the water.Picture of Beth Koigi, the inventor of Majik Water:The affordable and clean water is subsequently sold to communities through unmanned ATMs. The device is expected to provide a solution for areas predicted to have a shortage of water by 2025.3.

But if you go to Hungary - or some of the previous Soviet bloc countries - and you’ll see how bad governance had beggared them. They struggled the same way that Africa is struggling today. Membership in the EU has forced them to fix some of their governance issues - but not all.

Entering the international market is costly and risky, so these companies also have little incentive to expand beyond simply meeting domestic demand.South Korea also protected its domestic market, but many of the tariffs on foreign products were temporary. This meant that Korean companies had a protected market to give them a starting point, but they had to be prepared for foreign competition in the future.The other advantage South Korea had was that it has virtually no valuable natural resources. While this seems counter-intuitive, the lack of easily extractable resources forced them to focus on value-added, high-end products. Often, when a country has access to massive resource wealth, they concentrate their capital on the extraction of resources because it's easier and less risky than starting a new industry from scratch. This can have disastrous consequences should they deplete the resource or the price drops as they have virtually no other source of revenue.Value-added products are riskier at start-up, but typically have more stable demand and prices than natural resources, which in turn makes the whole economy more stable, allowing for more sustainable growth. The riskier aspect of starting such industries also encourages diversification. Should one industry fail, other industries are there to keep the economy going. This is partially reflected in the fact that Korean companies tend to be conglomerates.","4,585 followers",Lorian Flint,37.6K,999,12.5M,2013,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-just-a-coincidence-that-technology-has-evolved-to-what-it-is-today

Outside of Korean War, he is responsible for murder of hundreds of thousands of his countrymen (concentration camps, massacres and just plain repressions). Corruption, which remains a problem for South Korea even now, was especially prominent in his rule, and so was racket. On top of that, Synghman Rhee had the audacity to build a cult of personality around himself. This old guy was extremely religious, and combined with shamelessness, this resulted in messianic complex.You can imagine if it’s possible for a country to develop under a ruler like this. And while Synghman Rhee and his clique were only pillaging the already dog-poor country, their enemies in North, with help of USSR and China, were building towns and roads, bringing fruits of civilization to common Koreans and, generally, making DPRK a better place.Then, South Koreans decided they had enough, and started an uprising that Rhee was unable to suppress. He fled to Hawaii, and since then Republic of Korea was governed by figures so insignificant that few actually remember their names. They didn’t last long anyway. A year or so later, when it became apparent that they can’t fix the broken state, a military coup happened, giving rise to Park Chung-hee - the first South Korean leader who actually did something to improve his country.But that’s another story…","23,886 followers",Robin Daverman,574,2.3K,40.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-just-a-coincidence-that-technology-has-evolved-to-what-it-is-today

It was the Protestant missionaries that brought educational institutions to Korea, which were some of the first to teach in Korean (as opposed to Chinese). As a result, Christianity was spread further, especially in the north (yes, I know this is ironic). In 1910, Korea became a colony of Japan. This led to missionary movements being suppressed. However, as a result of suppression, missionary groups began operating independently of their counterparts in the United States and Europe. Because of this, churches in Korea became more distinctly Korean rather than simply universalistic.Missionary school in KoreaUnder Japanese rule, theBy the 1930’s, Christianity was suppressed further, and State Shinto was mandated. Many Koreans saw this as a sign that Christanity was inherently linked to the independence movement, further boosting its popularity. This continued after Korea finally gained independence in 1945 (from Japan) and 1948 (from temporary Allied administration), especially considering the fact that South Korea’s first president, Syngman Rhee, was Methodist.As a result of the Korean War, millions of Koreans, mostly from the north (which ultimately came to be ruled by a communist government), fled to the United States. Since Christianity was more popular in the north than in the south, this explains why Korean-Americans are more likely to be Christian than South Koreans.",UNKNOWN,Sandeep,667,112,710K,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-just-a-coincidence-that-technology-has-evolved-to-what-it-is-today
