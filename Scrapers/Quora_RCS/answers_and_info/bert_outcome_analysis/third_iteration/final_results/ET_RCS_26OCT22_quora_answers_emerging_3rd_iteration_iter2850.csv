Britain was extremely good at inventing radically innovative technologies while the US was very good at making them suitable — practical enough — for use in warfare — able to manufactured, mass produced, at reasonable cost, rugged enough to field, reliable, repairable. It made for a very good team.For example, the British got started on the bomband in broad theory already knew how to make one; but precise engineering values were needed for critical mass, atomic cross-sections, how high the purity had to be to make the bomb go boom instead of fizzling. In addition, there were tremendous practical difficulties involved in supplying materials, U-235, fissile Pu, ultra high purity graphite and calculating the precise amounts needed for each type of bomb. These were the kinds of issues that the US excelled at providing.The Revolutionary Cavity Magnetron (centimeter) RADARalso springs to mind, but in fairness it must be mentioned that the prototypes of this magnificent invention, brought to the US by the Tizard Team were already quite advanced. However, once the Rad Lab at MIT got hold of one, they went nuts, developing thousands of variants throughout the war. Moreover, some of their improvements were actual improvements.Also sometimes the Brits had excellent technology but simply couldn’t make enough of them — RR Merlin Engines—- so US industry merely copied and made more to fil the need using our vast industrial production capacity.However, even though the Brits had invented the tank,They never really made a suitable tank in WWIIbut the US came along and delivered one that was almost good enoughThen came along with another, based on the same chassis, that was good enough and best of all was reliable, repairable and provided good protection for its crews:Even though the M4 was clearly superior to the M3 in every way, it proved difficult to shut down production of the make-do M3 to replace it with the M4, because the M3’s were so badly needed at the time.All in all, I would say that the British-American Technology team was a pretty good team.",150 followers,David Jones,3.2K,270,841.2K,2022,https://www.quora.com/Which-country-had-more-advanced-technology-during-World-War-II-Japan-or-Germany

Then I was just an old mother without a child. The communists came and said that this time, everything would be better. I believed them.

I mean this was the nation of the Bushido Warrior Spirit. You’d expect them to fight until the end when in reality Germany was the Axis power that actually had be dragged across the finish line.There are 2 argumentsI myself have previously fallen prey to this debate and touted that the Soviet invasion of Manchuria was the main factor. I was wrong.In Japan, at this time there are 2 groups (generally)1: The Government and the PeopleThe People of Japan had been generally pro-war but after years of loss, people were growing tired of the whole thing. I mean cities were being carpet bombed into rubble. It wasn’t pretty. The Japanese people were tired, starving, and dying by the thousands. Tokyo was being firebombed and Japan was in literal ruins.Then the nuclear bombs came. Now at first, these didn’t scare many people. Sure it was a big bomb but there had been lots of big bombs- why would a bigger bomb be that much of a big deal? Well then the devastation set in and the 2nd bomb was dropped and the people were honestly tried of the suffering.The Government meanwhile literally sh%t themselves. Japan had a nuclear program and understand how insanely difficult it was to produce a single nuclear bomb. They thought the first one was an experimental fluke but when a second nuke was dropped the Government was STUNNED. They realized at that moment the US had successfully cracked the code to making nuclear weapons and they knew how insane of an accomplishment this was.The military? They didn’t care. They were dying by the millions all over Asia and they expected the people on the home island to do their part and keep their resolve.2: The MilitaryNow at some point, I will write a long piece about how the Japanese military infiltrated and overtook the entire Japanese system prior to WW2. It’s a long and rather complex story, to be honest.The point is that Japan was ruled in large part by its military. The Army and Navy were rivals more than allies and each sought to establish more control over the government than their rival.Anyway as stated the nukes didn’t bother the Army or Navy. What bothered them was the actual battles they were fighting. The situation in 1945 was tough.So everything is falling apart on all fronts but hey, at least they aren’t fighting the Soviets!Japan had actually fought a minor battle against the Red Army early on in the war and lost badly. Since that time Japan had gone way out of its way to avoid provoking the USSR. I mean the measures they took were kinda bonkers overall.Well as all these fronts collapse and as the US starts eyeing Japan itself the unthinkable happens- the Soviets attack.Like demons in the night, the Red Army invades Manchuria and absolutely crushes the extensive Japanese Army in the area. About 900,000 Japanese troops were killed or captured, representing a HUGE chunk of the remaining Japanese military. Just like that, as much as 20% of the Japanese Military was GONE.Now suddenly the USSR could invade mainland Japan itself and suddenly it was clear that with Soviet help, every effort was doomed.So the Army- or at least the leadership within both parts of the military- decided the time was right to surrender.Getting Japan to surrender was not easy. Japan’s plan was to have the US invade Japan and make the invasion so costly that the US is forced to negotiate a peaceful settlement. The hope was that this settlement would have better terms than the total Japanese surrender.In order to get Japan to surrender without the home island being invaded both the civilian population, civilian government, and the military all had to agree surrender was for the best.If the government decided to surrender then the Japanese troops would ignore the order or perform some sort of coup. If the military alone decided to surrender the government would carry on with its “make America bleed” plan.Now there is plenty more to go into here- this is all a bit of a simplification. But I think it gets the broad points across well.Both points are right. The nukes AND the invasion each played a role in the Japanese decision to surrender. Nobody is wrong- everyone is right.","33,158 followers",Susanna Viljanen,706,10.7K,164.9M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Which-country-had-more-advanced-technology-during-World-War-II-Japan-or-Germany

We like you, but one of these days our two countries are going to go to war.” The American replied, “Yeah… I know.”Conflict between the U.S. and Japan was sort of inevitable. From the 1860s on, both countries had displayed an intermittent desire for territorial expansion into the Pacific. This desire grew stronger over time. When the U.S. fleet attacked the Spanish at Manila, for instance, it was shadowed by a Japanese flotilla. Turns out, the Japanese also had their eyes on the Philippines at the end of the 19th century. After the Japanese acquired many of the German islands in the Pacific as League of Nations mandates, after World War I, both countries began to wargame and plan a possible “Pacific War.” Predictions and descriptions of such a war were published in the U.S. in the mid-1920s.Although Japan and the U.S. normally had fairly cordial relations, both countries were expanding their political, cultural, and economic influence in many of the same places at the same time. The Pacific was one of the few parts of the world where the two powers were on a more or less equal footing, and where they didn’t have to play second fiddle to one of the major European colonial powers. The Pacific was vital for the defense and economic well being of both Japan and the U.S., and it was up for grabs. By the mid-1930s, with Japanese aircraft “accidentally” bombing U.S.-flagged gunboats in China (USS Panay, 1937), conflict seemed inevitable, and both countries began to build up their naval and other forces in anticipation of a future war.With the Japanese invasion of China, in the 1930s - a place where the U.S. had a lot of investments - tensions between Japan and the U.S. heightened dramatically. Before long, the two countries were engaged in a proxy war, with the U.S. aiding the Chinese nationalists, and at that point all-out war, with the Pacific as the prize, was only a matter of time.","4,686 followers",Youji Hajime,539,1.4K,8.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-country-had-more-advanced-technology-during-World-War-II-Japan-or-Germany
