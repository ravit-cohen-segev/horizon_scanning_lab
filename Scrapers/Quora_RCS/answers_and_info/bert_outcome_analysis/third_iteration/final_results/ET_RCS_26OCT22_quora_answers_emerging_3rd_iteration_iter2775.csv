That is the number they had for the first 180000 years after they emerged on the planet. But their numbers increased when they invented animal husbandry to go to grasslands. Their number exploded when they invented agriculture to go to floodplains to settle villages. Their numbers super-exploded when they built industrial cities.For more details, please read","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-ecological-niche-do-humans-without-any-advanced-technology-or-agriculture-inhabit

Modern humans are a bit more selective, but still are highly intolerant of man-eating animals.The techniques of mass-slaughter hunting evolved into ranching herds of domesticated animals, or what we call pastoralism. Gathering developed into agriculture in the same way, only domesticating plants rather than animals. It’s not entirely clear which came first because the first instance of each were probably during short interglacial periods before the worst bit of the last Ice Age, making finding evidence a bit difficult.Mass-slaughter hunting techniques seem like they would be especially useful during periods of heavy glaciation, when preserving meat over long periods of time was relatively simple.

It is a very professional place to work. And DAE pays almost 30% extra as opposed to any other central government job of the same scale. Most people only look at the pay-scale and not the allowances admissible to specific departments. Please read about PRIS scheme of DAE, ISRO, DRDO etc.Let me attach some pictures for you:It also has an in-campus institute, HBNI for MTech/MSc and PhD. I believe the eligibility is via GATE. Majorly, RRCAT is involved in non-nuclear research, e.g. lasers, particle accelerators etc. In case you get the chance, please visit it once.Thank You.P.S.

She turned to me and said, “Do you have washing machines in Scotland?” Obviously, I was forced to admit, that no we didn’t. Instead we just went down to the river and bashed our clothes off rocks to clean them.2) Transport - I spent two weeks in the lovely town of Columbia. Missouri. There I amazed the locals with my insistence on using a strange outmoded form of transport known as “walking”. Locals would slow down as they passed in their modern cars, pointing and laughing. To them, it must have been like watching a live action version of the Flintstones.3) Voting – would you believe it, but in the UK we still vote by drawing a little X next to the candidate we want to vote for. No sign of the advanced electronic voting they have over in the states. Indeed, we are so old fashioned that we haven’t even outsourced our voting to the Russians yet!4) Guns – It may be hard for an American to believe but almost nobody in the UK owns their own guns. This means that if we have to rise up and overthrow our own government (currently seems like a good plan) then we will be armed with nothing more than some particularly well sharpened sarcasm.Still, perhaps one day we can hope to be as advanced as the US.

Smaller cities have buses available that will take you just about everywhere within the city and bigger cities have subways as well as buses. For going between cities and provinces, China has a high speed rail system in place that is more extensive than the American highway system! For example: I lived in a city called Nanjing in China - about 200 miles/300 km from Shanghai. I could take a high speed train from Nanjing to Shanghai in about 1.5 hours!In contrast, I took an Amtrak train from Detroit to Chicago (about 300 miles/480 km) and it took over 8 hours!Another area China wins at is public utilities. They provide electricity, water, and gas for billions of people for very affordable prices! I paid maybe a total of $20 (US) per month for all utility bills, whereas it cost me over $100 in America! Atop of that is wireless technology (which is considered a public utility in China). I paid 100 rmb ($15) monthly for 16 GB of 4G data, with 1000 texts and 500 minutes of talk (which pretty much meant unlimited everything for me). In America I pay $50 a month for my unlimited plan. Yes, the 4G is a little faster, but that may just be because I’m not trying to access the foreign web here…A third area (kinda related to the second) is how the CCP controls markets and prices so everyone can live a comfortable life.
