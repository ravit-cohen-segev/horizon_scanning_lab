0,Often times I have your phone number before you say hello. If its a landline I will have your address in about 10 seconds. If its a mobile line the time varies but is maximum 30 seconds. We also have other methods at our disposal to find out the cell phone owner. We can request it from the carrier. That will take a few minutes. We can also use 3rd party technology to ping your phone.Its completely different if this is something to be used in a criminal case although 911 data is fair game for both prosecutors and defendants.,110 followers,Neill MacRae III,7.2K,51,1.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/With-advanced-technology-why-does-it-still-take-the-police-at-least-an-hour-to-trace-a-call

Because I felt the ramifications in doing so, namely psychiatric evaluation, would not benefit me to a significant degree, and might damage me financially, I told him I was not suicidal or in need of them or their intervention. ‘Could you leave now, - I’m o.k., thanks.’It did no good. Looking out my window, I saw S.W.A.T. members with scoped sniper rifles, behind the trees in my yard, aimed at the house. Luckily for me, I had NOT been drinking that day!I hung up on the S.W.A.T. captain and called my city police department. I explained that I saw someone with a rifle on my property pointing at my house, and could they send someone out now, and I’ll stay on the phone.As I remember, two squad cars quickly showed. They see S.W.A.T. all over, but I’m still on the phone, communicating in my normal, rational way, explaining it’s all a misunderstanding that S.W.A.T. is there, and could they help me placate them into leaving. A policeman, from the city, took sympathy to my plight, came to the door, and talked with me.Satisfied that I was ‘o.k.’, and not needing an intervention, he then approached the S.W.A.T. captain and told them their services would not be necessary.

And if it wasn't Africans killing each other, it was Islamic Empires who also expanded all the way west into Morocco and South into Ethiopia, enslaving a much higher number of people than Europeans ever did and committing their fair amount of genocide. If anything Africa's most peaceful time was when they were under European governments, where they taught them to write, read, and how to be an actual nation.Same with the Americas, constant wars between tribes, killings, millions of sacrifices to the gods by the Aztecs, etc.Indians were constantly raided by Muslims (what a surprise), they had conflicts with everyone around them, never could establish an actual organized civilization, until the British came and established order, just like in South Africa.Europeans, even though they killed and enslaved people (just like EVERY civilization in history did at that time, with the only difference European technology was superior), they brought in civilization, laws, civil rights. After some time they were the first people who abolished slavery, established official human rights, etc.If anything, during colonization times, a country was lucky if it was colonized by Europeans than any other alternative at that period of human history, like being conquered by an Islamic, Asian, or African nation.I'd just like to add that lately and after WW2, there has been a massive ""prosecution"" of what Europeans did during their Empires, while completely forgetting that every other civilization in the world was doing or trrying to do exactly the same thing. We are constantly reminded how Europeans commited genocide and enslaved other people, but no one ever talks about how north Africans enslaved Europeans in Iberia, how Islamic empires enslaved and commited massive genocides in India, Africa and the Balkans. We forget about the Asians who tries to establish dominance against the others by killing and enslaving them, forget about what Africa was before European colonization etc.While we ignore the technology Europe developed, human rights, abolishion of slavery by the first time in history etc.I'm not trying to ""whitewash"" European Empires, but trying to show some truth against the demonization people have tried to bring into European Empires, wrongfully thinking the rest of the world were just good people who only wanted peace in the world.","2,052 followers",Aaron Jantzen,1.7K,3.4K,13.8M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-would-advanced-technology-look-like-in-a-world-that-never-excessively-harmed-the-environment-and-never-developed-cities

Alternate advancement, the same tech (but a lot later down the line), full-on sci-fi utopia, etc.I’m not going to go through every scenario and just list the one that I personally see as being the most likely/most fun to think about.I think that if war never existed, it would go something like this;Alternate advancement.While there is no war, humans are still humans. We like to fight and compete. The world leaders understand this, and the more enlightened among us tell them this.With the “humans like to fight” fact firmly rooted in reality, both our current and alternate realities, there would be a “Peacekeeper” force for each nation. I use the term “Peacekeeper” because an actual military would be a foreign concept.The peacekeepers’ purpose would be as a safeguard against anyone who might “change their mind.”A Peacekeeper would probably look something like this, if not a 1:1 match.This is a soldier from the Death Korps of Krieg in Warhammer 40k. They heavily draw influence from World War 1 and 2 (mostly 1) in almost all aspects. Their uniforms, their strategies and tactics, and weapons (as far as ballistic weaponry goes). We would still have things like machine guns like the Maxim, rifles like WW2’s StG-44, and vehicles like the M3 Halftrack and the M12 Self-Propelled Gun.There is a twist, however.Wanna know what our homes and cities would look like? They would look like this.That’s the Citadel from Mass Effect. I’m not saying we will have floating cities in space, or contact with sentient extra-terrestrials, however. I’m simply saying “our non-peacekeeper tech would be ridiculously sci-fi.” Since there is no war, medical advancements, our homes, and general quality-of-life tech would be so far above what we have now, it would be considered ridiculous.Our world would be a contrasting combination of grungy Steampunk and sterile space sci-fi.The space race would ALSO still happen, just under different circumstances. It would still be a case of “I’ll race ya.” This is where the “humans like to compete” part comes in.With that in mind, we would indeed eventually have floating space cities akin to The Citadel in Mass Effect, and much sooner than we will in our current reality.Yet, our Peacekeeper tech would still be stagnant in WW1, WW2, and the intermediary years between the two.My inspiration for thinking this subconsciously came from a book (I forget the name of it. The rest of the details are extremely hazy….. I was drunk when he told me about this, so pardon me for inaccuracies.) my dad told me about a few years back, where there was a race of hyper-advanced aliens that conquered the galaxy, as far as they knew they could. Then, they stumbled across our current, real-life Earth. They contacted the US president (of course they did), and said “Earthlings, we are the most powerful and most technologicaly advanced empire in the galaxy. Surrender now or die!”Being humans, who love to fight, we laughed and said “come get us.”Next thing you know, a bunch of aliens start marching off of a troop ship. But what’s this? They’re wearing uniforms like Napolean’s troops…. they’re marching in lines across open fields… they’re performing musket volleys… what?Turns out that the reason why the aliens had such advanced space tech is because they almost completely ignored their military tech. Their experience up until this point had been Zulu War-esque.Suddenly, they’re fighting against US Marines, Army, Airforce, etc. armed with M16s, machineguns like M60s, M1 Abramses, B-52 bombers, AH-64 Apaches, and all other kinds of good stuff.Needless to say, we won that war, remembered what they said during their ultimatum about being “the most powerful and technologically advanced”… “Reclaimed” their ships and went on our own liberation spree across the galaxy, ’cause ‘Murica. Very suddenly, humanity was the most powerful race in the galaxy.Back to the question at hand;The reason I say our tech would be WW1-WW2 level is due to aforementioned “humans know humans like to fight” so we’d be a bit more advanced than firing lines with muskets.That’s all for now.

So in a fictional universe, he was still working within its own fictional limitations. Cool.Now we go to the trailer for End Game. Last we saw him he was stranded with Nebula on Titan. An alien planet. With alien tech. Now I love Tony but we really put a lot of unrealistic pressure on a flawed character with human limitations.Even with all the debris around, there's no earth equipment he can utilise to scan and figure out what anything is to “invent” something. We saw his communications with earth cut out as he left the atmosphere. So Friday doesn't work either. He's just recording in hopes of it being found. Caveat.We don't know he hasn't been tinkering with said alien tech and materials and is hoping to attempt a Hail Mary pass with some very same said repurposed alien tech to get off the planet, assuming there's a fuel source.But the odds of realistically working with tech not from your own planet to even put together a terrestrial vehicle (like a buggy) much more one capable of flight through space seems slim to none, no matter how inventive.

When the rockets cut off, the helicopter will have a high possibility of crashing before the helicopter slows down enough rotors to “bite” into the air restoring control. And that is disregarding the high possibility of the rotors getting ripped off due to speed.As to Knight Rider, the tech is mostly here though it is hard to scan a building and make up a perfect blueprint of the building and highlight the target being scanned for. As to bullet proofing, depending on the weight of the car- it’s possible to recreate it. The laser, on later episodes, that is still out of reach but getting closer all the time.",1 follower,Ryan Nelson,591,1.1K,10.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/With-advanced-technology-why-does-it-still-take-the-police-at-least-an-hour-to-trace-a-call
