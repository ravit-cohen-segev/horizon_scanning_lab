While it's not explicitly stated, there could be countless deaths as various functions slowly start to break and are incapable of being repaired.At the very least, humanity has the capability to keep ourselves ""dominant over our machines"" by maintaining ourselves as ""Machine Repair Technicians"".Another short story (which I forget the name at the moment) handles the topic of ""useful employment""...

3,"Automation has been a concern for workers and policy makers for centuries. It is still a legitimate concern.What if 50% of the jobs are done by robots?Case 1: I assume that theAutomation has been a concern for workers and policy makers for centuries. It is still a legitimate concern.What if 50% of the jobs are done by robots?Case 1: I assume that theAnd in the developed world too there are plenty of challenges, especially in geriatrics. They don’t have enough nurses or caretakers. I believe robots will take up a lot of these. Robots could also handle customer service and concierge in those places as big chain stores have taken these markets providing a very impersonal touch.And robots will also do a lot of new jobs - such as cleaning up solar panels in the middle of a desert, cleaning up trash in high voltage power lines & windmills, prospecting for metals at the bottom of oceans, clearing up plastic from water bodies, compacting land fills etc.Assuming there are a 2 billion jobs in 2017, the number of jobs could go to 5 billion in 2025, of which if half are done by robots, we still win. The key is to push for creating a number of jobs.Case 2: Assuming thatThis would require a lot of restructuring of the economic policy. It would not be a bad thing for humans to reduce the number of work hours. We are already having less time for our children, parents and spouses. We spend most of our daylight working and this would appear as a crazy-barbaric thing in the future. It increases our stress levels and makes for an unhappy, unhealthy society.What if we all could have our work times cut into half, but still being paid the same? That would require the governments to tax the firms appropriately - they don’t need to increase corporate taxes, but make sure all firms pay 35% of profits in taxes and don’t do what companies like GE and Apple do - skipping most of their tax payments with wicked accounting.In parallel, they have to create a minimum welfare program where all citizens get basic necessities - food, clothing, shelter, books, healthcare through a universal basic income. The cost of these will be a lot cheaper by then as the robots are creating these services and thus making it more affordable for the government.All said, overall our business and political leaders cannot imagine well about the robotics industry. They keep thinking about the 1960s era robots - of big metallic machines doing automation in factories. There are a whole new fields and applications to be created that they cannot even imagine now.Think of some applications of intelligent humanoids:Robots could do to our life, what the PCs did 30 years ago. Sure, they automated some stuff and removed some jobs [typists, stenographers, secretaries] but they created whole new wonderful fields. PCs do a lot of our jobs, but they also created an equal amount of new jobs. That is what could happen to robotics - but the common public and leaders are uncompletely unaware of what is happening new in robotics.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,1.5K,5.6K,427.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Better-technology-means-computers-and-robots-will-replace-the-common-human-being-in-many-jobs-Will-this-be-terrible-for-mankind

8,"No, the main advantage of attack helicopters is that they can fly low to the ground, making it difficult for air defenses to target them. By contrast, drones have to fly high above the ground, making them vulnerable to enemy radars. Additionally, drones can only be housed at and launched from airbases, which are becoming increasingly vulnerable to cruise and ballistic missile strikes. Helicopters’ ability to take off vertically allows for much more flexible basing, allowing for dispersion.

However, in high intensity conflicts large, stealthy drones like the Sukhoi Okhotnik-B and the Northrop Grumman X-47B will be used increasingly in the place of traditional fighter bombers and strike aircraft. Drones like the predator will not be particularly practical in high-intensity conflicts, because their low speed and high radar cross-section leaves them vulnerable to air defenses.","1,771 followers",Charles Jannuzi,593,8.1K,17.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-will-eventually-replace-hearing-aids

A dead-end platform which 30 years from now will be looked at with nostalgia but not used anymore excepts in parades.For sake of discussion, I define an attack helicopter as “an armed helicopter with the primary role of engaging targets on the ground, mostly armored fighting vehicles but also enemy infantry”.

If we don’t agree, don’t bother reading further.Originally, the helicopter gunship was conceived during the Vietnam War (AH-1 Cobra). Later, the attack helicopter was seen as a solution for defending West Germany during the Cold War in the 70’s and 80’s. It was assumed that fixed wing aircraft would not be able to survive in the dense SAM environment and there would be no time to create safe regions via SEAD attacks. In addition, at the time there weren’t many long range precision munitions enabling attack from behind the front lines. Nor were there networked battlefield management systems that provided real time intel of targets.The thinking that prevailed at the time was that a low flying platform that could fire 8–16 anti-tank missiles would be able to stop the waves of Warsaw Pact armor in the Fulda Gap (or Syrian armor in the Golan Heights) - flying low and out of SAM range, locate targets and destroy them. I am guessing this is also part of the shared experience from the Yom Kipur War.A lot has changed since then.As an example, look at theIf I look today, attack helicopters are mostly used as gunships or missile carriers as part of the global war on terror and other asymmetric battles . But that is just because these platforms are already available. Had the US Army needed to fund new attack helicopters, I would estimate they would request something else:Where does an attack helicopter fit in? I can’t see where. The lethality of the battlefield together with improvements in UAVs and guided munitions have made it a platform of the past.Will helicopters continue to be used? Certainly - but for other uses. Not as attack gunships.",5 followers,Bill Otto,7.6K,7.5K,43.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Better-technology-means-computers-and-robots-will-replace-the-common-human-being-in-many-jobs-Will-this-be-terrible-for-mankind
