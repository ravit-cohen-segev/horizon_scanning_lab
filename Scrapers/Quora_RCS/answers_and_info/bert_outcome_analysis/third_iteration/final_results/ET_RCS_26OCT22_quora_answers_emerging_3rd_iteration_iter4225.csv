That the Americans were able to use superior leadership, George Washington, guerrilla tactics and strategy to beat the better supplied British troops who just walked into the open without strategy and got mowed down by rifle fire from the trees in the distance.There is so much wrong with this.

That the Americans were able to use superior leadership, George Washington, guerrilla tactics and strategy to beat the better supplied British troops who just walked into the open without strategy and got mowed down by rifle fire from the trees in the distance.There is so much wrong with this. The Americans did not win the war. At least not the way many people think. They did not constantly outfight the British using better strategy and guerrilla warfare. All of the major American victories were fought in the conventional style of battle at that time. Yorktown, Cowpens, Trenton, and more. King’s Mountain and parts of Saratoga are some of the few arguably won by guerrilla manners. Next is that the British were not the greatest military in the world. They had the greatest navy.Their navy had won many victories in wars throughout the century. The British army was formidable. But it wasn’t the best. It was in the top 10–5 best armies, but the best actualor the Prussians.The British army was on the winning side of many wars. The Seven Years War comes to mind. However, it was won with a lot of strategy on William Pitt’s part, naval superiority as well as expansion into other countries, such as in India. So the Americans were not fightingSiege of Savannah (the British capture and defend the city against the Americans and French.)Battle of Camden (an outnumbered British force destroys an American force under Horatio Gates.)Battle of the Saintes (even though not important overall being after Yorktown, still worth noting seeing how heavily the French navy was beaten, Admiral De Grasse being captured.)The war has been taught the wrong way. The American victories were won in conventional-style warfare. Guerrilla warfare is never enough to win a war alone. It was a behind the scenes success that largely was only effective on the frontier. In fact, the British were more experienced and arguably more skilled in guerrilla style warfare, as were many of their Native American allies.Above is Robert Rogers: EvenEdit:But the Americans were not overly better than the British. British leadership was inconsistent. The generals were able to win many battles but failed to completely destroy the Americans. But they were able to constantly outmaneuver them. In fact, George Washington lost more battles than he won. It was his ability to keep the Americans alive that helped them win. It was also thanks to Nathaniel Greene outlasting the British in the south. The British generals were successful in the short term ideals. Such as William Howe, who defeated the Americans in New York and in Philadelphia, but failed to completely destroy the rebels, even when he had the chance to at Long Island. The Americans constantly lost in the short run, but their ability to live to fight another day kept them holding out until the French and Spanish became involved. After this, people like Baron Von Steuben trained and drilled American troops into a more professional fighting force. Then you have the fact that British troops were being sent to fight a war 3,000 miles away, meaning that British morale was likely pretty low.I would also like to mention the deciding battles before Yorktown, namely the southern campaign. With the fight reaching a stalemate in 1778, the British struck south, capturing Savannah, shifting the theater. They held Savannah and beat the Americans at Camden and Charlestown, which were terrible losses for the revolution.The thing is, despite all this success, this caused the Americans to shift tactics. Nathaniel Green became general of American forces in the south. He focused on outstretching the British, forcing them into a wild goose chase and weakening their supply lines. This split up the British, and led to General Morgan beating Tarleton Banastre at the Battle of Cowpens. Guilford Courthouse, however, despite being a British victory, cost their already small force high casualties. This put Cornwallis in a bad position. So he retreated to Yorktown to await aid from Henry Clinton. This help did not come, and led to the Americans and the French trapping them in the siege of Yorktown. Francis Marion was a large help in the south as well, harrassing British supply lines and more with his guerrilla tactics (I did say guerrilla tactics are overstated, but while they can’t win a war, they can help support and effort in a certain theater). Lastly is Pensacola. Galvez and his Spanish forces captured Pensacola, threatening British Jamaica and sugar colonies, and forcing their navy to take up defensive positions, keeping a British fleet that could have likely stopped the French navy at the Chesapeake Bay from attacking. So, overall the deciding factors were:The war was won by help from France and Spain. It really was just outlasting the British. Because the British could have kept fighting after Yorktown. They showed this with the Battle of the Saintes. They had the capability to try and capture or recapture major cities and hold off America’s allies, but they realized that it wasn’t worth it, abandoning the effort similar to what happened in the Vietnam war. So can we truly consider it an American victory? Not really. It was just the French and Spanish gaining the upper hand for the Americans.The American Revolution was complicated, but is often oversimplified by biased textbooks, authors and teachers. This book is one of the worst offenders.This whole book was propaganda, from trying and failing to debunk racism, overemphasizing the ‘heroics’ of people like George Washington to Americans being great heroes and the British like…storm troopers.The winners write the history books, so don’t trust everything your friendly neighborhood textbook says.Peace!EDIT: Since history is controversial, I’ve had comments disagreeing with me. Rude comments and replies to them have been deleted, but some pointed out my hidden message towards Trump. I dislike Trump, but that is my personal opinion. If you disagree, this answer is talking about an important aspect of history, not about Trump and starting an argument over it is not needed. Nevertheless I have gotten rid of it. I have added in a point or two some people have wanted me to add.EDIT #2: Okay, a second edit! I never thought I would have to do this! With many views and upvotes and supporting comments comes disagreement. Some have said my article seems to be bashing the American’s effort, while I then suddenly admit that people like Francis Marion and Nathaniel Greene helped win a theater despite debunking similar tactics earlier. Francis Marion and Nathaniel Greene had effects on the Southern Theater that would help the Americans win, yes, but me admitting that does not mean my other points are invalid. Even with the effects from those two in the south, all that I said about British logistical problems remains and was present. This whole article was mostly just getting rid of the idea that American won through ‘X,’ and more that ‘Z’ (logistical problems and all mentioned) was hampering the British, and that if I remove the those qualifiers, America won, and that I am downplaying American tactics. Yet the evidence I provided still helps support my opinion that it was logistical disadvantages on the part of the British that forced them to leave the conflict. Even with all of the American tactics I am supposedly bashing, if those problems had not been there, America likely would have ‘lost.’Sorry that this response was long. I had a lot to try and cover with all this. It’s hard to write about so much and make sure my points stay solid and consistent. I stand by my conclusions, and future rude comments will be deleted. Thank you!Thanks for the upvotes!",0 followers,Oscar Fredrick,2.8K,202,5M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Britain-lose-the-American-War-of-Independence-Revolutionary-War

If you have paid to view this answer, cancel your subscription, follow me, and view it free on my feed, together with all by other free content.…but for the moment just stick with it and try to see the situation from British point of view.At the time Britain was engaged in a long and protracted, global, war with another superpower, France, which happened to also be it’s closest neighbour.This was a vicious fight to the death, from which there could be only one winner, who would then dominate the earth for the the next 100 years (sounds like a good script for a blockbuster film).Into this huge global conflict step a few far off British colonies in the Americas who decide to rebel against their King.Worse, these colonies treacherously invite the French to help them. The only modern equivalent I can think of that comes close to how this must have felt to the British is the Cuban missile crisis.In response to this conflict in the Americas, Britain has three strategic aims:The loss of a dozen or so colonies in the Americas was of little importance to Britain, provided the French cannot use it to their advantage - what we would now call ‘collateral damage’.In this wider context, for Britain, the American War of Independence was only ever a rearguard action against the French, not a war they sought to win. This is not to disparage the achievements of the American revolutionaries, or belittle the importance of the war to the people of America. This is only to view the conflict in the wider British politics of the day.Britain succeeded in securing its strategic aims in the Americas, with the minor loss of only a dozen or so colonies. They also, together with their allies, won the global conflict against the French in a series of spectacular campaigns; the French Monarchy, together with the French aristocracy was restored, and the French revolutionaries were wiped from the face of the earth (except for those that escaped to America). The idea, though, never died, which is why France today is a republic.So you see, against this wider, global, idealistic, conflict, and the spectacular British victory in Europe, the American Revolution hardly registered in the British psyche, which is why we British have never really considered it a defeat - just a loss.Of course, to those in the USA, the American War of Independence is, quite rightly, a pivotal moment in history, but that is because you see history from your point of view, the British point of view is just a little different.Author update:Many commentators have pointed out that the French Revolution started 6 years after the end of the American War of Independence, and referenced both the Seven Years war before and the 1812 war afterwards. My thanks to everyone for correcting me - my timeline got a bit skewed. I have amended the article accordingly.My point is, that a British-centric view of the period sees the struggle with France lasting from the start of the Seven Years war in 1756 until the battle of Waterloo in 1815. Sometimes it was open warfare and at others it was more akin to the Cold War, with both sides fighting proxy wars through other states/players. The French Revolution only upped the stakes for both sides. Of course, I am generalising massively.They say, ‘History is written by the victors,’ but it also depends from where it is viewed.",64 followers,Nick Travers,783,944,1.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Britain-lose-the-American-War-of-Independence-Revolutionary-War

5,"‘The noble lord mentions the inpractibility of conquering America. I cannot think the noble lord can be serious on this matter. Suppose the colonies do abound in men, what does that signify? They are raw, undisciplined, cowardly men. I wish instead of 40 or 50,000 of these brave fellows, they would produce in the field at least 200,000, the more the better, the easier would be the conquest.‘The noble lord mentions the inpractibility of conquering America.

I wish instead of 40 or 50,000 of these brave fellows, they would produce in the field at least 200,000, the more the better, the easier would be the conquest.Could the Brits have won?If this was the case then why were the British unable to make the most of their victories? The answer lies in the fact that the rebels were able to avoid major confrontations under disadvantageous circumstances. The single opportunity the British had to destroy the bulk of Washington’s army was in 1776. After this the Continental army’s strategy was not to engage the British army where it would not have the opportunity to retreat. During their defeats the rebel commanders were pragmatic and were able to withdraw in good order. British commanders found it difficult to pursue retreating forces, often because of a lack of provisions and a lack of manpower reserves for attending to the wounded while remaining on the offensive. The ubiquitous woods and high fences of the American landscape provided a further barrier and the challenges of operating in America let to physical and mental exhaustion among the British army.The trigger for French intervention was partly the British defeat at Saratoga (where most guns on the American side were supplied by the French) – but the main factor was British attempts to negotiate with and conciliate the rebels. This was too little too late but the measures were enough to provoke the French into action for fear of an Anglo-American rapprochement. With France’s entry Britain now faced a mortal threat in Europe. In Ireland rebellion by Irish Jacobites became a constant threat. King George III’s German territories were now exposed to an attack by the French and the Austrians and the French could now put pressure on the other German principalities to withdraw their mercenaries. As a result Britain was forced into mass-mobilisation and to spread its forces more thinly.ConclusionAddendumThe most controversial element of this question seems to be the issue of how important the 13 colonies actually were for the British Empire. It is true that the Caribbean was seen as the economic engine of the empire (although, as I pointed out, the mainland colonies were increasingly important) Jamaica alone produced 40% of the sugar and 90% of the rum in Britain’s Empire. You can see the relative importance of the colonies through this chart of export values from 'British Atlantic, American Frontier' Stephen J. Hornsby.At the same time India was believed by ministers to be a fiscal gold mine; Bengal for example had a population of around 20 million and was reckoned to have a public revenue of around a quarter of that of the British Isles.I disagree though with the idea that the Caribbean was vastly more important in the contemporary British mindset. That would have been true through most of the eighteenth century but in the intervening period the American mainland underwent a massive population explosion. Various projections doing the rounds at the time suggested that by 1786 the 13 colonies would have 4 million inhabitants with corresponding economic benefits to Britain – this meant that by the time of the revolution they loomed larger than the Caribbean in terms of British strategy (The best demonstration of this is the fact that Britain relinquished some islands she had won in the Seven Years War in order to hold on to Canada). State power was measured in terms of population as well as financial power.The problem is that 18th century British statesman did not make decisions based on pure economics. If it were a straightforward question of money then the West Indies were more valuable. However, the fact is that British policy was not driven primarily by commercial factors; the primacy was given to strategic considerations. They thought in terms of the European balance of power and America’s role within that. Similarly Ireland and Scotland were seen as part of Britain European grand strategy; for example – if Ireland fell it offered a back door to England or contribute to her encirclement.The importance of America was two-fold – firstly that backing down would destroy British credibility (a collapse of authority undermined Britain’s position as a Great power) and secondly that ministers and peers believed that it was the valuable resources of America which has enabled them to face the united efforts of the House of Bourbon in the Seven Years War. It was also felt that the monopoly of American trade supported British power - most crucially in any conflict with the Bourbons (France and Spain) - and that, without political links, it would be impossible to maintain economic relationships.So the British did care about North America - that's why they conducted the largest military mobilisation undertaken hitherto (from 72 battalions in 1774, to 118 in 1783 & 16,000 seamen at the outbreak of the war - to 60,000 in 1778 and 100,000 in 1780.","3,298 followers",Kevin Flint,899,1.6K,8.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Britain-lose-the-American-War-of-Independence-Revolutionary-War

Further, England was divided over its American colonies with many in England, including Members of Parliament, being against the war. England, by the time of the Revolution, was no longer a true monarchy, but very much a constitutional monarchy were the powers of the king were severely limited. Most of the charges in the Declaration of Independence should not have been placed at the feet of King George III, but rather at Parliament.In short, England lost the Revolutionary War because it was too expensive to fight an unpopular war against Englishmen - and the Colonialists were largely Englishmen - and win in a place so far from English shores.","12,759 followers",Khalid Elhassan,13.3K,1.2K,38.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Britain-lose-the-American-War-of-Independence-Revolutionary-War

Death was a constant companion in the 1700s it didn’t hold the sting it does today. You could wipe out a battalion with disease or grapeshot, the other battalions would just hope the dead soldiers had been a month in arrears. It meant they were more likely to see their pay. It’s a mercenary business.In this the British still had an advantage. They were volunteers and actual mercenaries. They would grumble, but had nowhere else to be. American volunteers may have joined with pride and spirit, but it’s easier to maintain grumbling and pay in an army than spirit.The public will to fight is the most fragile. It’s easily shocked by just a little news, is usually confused by the details and everyone seems to have an opinion. This is where American strategy had its only card in the game.Most people in Britain were also arguing for better representation for their taxes. They didn’t like the idea of a military forcing parliaments decision on its own people. They also made three times as much money from the Caribbean and umpteen times more money from India than they did from the USA.In 1776 it wasn’t really worth the trouble.By coming back after every knock, by taking the field again and again with some success.
