1,"Typically in a fleet of the pre-modern ships of old, there were three commanders who oversaw the fleets, and two of them oversaw those fleets in segments.Ships would be commanded by a Captain, from the smallest sloop to the largest frigate. That Captain would, as is quite often depicted in movies and documentaries about such things, usually have a command staff that had different duties aboard the ship but answered to the Captain and his second in command exclusively.Fleets worked much the same way.

That Captain would, as is quite often depicted in movies and documentaries about such things, usually have a command staff that had different duties aboard the ship but answered to the Captain and his second in command exclusively.Fleets worked much the same way. The fleet Admiral (note: not “Fleet Admiral” with a capital ‘f,’ but “fleet Admiral,” as in the Admiral of a particular fleet) commanded the entire fleet (or squadron in some cases). His second in command, using the common “vice” prefix to denote the “one step down from ___” custom, was the Vice Admiral, who commanded the fore section of the fleet, the ships who often were in the most danger from naval or coastal fire during an engagement.Junior to the Vice Admiral and Admiral, yet superior still to the Captains under his command, was the Rear Admiral. This Rear Admiral was often a man with more experience (or a higher commission) than Captains, but less time commanding more than one vessel than either the Vice Admiral or Admiral. The Rear Admiral would often be a recently promoted Captain or otherwise a moderately influential man in aristocratic society with fewer chances to achieve leadership than the Vice Admiral or Admiral, and so the Rear Admiral commanded the aft section of the fleet, the rear.This is because the aft section of the fleet often consisted of ships with lighter loads of cannonry and ammunition, and were considered to be under fire less often and with less severity than the ships in the fore section of the fleet. The Admiral would issue commands to the Vice and Rear Admirals, at which point those Admirals would relay the commands to their Captains, etcetera. Sometimes, when the Admiral was incapacitated or it was otherwise necessary, the Vice Admiral could issue orders to the Rear Admiral, as the Vice Admiral would have been the most senior of the two in most cases.If the Vice Admiral were in any way incapacitated, the Rear Admiral would assume the position of the Vice Admiral, often without a battlefield commission as until more recent naval tactics in some countries, the two were the same rank with different duties. A trustworthy Captain from the aft section of the fleet would then be selected to receive a field-commission to Rear Admiral, to be decided upon permanently when the crisis causing such an event to occur could be solved.In modern times, the rank has retained its practical use as a junior rank to the Vice and “Full” Admiral ranks, but has lost its (in theory) flexibility with the rank of Vice Admiral, and it is now possible to find Rear Admirals (Upper Half) in charge of full fleets, while in the United States, Rear Admirals (Lower Half) typically command squadrons.","29,953 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,3.9K,7.7K,249.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-condition-of-repair-service-provided-by-Lava-Mobile-service-centre

Unfortunate. And in Desert Storm and beyond, we’ve seen enormous changes in technology that afford entirely different means of air combat.Radars — WWII era and other low-frequency radars can often “detect” stealth aircraft. But detection is not engagement and it’s not fire control. These radars cannot be minimized in size (see: physics).Designing for stealth can result in great reductions in RCS, and thus the detection ranges of aircraft. If you can drive that range down significantly, you can often delivery ordnance before the enemy can shoot back. This is particularly true with air-to-air engagements. If you can close to within missile range without being detected by your opponent, you win the majority of the engagements.","6,091 followers",David Tussey,594,1.8K,37.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-condition-of-repair-service-provided-by-Lava-Mobile-service-centre

For nations that surrendered quickly and without must resistance, the Mongols gave lenient treatment. For others that refused to surrender and insulted the Mongols, such as the Abbasid Caliphate, their cities were burned and their civilians were butchered. By 1260, the Mongols had rampaged throughout the Middle East, destroying many major powers in the region and cowing almost all of the rest into surrendering. All except one.By 1260, the Mamluk Sultanate was arguably the last major power left in the Middle East to defy the Mongols. Persia had been conquered, with her infamous Assassins Guild which the Christian Crusaders so feared completely exterminated. The Abbasid Caliphate had been crushed, with hundreds of thousands of civilians (estimates go as high as 800,000) killed when the capital, Baghdad, fell. The Ayyubid Dynasty, which was established by the reputable commander Saladin, was destroyed. The Mongols seemed unstoppable.When Hulagu Khan sent his envoys to Mamuk Sultan Saif ad-Din Qutuz, telling him to submit and be spared, the Sultan told the Mongols to go “fuck themselves” by killing all the Mongol Envoys and Ambassadors and having their heads displayed on Cairo’s gates. So began the Mongol Invasion of the Mamluk Sultanate.Mongol Invasion of the Levant in 1260. Aleppo and the Ayyubid Dynasty fell at the start of the year.The Mongol hordes, enraged by the defiance of the Mamluks, decided to teach them a lesson and show the world why the Mongols were not to be fucked with. They had already implied that the Mamluks would meet an unkind fate should they resist in their messages to the Sultan.From the King of Kings of the East and West, the Great Khan. To Qutuz the Mamluk, who fled to escape our swords. You should think of what happened to other countries and submit to us. You have heard how we have conquered a vast empire and have purified the earth of the disorders that tainted it. We have conquered vast areas, massacring all the people. You cannot escape from the terror of our armies. Where can you flee? What road will you use to escape us? Our horses are swift, our arrows sharp, our swords like thunderbolts, our hearts as hard as the mountains, our soldiers as numerous as the sand. Fortresses will not detain us, nor armies stop us. Your prayers to God will not avail against us. We are not moved by tears nor touched by lamentations. Only those who beg our protection will be safe. Hasten your reply before the fire of war is kindled. Resist and you will suffer the most terrible catastrophes. We will shatter your mosques and reveal the weakness of your God and then will kill your children and your old men together. At present you are the only enemy against whom we have to march.Hulagu’s letter to the Sultan, before the declaration of warBy resisting, the Mamluks were to be given no quarter and that everyone, even the old, the weak and the women and children, were all to be slaughtered. The Sultan’s defiance would have probably ended with Cairo sacked and hundreds of thousands of Egyptians dead had it not been for fate, or possibly chance.In a great stroke of luck for the Mamluks, Great Khan Möngke died campaigning against the Song Dynasty in 1259 and news had reached Hulagu, one of the potential candidates for the Great Khan in early 1260. Hulagu decided to depart from the Levant with most of his army, leaving behind one Tumen (the Mongol version of a military division, one Tumen = 10,000 men) under the command of his best general, Kitbuqa Noyan, to defend the Levant. It would take months if not years for the Mongols to go to the Great Khan Convention to decide on the successor of the Mongol Empire and then come back.Map of the Mongol Empire and its vassals in 1260, taken from Reddit.The Mamluk Sultan, practically jubilant at his luck, assembled the bulk of the Mamluk Host at Cairo and quickly began invading Palestine to drive away the Mongol Occupation Army. Although the Mamluk Sultan had extremely bad relations with the Christian Crusaders Armies which still occupied sizable portions of the Levant, the Crusaders decided to allow the Mamluks to use Crusader ports for resupply to drive away the Mongol menace. The Mamluks started to make considerable advances before the Mongol Tumens began to assemble to drive them away.One of the three main reasons why the Mamluks defeated the Mongols was because of the Mamluk’s numerical superiority.The Mamluk invasion of the Levant and the Mongol counter offensive, summer and early autumn of 1260.On September 3rd, 1260, the Mamluk and Mongol hosts confronted each other at the Jezreel Valley, in the northern part of modern day Israel/Palestine. Muslim sources state that the entire Mamluk host was 20,000 strong, whereas the Mongol force was vastly inferior, somewhere between 10,000 to 12,000 strong. Even then, it should have been possible for the Mongols to prevail. The Mongols had crushed far larger armies numerous times before. This is where the second main factor for Mongol defeat appears.The Battle of Yehuling was an example of a Mongolian Army (110,000 cavalry) defeating a vastly numerically superior force (350,000 infantry, 150,000 cavalry)The Mamluks and their allies used hit-and-run tactics against the Mongolian force, acknowledging that they would lose a direct confrontation with the Mongolian host. Eventually, the Mongolian cavalry’s direct heavy assault against Mamluk positions forced the Mamluks into a full scale retreat for the highlands of the valley. Here is where Mongolian arrogance led to their defeat.The Mongols should have realized that the Mamluks had laid a trap.When the Mongolian army charged into the highlands, the other half of the Mamluk army emerged and began their riptose against the Mongolians. The exhausted Mongolians were soon beset by arrow storms and were surrounded by the Mamluk armies. Here laid the final reason for Mamluk victory. The Mamluks were used to the desert terrain, which provided little water and blistering temperatures.The Mamluk horsemen were accustomed to the hot terrain, especially the water-scare deserts in Arabia and the Levant. The Mongolians were less so.The Mongols, now realizing that the tide of the battle had turned decisively against them, desperately tried to break out. The left wing of the Mamluk army began to collapse under the weight of the desperate Mongolian counterattack, which was on the verge of escaping. Sultan Qutuz and his elite guard legion, which had been observing the battle and acting as a reserve, charged into the left wing and shattered the Mongolian counter attack, effectively dooming their would be conquerers. Although the Mongolian host reorganized, it was still encircled and soon Mamluk heavy calvary and assault troops overwhelmed the Mongolians in close combat, which had never been achieved before.Mamluk cavalry and assault troops charge the Mongolians at Ain JalutMamluk assault troops and heavy cavalry played an important role in Mamluk victory.There lay three crucial reasons for Mamluk victory against the Mongols at Ain Jalut. (The second and third reasons negated Mongolian strengths, whereas the first reason would seal Mongolian defeat)Mamluk numerical superiorityMongol arrogance coupled with clever Mamluk tacticsInhospitable terrain for Mongolian horsesBy the end of battle, the entire Mongolian Tumen had been annihilated, an unprecedented defeat in Mongolian history. Kitbuga was captured and killed in a struggle, marking him as one of the few Mongolian generals to fall in combat in the 1200s. Over 10,000 men were slaughtered in the rout, which permanently shattered the Mongolian aura of invincibility. The defeat at Ain Jalut was arguably the start of Mongolian decline, as Westward expansion began to end. Although the Mamluk-Mongolian War would continue on for many years, the Mongols would never again be feared as the undefeatable hordes that could not be stopped.The victory at Ain Jalut heavily rewarded the Mamluks. By 1290, they would wrestle control of the Levant away from both the Crusaders and the Mongols. The Mamluk Sultanate began its empire at Ain Jalut.",837 followers,Maximilian Singer,592,174,2.8M,2017,https://www.quora.com/According-to-Pierre-Sprey-creator-of-F-16-claimed-that-todays-stealth-fighters-can-be-easily-detected-by-vintage-World-War-2-era-radar-systems-If-thats-the-case-why-havent-engineers-able-to-miniaturize-that-kind-of
