But many, especially the environmental predictions were considered to established science with a majority of scientists in agreement. Anyone who disagreed was ridiculed.How does the role of futurist benefit society? Unfortunately, many of our futurists did not benefit society. They scared people, caused major anxiety, and caused much government money to be wasted studying upcoming disasters that never occurred. Some, like acid rain, ozone depletion, and nuclear safety resulted in new laws and regulations that did serve to make things better or safer.Too many so-called futurists are trying to make money, sell books, obtain grant money, or get their political party elected.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2014,https://www.quora.com/Who-are-the-top-technology-futurists

It's not all glam, even if you are  working on really cool stuff, you have to deal with the less than cool  things.  And I don't think anyone is running for the doors because of this, since we are professionals and realize that it's work that needs doing. And we are working towards a vision that helps drive you through the mundane.It's worth noting that you can have a major impact on what you work on (in addition to the company, your manager, the team you work on, or your seniority) if you are willing to invest the energies. Often, I've observed that the best engineers make opportunities for themselves, instead of waiting for the opportunities to be handed to them. It's in our blood, after all, to be creative, and to innovate. You could have a manager that is focused on making sure that requirements are met, and live that life and be happy, but that doesn't stop you from thinking out the box and turning around something great that nobody was anticipating. AOL Instant Messenger is an example of this, it was a skunkworks project at AOL that management actually thought wouldn't amount to anything, but in the end had enormous appeal and upside. VMware Fusion also came into existence because of the creativity and drive of a small number of engineers (one who is now doing good things at Facebook I hear) who felt it was needed and did what it took to make it happen.To directly answer the question: I've been engineering now for, oh, 25 years, and I'd estimate that on the average, 40% of my efforts have been ones you could probably characterize as anti-glamorous. But I've always kept my sanity knowing that the other 60% exists. And that all of it is important in the end, because glamor work alone does not ship products.","112,405 followers",Yishan Wong,801,1.6K,28.7M,2010,https://www.quora.com/Who-are-the-top-technology-futurists

High-profile projects at Facebook get respect from the press and the outside world, but ""doing the dirty work"" gets you respect from your peers and management.

(In my personal experience the only other place I felt that way was at MIT; I am sure there are other places like these.)As Lucent started doing poorly however, the focus shifted from research more into productizing ideas. This work was satisfying in other ways. When the constraints on your problem change, sometimes it gets harder to solve for non-technical reasons. That also adds to learning. But yes, the challenges are different.A lot of my erstwhile colleagues now work at Google. Some at Microsoft. Some weren't easily satisfied anywhere and went back to academia.I think this applies across corporations as they age, their focus shifts, as you become more senior and move up the corporate ladder etc.Lastly, to echo some of the other responses here, work is what you make of it. I used to believe ""there are no small jobs, only small engineers"". I took on projects others would not, and guess what, you can even innovate in seemingly dead-end tasks - improve efficiencies, reduce costs/time to market, better meet customer needs, etc. There were patent opportunities even on these projects.So in sum, my view is: enjoy your work, if you really hate parts of it, imagine that's the part of the job you are really paid for (since you'd do the parts you really enjoy for free - at least in theory), and go from there.

If Amazon keeps its eyes open, they have the talent and horsepower to stay King of the Hill.

Whenever things got painful, a team would be put together to work on the problem since the fact that it was so important would make the problem sexy again. Being able to throw Google scale resources at even what would be considered mundane items at other companies is a lot of fun.What was a problem was making unit tests and testing something important enough that people would do it consistently. The testing inter-grouplet took on that problem and spent years on it, and did succeed in changing the culture enough that it was considered important.","20,836 followers",Alan Mellor,796,12.3K,63.8M,2010,https://www.quora.com/For-top-technology-companies-what-of-their-engineer-time-is-devoted-to-tough-groundbreaking-intrinsically-satisfying-problems-and-what-is-routine-grunt-work-a-1X-engineer-could-handle

But, we have code duplication: maps uses ""arrayContains"" and Closure has ""goog.array.contains"". The semantics of such functions are occasionally slightly different (e.g, when does an array contain ""undefined""?).  So, this can't be fully automated, and fixing each occurrence can take a fair amount of true, real grunt work.I currently spend about a day a week doing what I consider to be grunt work: stuff which I find boring and for which Google is probably overpaying me.","45,614 followers",David Seidman,753,3.6K,85M,2011,https://www.quora.com/For-top-technology-companies-what-of-their-engineer-time-is-devoted-to-tough-groundbreaking-intrinsically-satisfying-problems-and-what-is-routine-grunt-work-a-1X-engineer-could-handle

Now what is interest rate? It is some thing charged against the chance that you might go bankrupt. Say you go to a bank for loan, and Bill Gates go to a bank for a loan, Bill Gates would be charged lesser interest, as there is a lesser chance that he might not repay the loan.But, if you believe that the bank is charging you too much interest, given your credit-worthiness, and you believe that the public has more confidence on your credit worthiness, it might be preferable for you to take money directly from the public at an interest rate lower than what the bank would charge you. The public will also be happy, as they get an interest rate more than what they would earn from a Fixed Deposit in a bank. It might be crucial to note that, you/your firm is generally less credit worthy than the bank. But to compensate for that, you pay the public more interest than what the bank would pay for a FD. This form of raising money is known as raising money though ""Bonds"". You/your firm isAnother form of raising money from the public is, advertising the public to become partners in your business. They put in a capital amount up front, become a partner, and enjoy the profits and loss of the firm. In contrast to bonds, here you haveNow the role of an investment bank (IB) is to help a firm raise capital through the above two ways predominantly, apart from other lesser known but more complicated ways.The job of an investment banker, starts from identifying a firm, that would potentially need capital/be able to raise capital at a cost lesser than what a private bank would charge them, and suggest the firm to raise capital from public, showing them that it would be more advantageous. Once the firm sees merit in the idea, the investment bank, targets/decides the right time, right opportunity, right currency/exchange to issue the bonds/equities in. It is also the IB's duty to draft the legal documents for the bond/equity issuance.Following this, the IB starts to identify potential investors who would lend capital to the firm that is raising the money. If it is a bond issuance, the IB convinces the investor that the chance of the firm going bankrupt is very small, and hence the investor will receive the principal and an interest greater than what an FD will give him. If it is an equity issuance, the IB convinces the investor that the profits (and hence the returns) are going to be very high, and raise capital for the original firm in question.The IB gets a fee for this service provided. Added to that, most of the times, the IB itself becomes one of the investors and buys some bonds/equity that is issued.Another important role of IBs is to handle mergers and acquisition. For example, Amazon is a very big online shopping platform in many countries. In India, however, Flipkart has a larger market share, and Amazon has difficulty establishing itself in India. So, Amazon would try to acquire a smaller firm in India, like Jabong - an online apparel shopping centre. (It indeed is trying to acquire Jabong). So, Amazon straight away has all the infrastructure that Jabong has already set in place, and can establish a hold in at least one sector of online shopping - apparels. Similarly mergers can occur, when two large firms, merge to form a single unit and hence have enhanced performance, compared to what could be achieved by competing. It is the role of an IB to identify that Amazon is trying to establish itself in India, and hence looking for an acquisition. IBs suggest amazon that an acquisition will be profitable for them, and identifies the smaller firm, that can be acquired. Then, there will be a large transfer of the shares of the smaller firm to the larger firm - Amazon. Again, IBs get a fee for getting this merger/acquisition done.To be an investment banker, one needs to have skills to understand financial statements, identify opportunities for raising capital, mergers, acquisition etc. Truly, this can be developed by closely observing the performance of various firms in a sector. Added to that, ability to talk to, explain and convince a firm to raise capital, do a merger or  an acquisition etc., will be a very useful addition.There is also a so called ""Markets"" division for most of the IBs, which trade on ""secondary markets"". Secondary markets are places, where you can choose to sell the bond or an equity to  third person, if you no longer want to hold it, or you can buy it from a person holding it, if you had missed the opportunity to buy it, when it was originally issued. The price at which the bonds/shares are traded in the secondary market is directly related to the firm's performance. Say for example, Mr. A lent $100 to your firm in the form of buying a bond. Now, say the agreement had been made on day 1, that you would pay 5% interest every year. Now, if your credit worthiness increases, Mr. A would be reluctant to sell the bond which had a value of $100 originally. However if Mr. B offers $110 to Mr. A, for the bond which originally had a value of $100 (Strictly speaking, face value of $100), then Mr. A would sell it to Mr. B. The same thing can happen other way as well. Say your firm lost some credit worthiness, and Mr. A has to get rid of the bond, he would be ready to sell it to Mr. B at just $90 perhaps. So here IBs, continuously monitor the performance of every firm which has issued a bond or equity, and hence calculate the ""fair value"" of a bond or a share. It might be easy for you to connect, if I say, it is this value in the secondary market for a firm's equity, that you see quoted as a firm's share price.",783 followers,Sriram Sankaranarayanan,836,0,0,2015,https://www.quora.com/Who-are-the-top-technology-futurists

They care a whole lot.Want to know what theyNow, MBA hiring is a little different from hiring undergraduates. At the undergraduate level, the top recruiting prospects don’t necessarily all attend the most highly ranked schools. Partly this is because some high achieving students have to choose their school based on financial considerations; partly it’s because the data on which college admissions offices make decisions is very different from how employers look at a candidate.At the MBA level, things are a little different. By and large, the candidates with the best test scores, best undergraduate records, and best early career professional achievements (in other words, the candidates top investment banks want to recruit) get admitted to the top MBA programs. Combine that with the fact that investment banks’ hiring appetite at the MBA level is a fraction of what it is at the undergraduate level, and you’ll gather that there’s relatively little motivation to look for MBAs outside the top 10–15 programs.So if you’re thinking about pursuing an MBA for purposes of getting into investment banking, think carefully about what sort of school you’re going to be able to get into before committing.",30 followers,Robin Thomas,8.1K,731,13.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Who-are-the-top-technology-futurists

But guess what, if you don’t like it, do something else! And furthermore, I now own a business I bought that was a former client and my typical week is more like 18–20 hours a day 6 days a week with half a day on Sunday. I sleep 4–5 hours a night and can’t wait to go to work in my home office. But you must love it, then it’s not work at all. What’s the reward? My balance sheet is the reward.
