But sadly percentile made him lose. I also want to add something that NTA only came into existense because Education Minister wanted to make money by taking huge government revenues.

Also, I realise that the thing I lacked during my preparation wasAh, so I gave my exam onI find Physics a bit difficult, chemistry was also tough as I left organic and ignored NCERT. I think maths is the subject, where I scored the highest (comparitively) and I left some very easy questions, due to unkown reasons. I started my paper with Physics, then jumped to chemistry, then back to Physics, then I started Maths and then finished rest of chemistry.I attempted 46 questions in all,My result btw:I don't think this is enough to even clear the cut-off. Last year I scored 84.6 percentile in January and 74 percentile in April ( I went there with no seriousness).Wish me luck.Any kind of suggestion is welcome❤️Edit 1:Warning:Edit 2 (12 Sept 2020):I tried hard but lockdown had its impact on my studies and I find myself guilty for wasting this opportunity. I tried and scored around 110, but due to bad normalisation, I scored even less than last time (when I scored 71) , so, I didn't even clear my cut-off. I scored 87.7 this time.One reason behind this may be reduced number of students, because I was ahead of 87.7% of students out of 635k that appeared this time, which means around 78k rank, but after combining it with January, January score dominanted and I secured 128k rank.I won't get anything with that, I know (General student here).Just hope that I find some decent college through UPSEE, else I will be out of options, I have no idea what will happen now.I just know that it'll all be over by next month, things will get finalized anyway.Thanks for reading, I am open to any kind of suggestion.",341 followers,Anshul Nigam,1.7K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-percentile-should-a-student-get-in-the-JEE-Mains-to-be-admitted-to-computer-science-or-EC-program-in-any-top-IIIT-Indian-Institute-of-Information-Technology

Our team at Grammarly has compiled a handy list of common grammatical errors to help make your writing accurate, clear, and professional.Ambiguous (“Squinting”) modifiersA squinting modifier is a misplaced modifier that, because of its location in a sentence, could modify either the phrase that precedes it or the one that follows it. In the example sentence, is the subject listening to music slowly or slowly getting a headache? To correct a squinting modifier, move its position in the sentence to clarify to the reader which word you intend to modify.Misuse of lie/layIf you plan to place or put an object somewhere, such as a plate on a table, you should use “lay.” If you intend to stretch out on a bed for a nap, you should use “lie.” The verb “lie” is an intransitive verb, which means it does not need an object. The transitive verb “lay” requires an object.It may take some getting used to this “lay” or “lie” business; after all, misuse of these verbs is common. But if you remember to lay down your fork before you’re full, then you won’t have to lie down later from overeating.Comma splicesHe was very hungry, so he ate a whole pizza.To splice means to connect or join. When a writer joins two independent sentences with a comma instead of separating them with a period or coordinating conjunction, that’s a comma splice.The comma has its jobs to do, but connecting two independent sentences isn’t one of them. Besides, the period gets testy when his sister, the comma, steals his thunder. Periods have their jobs, and so do commas, but never the twain shall meet—unless it’s in the form of a semicolon. Semicolons can also take the place of a coordinating conjunction, such as “and,” “but,” or “so,” among others.Run-on sentencesRun-on sentences, also known as fused sentences, occur when two complete sentences are squashed together without using a coordinating conjunction or proper punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon. Run-on sentences can be short or long. A long sentence isn’t necessarily a run-on sentence.To avoid run-on sentences, see if there is more than one idea communicated by two or more independent clauses. In our examples, there are two complete sentences:Example:Example:Both sentences are complete ideas by themselves; therefore, use a semicolon or a period to indicate that they are separate independent clauses.Using “could of” instead of “could have”“Could have” is always correct; “could of” never is. Writers probably make this grammar gaffe because, when we speak, the contraction “could’ve” sounds an awful lot like “could of.”TautologiesTautologies express the same thing twice with different words. In our example, the word “made” implies that Jack used his own two hands to create the pail. The prepositional phrase “with his own hands” creates a redundancy. Once you know what they are, it’s fun to discover tautologies: dilapidated ruins, close proximity, added bonus, large crowd...The list goes on and on!After reading through this list of common grammatical mistakes, you might be wondering how to remember all these rules as you write.

First, I was legitimately struck during my visit by how friendly and supportive everybody was.  I did not have a pleasant experience in high school, and Haverford seemed like it would be a place where good people help each other.  Now, Haverford still exists in the real world, and not everybody is just lovely to be around all the time, but I did find, by and large, that my initial impression was accurate.  The freshman hall experience (called Customs) is intense enough that you're basically handed 8-16 friends straight off the bat, and very few people go through their freshman year alone, especially in contrast to other colleges.  As a personal contrast, I went to NYU for law school, and I was struck by how socially acceptable it was there to be an asshole.  It wasn't considered a positive attribute, but it also wasn't socially damning.  At Haverford, assholes are unpopular.  (And excuse my language.)The second reason I went is that Haverford is small enough (roughly 1100 students when I went, and I think it's similar now) that you really feel like you know everyone.  I recall on my visit seeing some dude barreling around a corner and running into someone.  After he helped her pick up her stuff, he started talking to her about something that, even from out of earshot, was obviously unrelated to what he just did.  I thought about it and realized that I would love to go to a college where you would have something you want to talk about with someone you literally run into.  This cuts both ways -- it's a lot more intimidating to make a move on your crush when you know, win, lose or draw, that everyone will find out by Monday -- but by senior year (actually, by sophomore year) you really know who your friends are in your class, and you have a bond with everyone that I don't think happens at every college.As a side note, I did pretty well in school and expected to be one of the smarter people at Haverford.  I was wrong.  The academics there are strong, sure, but I just loved being around really smart people all the time.So those are the differences that made me go there.  By the time I left, I liked to say that Haverford was a place for turning dorks into actual adults.  Now, there are some popular-kid types at Haverford (and they're lovely), but I found that almost everyone there had some level of being both friendly and nerdy, however easily they might mask it with good looks, athletic accomplishment, or what have you.  And some people (here's where I came in) showed up at Haverford being, again, friendly and nerdy, but not necessarily the most socially adept.  And something about being in a positive environment of like-minded people helps a lot of Haverford students come out of their shell, become more confident, and leave as a (mostly) fully functioning adult.  Put more obnoxiously, there are colleges out there that are women-only (like our twin school Bryn Mawr) where, presumably, women go to gain confidence and leadership skills in a supportive environment.  Plenty of HBCUs out there do the same for African-Americans.  Honestly, I think Haverford is like that for nerds.  I'm really glad I went there.","21,936 followers",Vidhi Khandel,20K,182,11.1M,2012,https://www.quora.com/What-percentile-should-a-student-get-in-the-JEE-Mains-to-be-admitted-to-computer-science-or-EC-program-in-any-top-IIIT-Indian-Institute-of-Information-Technology
