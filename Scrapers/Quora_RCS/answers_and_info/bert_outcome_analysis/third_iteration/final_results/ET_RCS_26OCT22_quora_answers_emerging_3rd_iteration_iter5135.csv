For one, they're not as private as they could be, and privacy is something really useful on phones. Another thing is that they can get lost, stolen, scuffed up, dirty, greasy, damaged, really anything bad. With touchscreens, if you crack the screen, it's not going to be good.Would a commercial DNI be a silver bullet? No, it wouldn't.

Some large, some small, some thick, some thin. Some folded, some had folding parts. Batteries were changeable without an advanced quantum physics degree and a 4000 piece tool kit.I've owned close to 50 different phones since the early 2000s, and my favourite of them all is a phone I still use today, my ruby Siemens SL55 slide phone.It's tiny, and I have the rare branded leather belt pouch for it too. Why do I like it so much? Because when I purchased it, I wanted a phone I could make and receive telephone calls with. This little beauty has never failed on that front.Then Apple invented the IPhone. Since then, with few exceptions, all phones have been boring rectangles. I'll concede they are extremely feature packed boring rectangles, but boring rectangles they still are.Don't get me wrong, most of the phones I own are boring rectangles. I've got phones with 5000mah batteries, when that was something to brag about. I've got phones with night vision cameras, because why not?...",36 followers,Adam Ambrozy,579,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-future-technology-could-replace-cell-phones
2,"World has not yet been introduced with GENERAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. We only have automatic machine guns and person detecting engines. Although we use them on the borders of Pakistan in the Arid and the forest regions, we can't use them to replace people.  Remember that the other side of SIACHEN is in Pakistan. If we pull out troops from there, even a minor intrusion of Pakistan can destroy those Tech stuff and they will claim the Glacier in no time.That is exactly why pulling out troops with replaced technology is a bad option. There are two options remaining.1) A Diplomatic pull out by PAWorld has not yet been introduced with GENERAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. We only have automatic machine guns and person detecting engines.

If we pull out troops from there, even a minor intrusion of Pakistan can destroy those Tech stuff and they will claim the Glacier in no time.That is exactly why pulling out troops with replaced technology is a bad option. There are two options remaining.1) A Diplomatic pull out by PAK and INDIA :The idea of declaring the Siachen region a ""Peace Park"" was presented by environmentalists and peace activists in part to preserve the ecosystem of the region badly affected by the military presence.In September 2003, the governments of India and Pakistan were urged by the participants of 5th World Parks Congress held at Durban, to establish a peace park in the Siachen region to restore the natural biological system and protect species whose lives are at risk.2) Technology advancement by IndiaI Doubt option 1 will ever be possible because even if we believe Pakistani Government, it can always send its proactive millitants and claim the territory just like the Kargil. Which will eventually lead to a war / destruction of natural heritage.DRDO is heavily committed for the second option and has been developing advanced technology for our troops at high altitude. There are lots and lots of things for the Indian Army which are being developed by DRDO and they're all around the media. These links will surely help your thought process.DRDO-FICCI Initiative on Accelerated Technology assessment and Commercialization (ATAC)DRDO to help soldiers put best foot forward at Siachen - Times of IndiaDefence Institute of High Altitude Research (DIHAR)- Dihar- DRDO*One more thing:DRDO is an Indian Establishment. Its a part and parcel of the Indian Democracy. I don't understand why a negative image is being inducted on to DRDO but it has done what it can to the country. It works very hard to meet the requirements of Terrestrial , Water and Air forces and also helps us tactically and strategically. A Lot of Responsibility is held on DRDO and it meets the needs.It feels the tragedy of deaths same as we do and that is the sole motivation of DRDO unlike the majority of *intelligent Indians who go to USA for their studies and work. You can't critize India if you didn't contribute to it.","5,091 followers",Maj Shirish Patil,11K,666,3.9M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-future-technology-could-replace-cell-phones

Special clothing: This includes warm clothing, jackets, sleeping bag, mattress, rucksack, socks, shoes, goggles, gloves etc. These are mostly imported, high quality material to protect you from the cold.2. Safety Equipment: every person inducted into the glacier gets a lot of equipment, individually, and collectively. They get crampons, ice axe, slings, carabiner, etc individually. Collectively, additional equipment like climbing ropes, harnesses, avalanche rescue kits, medical equipment like oxygen tanks, rescue stretchers and so on.3. Special equipment: the troops also get a lot of other special equipment like radio sets and communication equipment, heaters and Bukhari, ski, etc.4. Special Vehicles: special vehicles like ATV, snow scooters, etc are deployed in many areas.5. Additional Weapons: certain additional weapons are placed in the areas.6. Special rations: the extreme climate makes survival difficult. Body needs a lot of extra calories, and hence a lot of extra rations are given which include high calorie foods like chocolates.7. Special Shelters: special Igloo shaped fiber glass hut, with insulation are given to troops, to keep themselves warm, when they are indoor. However, for duty they must brave the extreme cold. At some posts, the FGH cannot be set up, and the troops do live in caves, or other temporary structures.8. Special training: last but not the leastâ€¦ every single person, irrespective of rank and status, must undergo the special training given at SBS (Siachen Battle School). They must also pass the tests, during and at the end of training before they are inducted, provided they are found medically fit. Those who don't clear the tests are put through the training again. Trust me, nobody wants to go through the grueling three weeks (without any Sunday or holiday) again, and they do everything in their power to pass the test the first time.They do get Siachen allowance also, but a few other answers give a comparison of allowances with other services like IAS.The hazardsInspite of all the extra equipment, facilities; there are still casualties, troops still die, or fall sick, fighting against the odds, few with amputed limbs. You must have heard the news about our troops buried in an avalanche in Nov 2019.There are are various hazards and challenges of operating in such areas.Weather:* High Altitude diseases: troops may suffer from HAPO, HACO, and if care isnâ€™t taken, it can be lethal.* Sun burns: Due to the rarefied atmosphere, the UV rays are very harsh, and can easily cause skin to burn, over a period of time.* Impact on health: Due to lack of oxygen, the blood thickens, and may clot at ce...",856 followers,Kaushlesh Tiwari,12.2K,284,2.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Has-DRDO-committed-to-develop-specific-technologies-for-replacing-army-troops-at-Siachen-where-an-estimated-869-troops-have-died-since-1984
5,"For a soldier posted in Siachen or other snow bound areas, keeping his feet warm is a privilege indeed.

A unit under the DRDO, the lab has begun the process of getting a patent for what it calls a 'flameless portable heat solution'.The Naval Materials Research Laboratory has tweaked a food heating powder, developed by it earlier, into a foot warming solution. DRDO already has a patent for the food heater, which has aluminium, iron and magnesium as basic ingredients.A pouch in a specialized foil coupled with water can automatically heat ready-to-eat food, taking the temperature up to 80 degrees. By adding a few more chemicals, including some day-to-day materials, the temperature can be kept within limits tolerable to the human body.""All one has to do is tuck the pack in the shoe along with some water or maybe a piece of ice, and the temperature goes up to 30 to 36 degrees, which is tolerable enough in such weather,"" said DRDO officials presenting it during the expo at VNIT.","66,693 followers",Dima Vorobiev,690,4.2K,139M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Has-DRDO-committed-to-develop-specific-technologies-for-replacing-army-troops-at-Siachen-where-an-estimated-869-troops-have-died-since-1984

We already have them. There are batteries that charge through magnetic induction (e.g. Qi charging in smartphones) and batteries that charge through electromagnetic means (e.g. solar cells in calculators). Electric current is a flow of charged particles. It does not necessarily have to be electrons; it can be positively charged ions. Fiberoptic cable transmission which is electromagnetic (not based on electric current) is available but it still can't match electric current in terms of the amount of energy delivered per unit time ( power) so this is still utilized primarily as a means of transmitting information.,"7,828 followers",Joe McCracken,1.9K,765,12.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-future-technology-could-replace-cell-phones
9,"If you're asking if moving electrons are the only way to transport energy, the answer is that there are alternatives such as steam, coal, compressed air, natural gas, etc.Although electrons are the obvious choice for conveying electricity, anything carrying a charge (ionized atom) could do the trick if properly controlled.Electromagnetic fields can also convey energy through induction instead of through wires, but wires are simpler, carry higher currents, go longer distances.",31 followers,Rick Fleming,1.7K,517,535.9K,2021,https://www.quora.com/Has-DRDO-committed-to-develop-specific-technologies-for-replacing-army-troops-at-Siachen-where-an-estimated-869-troops-have-died-since-1984
