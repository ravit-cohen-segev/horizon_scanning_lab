2,"The internal combustion engine hands down. It makes the application of all the rest, ok most of the rest possible. It laid off lots of horses, mules and farm hands who were free to move to the cities and fuel the industrial revolution, fill the high rise offices and think tanks as well as the suburbs, condos and have disposable income that moved us into and now perhaps through the era of the great society.

4,"Well, by American farmer, we are talking anything after 1776. Some big ones were the iron plow, McCormick Reaper, barbed wire, the tractor. However, irrigators have been extremely important in turning unfarmable land into tillable. Not to mention solving massive crop failures from unpredictable droughts. We are beginning to see the problems associated with running out of water for irrigation, a big problem that looks to get worse with time.

What if we‚Äôre each just a brain in a jar with a USB port pushed into the brain stem to make us t2: The Ship of Theseus Paradox (Or Grandfather Ax)Suppose I took something, like my car, and replaced a broken part. Is it still my car? What if I replaced more parts? Or every single part? Is it still my car then? What if I took all my previously discarded parts and reassembled them, placing it next to this new car? Which one is ‚Äúmy car‚Äù? Also, what about people? My cells are replaced constantly. Am I the same person I was yesterday? Or five years ago?3: The Trolley ProblemSuppose there was a trolley out of control, on course to run over ten people. But I can pull a lever to redirect the trolley so that it runs over only4: The Prisoners DilemmaSo, suppose we have two prisoners who are refusing to cooperate, and we need to figure out which one‚Äôs guilty. We tell them both that if they rat the other out and the other keeps quiet, then the one who squeals gets off scot-free. However, if they both start pointing fingers, they both get an equal (and harsh) sentence. Likewise, if they both refuse to blame their partner in crime, they both get a light sentence. Now, while being cooperative seems like the most reasonable idea for both parties, both will inevitably weigh their options and elect to rat the other out, out of fear of taking the fall alone. This applies to the real world, too. (e.g, the arms race, expensive presidential campaigns, advertising, etc)5: The Experience MachineSo we generally think that things that gives us pleasure are good. But what if we‚Äôre put into a box, or plugged into a machine, that basically gave us perfect pleasure, 100%, perfectly optimized, 24/7 for the rest of our lives? Would that really be a good thing? Is there more to life than just feeling good about things?6: Moral RelativismIs there any one correct way to determine what is right and wrong in the world? It seems like every society and culture has its own ways of determining right and wrong. Granted, some of those ways are deemed pretty horrible in hindsight, but still. Is there any way to determine what this right or wrong might be? Where do we look to figure it out?7: Mary the Super-Scientist in the Black and White RoomSuppose you were Mary, a scientist who lived in a black and white room, who used a grey-scale computer and lab equipment to learn everything there ever could be learned about neurology and optics. You understood all the terminology of colors and how light interacted with the human eye. What would happen if you were released from your room into the real world to see the colors around you? Would you have ‚Äúlearned‚Äù anything new? Are there things that cannot be learned by mere passage of information, but must instead be experienced to understand?8: The Chinese Room Thought ExperimentWhile we‚Äôre on the subject of forcing people to live in rooms, imagine this: Suppose you lived in a room where, occasionally, sheets of paper with words in Mandarin Chinese printed on them would slip through a slot. You have a book that describes in perfect detail what Chinese words you should use to reply to the person on the other side of the slot, but your book doesn‚Äôt describe what the Chinese words9: Our Purpose in LifeWhy are we here? What are we meant to do with the time that we‚Äôre given? Are we meant to enjoy ourselves? To help other people? Or, is that just helping other people enjoy themselves? Is it nothing? Are we given no purpose at all? Is it to pass butter, perhaps? Can we ever truly find out?10: The Problem of Free WillSo atoms and molecules work in a predictable manner. If we got a strong enough computer, we could hypothetically predict with perfect accuracy all the behaviors of, say, an entire ocean. But could it really? But what about us? Human beings, after all, are made entirely from atoms and molecules. Are we predictable? Can all of our actions be predicted with perfect certainty, if we had enough computational power? Does that mean that all of our actions, down to the day we die, are set in stone? Is it even possible to predict with absolute certainty everything we do? Or, is there something more to it that prevents such computers from making these predictions?","358,974 followers",Sean Kernan,8.6K,5.6K,727M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-revolutionary-technological-invention-in-farming-from-the-last-two-hundred-years
10,"I will give two answers: the first on more solid historical ground, and the second more speculative.First answer: Civilization had to wait for the end of the ice age, which terminated about 15,000 years ago.

That allows others to becomes tradesmen, businessmen, and physics professors.Do not underestimate the rapidity of technical innovation during this period. It may seem slow, but that‚Äôs because today we take bronze and iron for granted. There were likely enormous advances in farming technology, but the wooden tools and plows used did not last for archeologists to study.The question says that ‚Äúadvanced technology‚Äù took place 500 years ago. With the rapid growth of technology, it mightSecond answer (much more speculative, perhaps even whimsical): The true advance of humans came from a human genetic mutation that took place about 3000 years ago. One of my names for it is ‚Äúthe dissatisfaction gene.‚Äù This was a gene that made people unsatisfied with their present situation. Animals never developed this; they search for environments that are good enough, and then they are satisfied. House cats are prototypical. But even elephants seem to be happy when they find a place with lots of grass and water.Not humans. Those who had this gene were never happy enough with what they had, and they pushed and developed and worked hard and created an ever expanding civilization.If you too are cursed with this gene (I think I am) then it is difficult to be happy, because no matter what you achieve, you want to do more. For that reason I sometimes refer to it as the ‚ÄúOriginal Sin Gene.‚Äù Like the original sin of Judaism and Christianity, it dooms humans to suffering. No matter how much life improves, we want it to be better.There is a solution that I personally try. I recognize that I must continue to strive to achieve more, and this is my burden. But I also can rise above it, and look at the world, and realize how blessed I am to live in such a wonderful place. Enjoy what we have, but never stop working to make it even better.","9,587 followers",Max Searle,2.1K,82,6.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-revolutionary-technology-invented-in-the-last-10-years-that-will-or-may-change-the-future-of-humanity-for-a-long-time
