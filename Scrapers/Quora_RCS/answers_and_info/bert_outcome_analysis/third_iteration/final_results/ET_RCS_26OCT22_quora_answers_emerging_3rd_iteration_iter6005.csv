But to know how to use knowledge is to have wisdom.” — Charles SpurgeonFirst off: it is great that you spent your free time reading online about those topics and amassed a bank of knowledge! It is great that you took the time to understanding the topic before just jumping in too hard too fast. I don’t think there is really any “wrong way” to get involved in an area, but I do believe that not doing preliminary res“Wisdom is the right use of knowledge. To know is not to be wise.

But to know how to use knowledge is to have wisdom.” — Charles SpurgeonFirst off: it is great that you spent your free time reading online about those topics and amassed a bank of knowledge! It is great that you took the time to understanding the topic before just jumping in too hard too fast. I don’t think there is really any “wrong way” to get involved in an area, but I do believe that not doing preliminary research in a field and just jumping in tends to have a higher failure rate. Whether or not you spent “too much time” is arguable. On one hand, you could have started gaining skills. On the other, you now have a valuable perspective that will help you in everything you do.With that said, the only way to “do” anything with that knowledge is to start working. You’re going to have to start small and work your way up. It’ll be frustrating at times, but it will also be exciting. As you go along, you will question your pace and say “How am I ever going to be able to do anything great if it takes this long to just learn how to do it”. However, you will also appreciate you far you have come, and marvel at your creations (often you may be the only one doing so because only you will have an understanding of how much work it took to get there).Some potential paths you can take from here (Note: these paths are not mutually exclusive; you can mix and match these as you wish):I’d encourage you to make a pros/cons list for each of these, and to research all of them thoroughly before jumping in. However, build a time line before you even do that. You have a history of spending a long time researching without taking action, so make sure this doesn’t turn into another example of that. Designate how long you are going to look into these for (I’d say probably 1–2 months TOTAL, AT MOST) and then start breaking down what you are going to do week-by-week to accomplish the goal of figuring out which to do. Then make another timeline for how you are going to accomplish your plan, and build it out week-by-week, sub-goal by sub-goal. I’ve found the easiest way to fail at something is to set a broad goal, and then just start working on it without planning how you are going to accomplish the goal.",6 followers,Samuel Lee,568,87,590.2K,2016,https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-stop-collecting-tons-of-meta-knowledge-about-computer-science-and-emerging-technologies-and-actually-start-DOING-these-things
1,"First, I was luckily able to get offers from many companies, including Google, Amazon, etc.I applied to more than 500 internship positions and heard back and got an interview for around 30 of those 500. The interview processes for most companies were very similar so I will talk about the overlapping interview process step by step. I did not get any referrals, and did not reach out to any recruiter.

I applied to 500 companies on their website.Recruitment Cycles--I recommend applying on websites as much as possible in August and sending out emails to recruiters that you have contact with. This gives you a headstart in the interview process, and if you have expiring return offers from previous internships, you must act fast and interview fast with other companies before it expires. --Here was the interview process for most companies, and if you have questions about specifics, I can try to answer those in the comments.Application PlatformsInternship Interview ProcessMy PreparationAdviceIf you have a question about a specific company, leave a comment down below!Good luck everyone and enjoy the upcoming Holidays!","9,064 followers",Allan Steinhardt,655,2.3K,5.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-stop-collecting-tons-of-meta-knowledge-about-computer-science-and-emerging-technologies-and-actually-start-DOING-these-things
2,"That's a good question.First let's look at what some people would list that I don't think will change our lives that much.Battery electric cars will have made big inroads in personal transportation but that isn't really one that is going to have a big impact on how we live our lives. It's still a car and does car things.I don't see self-driving cars being important enough in 10 years to have changed our lives much.I think there are two potential areas that relatively new technology will change our lives.One we may be having more and more remote working situations.

It's still a car and does car things.I don't see self-driving cars being important enough in 10 years to have changed our lives much.I think there are two potential areas that relatively new technology will change our lives.One we may be having more and more remote working situations. This very well could change how we live. Right now if you want an engineering job, publishing job or big law job you have to live in an expensive urban area. If you could cut that down to having to go to your office once a week I see two different things happening at once. People can start living farther away which might reduce the cost of living in the heart of a city but it will increase the cost of living farther away and cause smaller areas to have to provide more services to people staying home.The other change I see is automation of low-level low experience jobs. For example right now self-checkouts and online ordering is cutting into the number of cashiers that are being employed. Other than answering questions, much of what happens in a store for example can be automated. The first thing is this eliminates one path for teens to start into the workforce. This automation likely makes it harder for the small business to complete in some ways.","246,856 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-stop-collecting-tons-of-meta-knowledge-about-computer-science-and-emerging-technologies-and-actually-start-DOING-these-things
3,"They’ll shift to electric too. If there is one thing that electric cars totally dominate gasoline car at - it’s acceleration and top speed.Since those super-cars are sold largely on their 0–60, 1/4 mile, 0–100–0 and top speed - they’ll never again be able to claim superiority in the face of just a regular family saloon car.Sure, style and attention to detail count for something - but when your multi-million dollar super-car is outmatched on that scale - these companies have to move with the times.And they will…it’s just a matter of time.But it’s probably not going to be 50 years.

An enormous number of countries, individual US States and some individual cities have said that it’ll be illegal to sell a gasoline powered car after 2035 (or so). In Norway, that date is 2025…so it’s going to be illegal to sell a gasoline Lambo or Ferrari in Norway just four years from now!As this date becomes more widely accepted, all gasoline car companies are going to have to face the fact that either they’ll become electric car companies - or they will simply cease to exist.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-stop-collecting-tons-of-meta-knowledge-about-computer-science-and-emerging-technologies-and-actually-start-DOING-these-things
