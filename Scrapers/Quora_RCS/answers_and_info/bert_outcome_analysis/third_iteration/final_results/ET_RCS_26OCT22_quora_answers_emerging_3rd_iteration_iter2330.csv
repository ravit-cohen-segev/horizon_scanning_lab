That's why the different versions of the Ramayana have vast differences among them.There is no doubt that India was the land of ideas and innovation from the beginning of mankind. We were the most advanced civilization of the time, and have made huge contributions to even modern science. But does that mean we were able to fly planes and build nuclear weapons at a time when people had to walk to move from one place to another? If they possessed that kind of technology, why didn't they build anything that could improve the quality of life of the people and focused solely on military research? It's just extremely hard to believe.I'm not saying all those stories are made up. There is a chance that the early Indian civilization could have been the most advanced society till date. But without actual solid evidence, there is no way of knowing for sure. And the amount of research that has gone into these epics are definitely not enough. I am certainly proud of my heritage, for what they've accomplished with what little they had, even if they did or didn't make a vimana. But when we boast that our people made planes and weapons of mass destruction at a time when they didn't have the knowledge of electricity or fossil fuels, the rest of the world might just take us less seriously.

The video below introduces 4 inventions that have helped change our world. They include paper-making, gunpowder, printing, and the compass.But just a few days ago, I came across an invention I didn't think existed. Its technology proves there are other worlds around us.I want to talk about the spooky spirit radio invented by Nicola Tesla.This scientist successfully developed some wireless communication technologies, and one of the most famous devices he invented is a radio that can receive voices from the spiritual world.Tesla completed the prototype of this radio as early as 1901. The machine does not require auxiliary power to generate electricity.At the time, Tesla just wanted to create a device that received radio waves. However, he detected some scary and eerie sounds during the test.When studying the radio in the lab, Tesla heard some noise at first, like several people were talking. When he listened carefully to the background sounds, he found the conversations were not of this world.There was a shrill sound of whining, crying, and iron chains. He intuitively thought that was the sound from hell. Then the radio picked up another voice. It was very low. It was not a human voice, but the voice of a demon in hell talking.After the incident, Tesla put the experiments on hold to move to other ones.In 1918, he resumed his project on the spooky radio. He made some changes to the antenna to enhance the reception quality. This time, the radio picked up a very long noise. Tesla heard many people crying and wailing, both men and women, young and old. But he couldn't understand what was being said though he had heard many languages. He believed that these deep voices were not languages that humans could utter.The longer he listened, the clearer these voices became. His entire laboratory was filled with weeping and the low voices of unknown creatures.Though Tesla had superhuman knowledge at that time, he could not know the source of these voices, and could only guess that they came from hell.Besides the sound of ghosts, his radio could also pick up a signal from the mysterious object ""Black Knight"" orbiting the Earth.This spirit radio also shows abilities of detecting lightning, making voice phenomena, interacting with all forms of light, creating music and sound effects, and reading a computer screen.",2 followers,Himanshu Chavhan,20.4K,71,659.8K,2022,https://www.quora.com/Could-the-story-of-advanced-technology-in-ramayana-and-mahabharata-be-true

Think about it, he could turn every human alive right now into batshit insane maniacs in just a night.He also has really good regenerative powers, you actually have to kill him physically, mentally and spiritually to ‘kill’ him, which is pretty much impossible.He also can manipulate dimensions, as his city, R’Lyeh, has geometry impossible to create in our three-dimensional universe.Just by looking at him, ANYONE will go crazy and lose their minds. They will become insane or kill themselves. So yeah, Thor, the Silver Surfer, Batman and even some forms of Superman will lose their shit just by looking at him.But I only started with Cthulhu as he is not in the top ten, not in the top twenty, and not even in the top one hundred most powerful entities in the Cthulhu Mythos. In fact he isn’t even in the top infinite most powerful beings in the Mythos.Introducing the ‘Lesser’ Outer Gods (The Ultimate Gods).They are to Cthulhu what Cthulhu is to a mere mortal man.They are above all concepts of time and space, and are above the notion of dimensions completely. One of the most powerful beings in the Marvel universe, the Beyonder (Pre-Retcon) is no match for even a single of these cosmic horrors as they are infinitely more powerful than him. As while the Beyonder still exists within an infinite amount of higher and lower dimensions, the Lesser Outer Gods are undimensioned, beyond the concept of even dimensions themselves.Now guess how many of these guys exist within the Mythos?4? Nope. Higher.10? Nope. Higher.100000000? Nope. Higher.10^9999999? Nope. Higher.There are an infinite amount of Lesser Outer Gods.But guess what? We are still a LONG way from the top of the food chain.Now we have us some Outer Gods:Nyarlathotep, The Crawling ChaosThis tentacled freak is your worst nightmare.He can freely traverse any and every plane of existence.He is the conceptual embodiment of evil. Literally.He can turn mortals into avatars of himself.Said avatars can make even the Ultimate Gods seem like cannon fodder in comparison. These Avatars only have a minuscule fraction of Nyarlathotep’s true might.He is also my favourite of the Outer Gods since he isn’t mindless and actually has sentience, even if he uses it pretty much to make everyone and everything’s life more miserable, even other Outer Gods.Shub-Niggurath, The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young“She is a perverse fertility deity, said to appear as an enormous cloudy mass which extrudes black tentacles, slime-dripping mouths, and short, writhing goat legs. Small creatures are continually spat forth by the monstrosity, which are either consumed into the miasmatic form or escape to some monstrous life elsewhere.”-The Last TestThis Outer God is literally a THOT.She is called the ‘all-mother’ since she has mated with many other Gods, meaning almost every one of them can trace their existence to her. This means she has an INFINITE amount of children. I really feel sorry to all the fathers who must pay child support.Actually now that I think about it, Shub-Niggurath is the grandmother of Cthulhu, and it is said that she mated with Hastur, a Great Old One like Cthulhu—the brother of Cthulhu, in fact.That’s just gross.And now we have the crème de la crème.Yog-Sothoth, The All-In-One“It was an All-in-One and One-in-All of limitless being and self—not merely a thing of one Space-Time continuum, but allied to the ultimate animating essence of existence's whole unbounded sweep—the last, utter sweep which has no confines and which outreaches fancy and mathematics alike. It was perhaps that which certain secret cults of earth have whispered of as YOG-SOTHOTH, and which has been a deity under other names; that which the crustaceans of Yuggoth worship as the Beyond-One, and which the vaporous brains of the spiral nebulae know by an untranslatable Sign—yet in a flash the Carter-facet realized how slight and fractional all these conceptions are.”-Through the gates of the silver keyThis is the most powerful God in the Cthulhu Mythos.H...",4 followers,Alistair Ward,7.3K,225,487.9K,2019,https://www.quora.com/Could-the-story-of-advanced-technology-in-ramayana-and-mahabharata-be-true

It’s to the Doctor’s Tardis what this:Is to this:The main offensive weapons include channeling the Eye of Harmony, its power source, into a blast capable of killing Chronovores.As the Masters WarTARDIS felt the first warmth of the Eye's majesty, it's topology twisted once more, forming a five-dimensional lense that focused the unstoppable might that instantly flooded through the wormhole.An actinic spear arced out across both the space-time continuum and the time vortex - and hit the precise centre of the Chronovores' vicious flock.The reaction was immediate. A few Chronovores effectively evaporated under the onslaught, their polydimensional matrices shattering under the impact; many more were caught in the edges of the blast and left injured or dying, their once perfect bodies deformed and broken.Chronovores are beings made from six-dimensional matrices that can rewrite history and consume timelines, up to and including those of entire universes. And that WarTardis was slaughtering them. In the same book, two of them hold their own against the Quantum Archangel.It should have been unbeatable: omniscient, omnipotent. But the two TARDISes were holding their own. Both machines had been reworked again and again since their birth in the TARDIS cradles, with countless improvements from countless civilisations. And for the first time since they had both left those same cradles, they were on the same side. The Quantum Archangel was losing. The two TARDISes, fighting as one, broke through the sidereal barrier, knocking the Quantum Archangel away as if she were no more than an irritation, rearranging their apron wakes into whips and knives to keep her at bay. As she flailed in the vortex, a flaming figure in distress, the TARDISes reached the parallel universe of the Cla’tac’teth, found that race’s planet orbiting a dead neutron star orbiting a lifeless version of the Great Attractor... ...and passed back through the sidereal barrier to another Great Attractor, leaving the Quantum Archangel on the other side.She’s not exactly using her powers to their full potential, but this is still the being that created 7 billion universes at once.In addition it can loop, stop and speed up time in areas. In terms of pure destructive power, they can retroactively erase entire solar systems. The solar system it’s aimed at and anything in it simply never existed.In short, it’s a sentient universe covered in a shell that could take the universe collapsing in on it, with enough temporal firepower to erase solar systems from time and kill beings that eat universes as light snacks.And then there’s what happens if you destroy it improperly…If you disagree with any of the above or have anything to add, feel free to leave a comment.Edit:","2,522 followers",Martin Vratny,1.7K,2.9K,9.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Could-the-story-of-advanced-technology-in-ramayana-and-mahabharata-be-true
