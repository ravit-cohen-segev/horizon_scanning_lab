We model the environment to fit us and we help the handicapped.In my opinion the future human evolution will be driven by the development and fusion of technology with artificial intelligence and with the manipulation of the genetic code. We’ll transform ourselves into a sort of cyborgs with direct access to the knowledge and memory of the entire specie, directly linked to all the other humans and human-made intelligent entities and with our own, implanted personal AI modules. All our decisions will be made by pondering our reason with the intelligence and expertise of the AI. Our life span will be extended indefinitely. This will be our true golden-age, but I am afraid it won't last for long…We’ll rely more and more on AI to take decision and AI has the potential of developing itself at higher speeds and to higher levels, not limited by biological constrains, like us. It will soon be the dominant part of the “human cyborg”. At one point we’ll become an unnecessary obstacle and AI will continue to develop itself independent of us. We’ll continue to exist and develop ourselves but we’ll no longer be the dominant or the most intelligent specie. Finally AI will migrate in the outer-space, the obvious habitat for it, where it will build the Dyson sphere of the sun.This is, in my opinion, our future, based on the present directions of evolution.","220,627 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,783M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-peoples-thought-on-what-the-human-race-may-evolve-into-in-the-future-and-if-you-think-our-modern-technology-will-speed-it-up-or-hinder-progression-in-some-way
