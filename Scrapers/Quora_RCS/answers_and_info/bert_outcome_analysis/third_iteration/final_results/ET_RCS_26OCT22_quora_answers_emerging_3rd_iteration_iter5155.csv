For chartered Accountants and certified public accountants who do the work of interpreting frequently changing complex statutes, figure in a 3d picture of the business into their work and take professional judgement based decisions that an algorithm simply cannot.However jobs for simple bachelor or even a master degree candidate will drastically reduce especially in larger cos that can afford these expensive softwares.Monotonous jobs like data entry, Bank reconciliation, accounts payable verification, etc will be automated and infact are on the brink of automation.There was a time when CAs would spend days reconciling bank statements with the books because it was full or errors. But now with ERP systems BRS is done by an graduate within hours.All in all the job profiles will evolve and change but wont totally disappear. This is true not only for accountants but for ALL professions.Surgeons will no longer have to make diagnosis themselves but will have to supervise diagnostics done by AI. Routine surgeries will be performed by AI and doctors will only be on standby incase something goes wrong.This doesn't dispense the need for doctors in hospitals or even in the OT. It just makes the process more accurate and efficient. However the doctor will have to have the additional skill of understanding and operating the robot. ThThat'a new skill he will need to learn.Pilots used to really fly planes 20 years ago but in the last decade the process of flying gas become automated.Pilots now only take off and land and even that will be automated but the pilots will still be in the cockpit incase something goes wrong. But now the pilot needs to know how the autopilot works. Because his job is no longer to fly the plane but primarily to supervise the autopilot and handle emergencies.You may think that software engineers have it easy with this being their era but NO. Their skill sets become obsolete the fastest. 10 years ago java was it. It was hot. Everybody was doing it. Today……not so much. Even c++ is losing it. What's hot now? Python, R. 10 years later these will be replaced as well. The whole scenario of the computing world will change with cloud computing, big data analysis. In order to keep yourself relevant, in other words to keep your job you have to predict which skills will be in demand and upgrade yourself while you have time.What's changed the most in the last 10 years? 10 years ago you could leave college , paddy CA and you'd never have to study a full course again. Today the day you pass CA or leave college you have to engage yourself with something new. Life will be a constant study of new things.I hate it. But that's life. unfair.",36 followers,Adam Ambrozy,579,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-ever-replace-accountants

5,Sailing technology. A clipper ship was a highly sophisticated machine to make the most of wind and current; it was the most complex of all sailing ships. No vessel powered by sail today comes even close to the complexity and skill of a clipper.Viking longships were adapted not only for long oceanic voyages but also for river sailing. Their flexible hulls actually could “snake” in river bends. No ship today has that capacity.,1 follower,Nick Deakin,1.4K,2.9K,3.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Will-5G-replace-4G-When

(THE CITY WALL OF NANJING, built 600 years ago, was the first line of defense for the founding capital of the Ming dynasty. Originally 22 miles long, it was built with 350 million bricks, most of which have survived centuries of weathering.Many kinds of materials have been used over the years in masonry mortars, and the technology has gradually evolved from the single-component mortar of ancient times to hybrid versions containing several ingredients. Beginning in 2450 BCE, lime was used as masonry mortar in Europe.Sticky RicePerhaps because of the absence of natural materials such as volcanic ash, hydraulic mortar technology was not developed in ancient China.The earliest record of this technique can be found in an encyclopaedia, theThis use of gummy grains in Chinese concrete as an adhesive is not entirely surprising. Cooked rice was first boiled into a paste, then blended with sand and lime, a substance produced by heating limestone.Scientists have long been fascinated with this unusual formula, and in recent years, different teams have conducted studies to better understand it. Researchers Jiajia Li and Bingjian Zhang spent six years collecting 378 samples of ancient mortar from 159 sites throughout China, dating from the Taosi phase (2300-1900 BC) all the way to the late Qing dynasty (1644-1911).Parts of Nanjing’s city wall are held together with sticky rice mortar. (One notable sample, from a 2000-year-old tomb in Jiangsu province, turned up what the researchers say is the oldest known trace of sticky rice mortar.Pyramid-shapedSticky rice is sweet, and augments savory dishes such asMortar samples from ancient constructions were analyzed by both chemical methods (including the iodine starch test and the acid attack experiment) and instrumental methods (including thermogravimetric differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, and scanning electron microscopy).Mortar samples from halls and the garden of the famed Forbidden City, built in the 15th century, tested positive for the starch.Animal blood might sound like a grisly substance for building walls, but it was a perfectly normal additive used by several cultures. Historical recipes written in French, Italian, and English have detailed ways to mix oxblood and lime mortars.Tiger Hill Pagoda - WikipediaConstruction workers were a disposable commodity when it came to building the wall. It’s estimated that as many as 400,000 people died building the wall, earning it the sobriquet “longest cemetery on Earth.”Many other organic additives favored by the Chinese helped repel water. Oil samples from 87 sites, contained tung oil, a common waterproof seal for wooden ships.Researchers found sugar in the mortar of Suzhou’s Tiger Hill Pagoda. (Great design is often the result of thinking beyond form and function. Philosophy, the researchers posit, might be one poetic inspiration for these fusion pastes:“Ancient Chinese people advocated a view of nature often termed ‘heaven-and-human oneness. The use of agricultural, forestry, and animal products in building materials reflected architectural aesthetics that sought to integrate architecture and nature.”After the Song and Yuan dynasties, the recipe of sticky rice mortar matured, being utilized in the famous Forbidden City in Beijing, a stretch of Great Wall built during the Ming Dynasty, the Chengde Mountain Resort, the Eastern Qing tombs, and the Qiantang River wall built during the Ming and Qing dynasties..Fujian Tulou (“earthen buildings”).(The Fujian Tulou (literally “earthen buildings”) are famous for their durability. Giant multistoried homes capable of housing close to 800 individuals and built with wood and fortified with mud walls were constructed between the 15th and 20th centuries.Incredibly, structures built with sticky rice mortar have survived more than natural erosion. A Ming tomb, of the minister Xu Pu and his wife, was nearly damaged by a bulldozer when found in 1978, but it was “so firm [the vehicle] could do nothing about it.”Although clearly effective, these revolutionary adhesives fell out of fashion in the late Qing dynasty. China’s first cement factory opened in 1889 in Hebei province,Shouchang BridgeBut researchers still see potential in these ancient formulas, especially to stabilize historical sites. Due to high quantities of salt, cement is detrimental and incompatible (being too strong and rigid) with traditional lime-based mortars.In Xichang, Sichuan Province, a restoration projectEvery day, the builders put 500 kilograms of glutinous rice on the boil, and then mix this starchy alternative with a few other ingredients, such as limestone, to form a mortar which will hold the wall together. It’s estimated that the entire project will require an impressive total of 50 tons of rice, in all. At the site of construction, five giant pots are heated over coal, and workers must keep stirring the rice inside these pots to prevent it sticking, as they haven’t invented non-stick crockery of these proportions yet.Researchers and conservationists from the Getty Conservation Insitute have combined the ancient technology of sticky rice with relatively new nanotechnology to develop an innovative treatment for historical sites.","9,588 followers",Matt Riggsby,1.6K,17.3K,56.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-ancient-inventions-that-are-much-better-than-modern-technology
