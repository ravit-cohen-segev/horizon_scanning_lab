Now, on the one hand we have the explanation that as an extrasolar object, it has undoubtedly been exposed to conditions which none the asteroids we've observed have. And on the other hand, the explanation that it's because it's a lightcraft built by aliens.Technically speaking, both do fit the available data. But the former one fits it better. The only reason to abandon it in favor the more complex, less supportable position would be if there were some observations that simpler option simply could not account for that the complex one did.",4 followers,Dan Bradbury,4.2K,21.7K,235.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-Oumaumua-a-lightsail-floating-in-Interstellar-space-as-a-debris-from-an-advanced-technological-equipment

When that filter is overloaded with pain, it can’t filter out a lot of the things that other people filter out and this causes the conscious mind to become aware of ideas that other people can’t see because their filter has labeled them as ‘irrelevant’. Another thing that happens when your body is in pain is that you organize your life to minimize pain and minimize unnecessary sensory input that may overwhelm your already overloaded input filter. This causes you to seek out quiet spaces and distract yourself by obsessing over things that other people wouldn’t ordinarily care about. Stephen Hawking led such a life, but his distractions became increasingly disconnected from real life as time went on. He also seemed to take out some of his rage at his condition by saying things designed to make stupid, gullible people react in stupid, gullible ways, thereby reinforcing his sense of superiority and self-worth.

Refer to the Doctor Who episodes “Inferno,” “Rise of the Cybermen,” and “The Age of Steel.”In the Marvel Comics series “The Eternals,” we are introduced to an advanced civilization of beings called The Celestials. They are embodied as gigantic humanoid figures covered from head to toe in armor. They have the ability to alter the DNA of any species of their choice and evolve them into beings of various powers and talents. From the DNA of early hominids on Earth, The Celestials “created” the godlike Eternals and the Deviants, which inspired our vision of demons and monsters. Those hominids who were not manipulated by the Celestials evolved naturally into modern homo sapiens.In the compilation of stories written by JRR Tolkien published as The Silmarillion, we are introduced to the Valar. In power, they are akin to The Celestials except that the Valar were divinely created rather than having evolved into superbeings. Each Valar was granted a dominion to rule over by Eru Illuvatar (the creator god). Varda was the lady of the stars. Mandos ruled over the Underworld. Ulmo ruled over the waters of the world. At the peak of the Valar was Manwë, who ruled over the air and wind. Manwë answered to none but Eru. There was even a Satan figure in the pantheon of Valar: Melkor. Melkor sought absolute dominion over Ëa (the universe) by seeking The Flame Imperishable. Failing in his quest, Melkor rebelled against Eru, who cast him down to the coldest and most barren realms of Arda (Middle Earth).So between The Time Lords, The Celestials, and the Valar, there are civilizations and powers that make the GFFA look like they're still in the Stone Age.Glad to be of service,JJB*I just noticed you were asking about science fiction and fantasy FILMS.
