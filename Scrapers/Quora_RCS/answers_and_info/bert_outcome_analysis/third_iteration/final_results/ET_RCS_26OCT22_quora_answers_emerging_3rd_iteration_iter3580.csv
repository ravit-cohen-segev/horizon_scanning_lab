This would require all forms of transportation to change over to electric motors. That means every one of the 1+ billion cars in the world would have to be destroyed and replaced with new electric cars. That is a cost that most countries - including the US - cannot afford in the short term.A much better fuel choice would be one that could be retrofitted into gasoline cars during a protracted phase-out of 4-cycle engines and into electric motors. This is also true of the heating of homes and offices, the fuel needed to produce electricity and most other forms of energy production. Unless we can do that, there will be a much greater disruption in our economy and in related energy and transportation industries that will make the transition into a new fuel much more expensive, difficult and take much longer.Essentially, we need a new fuel :that can directly replace oilthat does not pollute,can be retrofitted into most oil burning devices and facilities,can be produced cheaply andcomes from a natural resource that is abundant and easily accessed.There is such a fuel. Hydrogen.FUEL:We are headed toward what is called a “hydrogen economy”. As an alternative to fossil fuel, Hydrogen (H) is the ONLY fuel we now know of that meets these three requirements:USE:There are limits to hydrogen because it does have a lower energy density than oil. It would have very limited application in aviation and in large vessel shipping and trucking. For those, we would have to rely on fossil fuels until we can design either electric or other fuels that could be used.Hydrogen can be used to burn as a primary fuel for heating and vehicle power. It can be produced from water and when it burned, its exhaust is water. A pipeline or truck leaking hydrogen would not be an environmental disaster because hydrogen is a natural part of out atmosphere. It can also be used in a fuel cell to produce electricity. Fuel cell powered cars are already on the market with as much range and fill-ups as fast as gasoline cars.PRODUCTION:Producing H from water, compressing it into a liquid and using a reactor to produce it makes H a viable (and right now, the only) fuels that can replace fossil fuels and coal.Making H on an industrial scale using electrolysis is not practical but it can also be made by a process called “cracking” which heats water high enough that the molecules split up into H and O2. The heat needed is high but it can be achieved with some newer designed nuclear reactors such as the Pebble Bed Reactor (PBR).A PBR power plant can last for up to 40 years. The PBR fuel “pebbles” are cycled continuously and replaced, as needed, without shutting down the plant for refueling. This means that it is technically not a renewable energy source but 40 years is long enough that for all practical purposes, it is renewable.PRODUCTION FACILITY:A typical H production facility would consist of a PBR or some other 5th Gen VHTR (such as molten salt thorium reactor) located near a large water source such as an ocean. It would create electrical power in the usual way (PBR’s use helium (an inert gas) instead of steam as the primary heated media). The heat of the reactor would also be used to “crack” some of the water into H and O2. A lesser amount of the heat would be used to desalinate the sea water. The electricity produced by the PBR would power the entire process and the facility but would also be used to compress the H into a liquid and put it into liquid H storage tanks, trucks and/or to pump it thru underground pipelines - similar to those used to transport natural gas today.Initially, to reduce social resistance to the use of nuclear reactors, it might be necessary to build the H production facilities in remote areas but near water such as Baja, Mexico or Hudson Bay or Newfoundland and pipe or ship the liquid H back to distribution facilities. As the safety of PBRs is established, they could be built along any coast or around the Great Lakes.There are loses in the cracking of H - it takes more energy into the process than we can get out of the H as energy to do work later. This means that if you only look at the net energy input versus the net energy output, then this is not a practical process. However, if we gain the H energy by being able to use the produced energy in new applications then it is worth it. For instance - we can’t use nuclear reactors in cars but we can use H. A PBR is one of the few designs called a Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) that is efficient enough to make H with a net loss of energy but with a net gain in cost. This is because a single load of PBR reactor fuel will produce H for years.If the reactor can operate for a very long time on an infrequent fuel load (thorium) , then from a monetary perspective, it is profitable, i.e., the sale and use of the cracked H is higher than the cost of the PBR’s refueling.The output of the PBR facility would be large volumes of liquid H, large volumes of O2 as a compressed gas, fresh water made out of salt water, and electricity.That it takes a PBR or other VHTR to crack water into H is really no different than using an oil refinery to make fossil fuels - except that a H-cracking refinery would have almost no pollution, would use an unlimited resource of raw material (water) and would produce a fuel that, when burned, would return to being water.Given the hydrogen production capacity of a PBR or other VHTR reactor over its lifetime and the costs of the fuel used versus the value and sales cost of the hydrogen produced, it makes no difference that the net energy in is less than the net energy out.See more details about cost of a PBR at the end of this articleDISTRIBUTION:Since the PBR’s reactor is used to make steam to power electricity production. That electricity can then be used to power the equipment to compress the H into liquid form so it can be concentrated and transported to and thru distribution methods - pipes, trucks and into car tanks. The H is then used in other power plants to make steam for electricity without the pollution that coal or oil would make,It is a serious error and an impediment to progress to draw strict conclusions about potential solutions by using strict definitions or arbitrary limits on those possible solutions. A nuclear reactor that can operate non-stop for 40 years or more is essentially a renewable resource as long as there is a source for the raw material that makes up the fuel (uranium, thorium, etc.). Certainly a breeder reactor is renewable since it produces waste that is usable fuel in other reactors. When we perfect fusion reactors, they will be essentially renewable because they might be able to operate for as much as 50 to 75 years.This is actually not much different than a solar power plant. A significantly greater unusable energy (sunlight) is put into the process than usable energy taken out. The sunlight is unusable in the sense that it is not dense or powerful enough to power a car or heat a house or operate an electric power production facility. If enough solar panels are added together, it becomes more usable but that is impractical for vehicles without the ability to accumulate and store the solar produced electricity. We consider this renewable because we are using the renewable energy of sunlight.The efficiency and low cost of nuclear powered heat and electricity and the long intervals and relatively low cost of the fuel, is not the same as but is similar to the energy we get from sunlight. That heat and electrical energy is then used to create a more usable and transportable fuel. Using a VHTR or PBR in place of the sunlight is not the same but it is many orders of magnitude better than using fossil fuels or coal with multiple additional benefits - no pollution, much smaller footprint, lower overall cost, etc.When you consider that almost all transportation, all industrial uses, all home heating and cooling and all related forms of electricity production can be powered by Hydrogen, it is a logical choice to replace oil. Given that 7/10th of the earth is covered in water, that burning hydrogen gives off no pollutants and we have a viable method of producing the hydrogen without burning any other polluting fuel to get it, it is the ideal solution to our energy needs.PBRs and other 5th Gen VHT Reactor Designs:There will be those that argue that nuclear power is actually very expensive but it really makes a big difference how you create your statistics and charts. PBR’s, for instance, can be made so that 5 of them will fit on a football field with room left for parking. They are small enough that they the reactor core can be built off-site and trucked to where it will be used. They use 1/10th the plumbing of the currently used design. They do not require any cooling towers. The core heats helium gas directly which is then used to heat water for the generator but because helium is an inert gas, it cannot and does not become radioactive. There is also a quirk in the physics of using the “pebble” design (actually tennis ball size) such that if the reactor core rises about 1,600 degrees, it will automatically shut itself down, , i.e., it cannot overheat, melt down, or go “critical” like today’s reactors. It is also nearly impossible to make weapon’s grade fuel from the reactors depleted fuel pebbles.This design makes for a very efficient and low cost reactor with low maintenance, a small footprint, nearly zero pollution and as safe as it is possible to get. This all translate to avery low net cost over time and when considering the amount of power it creates.I find that the most honest values of cost come when you consider ALL expenses over as long a period as possible. A “total life cycle cost” gives a good estimate of the end cost to the consumer but it is difficult because not all production sources can last for the same length of time. Here is one chart that attempts to do this and is the one that the US and IEA accept as the definitive quantification of production costs.To be considered valid and usable, it is important to recite the fine print of how these numbers were produced. Here it is:Total Life-Cycle Costs for Electricity, normalized to capacity factor, life-span and amount of energy produced. Costs include construction, operation and maintenance (O&M), fuel, and decommissioning. Costs do not include electrical grid upgrade, transportation issues, connectivity of renewables and buffering of their intermittency by rapid cycling of fossil fuel plants as presently practiced in this country, and externalities such as any carbon-tax, pollution and health care costs associated with energy production and use. Also, these costs are not levelized but are actual direct costs. Once actual costs are known, better long-term planning can be done and some levelizing factors can be wisely shaped to affect a more desirable energy mix.Costs not captured include electrical grid upgrade, connectivity of renewables and buffering of their intermittency by rapid cycling of fossil fuel plants as presently practiced in this country, and non-carbon-tax externalities such as pollution and health care costs associated with energy sources, especially for coal. Costs for coal are highly dependent on the cost of gasoline, and the costs for wind are highly dependent on material costs like steel and concrete as wind requires about 10 times the amount of steel, concrete and copper per kWhr than any other energy source. These, in turn, are also highly dependent on the cost of gasoline. All decommissioning and waste disposal costs are relatively small compared to other costs, 0.1¢/kWhr or less, even for nuclear. Costs of a carbon tax @$15/ton of CO2 emitted are significant for the fossil fuels over this time period but, on their own, are still insufficient to force any change in fossil fuel use, or the total mix of sources adopted by a nation.If you read this carefully, almost all the things NOT captured in the above graph would significantly ADD to the costs of the fuels except for nuclear which would add very little.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/In-the-future-after-we-have-more-advanced-technology-can-we-just-drill-straight-down-to-another-country

So, Israel today, has the talent, the concentration and the genetic presence to give Israel;the Jewish Country -the best input, from the best of science and technology.Israel is a Western nation. It is a free economy, a democracy and has many companies that have serious R&D units.2/3 of all households have internet, all businesses have high-speed internet, the telephone network is excellent, and new Start-ups are the standard, and impressive. Most high-school kids and 80% of all adults have smart-phones.For obvious reasons the Military industries are very advance and support our High-Tech Army. We have portable computers with most field-companies, drones overhead, the latest jets in the air and our satellites in the sky.Our tanks are technological wonders. The technology for tanks to fire, at a pin-point target while on the move-at 50 Km/h is made and used in Israel.We have robot boats, tunnel -destroying technology and face-recognition cameras in most ‘hot-spots’.The technology to shoot down enemy rockets-while in the air-over the enemy side of the fence is made in Israel and well applied.Our computerized and radarized anti-‘car-crash’ system is now sold all around the world.In medicine, We have the latest technologies and we have developed many of them....","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/In-the-future-after-we-have-more-advanced-technology-can-we-just-drill-straight-down-to-another-country
23,"You ask what technologies might do this:Running the numbers on this was fairly interesting.  Current total energy production is around 600 Quads/yr (quadrillion BTU) which is 1.758E14 kWh/yr and ten times that is 1.758E15 kWh/yr - our goal.The only one I can see scaling this largeYou ask what technologies might do this:Running the numbers on this was fairly interesting.  Current total energy production is around 600 Quads/yr (quadrillion BTU) which is 1.758E14 kWh/yr and ten times that is 1.758E15 kWh/yr - our goal.The only one I can see scaling this largeUsing a single 6 mile square primary collector, that's 93,239,108 square meters of area and a general assumption would suggest we could get a maximum of 44% of that much space sunlight (equivalent to 65% of terrestrial sun's power) into some form of usable energy.  Remember, if these are in the ocean, we could use the waste heat to desalinate water.  With no cloud issues (they would vaporize inside the beam) or night time darkness, this comes to an annual production of  530,903,483,694 kWh/yr (5.309E11) per system.  And dividing that into our 10x needs suggests we need 3312 of these systems in geostationary orbit.  That's not as bad as it first sounded but it doesn't address how to get this energy to the people.  Perhaps since so much clean water is being made, we could use the pressure of pumping the water inland to power generators.However, you didn't say why you wanted 10 times our current production of energy.  The assumption might be that you feel increases in per-capita energy use will rise along with population.  Neither of these are true by the time the problem increases demand by 10 times.Population is still climbing BUT the rate of climb is falling dramatically and this is the trend to base predictions on.  When this rate falls below zero (around 2035), then global population will begin falling.  The peak is expected to be 9-9.5 billion people and then it's expected to settle back to 5-7 billion people.Not all people's energy consumption is rising.  Thanks to technology, the largest energy users are multi-tasking their energy demand.  Instead of 30 gadgets for office use, home use, entertainment, communication, education, information, etc., they now have one cell phone.  The energy use for those services is way down and falling fast.  Even manufacturing is becoming more efficient by modeling things in CAD to near perfection before building, testing, selling betas, refining and ramping up mass production.  Transportation is set to see these scales of energy reduction too.   And developing countries are leapfrogging the old technologies (think land line phone infrastructures) by jumping straight to the cell phone system.  Rather soon, people will do business by telecommuting and online transactions and produce locally instead of shipping their trinkets 5,000 miles.  Energy won't be shipped by rail (coal), ship (NG) or pipeline (NG and oil) and it won't entail as much energy to mine or refine or store or secure it or to transport those people to work.  Production will be more time-matched to demand with very little storage to shift some solar at 4 pm to evening use at 7 pm.  Many of the AC devices we now use (which lose up to 70% of their power before converting to DC which is actually used inside) will be powered directly by DC eliminating that waste and the 'standby' times they sit idle.The net result is that overall energy demand will settle to far less than we even use now.  Instead of that 1.75E14 kWh we now want, I would estimate it to fall to below 1E14.  This changes your question dramatically.  We now need 188 of these systems for our new demand (5.7% as many).  And that's not counting any other energy systems like dams, wind, ocean, geothermal, biofuels, OTEC or any other source.So unless you are actually writing a sci-fi story, it would make sense to begin with researched givens and goals.
