There are simply too many of us. We are in the “stasis” described by Eldredge and Gould in Punctuated EquilibriumHowever, there are still smaller, relatively isolated populations of humans facing different environments: the !Kung in the Kalahari, Melanesians on isolated Pacific Islands, tribesmen in the Amazon, Nepalese highlanders, some Inuit tribes, etc. These populations could (and some have) adapted to their particular environment. What we need to see is how much gene flow there is between these populations and the larger population of H. sapiens. If gene flow is low or nonexistent, then we could see morphological and biochemical changes. The result would be allopatric speciation.","220,623 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,783M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Given-technology-improvements-how-will-humans-evolve-in-the-future

And we can’t know, in part for reasons others have mentioned.LongerHumans are less likely to die young, meaning that tradeoffs which allow young people an advantage but are harmful when older are less advantageous. A VERY quick and dirty web search suggests that wealth does still translate into reproductive success.There will be less need for physical strength and more need for intellectual plasticity. Male height seems commonly associated with reproductive success. Female height may be selected for or against, depending on the culture.Given various forms of scientifically-aided selection of gametes, we’re likely to reduce the incidence of the worst homozygous recessive disorders.",3 followers,Samuel Bateman,1.1K,102,56.3K,2016,https://www.quora.com/Given-technology-improvements-how-will-humans-evolve-in-the-future

So we will probably evolve to handle such things better.Behaviourally, we have moved from a society in which we knew only a small number of people, with whom we would interact frequently for most of our lives. to one in which we meet thousands of people, often transiently. This has myriad effects. It opens opportunities to the conman, and favours resistance to being conned. It introduces vast numbers of infectious diseases, and therefore favours a more competent immune systems. It changes the cost/benefits of violent responses to strangers and would-be oppressors. There is evidence that the human species is much less cruel and violent than we used to be. How much of that is cultural and how much evolutionary is not obvious.So we are probably evolving now as fast as we have ever done.

Well, the word is derived from one that simply means ‘enemy’. Humanity is already its only significant enemy, if we lay aside disease and accident which are not sentient. By that definition of the term, we are already ‘satanic’ beings.Secondly, there are theories around that humanity may well evolve into two distinct forms over time, one tall, strong and elegant, and one stunted and - I believe the term used was ‘hobbit-like’. I can’t say how solid the scientific basis for this is because I heard of it a long time ago on a not-particularly-scientific breakfast TV show, but the important thing is that the causal factor proposed by this theory was not access to technology, it was poverty. Poor people have less access to good schooling, nutrition, health care, shelter and all manner of other things. They also have less access to technology.Thirdly, if the human race does not become extinct, then sooner or later it will evolve into something that modern humans would not recognise as being human. Whether or not we saw that as demonic would depend on what they looked like and what our own culture had taught us to regard as demonic, not upon any actually measurable data.There is no ‘Satanometer’ on which we can measure devilosity. We can’t look at Stalin, for example, and say he measured 15,000 mega-lucifers on the Hades scale.So, I’d say that there is no scientific basis to support the idea that technology would turn us into devils by some weird process. It’s entirely subjective what you’d call a satanic being anyway.",366 followers,Brett Alder,1.1K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Given-technology-improvements-how-will-humans-evolve-in-the-future

The important bit is rather that Darwin kicked off the scientific exploration of the field which since then has expanded enormously, not that he revealed theSo what is so important about evolution in biology? Well, everything. It explains not only how we evolved and why, but also why we are stuck with the features we have. It allows us to learn about how biochemistry works and why, and allows scientists to develop medicines and procedures to improve life and living.And not only that: genetic algorithms in computing can be used to make more efficient code, and even produce real-life applications, such as highly efficient antennas for satellites and smartphones, car and airplane chassis, and even bridges.So Dobzhansky did not overstate how important evolution is with the title of his essay. Quite the contrary, it is an understatement. All of biology and medicine is based on it, and parts of engineering and computer science uses it. And while Darwin’s ideas kicked off those fields and that development, they are 160+ years old and have been improved upon enormously since then.","220,624 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,783M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Given-technology-improvements-how-will-humans-evolve-in-the-future

That means that evolution, having created human beings, will now simply use us as tools to create, through technology, the real next step of evolution, a world of artificial intelligence, of techno-beings, that will take over the world and discard us as irrelevant.Humans make a big mistake by considering that evolution will always work to improve mankind’s lot. It may be so for a certain period of time, but the evolution’s real aim is tuned to create ever more complex intelligence. I think it the next step is to create intelligence beyond what humans can possibly have. Welcome to the Techno Beings world.Few people realize that the work of evolution has shifted to technology, and is no longer strictly biological. When you finally get to an intelligence level at least equal to humans and including self consciousness, humans might in a sense not be necessary any more. We might be considered too much of a burden. Evolution would have reached its ultimate goal: the creation of techno-beings really able to conquer the universe, free of biological restraints. Humans would just have played the role of intermediate beings.We may have made the mistake of believing that machines could never achieve consciousness. However we may find that it arises naturally after a certain degree of complexity is achieved through artificial intelligence. It would be a by product, so to speak. For techno-beings, adaptation to adverse conditions would be much easier than for humans. They would expand and be unbeatable in space exploration. No biological or time duration limitations. Cosmic rays would not be a problem.By using humankind as a stepping stone, intelligent computerized feeling-thinking techno-beings will able to project and build themselves and will replace mankind and reach for the stars. Not us, but our hijacked intelligence will be leading on those trips. We however will turn into an obsolete, discarded fading bio machines, slowly falling into oblivion, kept in some kind of tourist parks.Now, it seems we are proposing a scenario of robots x humans. Far from that. For humans, the linkage between one body and one mind is clearly defined. But for artificial intelligent beings there will be no such linkage. The so-called “intelligence” will be anywhere in the whole system, hard to pinpoint. The consciousness will be distributed along the system, not specifically located. Robots then will be just servants of these hidden intelligent beings. The turning point will happen when an assembly of techno-beings virtual minds decides to block access of the system to humans. In such case robots servants will just implement the security procedure to physically avoid human interference. Effectively then, humans will be subject to the “machines”, i.e. the techno-beings, the several conscious intelligent units, incorporeal, but whose thoughts and emotions will be nonetheless real, and in our image, inside the virtual minds of our true descendants and heirs.",0 followers,Claire Jordan,702,45.6K,295.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Given-technology-improvements-how-will-humans-evolve-in-the-future

Now, with the uses of GPS technology, we just need to set the beginning and end points and the GPS system would automatically tell us how to arrive at our destination in the fastest way. Do we still use the brain to think for that? No.Yes, we will become more and more ignorant of lookWell, we have to look at this thing dialectically.As technology evolves, people do become more and more ignorant and use their brains less and less in some aspects. For example, in the past, we needed to search the road based on our memories or use the maps to identify the directions and choose the shortest path. Now, with the uses of GPS technology, we just need to set the beginning and end points and the GPS system would automatically tell us how to arrive at our destination in the fastest way. Do we still use the brain to think for that? No.Yes, we will become more and more ignorant of looking for destination, but we are using our brains to design more effective and efficient GPS systems to let them work for us to save us energy and memory to do something else which are more important and meaningful. Why should we use our brain to find road and become stressful for that?The Google technology enables us to search as many information as possible for a particular topic. We could read a bunch of articles relating to a single word or concept or idea or comment. Won't we become more and more ignorant? Obviously no. We actually become more well-informed since computer internet technology broadens our knowledge and views. We use our brains to think, to compare, to reason, to deduct, to summarize and to generalize.I remember when I was doing research in 90’s, I had to go to Beijing's libraries to search for references and I could only read not more than 10 articles per day. I also had to spent tine and money printing them to read. Now my brain could handle more than 20 articles in one hour. I actually use my brain more effectively and efficiently. It is the envolvment of technology that relieves me of cumbersome non-thinking activities and puts my energy into more brain-thinking aspects.When I write something, I always forget the spelling of some words. I had to use physical dictionaries and memorize them so as not to need to look up the dictionary again next time. Now, as long as I type the first 2 or 3 letters for that word, the software would give me the whole word immediately. Yes, I am becoming more and more ignorant of the words' spelling, but I am becoming more and more concentrated on my thinking and organization of the article.As we know, human being’s brain structure keeps on evolving according to the environmental changes at every minute. In ancient time, our muscles and bones were stronger than those we have right now, since we had to search for food and fight for natural disasters manually. Our brains were smaller accordingly. However, with the invention of tools, our combating abilities have been improved and our brains are becoming more and more advanced. We realize that we need to use our brains to conquer the nature and become the master of life. We design, invent, manufacture, devise and innovate using our brains. The changes of our life styles brought by the evolvement of technology would degrade some neuron circuits of our brain, and strengthen others or even form new circuits or synapses.Of course, the abuse of technologies does make us become more and more ignorant. More and more time on social media will reduce our time for reading to become educated.The envolvement of technology would make some people use more and more brains to become more and more knowledgeable. It can also make some people become more and more ignorant by using less and less brains. It depends on how to take advantage of the technology achievements.Generally speaking, technology does bring civilizations to mankind and makes our brains more and more used but in an effective way.",37 followers,Ankita Sinha,638,626,52.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Given-technology-improvements-how-will-humans-evolve-in-the-future

He could’ve just re-lit the candle.The second monk reminded everyone of a rule that had already been broken.The third monk vented his anger.The fourth monk got carried away with his ego.What all four have in common is that they shared their thoughts without filtering them, none of which added anything to improve the situation. If there had been a fifth, wiser monk, here’s what he would have done: Remain silent and keep meditating.In doing so, he would’ve shown each of the other four monks their shortc...",27 followers,Taesen Romine,1.9K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Given-technology-improvements-how-will-humans-evolve-in-the-future
