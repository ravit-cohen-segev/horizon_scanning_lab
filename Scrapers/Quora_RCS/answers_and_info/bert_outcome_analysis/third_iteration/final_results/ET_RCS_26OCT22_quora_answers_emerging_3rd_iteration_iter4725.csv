It's estimated to require 88 weeks of dedicated study in order to reach proficiency. This means that even if you work hard and are talented at language acquisition, even if you could study it all four years in college you will still not be proficient. Not fluency mind you, proficiency….Can you possibly imagine spending four years of classes in a language and then requiring the English signs to navigate the train station or needing to point to items you want behind the counter because you don't know how to ask for them or you thought you did but they don't understand you?To just reach practical proficiency with Chinese, you need to just set aside two years of your life dedicated to learning it. Even then, you're still not fluent. Learning Chinese as an adult is probably one of the worst possible allocations of your time. The amount of money, time and opportunities lost by learning Chinese can pay the costs of hiring translators when needed with plenty to spare.This is why you can always assume the better Chinese a foreigner speaks, the less important his career is. Spending that time learning the language gives no career advantages (because you're still not native) and comes at the sacrifice of practical education like an MBA or work experience. The few times I've met a foreigner in China with a truly successful career that spoke better Chinese than I did, it was always a shock.Here's the problem with Chinese. There is no snowball effect, in fact, the more you learn, the slower you will progress. Once you clear the low hanging fruit of the most commonly used characters, each additional level of learning becomes far less relevant on a day to day basis but without those additional steps you'll never be able to achieve fluency. Most expats living in China plateu at proficiency, once you reach a level where you can function at work, school or whatever, you tend to stop putting additional effort on because the ROI on the time spent learning it is ever decreasing.There are nearly 100,000 unique Chinese characters. The average Chinese person only knows about 8,000. To be able to fluently read a newspaper you need about 3,000. However, if you learn the most commonly used 200 characters, that covers about 50% of daily interactions. So the more you learn the less relevant it becomes but you still aren't anywhere close to being able to read a simple news article about increasing housing prices.I know well over the commonly used 3,000 characters statement for reading but not only is reading a simpler news article a rigorous and slow venture, but I will need to call upon a dictionary. Furthermore, after deciphering it, I still need to step back and then process what it all means. I'll need the dictionary because there are always new characters. I may know many thousands of characters, but they are rarely the ones I need in any given situation.As a native English speaker, I can sit down at a restaurant in Spain and browse the menu. I may not know what anything is, but I still can read and pronounce it. So if I keep seeing “bacalao” on a menu I instinctively remember it and know how to pronounce it. All I need is to ask, which is easily done or Google it, also easily done. Without ever having studied, I now know what cod is in Spanish.In China it's not like that at all. You see 鳕 (cod). You don't know how to say it and writing it is something you'd need to learn. Furthermore, your brain isn't hard wired to recognize and differentiate it along a sea of other new characters. You see bacalao and it sticks with you, that doesn't happen with 鳕. You can guess it's probably aquatic (from the parts of the character) and if you can read the left and right individual components, you'll be able to guess the pronunciation about half the time but not the tonal accent.There's simply no way to just see something on a menu and naturally learn it through indirect exposure like with other languages. You can't just ask because you don't know how to say it so you would need to point to it and then ask how to say it. The other option is to painstakingly draw it into specialized software. Then, once you do learn how to say it, it's just one of a handful of repetitive sounds so it won't have anything distinctive about it to make remembering it easy. True story, I remembered bacalao despite not having spoken Spanish for a few years but had to look up cod in Chinese despite living in China for this example.Chinese requires one to make great effort to learn it and you'll still likely pronounce it wrong. Meanwhile you just want to eat some food and don't need to waste half your lunch break learning one of tens of thousands of characters you don't know.Nothing comes easy in Chinese. You can't simply absorb it and be fluent. You can immerse yourself and learn it faster, but everything will be earned not given. In fact, unless you'll be immersing yourself in Chinese, there's really no point in even trying.I never studied Spanish formally. As a child we would spend summers in South America and I picked up the language naturally. Now it normally takes at least 2 weeks, but after hearing Spanish for two weeks straight, it suddenly clicks. All the things I picked up as a child just get reactivated and I'm flooded with a rich vocabulary, not even knowing how I know the meaning of the things that I simply just understand. With Chinese, I'm fortunate to remember 鳕 a few hours after spending five minutes drawing it intoAs I never actually studied Spanish, I can't really communicate well nor articulately. I don't even bother using proper grammar, but I'm always able to communicate. I can always read something and figure it out even if I don't know all the words. I can manage doing what I want to do and saying what I want to say. Even if what I say is so grammatically poor and I use the wrong adjectives and nouns, I'm always able to get my point across without any problems. I can say “I drank wine now, wait friends, 1 hour eat later, outside up.” And they'll naturally understand “He wants to sit on the terrace and drink wine until his friends arrive and they'll order food.” The lack of ability rarely prevents from doing anything and while I fake it until I make it, I'm intrinsically picking up proper phrasing and a better vocabulary.Meanwhile, in China, it's very common for me to say something in Chinese and someone just responds with telling me they don't speak English. They didn't even recognize that I was speaking Chinese. For this reason, I would never consider myself fluent despite that my skills are far superior to many Americans that claimed fluency like presidential hopeful Jon Huntsman.My reading and writing of Chinese is actually very good, many times for work, people thought they were communicating with a Chinese person who used odd sentence structure and just wasn't very articulate. Yet someone who can read and write that well can sometimes have trouble ordering a bowl of noodles. I can't even begin to write my own name in Spanish but have never had a server respond with “Why you speaking English to me?” and walk away to find someone else who knows English after I made an order in Spanish.It's the tones of the characters that make speaking it so difficult. Like many foreigners, no matter how hard I may try, I simply don't hear them because my brain never learned it as an important skill in my formative years. I hear Chinese very differently than Chinese people do. They hear the exact word, I hear multiple words and piece it together using proper context. Ah he must mean “bowl” and not “finish” or “night” or “ten thousand” whereas a Chinese person hears what I literally say and not what I obviously intend to say when I speak. They didn't hear me ordering a bowl of noodles 一碗面 (yi wan mian) because I said 宜万免 (also yi wan mian), which is utter gibberish. So clearly that gibberish must have been English so they go to find an English speaker to deal with me.This is the problem with learning Chinese from English. For many people such as myself, they just don't hear the tones so they can't learn them. You can hit a glass ceiling that no amount of hard work can overcome.There is no such thing as close enough in Chinese, you either said it properly or just spoke in tongues. If I totally butcher another language and pronounce bacalao in a very messed up manner, they'll just say “did you mean bacalao?” or not even bother confirming and they just give me the bacalao because that's obviously what I tried to order.That's why even when uttering a single character can convey what I want, I'm forced to use very unnecessarily long sentences to force the listener to hear what I logically would have asked for rather than what I literally asked for. Salt 盐 and cigarettes 烟 are both yan, as are 眼,言,演,严,炎,燕,岩, and 验. I could go on writing all the yan for quite some time. So I can't just ask a shop if they have yan but rather tell them I want to cook some food, where is the yan or I really want to smoke yan. You sound like an utter fool but it works much better than saying yan and hoping you hit bingo.Before I learned to use lengthy sentences, this would be a common conversation?Do you have yan?Yan?Yes, yan.Yan? Hey guys, this foreigner wants yan.Yan? No that's illogical, maybe he meant yan.Hey foreigner, did you mean yan or yan?I want yan.Yan??Just give him the yan, he can't possibly be asking for yan.No, not this yan, the other yan, you know for cooking.Oh, yan! Hey guys he wants yan!Why didn't he just say so then?This is why all the discussion of the simple grammar is a red herring. If people don't even know what the words are that you are saying, why on earth would the easy to learn sentence structure of your gibberish even matter? This is why I'm much more fluent in reading and writing than oral because if tones are removed the language is orders of magnitude easier to communicate.Then even if you learn all the characters and how to pronounce them, you still need to understand the cultural context to put it all together. Nearly every day I'll read a sign or hear a phrase and despite knowing every single character involved, don't understand what it means. Not like where I'm a little unclear because it's metaphorical but where I don't even want to guess what it could mean. Chinese grow up reading 2,000 year old poetry and a lot of the language reflects this ancient literary tradition.You can't fully grasp Chinese language unless you are at least familiar with the classics. On my desk right now is a collection of Tang Dynasty stories intended for little children. The hope is at some point I'll start picking up on the references and despite being “fluent” in Chinese, reading a book intended for children is still very ambitious for me. I couldn't even get past the first paragraph reading Tang Dynasty history for adults. And none of this exists in English so history for babies is my only option.Chinese is hard. You need to learn an entirely new system of reading and writing. You need to rewire your brain further to where each word requires a unique tone of voice. You need to understand their ancient culture in order to understand what you read. Sure, the grammar is simple enough to be learned in a week. But grammar never gets in the way of communication, it just makes you sound funny. Big difference between sounding funny and being incomprehensible.In fact, foreigners that master Chinese from a non related language (Korean and Japanese etc are from different language groups but both have 60% of their words coming from Chinese so they don't count) can be celebrities if they choose. It's so infrequent for a non Asian to speak Chinese fluently that when they do it's such a novelty that they'll be put on television.P.S. someone shared this in the comments","527,820 followers",Adam,1.2K,1.1K,5.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-anyone-learning-Chinese

Honestly?I know I’m probably being held at gunpoint by multiple Russians to say “T14 Armata da” but with the lack of information given by Russia, I can’t really list it as much other than a propaganda machine. In the end, the MBT used by Russia is still the T-90.What do we know about it? It could have the most horses put in a tank (2000). It could have some crazy advanced computer shit dumped in. It could be the best tank in the world. But the way Russia keeps us guessing, the way they don’t give us any tests, any records, nothing, it really doesn’t confirm…anything. Sorry, Russia.Moving on.Don’t have a really clear idea, again, there are so many factors in tanks that define what “best” is that makes you what is “best”? Is it the logistics, the cost-efficiency and usage? Then we would still be stuck on the T-55.Is best its game-like statistics, the armor, firepower? The way its used? Its effectiveness? It certainly gets muddled somewhere in there.In the end, the better tank is always the one that has the better crew and is positioned most effectively. The one with years of experience duping behind some rocks will most likely beat a newer, inexperienced tank. M60A1 tanks, 30 year old tanks that were replaced by Abrams a fifth of a century ago outfought the Iraqi T-72 tanks, newer, more technologically advanced tanks. And by far. It wasn’t even close. They got pwned. Why? Experience. Training. Positioning. America was just better.Wait, I’m not allowed to answer like this?Goddamit.Well then, best main battle tank of the past 5 years, blah blah blah no one cares. In the end, there are two that rise from the competition, two that have been debated over for half a century. That’s right, I’m talking aboutBEER vs BEER.MURICA NUMBER ONENEIN HALT DEINE FRESSEIn most Top 10 Watchmojo.com lists, the Leopard 2A7 has consistently ranked higher (and the highest) as the best main battle tank in the world, leaving the M1 Abrams often to the 2nd or 3rd place prize. However, now with the introduction of the third SEP package, will it be enough to push the M1 to get the gold and ultimately, that oil-covered bread? Or will the 2A7 continue to defend its title as the world’s best?The 2A7 is incredibly strong as a tank (hence its…world’s best…title…), with high mobility, super strong armor, practically invincible turret armor, the totally-not-a-lazy-upgrade-instead-of-a-130-mm-gun Rheinmetall 120 mm L/55, putting it 132 cm in length ahead of its competition. And bigger is better right? Right guys? Right…*cries in Asian*All models also have digital FCS, laser rangefinders, a fully-stabilized gun so it can hit moving targets while moving while on rough terrain, and advanced night vision and sighting equipment (earlier models using low-light level TV system, thermal imaging came later). I’m talking about the Leopard 2. Not the 2A7 specifically.The 2A7+, the one that’s actually in service, comes with additional modular armor, improved frontal protection with a dual-kit on the turret and hull, and increased 360 ooga booga protection from mines and RPG’s. Or, for you uncultured normies, this thing is invincible! Have fun trying to destroy it!Oh yeah, and it also has a remotely controlled weapon station, haha. That doesn’t sound badass. At all.It’s good for low-intensity, it’s good for high-intensity, it’s good for mediocre-intensity conflicts. It’s a jack of all trades, master of all.But the Abrams has one important edge. Experience.The Abrams have fought in way too many conflicts since its introduction, much more than the Leopard 2. And I don’t mean export. I mean the United States of ‘Murica.

So cool.But the main thing they did here aside from some upgrades to the tech inside, was making the gun fucking long as hell. That gives better accuracy, a harder punch, and to be Honest, becomes quite intimidating. Who wants to go up against a tank that looks like a cross-breed of Tank and Tank Destroyer (much better done than the STRV 103, such a silly design)What sets the Abrams apart is that the tank has been tested. And I mean EGREGIOUSLY TESTED in multiple types of combat, and with by far and away one of the best armored cavalry schools in the world. These guys eat, breath, and shit excellence in their tanks and, to date, the only tanks actually destroyed in tank on tank fire (not mobility kills you donuts) were killed by our own tanks, even then, that was difficult. Seriously, the damn thing can take a direct hit on the DECK from a 155mm M777 Artillery piece and shrug it off like nothing happened.

6,"This is probably going to be contentious, but…The T-14 Armata is probably the best thing to happen to tank design in the last (very uneventful as a whole) five years.Recent conflicts in the Middle East have only gone to highlight how the biggest enemy of the modern MBT is not attack helicopters. Not aircraft. Not even other tanks. The biggest enemy of the modern MBT has become man-portable Anti-Tank Guided Missiles and other shoulder-launched anti tank rockets. They are cheap, can be carried on foot, are easy to conceal, and can cause catastrophic damage to even the most protected main battleThis is probably going to be contentious, but…The T-14 Armata is probably the best thing to happen to tank design in the last (very uneventful as a whole) five years.Recent conflicts in the Middle East have only gone to highlight how the biggest enemy of the modern MBT is not attack helicopters. Not aircraft. Not even other tanks. The biggest enemy of the modern MBT has become man-portable Anti-Tank Guided Missiles and other shoulder-launched anti tank rockets. They are cheap, can be carried on foot, are easy to conceal, and can cause catastrophic damage to even the most protected main battle tanks, especially given an elevation advantage.The T-14 is the most meaningful attempt at addressing the changing role of the modern main battle tank, with a huge focus on survivability and protection against the myriad of anti-tank threats that could litter a future battlespace.Now, obviously many of these ideas are very new and radical, and as of yet untested. We don’t know how well this vision of a future MBT will fair until we have a substantial conflict. But this isn’t really the point. The T-14 is a marked attempt at progress and innovation where much of the world’s tank design has stagnated.The M1 Abrams and it’s variants are a workhorse yea, but at the end of the day it’s a very old platform that’s been endlessly upgraded and upgraded without any real development. While it may do fine for now, it is, in my opinion, showing it’s age. It’s myth of invulnerability has sort of worn away over the years. You could argue it’s just fine for now, and I would agree, but the U.S. Army should be thinking about the future, and I don’t think the heavy and cumbersome M1 platform is it.The T-14 on the other hand tries so many new things. A conflict that tests it will truly provide invaluable information to tank engineers around the world. It has a new 2A82-1M 125 mm smoothbore gun, firing a ludicrously wide range of projectiles ranging from sabots to air-burst high-explosive rounds. Word even exists of anti-aircraft missiles for the weapon system.It’s also substantially faster than many competitors with a maximum speed of 56 mph, which could prove vital in a future battlefield that may well be dictated more and more by mobility. Survivability, specifically for the crew, is also paramount given the unorthodox bull layout.On top of this, the tank seems to have very meaningful active protection, able to intercept projectiles traveling up to speeds of Mach 5.0, not to mention a fairly large suit of electronic countermeasures, not to mention a radar system.Many of these things are features nations like America or Britain have barely started to consider. While we don’t know the exact effectiveness of the tank, the fact that they’re switching traditional design philosophies so much shows a willingness to experiment that’s been missing from tank design since the advent of gas turbines and the digital age. It shows much-needed progress, and for that, in my opinion, the T-14 is the best thing to come to tank design in the last few years.

The vehicle is built on the philosophy of Hull Down fighting and as such supposedly has incredibly thick turret armour to compensate for this specific role, no Challenger 2 (aside from some Blue-on-blue incidents) has been destroyed in active combat. So does this determine that Challenger 2 is the best tank in the world? No, because its all about how these tanks are deployed and who are operating them. The Challenger 2 operates at long range, Hull down to reduce its visibility and pick off targets at long range, an Iraqi T-55A isn’t going to reliably destroy a Challenger 2 in such a position because the Challenger 2 is using its designed role to the maximum effect and is basically “in its element” so to speak.Many people say the M1A2 Abrams is the best tank in the world citing its armour or its ammunition…which are all classified by the U.S Military, armour which is leaked is no longer adequte because rivalling nations could start developing new ammunition to defeat the armour, so when people claim the M1A2 Abrams is the best and cite these things I have a hard time being convinced because its totally classified and there is no way of knowing unless the U.S Government decides to declassify them which would happen after the armour is considered completely obsolete. The U.S military operates the M1A2 Abrams with lots of training and professionalism however the Saudi Arabian M1A2 Abrams are being knocked out relatively easily but this is because the U.S Military Tankers are signifcantly better trained and know how to operate their tank much better. The M1A2 Abrams cannot be determined as the best based on armour or gun performance data which we do not have access to and the same applies to Challenger 2, Leopard 2A7, Ariete, Leclerc and all the other MBT around the world.These tanks are certainlyNew innovation does not always mean the “Best MBT in the world” either, sure the T-14 Armata uses a fully remote controlled turret system with the Crew inside the Hull. The Jordanians however already developed a fully remote turret on the Challenger 1 called the “Falcon Turret” and was first revealed in 2003, long before the reveal of the T-14 Armata platform. The T-14 Armata is also (to no-ones surprise) a classified project, Western commentators can only guess at the effectiveness of the tank and judge any propaganda relating to it.So to answer the question there is no “Best MBT in the world” because every tank is constructed/purchased based on a Nations specific armour requirements and their armour philosophy. A tank which excells in Hull Down fighting with classified armour cannot be readily compared to a tank designed for all out assault with classified armour because there are no avaliable variables.This is why WW1, WW2 or the Cold War are much more interesting to compare because there is actual data avaliable for armour thicknesses and gun performance, we have the right variables and it can be fun to judge how well say a Centurion MK1 with a 20mm Polsten cannon would do against 500 Bob Semple tanks.Centurion MK1 with a Polsten Cannon in the coaxial mount, the Centurion is considered to be the father of the Modern MBT as its designated role rendered the mixed-match of Cromwells, Churchills, M10 “Achilles”, Fireflies and regular M4 Shermans entirely obsolete. Britain began focusing on the development and upgrading of Centurion through the late 1940s and towards the end of the 1950s.",6 followers,David Atwell,1.4K,1.4K,13.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-main-battle-tank-in-the-world-in-the-last-five-years
10,"The Leopard 2 hands down. Sporting probably the best and most tested smooth-bore cannon in the world (Rheinmetall 120mm), insane turret armor, and famous German reliability, it is also the most exported. It’s used by Sweden (Strv 122), Norway, Finland, Denmark, Netherlands, Hungary, Greece, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Austria, Canada, Chile, Qatar, Turkey, and Singapore. Over the years it has had many different models and upgrades, and is one of the more battle tested MBTs. Just like any tank it has its weaknesses, but within the past 5 years it is certainly the most consistent in reThe Leopard 2 hands down.

Just like any tank it has its weaknesses, but within the past 5 years it is certainly the most consistent in regards to performance and potential. The new Leopard 2A7+ is the most advanced MBT in the world (although not fully tested).Why not the Abrams? While it’s probably the most iconic, it carries a close second. It’s seen upgrades, but it has had logistical and operational issues in the past (namely sand vs. air intakes). The new SEP versions and exploration of the M1A3s role keeps it in the top tier though.The T-14 Armata? Does it actually work? Not entirely clear. It looks cool, has a pretty big bang bang stick (125 mm), and supposedly an excellent APS, but it has yet to be combat tested.Challenger 2? Needs upgrading. The Chobham armor was legendary a decade ago, new APFSDS and ATGMs have sort of downgraded it. There’s the new version, but there’s budget issues. The Brits still use their rifled guns though, which wears out faster.The Merkava is one of the more unique MBTs, with it’s engine in the wrong place. During Israel’s conflicts decades ago it was useful in protecting the crew (which were costly to train and find), but nowadays it’s a severe liability. The new Trophy APS looks pretty awesome though.I probably missed some other MBTs, but overall the Leopard 2 is the best. It should be noted that with a lack of significant armored conflict between nations since the Gulf War, a lot of these tanks have participated in asymmetrical warfare. When Russia and NATO duke it out, or China fights the US in the Pacific, things could change.","1,771 followers",Charles Jannuzi,593,8.1K,17.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-main-battle-tank-in-the-world-in-the-last-five-years
