Yesterday the multi-page websites were popular, today the trend for simplicity brought single-page apps back on the top, so I'll tell you a couple tips aboutProgressive Web ApplicationsThe world first heard about progressive web apps in 2015. The next year we met the pioneers of this technology, and in 2017 progressive Web Applications seem to have become the major competitor of native mobile apps.Progressive web appsOnline customer support2016 was the year of chatbots. 2018 will be the year of helpful chatbots. Since there are thousands of bots out now, the quality of their services will be the next web development trend.The prediction is that 85% of all customer interactions will proceed without human assistance till 2020.A customer service chatbot becomes a must on almost every website. Whether you are selling electronics, crocheted toys or software development services, you should have a chatbot.Static websitesYou definitely remember the concept of a static website from the early years of the World Wide Web. All the first websites on the Internet were static.But then the era of dynamic websites began.Websites became more functional and easier to update even for people with no technical background. At the same time, the development process became more complicated, as the extended functionality required communication with the server, so backend development got involved. Modern CMSs are the actual dynamic websitesNowadays, the web is returning to its roots. Static websites are becoming the web development trend of 2018 again.Single-page websitesAnother web development trend for simplicity is single-page websites. This solution allows putting all the content onto one long scrollable page, removing any clutter.One-page websites have a bunch of advantages. They don’t challenge the visitor with complex navigation, multi-level menu, and tons of text. The essential information is all on one page. The user only has to scroll to it.Of course, the use-cases of single-pagers are limited. This type of website will not suit e-commerce projects and blogs. At the same time, businesses can significantly benefit, presenting their services in a simplified and more engaging manner.Push notifications for websitesMobile apps notifications turned out to be a highly efficient means of user re-engagement. And recently this idea has been implemented for websites and is becoming new web development trend.The workflow looks quite simple: the user visits a website and is offered to enable push notifications. The user will then be notified of any changes on the website (like a new blog post or a private message), even after he has closed the tab with that website.The major benefit of such a technology is obvious - you can keep the user engaged without big efforts.Flash to HTMLIn 2010 Steve Jobs published hisThe major weakness of this technology is the incompatibility with mobile devices. An enormous amount of traffic is lost just because of the outdated technology.Motion UISimplicity is the trend in recent years. This is also true for web design. Users are already tired of crazy GIFs and flashing ads, that’s why websites with moderate design get more appreciation.At the same time, sophisticated motion UI is becoming more popular. Animations allow to add more style and enable you to distinguish your website from the thousands of others with the static UI.There are several ways to add some life to your minimalistic website. Consider page header transitions, nice hovers, animated charts, background animations and modular scrolling. These and many other elements may make your web presence much more enjoyable for users. The true artwork!JavaScript - Angular 2 and Angular 4JavaScript is the number one programming language for web applications. With dozens of JS-related technologies already existing and still in development, it will even strengthen its positions. The highly anticipated release of the last years Angular 2 becomes highly appreciated in modern web development.We met Angular 2 in 2016. It is a complete rewrite of the AngularJS framework. The main advantages are improved modularity, app architecture scalability,PHP 7.x - Laravel 5.xPHP remains the popular choice for website backend development. This programming language has improved its positions even further after the release of version 7.x. The latest update of the PHP framework Laravel 5.x is a recognized web development trend in 2018.Laravel is the most popular open-source PHP web framework. All the benefits of it can be fully experienced on dynamic websites with complicated backend.Laravel offers ready solutions for complex tasks. The variety of existing packages makes the development process faster and more reliable. Regular updates ensure that the framework complies with the current needs of the website owners and the requirements of the time.Also I decided to describe the anti-trends of the year as well.

Three calls signs get special treatment, basically like being an emergency all the time, and those are “Air Force One,” “Air Force Two” (VP), and “Executive One Foxtrot.” Those call signs do NOT get put in holding patterns or delayed. EVER! Controllers are supposed to know that, ESPECIALLY a DC area controller.I was flying Betty Ford and the two youngest Ford kids home to Andrews AFB in August on one of those horrid days with thunderstorms cells all over the place—Washington was getting pounded. We were coming in from the west, which meant we had to dodge all the buildups across the whole area to get to ADW on the far eastern side.INSANELY BUSY FREQUENCY:Machine gun words.This is a complicated radio call, too, not short and sweet. It has to include a radial, a distance, an altitude, a direction and a time to expect to get out of holding. The pilots then, technically, have to read it all back, which would further tie up the radio. But these were experienced pros, seasoned enough to reply with not much more than “Roger,” and the controller was happy to let them be brief.BREAKING IN:I listened to the rhythm of the calls and after about four sets of machine-gun holding instructions, I finally sensed a moment to key my mic, “Washington Approach, Executive One Foxtrot at eight thousand.”“Executive One Foxtrot, hold at eight thousand on the blah, blah, blah radial at blah, blah miles, left turns, expect further clearance at blah, blah, blah.” The time was about 45 minutes away. I don’t know what else he said because I didn’t need that crap, because I wasn't going to hold.“Negative, Approach. Executive One Foxtrot will proceed to Andrews on a 140 heading, deviating a couple of times to dodge buildups, then descend on the other side of the Potomac and turn north into Andrews.”“Executive One Foxtrot. Negative, negative! We’ve got traffic stacked up all over the area. Hold at eight thousand on the blah, blah, blah radial at blah, blah miles, left turns, expect further clearance at blah, blah, blah.”“Negative, Approach. Executive One Foxtrot will proceed direct Andrews as I said before.”This poor guy was about to pop a gasket.“EXECUTIVE ONE FOXTROT. NEGATIVE. NEGATIVE. NEGATIVE. IMMEDIATELY ACKNOWLEDGE THE HOLDING INSTRUCTIONS AND PROCEED AS DIRECTED.”I figured I needed to say my call sign very slowly so the supervisor on the frequency would hear me, jump in, and save this guy from himself.“Approach. This—in a slow and clear voice—is Executive. One. Foxtrot. We will proceed direct Andrews on this 140 heading, then we’ll descend and turn northbound after we cross the Potomac.”THAT DID THE TRICK:“Executive One Foxtrot, roger, proceed as you stated. Do you need to deviate while you’re on the 140?”“Roger, we’ll have to deviate a bit left and right on that heading, but we can basically hold it until we’re south of Andrews, then turn north on our own. We’ll stay at eight thousand until we cross the Potomac. We won’t bother you folks with vectors or anything else.”“Roger, Executive One Foxtrot, cleared as stated. My apologies for that, sir, he’s brand new to the DC area. That won’t happen again.”He obviously did not want me to have the White House call him when I landed. I have no doubt that young controller never made that mistake again.I always wondered what the airline pilots on the frequency thought about that exchange because I knew that “Executive One Foxtrot” is not even as remotely well know as the other two special Andrews call signs.ADDENDUM A FEW HOURS AFTER I POSTED THIS:Anyway!Clearly, the tone of my writing comes across here to some people as being a jerk. Being wrong. Being elitist. Wow! How in the hell am I an elitist for following the rules?On the other hand, perhaps me flying the First Lady actually makes me elite. Could be. If so, then, sure, I accept being an elitist. The 89th is known as an “elite” flying unit.And where did you get that I yelled at the guy? You can’t actually do that over a radio anyway. I always thought it was cool that all I did was say my call sign clear and drawn out, hoping a supervisor would hear me and bail this guy out. And he did. I didn’t call him names. I said nothing to him except the facts.His supervisor jumped in, and that was the end of the story. I’ve re-read it a few times and I’m missing the part where I’m a jerk. So, I guess that makes me not only an elitist, but a clueless elitist, too! The worst kind. I’m awful.COUNTLESS EXCELLENT ONES:In my 42 years of flying I’ve had EXACTLY ONE!But I cannot count the times that controllers have gone above and beyond to help me. Especially, the one time I had to declare an emergency. I knew that controllers were supposed to help, but I was BLOWN AWAY by all that they did.I called after I landed and asked to talk to the lady who handled me so I could thank her. They were so casual about it, like it was no big deal because it was so routine to them. Her supervisor barely remembered it less than an hour later. He said, “Okay, I’ll tell her you called.”To me, they’d just saved two lives, but to them it was just another day on the job.It was not my intent to disparage controllers. I actually thought it was sort of funny that this new guy got an education into working the DC area.Do you nasty commenters not get that it is the law that Air Force One, Air Force Two, and Executive One Foxtrot get privileges not granted to any other aircraft? If that pisses you off, write to your Senators and leave me the hell alone.So go ahead and post your slams if you feel offended by this little story. But from my perspective, it’s just a fun look at life in the pointy end of jet.

The difference is one wakes up in the year 2018 and the other wakes up in 1818.The latter wakes up chilly, to the sound of a rooster crowing, from a bed of straw he shares with lots of bedbugs. Neither his night shirt nor his bedding is terribly clean, and he splashes water on his face from a bowl to help wake up before looking outside to try to guess what the weather will be like today. He, like all of his family and most people he knows, is a farmer, so the weather matters a lot to him, and any other news will be a long time coming, including that his brother, who lives just a couple towns away, broke his leg a few days back and passed away from an infection. He works from sun up to sundown because he has little machinery and he would probably work longer if he had access to something better than candles to provide light.Our other man wakes up in 2018 to the sound of an alarm clock, he is not hot or cold because his home has central heating. His pajamas and bedding are quite clean because he has a washer and dryer. He is a bit groggy because he can light his home at the flick of a switch so often stays up later than he should. Fortunately he has hot coffee and a hot shower to help him wake up, and he checks his email while drinking that coffee and listening to the news and weather. He already knows his brother broke his leg a few days back, even though he lives a long distance away, and of course he does not die from an infection, he’s just at home bored and probably would welcome a phone call.These are two very different lives. They are separated by three centuries, a dozen generations, and a slew of inventions both major and minor. Those inventions, major and minor, have altered our civilization profoundly during that time. My answer however is not those inventions, but rather the ones emerging nowadays that will change our lives once more, many of which get little notice in the news.Even those emerging technologies that get reported with much pomp and hype often bypass a lot of the simple yet drastic changes they will bring to how we go about our normal day. A survey of technologies that don’t get talked about a lot, but will change the world we live in, requires introducing those technologies and explaining the potential of each. The trick is that technologies that don’t get a lot of fanfare don’t get it because their value and applications are not too obvious. Fundamentally, technology is about making our lives better, safer, and more convenient. To talk about the impact technology will have on our lives we need to go deeper than just what the technology does, like how a fusion reactor makes electricity cheaper and renewable, an obvious benefit, but also how it alters our day to day life. Cheaper electricity is awesome, an energy source that doesn’t run out or cause environmental problems is awesome, but it is easy to overlook all the other benefits that come along with them.We need to cover several such technologies. So to do this we will walk through a day in the life of two people, Sam, who lives nowadays in the year 2018, and Hannah, who lives just a few generations from now inOkay,What’s interesting about Sam and Hannah’s lives is that they both live in a pretty automated and high tech civilization.We spend a lot of time on this answer talking about futures in Hannah’s Era or even centuries further ahead, and we tend to focus on big things. New spaceships, new energy sources, giant constructs we could build around our own star or other stars and the ships that will get you there. Not today though, for today it does not matter that Ted was actually playing golf in a rotating habitat orbiting the Earth, complaining about how the spin throws off his normal swing. We care that his golf partner was actually lying down at home on his bed playing with him in virtual reality, and that he, Ted, and Hannah were thousands of kilometers apart, but all felt like they were in the same environment chatting, even though they were not in the same place and quite possibly all saw different environments. We don’t care that they have rocket ships with big fusion powered drives that can get to Mars in a week, we care about them having cars they can sleep in, fully relaxed in the knowledge that it could drive through a blizzard without a risk of accident and that if one did somehow happen, a dozen safety systems would pop on deploying airbags and restraints before the vehicle even hit the target, and that if somehow even that wasn’t enough, an automated ambulance would be on the scene in moments with robots controlled by experts hundreds of kilometers away piloting them, and already knowing from the vehicle monitors exactly what happened and where all the injuries were and how severe. We also don’t particularly care that Hannah’s son can do classes online, we already have ever-improving technology allowing that. We care about the automated interactive aspects of that, something called Affective Computing, or computers and systems that can recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human body language and affects. Fundamentally it is this sort of technology that holds the strongest potential to revolutionize our lives.Sure, a student can watch a recorded lecture and pick from several variations of it by other people covering that same topic, just as you can do now on YouTube for instance. But it is aThe Uncanny Valley, our tendency to respond more negatively to things which seem closer to human than further away, is a big hurdle to making such simulations, but if you can get past it, you open the door for books that don’t just get read aloud by some cold disjointed voice, but can be real-time performed like a TV show or interactive virtual environment without needing actors. It’s a lot easier to learn the history of the world when instead of a book or lecture or even historical TV drama, a person can land in that environment where the bits they find boring can be seamlessly detected and altered, so they remain focused on the important knowledge while enjoying themselves. It’s nice to have a test that doesn’t need to have questions checking your reading comprehension, because it already knows what that was from monitoring you while you read, and even nicer if most text can adapt as you’re reading it to rephrase the information or the question to better communicate to you as an individual. It’s like the automatic translator that doesn’t just hear what someone said in another language and translate it word for word, but instead can convert all the idioms and expressions into another language and its own idioms and expressions. It will be even cooler if one day we can just download knowledge and skills into your head, like in the film theWe didn’t focus on cool new power production methods like fusion today, we focused on ways to conveniently get power. Wireless energy transmission by magnetic induction or energy beaming, smaller and better batteries and solar panels, or harvesting energy right from the person. Leaching just a little energy away from every motion, maybe even putting devices in the body that could steal a bit of energy from your own food to transmit it to devices in or on you. IPredicting the future of technology is always a hit and miss game, often in hindsight the stuff is obvious, but can’t be predicted in advance. Some technology and its impact is easy enough to predict, but what makes them inaccurate in most cases is all those tiny secondary advantages and changes and those tend to focus on human desire and convenience. It’s not that hard to predict faster computers, the internet, satellites, or cell phones. What’s hard to predict is people using those to post a picture of what they ate for lunch. Once you do, you can imagine that a lot of restaurants will advertise online and show photos of the menu. It will seem obvious in hindsight that someone is going to make a piece of software that can look at that image and make some smart guesses about its nutritional value and calorie count. It will seem obvious in hindsight that as we get more Affective Computing able to monitor your reactions, your computer will get better at showing you bits of stuff on your social media newsfeed that you’ll enjoy, and that advertisers will be able to hit you with an ad showing a picture of pizza with the toppings you like when you are just getting a little hungry and haven’t had pizza recently, and tomorrow you’ll get shown sandwiches instead. It’s predictable that 3D printers, and fast, cheap, delivery might put a dent in classic retail shopping. It’s predictable that automated vehicles, not needing expensive drivers, will make it much cheaper to deliver things or take a taxi, so that fewer people might own individual vehicles.It’sHowever, it is very easy for us miss a lot of those secondary applications that can quietly sneak in there to revolutionize our lives just as much as landing on the Moon did, or going to Mars will.Have a great day (10 april 2018) !","246,825 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-upcoming-technologies-and-trends-we-are-expecting-in-the-web-development
