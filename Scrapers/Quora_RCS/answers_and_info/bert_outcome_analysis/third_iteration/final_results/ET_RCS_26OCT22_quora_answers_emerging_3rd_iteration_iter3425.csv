0,"Essentially, in ‘escalation order’.Essentially, in ‘escalation order’.This, really, is where the “normal”process pretty much ends. Further note that not all steps might happen in order. Any department can directly call the national guard if they need too. In reality, outside of comic books, no criminal is going to be able to deal with the national guard. Hell, state police is almost always the end of it. (Off the top of my head, I can’t think of a time that the national guard was actually used because of an individual or small group of criminals being “more than the police can handle” Usually they are called up for things like riot control, when more manpower, not technical capability, is needed. The closest incidents I can think of are the “killdozer” incident in colorado, and the Tank Rampage in San Diego, where calling the national guard was at least considered. However, in both cases, regular law enforcement was able to deal with the problem.)If things are past that point, it’s the pentagon. This is complicated by the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the military from performing law enforcement functions on US soil.

Not millions of years?Yes. Provided that we continue (a) existing and (b) advancing in technology, by the middle of this century, we will have access to our entire genome, nano-technology (or at the very least, micro-robotics) and AI. Those technologies, if we try really hard to extrapolate their logical course, mean that at some point in the next few centuries, there will be no more homo sapiens. Perhaps a few “museum humans” will choose to remain in their old form, but those beings will live on Earth or space stations, too frail and ephemeral; too needy to package into dense vessels for interstellar travel.If our descendants survive, they will adjust their genome. Maybe it won’t become prosaic until 2125, but at some point very soon, the temptation to remove all “negative” traits will be overwhelming. The temptation to enhance with some genetic coding from other beasts will become overwhelming. The temptation to enhance with artificial bits —that connect us to instant information, right to the brain— will be overwhelming. The temptation to create new biological features un-imagined by “Mother Nature” wholly invented by us and our super-advanced computer technology (maybe a new cell wall, completely re-engineered mitochondria, or a cell part that we cannot imagine today) will become overwhelming.At some point, after sufficient changes, we won’t be human any longer. We certainly won’t be homo sapiens. We’ll be something else … IF “we” survive that long and continue advancing technologically. A global disaster could destroy our civilization but leave a few hundred thousand of us thrown back the equivalent of five millennia. But if we survive and continue advancing, then homo sapiens is done in a few centuries at the longest; a century at the shortest.At some point in time, the advancing technology will unlock self-assembling, self-making robotics that leverage exponential growth that will either be our end or our elevation to the pinnacle of abilities in this cosmos. With lives extended to the many millennia, with intelligences in VR and AI’s meandering about the solar system, “time” won’t have the same cachet as it does today. A journey at .01c, taking 1,000–1,500 years to cross the gulf between stars will be meaningless in the lives of those beings — beings that are effectively immortal who see time as a non-obstacle.Those beings, if they end up coming into existence, will achieve interstellar travel.

Today's principle of nuclear fission reactor power generation is not fundamentally different from steam engines hundreds of years ago! Regardless of the current thermal power or nuclear power, it is heating water: heat converts water into steam, and the steam drives the turbine to generate electricity. (Note: The conversion rate of nuclear fission we use today is only 0.135%)It is most likely that human beings will not be able to ""go out"" the solar system, and even be ""trapped"" to die on earth!The nuclear fusion conversion rate is 0.7%. If nuclear fusion power generation is realized, it may alleviate the current energy crisis. It is not enough for interstellar flight. (Note: As science fiction says that ""Positive and Anti-Matter Annihilation"" is the most efficient, can achieve 100% quality conversion, can help us fly out of the solar system. )Realistically, if we fail to master the controllable nuclear fusion before depleting fossil energy, it is not only ""Civilization Retrogression,"" but the entire human sci and tech civilization will be ""locked out"" until we die. Because in those days we will be unable to ""organize higher-scale industrialization"" and not be able to further test our scientific theory.Human beings are powerless and insignificant. Think of Traveler 1, the man-made object farthest from the Earth, and the fastest man-made object. It takes 40,000 years to fly to the AC+79 3888 star of Ophiuchus. It takes 73,600 to fly to Proxima Centauri of Centaur. The interstellar voyage for it is just a simple fantastic lies. How negligible us? Please be humble~As for interstellar travel, if the person who does not wear the spacesuit leaves the surface layer, just like ""The deep sea fish leave the deep sea will detonate himself"", yes, in any other environment, the human body will be vulnerable to ""cannot withstand even a single blow"". Hey, we humans are the creatures born in the surface environment. We are destined to be inseparable from such environment, and it is even more difficult to cross the ""space measured by light years."" The earth is the cradle of humankind and it will surely be our destination and cemetery.Almost all of the Earthian is still bound by gravity, and it is difficult to fly out of it.Humans used to go to the moon with ""The primeval Chemical Rocket,"" but never went to Mars. Most people are trapped in the earth's tiny plot of land, let alone the universe.Although we can now ""observe dozens of billions of light years of the universe"", no matter how influential bigwigs can't leave the earth. They can only be like the common people who feet can't leave the ground. Exhausting the limits of the power of human tech can barely enough landing on the moon, its number can be counted on the fingers of one hand.The natural resources in the universe are inexhaustible, but we can only divide into some hostile factions, scheme against each other, intrigued, mutual suspicion, resorting to deception… excessive competition for such a little bit of unremarkable resource on earth. The human civilization at this stage is still too primitive.I really want to ""strive for the cause of human civilization in the universe all my lifetime"", but now I can only ""work for the sake of making a living and fortune"", such a life is not reconciled.We even have not been able to explore the earth.In terms of crustal exploration, the deepest borehole that our drilled has just reached more than 10,000 meters depth. Our drill bit with difficulty went to the bottom of the crust for humans and took a look at the edge of the mantle. This depth is only equivalent to ""The worm takes a bite of apple peel."" This is why we cannot predict earthquakes because even the ""normal state"" of the crust can only be inferred by indirect evidence, and the judgment of its ""abnormal state"" is even more unreliable.…SummaryIt seems that some of today inventions of ""redoubtable and formidable"" are mostly the advancement of Applied Science, not the progress of Basic Science. The development of personal computers is only consistently integrated and shrinking smaller, supercomputers are always stacking and piled up, naturally, their computing performance is strengthened…But quantitative change is unlikely to trigger a qualitative change. It won't bring us quantum computers.The so-called ""innovative tide and creative spoondrift"" is just something ""in application-level."" Basic theory has been stagnant for a long time, and superstring theory has not progressed for many years. In any case, ""Basic Theory"" is the ""source power"" of human sci and tech development.

In fact, you don't even need any fancy technology; the human eye can, in principle, detect a single photon. (SeeHowever, detecting gravitons is much (much much etc...) harder. A famous example (seeOkay, you say, so let's just make that detector (sometime in the far future when we have the technology to do so) and wait for 100 years. There's a crucial detail that I forgot to mention, however. The star also emits neutrinos in addition to gravitons; in fact, many more neutrinos than gravitons. And neutrinos are much easier to detect than gravitons. In fact, we can calculate that for every graviton that is detected in this scenario, aroundAh, you say, but we can build a neutrino shield and block the neutrinos! But such a shield would need to have a thickness of several light years, and if you try to make it more dense in order to fit between the star and the detector, it would collapse into a black hole...In conclusion, even with insanely advanced futuristic technology, it would simply be impossible to detect a graviton.What we have been able to detect, though, are gravitational waves. This amazing discovery by the LIGO experiment was announced on February 11 2016. Gravitational waves are made of lots and lots of gravitons, just like electromagnetic waves are made of lots and lots of photons. A typical gravitational wave is composed of roughly 1,000,000,000,000,000 gravitons per cubic centimeter, therefore it is obviously much easier to detect than a single graviton.On the other hand, we definitely do not have the technology to detect individual gravitons, and unless some new ingenious way to detect them is found, we will never be able to do so even with much more advanced technology.What are the consequences of this technological impossibility to detect gravitons? As it turns out, it doesn't really matter! Let me explain.First, where exactly do gravitons appear in physics? Theoretical physicists are trying to combine general relativity and quantum mechanics into a single theory, called quantum gravity. We do not have a final theory of quantum gravity yet, but we are working very hard on it, and we already understand many aspects of what such a theory should be.In a theory of quantum gravity, gravitons are the quanta of the gravitational field. Therefore, quantum gravity will use gravitons as part of its formulation, just like the theory of quantum electrodynamics uses photons, which are the quanta of the electromagnetic field.However, we did not confirm quantum electrodynamics experimentally by detecting photons. Quantum electrodynamics produces predictions that are different from those of classical electrodynamics, and by experimentally testing these predictions we have been able to confirm that the electromagnetic field is indeed quantized.In a similar way, when we finally have a good candidate for a theory of quantum gravity, it will produce predictions that are different from those of classical gravity. By experimentally testing these predictions, we will be able to confirm that the gravitational field is quantized.In other words, what we need to do is not detect gravitons; we need to test the predictions of a theory of quantum gravity, as soon as we have such a theory. This will indirectly confirm the existence of gravitons.(Note: this is a duplicate of my answer to",59 followers,Peter Graham,756,0,0,2016,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-many-of-the-future-men-are-around-us-but-we-have-not-been-able-to-detect-them-due-to-our-less-advanced-technology
