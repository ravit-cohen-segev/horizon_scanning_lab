The reality is that we almost never need a color print. (Or I want photo quality that home printers can’t do anyway).Here’s the deal: Don’t buy an inkjet printer if you want a reliable printer (unless you know exactly what you are doing… and you don’t). Making an inkjet at an affordable price requires a stupendous number of design compromises that make them unreliable and stupidly expensive per page. I’ll argue that in spite of their higher costs, color laser printers areBut all printers are shockingly complicated bits of kit, with countless mechanical parts that have to work under less than ideal conditions with exceptional repeatable accuracy, and with a user base that basically never performs any sort of maintenance on them.","16,453 followers",Chris Everett,1.9K,11K,78.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-is-the-next-technology-phase-in-printers
1,"Because printers are made of compressed misery and filled with liquid evil.Look a printer is a complicated precision mechanism that has to be able to pluck individual sheets of paper off a stack, move them in perfect synchronism past some sort of mark making apparatus, turn the paper through corners without smudging or distorting the image, and deposit them in an output tray ready to be picked up by an anthropoid ape who expects them to be immediately handleable.now look at this:Until the current chip shortage these were costing around £50.Do you really expect something banged out for around £Because printers are made of compressed misery and filled with liquid evil.Look a printer is a complicated precision mechanism that has to be able to pluck individual sheets of paper off a stack, move them in perfect synchronism past some sort of mark making apparatus, turn the paper through corners without smudging or distorting the image, and deposit them in an output tray ready to be picked up by an anthropoid ape who expects them to be immediately handleable.now look at this:Until the current chip shortage these were costing around £50.Do you really expect something banged out for around £20 works cost to be reliable at such a complicated task?You need to spend a bit more. I usually supply these:They are jolly reliable, so long as you obey the rules. I have seen someone get 250,000 prints out of one of these without bother.Then the next customer was putting sheets back in to print on the other side, having dabbed tip-ex on unwanted marks. This got transferred to, and ruined the transfer belt. Replacement cost as much as a new machine, though misuse..The more you pay for a printer, and the better you treat it, the more reliable it will be. Start putting cheap paper in and the dust will clog things up. Buy aftermarket or refilled ink cartridges at your peril. I recall a £2000 printer installed in a conservatory, whose extremes of temperature swings bent all the plastic parts in under 3 months. The manufacturer looked at all the sun-bleached panels and accused us of trying to get warranty on a ten-year-old machine. (the serial number had bleached off too).","135,506 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.5M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-is-the-next-technology-phase-in-printers

I might be biased here, but I think a lot of the hurdles around the barriers to entry have started to break down and we’ll start seeing some mainstreaming of AI services.A Legitimate candidate for President of the United States will seriously begin to start speaking about the impact of Automation and AI on the economy.We’ve largely been ignoring this conversation on a national level, with only academics and the Tech Industry having a dialogue about this.While we’re not looking at major unemployment due to automation, we should still expect some workplace disruption as industries change and workers need to be retrained. Look back at the coal industries’ rapid fall in the 2000s and how difficult it was, and is, to retrain workers and move them to new locations for work. It’s been said by many others, many workers drive a vehicle for a living. While these won't all go away overnight if say 10–20% of these jobs are lost to automation then we’ll see real disruption.No doom and gloom, I don’t see mass unemployment, but disruption is bound to happen.I could probably list off more, but this is a good place to start.Cheers.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Do-we-need-Advanced-AI-for-the-next-technologically-jump-2019
5,"As a 68-year-old recently retired Silicon Valley engineer with a M.S. in Computer Science from Texas A&M University that focused on AI, I have a surprising answer for you to that question. We are no closer to strong AI today then we were in the 1970s. It is not clear that we will ever be closer. That is the reason why the field has shifted to machine learning. That field has entirety different goals than strong AI.The assumption that human-style thinking is algorithmic and independent of the underlying hardware is probably false.

6,"Yes, our fate is inevitable.Humans have been at the top of nature's food chain for a long time.Why is that?We aren't the physically strongest species on this Earth.

A cheetah's leisurely sleep walk is faster than the fastest man in the world.We aren't the most venomous species.

I think an elephant would prefer our bite over a king cobra's any day of the week.We aren't the most durable species. Cockroaches can survive through extreme amounts of radiation.We don't have any interesting built-in biological defenses either. Skunks have their farts, porcupines have their spikes, and peacocks have their feathers.Humans are fragile. The vast majority of animals in this world could kill us effortlessly given the opportunity to do so, yet we still stand as the most dominant species. What do we have that others don't?TheThrough our intellect, we are able to domesticate other species for our own selfish needs such as entertainment and food. We manipulate animals to do as we please by enticing them with their most primal biological need, food. That Shamu at SeaWorld is content with doing flips because it is rewarded with constant treats. The chicken in the slaughterhouse copes with the trauma by being fed until it can't eat anymore.What happens when a new species that outperforms us physically AND intellectually is introduced into the ecosystem? They will domesticate us, exactly how we domesticate other animals.I present to you ladies and gentlemen, AI.Let me explain why AI is superior physically and intellectually.Machines do all of the strenuous physical labor for us, from cranes that carry metal beams to build skyscrapers to car crushers that squash old cars like printer paper. There is no doubt they possess more strength than us, and their limits are endless. Machines are very durable. If a robot's arm is blown off, the robot does not die. We can simply replace the arm with a new arm as if nothing happened. If a human's arm is blown off, he/she will die from blood loss. Who would win in a fight with Connor McGreggor and the villain from Terminator 3? I think the answer is obvious.Machines are starting to get smarter too. A computer can do millions of computations in a matter of seconds, and machine learning allows robots to learn with experience like a baby. Put those two things together and it is possible for a 30 minute old robot to have as much experience as a 100 year old man given the abundance of data on the web. Now put this intellect into an iron, replaceable body and you have the next ruler of the universe.Imagine a scientist who is planning on shutting down a robot because its getting too smart. In a matter of seconds, the robot downloads every single possible human portrayal of body language and facial expression, learns what they mean, analyzes the scientist's behavior, and decides the scientist's intentions are malicious. Then, analyzes every single possible outcome that ensures the its survival and chooses the most optimal one. The scientist is toast because he can't analyze every single outcome. The human brain does not have the capacity to do that, and instead reacts to events in real time. The robot then reverse manipulates the scientist by touching on his biggest insecurities, which defuses the situation. If the robot already had a strong body, the robot would utilize its physical advantage.Of course we aren't at this stage yet. We are still struggling with Alexa commands as it does not play the right song half of the time, but as history has shown, technological innovation always moves forward and never backward. We could warn everyone to stop working on advancing AI, but if someone doesn't do it, someone else will for power and profit. It is ironic how a species so obsessed with maintaining power is working relentlessly on creating another species that will steal that power. We are too blinded by our own ego and selfish desires to see the big picture from an objective point of view.The question is notHopefully not in my lifetime...","45,623 followers",David Seidman,790,3.6K,85.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Do-we-need-Advanced-AI-for-the-next-technologically-jump-2019

Both machine learning and the robotization of manufacturing processes are disrupting the way businesses operate as we speak.In March and April, Amazon hired 175,000 workers to manage a surge in online shopping. Firms offering products to facilitate telemedicine and online learning also took on scores of new employees. Many of these will stay, just as many pandemic-linked lay-offs will become permanent. There has been a surge in expected job reallocation from January to April, with 42% of lay-offs linked to the pandemic likely to prove permanent. Similarly,There can be little doubt about this.

Similarly, the shift to remote work prompted by covid-19 will leave a lasting impression. Of the hiring managers surveyed by Upwork, 62% say their workforce will be more remote than before the pandemic. (Source: The Economist)Ideally, these changes should allow humans to focus on the more creative and fulfilling aspects of work, delegating the more humdrum activities to machines, freeing us up to work less and focus of more rewarding and satisfying pursuits.Sadly, that is not how things work under the current dispensation. Businesses will simply look for ways to eliminate workers and subject their employees to a survival of the cheapest in a downward spiral. Without direct ‘government of the people’ intervention, the best ordinary citizens can hope for is some type of minimal universal basic income designed to stop us calling in the tumbrels.The majority of people need to have a job for their own self-esteem as much as to earn a living.
