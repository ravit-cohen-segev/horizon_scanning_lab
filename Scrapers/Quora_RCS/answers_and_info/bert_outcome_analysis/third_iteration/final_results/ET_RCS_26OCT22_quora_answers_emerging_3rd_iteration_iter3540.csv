1,"Part of the problem is that science fiction is always wrong. We really don’t know what’s going to come next. And that’s OK; the genre is more about what we hope for and fear than really about where we’ll end up. It just means that SF starts to look dated after a while. As a case in point, hardly anyone in science fiction saw the information technology revolution coming. Before cyberpunk rolled through, most treatments of information technology involve human-like robots and other bits of automatic machinery, but nothing in the way of the kind of global data sharing we have today.The other partPart of the problem is that science fiction is always wrong.

2,"It is important to note that the events in Star Wars happened a “Long Time Ago” and it is a fantasy movie, not a science fiction movie. It is not meant to portray our future or our future technology. Lucas wanted the set pieces and props to look well-worn and realistic more than futuristic. So usually commonplace items were repurposed into something else. Sometimes this makes something look “advanced” like the landspeeder, but other times it came across as just “alien” like the adobe buildings people lived in on Tatooine.

It's using laminar flow of a gas through the hilt, which is ignites and then burns at 4000 degrees Fahrenheit.In other words it's extremely dangerous. But it can cut through steel and keeps its shape when you swing it around. And by adding certain salts you can change the colour of the flame as well.So it's shiny, can cut metals, and lWell, some guy built a lightsaberYouTuber creates real-life ‘Star Wars’ lightsaber that slices steelUnfortunately you would have to carry a huge backpack around that contains everything to make it work, including a pipe to the hilt for the gases to flow through.

There cannot ever be a logical explanation. In Trek, the computer AI would move a trillion times faster than a human, yet Worf is still pushing the “fire” button on torpedoes.
