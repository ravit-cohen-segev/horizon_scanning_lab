What are the top life altering products/technologies in each of the past 3 decades?Past 3 decades?Huh? What’s #3 you may ask?#3 is what allows us to have photovoltaic solar power, wind power, variable speed motors, electric cars, DC adapters that are the size of a sugar cube, and so on. The ability to adjust voltage and frequency while maintaining small sized components - it’s really what is causing electricity to be the #1 method of powering everything, rather than having portable internal combustion engines.Now we won’t be able to replace it everywhere - for example, we aren’t going to have electric airplanes any time soon - but it’s a more efficient way for most things. Consider trains - high-speed trains running on electricity from overhead wires don’t need to carry any of the fuel required to make them go that fast - and for maglev trains, the amount of energy for the magnetic levitation is a small fraction of what’s used to move the train forward.The revolution of computing which started in the 1980’s is also now starting to pay dividends - through simulation and CAD systems, including 3D modeling, we can now make everything better and more efficient without the tedious trial and error required in evolution by building things and testing them. This is why car engines today are more powerful and more efficient than ever - because with more computing power and accurate simulation, we can optimize design before building the first prototype.",3 followers,Steve Baker,556,27.4K,163.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/The-1920s-brought-cars-and-talkies-the-1930s-radio-and-air-travel-and-the-1950s-television-What-are-the-top-life-altering-products-technologies-in-each-of-the-past-3-decades

Being able to safely store food meant gathering food was no longer a daily task and food could be shipped more than a few day’s travel. The ability to cool food stops disease from growing. Refrigeration was a huge piece of the puzzle in ending famine.1920s: The gasoline and diesel engine.

The model T didn’t reach peak production until the mid 1920s.1930s: The chocolate chip cookie. The tollhouse cookie dates to 1938. This product has had such a huge impact across the world that you can’t measure it’s reach.1940s: The electric washing machine and dryer. While it’s older you can’t undervalue this technology and it began it’s boom postwar. The amount of effort to clean and dry clothes was replaced by a few hours mixed in with other tasks. Can you imagine the world today if an entire day was dedicated to laundry across the entire world? Every home once had clothes hanging outside throughout the week.1950s: the transistor. Nearly every part of our daily life contains or is created by an item containing a transistor. Computing grew off this one item1960s: heart transplants began. It’s not unfair to see the 1960s as the beginning of the modern medical era. 1 in 3 Americans died from the disease in 1960 and is the leading cause of death in many countries to this day so advances around heart health alone has been hugely impactful.1970s: telecommunications. television and radio grew rapidly, fiber optics were invented and the arpanet grew rapidly. The abiliity to communicate around the world can’t be understated.1980s: Widespread vaccination. We are seeing the result of this in play right now. Billions of people are alive today because their parents were vaccinated worldwide from the 1960s to 80s. In 1980s worldwide around 20% of one year olds were vaccinated for a few diseases like polio, measles. By 1990 that was around 75%.1990s: The Internet. There’s no technology that has changed life worldwide more and it grew no less than 100-fold in this decade. In 1990 a school might have had a couple computers to learn to type. By 1999 more affluent schools would have dozens if not hundreds of computers all connected to the Internet. online shopping, social media, online gaming all started their rise in this decade.2000s: The digital camera and camcorder. Video recording is a few decades older but imagine the world without the ability to record everything easily. Criminal justice has been upended with ubiquitous security cameras. As recent as the 1990s people might take a few hundred photos a year. Digitally that could become thousands. Reporting new moved from professionals to everyone being able to share worldwide.2010s: Handheld computing and GPS. This combination has been life changing. The ability to know where you are and have computing systems that can give information based on this has upended society. Being able to put it in your pocket in one device changed everything.",33 followers,Dawson Perry,602,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/The-1920s-brought-cars-and-talkies-the-1930s-radio-and-air-travel-and-the-1950s-television-What-are-the-top-life-altering-products-technologies-in-each-of-the-past-3-decades

11,"Talking “less” isn't alone a good measure of smartness. There are 3 kinds of people who talk less:Smart peopleTalking “less” isn't alone a good measure of smartness. There are 3 kinds of people who talk less:Smart peopleBut with smart people, it doesn't feel like they “talk less”. The few words they say are on topic and relevant to the situation, and they are informative.Manipulative peopleManipulators talk like this because:So, such people hide facts and don't speak logically. TheyAt the same time, they hide even the possibility of anyone asking questions, and even try to stop others before they ask.Political typesThey speak ambiguously because they don't intend to makeHowever, due to their choice of wording and depending on their verbal intelligence, political types often make very confusing statements which can even mean the opposite of what they intended to talk about.One very rough example: I read a Facebook conversation. A guy who was presenting himself as “A social psychologist” asked “What is the single, most important trait you would like your ideal partner to have?”. A female CEO of a startup answered “To put aThen I looked at her page and she had some pictures where she looked like a dark character and a drama queen. Then I imagined she meant her ideal partner would be a guy dressed as a slave, wrapped in bondage ropes, cleaning, cooking, and looking after the house, with no income, no friends and no social life, and she would be dressed as a dominatrix whipping him, while he would be asking “Can I die now?” and she would say “No! “. Disgusting. In Trump slang, that’s a “true story, folks!” - although to clarify, all my stories are basically true. And her way to promote aggressive feminism is wrong.Another example of political-type talk is: “It’s a new day for democracy! “. It's always a new day anyway. A politician in a democratic country always talks about democracy. And the fact that it is new doesn’t say if it will be good or bad. It doesn’t say anything at all.A more recent example is Trump’s 2016 Presidential election slogan “Make American great again! “. A US politician's job is to work for the interest of America, so they could never say “Make America bad”. And is America “bad”? It depends on which point in time one compares it to, and against what criteria. Again, it doesn’t say anything at all.Either way, you can't identify smart people by the number of words, and you can't just talk less to sound smart. It starts from somewhere else, and then you find how much to talk.",UNKNOWN,Elson D'Souza,684,66,160.1K,2019,https://www.quora.com/The-1920s-brought-cars-and-talkies-the-1930s-radio-and-air-travel-and-the-1950s-television-What-are-the-top-life-altering-products-technologies-in-each-of-the-past-3-decades
12,"long story short - we spend the most creative years of our lives acquiring academic degrees rather than real knowledge which saps away our brainpower when it comes to creative thinking coupled with the Indian mindset of playing it safe as 90% of Indian kids are under family pressure from childhood to adulthood to make choices that are 'safe' rather than based on instinct. We are book smart and hard working, but we channelize our energies in finding that elusive safe haven while quietly regretting the things we didn't do somewhere in the recesses of our minds. And then we just hope that somedaylong story short - we spend the most creative years of our lives acquiring academic degrees rather than real knowledge which saps away our brainpower when it comes to creative thinking coupled with the Indian mindset of playing it safe as 90% of Indian kids are under family pressure from childhood to adulthood to make choices that are 'safe' rather than based on instinct. We are book smart and hard working, but we channelize our energies in finding that elusive safe haven while quietly regretting the things we didn't do somewhere in the recesses of our minds. And then we just hope that someday our kids would do what we couldn't do, and then when we have kids, unknowingly, we press them again on the path to a safe haven rather than free expression.Also, failure in India is a black spot. There is a stigma attached to it. You just cannot afford to fail. Your failure marks you as the lowest among the low in the social hierarchy no matter how good you are at what you do.Governance is responsible to an extent yes since there is no social security in India. In the west, the government pays you if you are jobless. And people are honorable enough that they try to avoid taking that route. The stigma in the west is to be on government support and not failure to do well in business. Try implementing that in India and half the country will sit at home and do nothing.Another important point is that every economy needs to reach a certain critical mass to be able to support the next generation of businesses. In the Indian context, there is more hype than substance. The reason why ticketing sites do well and go to IPO while others simply shutdown or languish in mediocrity is the nature of the Indian consumer. Keep it simple and you will sell! The market has to be ready first for the next big thing. How many of you remember Apple Newton? It was the first PDA and it flopped massively because the market simply wasn't ready for it. Then later came the Palm Pilot and it made history.Another point is the number of people who actually use the internet for transactions in India as well as the overall consumption in the economy. We are still a nation of savers and not spenders. I live in London and the population of UK is 50 million (Bombay+Delhi+Bangalore+Chennai+Kolkata) and yet the economy is over a trillion USD, simply because of consumption. Even a construction worker in UK carries the latest iPhone and this is not an exaggeration! India has a tax payer base of 31 million and first mover advantage in any category is very important because every other startup in the same space seems like a me-too. Look around you and you will see that trend in online retailing. The sites that do well in online retail are clothing and accessories.The simple funda behind building any global scale business is this (except IT as the model itself is different) - you need to stoke internal consumption before you can build global scale. If TCS and Infy were purely product companies, then a large part of their success would have depended on the adoption of their products in India.A very close friend of mine runs a startup in Bangalore and he has no grand illusions about the scale his company will attain in the next five years. He makes a hard core product which is extremely difficult to fabricate and needs a lot of specialized knowledge, not exactly one-night-in-the-dorm-room-with-a-beer kinda stuff. Even then, his focus is on the domestic market first and he knows he will never reach a billion dollars because that is not the size of the market.The motive for entrepreneurship should not be solely about money which is the most common angle Indians take when they look at this. Entrepreneurship is about happiness. It is one way to achieve happiness - simply because if you are going to spend the majority of your life working, then why not spend it doing something you love? How many happy Indian entrepreneurs have you seen from the previous generation? Entrepreneurship was a compulsion and not an option for the previous generations because lack of good education rendered you unsuitable for a nice government job.To add to Anon's post below, getting married is not really a problem till you find the right partner who is willing to support you in every way. What bogs down is the burden of family expectations and the bells and whistles attached to a relationship. In India, marriages are not about the couple, ever! There are too many stakeholders and too little accountability for those stakeholders except the 2 protagonists.Try looking at the matrimonial section of ToI. In the 'Looking for a Groom' section, the only desirable candidates are IIT/IIM/IAS grads. That means everyone else is a fool and if the girl ends up with a dork out of one of these places, she can take solace in the financial security and prestige provided by the acquisition of such coveted qualifications. Then turn to look at the other side in the 'Looking for a Bride' section and you will find a multitude of people shamelessly publicizing the size of their paychecks since it's accepted wisdom in India that plenty of money is the best substitute for lack of everything else required to live a happy life.Hope this answers the question.",5 followers,Ankit Kumar Singh,1.2K,51,4.8M,2013,https://www.quora.com/The-1920s-brought-cars-and-talkies-the-1930s-radio-and-air-travel-and-the-1950s-television-What-are-the-top-life-altering-products-technologies-in-each-of-the-past-3-decades

There was no railway station in Beagun Kodar village at the time. Despite the fact that a railway track ran through the village, no trains stopped there due to the lack of a railway station. Because the nearest railway station was 25 to 30 kilometres away, people in this village had a difficult time commuting on a daily basis. As a result, residents of this village worked hard to persuade railway officials to build a railway station in their village. The villagers' efforts bore fruit, and the railway authorities soon began construction of a small railway station in this village. The construction was completed, and the railway station soon became fully operational; everything was fine, but only for the first 5 years.Above is the real image of the railway station, image source google.This railway station was assigned a station master named Mohan in 1968. Mohan noticed a girl running parallel to the train one evening. Mohan reasoned that she might have missed the train in the station and was attempting to catch the train, so he ignored it. Next day in the evening he noticed the same girl running parallel to the train this time too he ignored the incident. He witnessed the same thing the next evening, but this time he was taken aback when he saw the female rushing and overtaking the fast-moving train. On the railway lines, she began running in front of the train engine. He tried to describe what had happened to the railway employees and passengers, but no one believed him, and everyone assumed he was inebriated or hallucinating. Mohan grew unwell and after a week he died.Soon after, a new station master was assigned to the village, and he, too, became aware of the same incident. Knowing what had happened to the last station master, he fled the station. The news of thess events at the railway station quickly spread like a wildfire across the village.Villagers stopped using this railway station because they were afraid of these incidents. One by one, railway employees who worked at the station left for the same reason. The story of what happened at this railway station quickly made its way to the railways' head office in Kolkata. Many railway employees were forced to go to Begum Kodar by railway officers from Kolkata, but everyone offered their resignation instead of working in this railway station. Because no one was using this railway station and there was a staff shortage, Indian Railways decided to close this station. So, for the first time in Indian railway history, a railway station was closed due to haunted events cited in official records.People were so terrified of this station that even train drivers had to increase the train's speed when it passed through it. Even the passengers on board the train closed all of the compartment's windows and doors and did everything they could to avoid looking at anything on this station.Some people decided to take advantage of the situation, and a tour company began offering tours to this railway station, naming it one of the most haunted places in India. After 35 years, a paranormal expert team investigated the station and submitted their findings, mentioning nothing paranormal in their report. This railway station was reopened in 2009 by Mamta Banarjee, the railway minister at the time. Nonetheless, no one visits this station after 5 p.m.I've never been to this location, nor have I interacted with anyone from it; I came to know about it from news articles and YouTube videos.
