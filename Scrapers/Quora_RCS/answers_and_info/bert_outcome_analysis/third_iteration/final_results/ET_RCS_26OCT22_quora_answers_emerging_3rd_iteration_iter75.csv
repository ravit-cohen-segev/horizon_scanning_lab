What they have is subscribers. 137.1m of them.So, for $200bn, you’re paying $1450 per subscriber.Now let’s see how else you could achieve that.Netflix will spend $13bn on content in 2018. Now, that’s been going up every year, but let’s say it will peak at $20bn.You could double that, spend $40bn a year, and give two years free subscription to people and you’ve only spent $80bn.Remember, Netflix give a month.It’s costing Netflix $10bn a year to run their service, so add $20bn on for two years, and you can give away a service with twice as much content as Netflix have and you’ve only spent half as much as you would acquiring Netflix.You would poach all of Netflix subscribers, and probably more. Incidentally, Netflix stock price would crater, so you could acquire what’s left in a fire sale.But doing it that way would seem like madness. That’s because it is. Buying Netflix would equally be madness.Netflix has the one thing that so many “entrepreneurs” in the Bay Area, who give their product away for free in a desperate effort to gain subscribers dream of. First mover advantage.Netflix would be too expensive to take on and beat, and have a market cap so high that the ROI on buying them would be awful.Netflix are here to stay.",155 followers,Brian Knapp,1.5K,208,18.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-something-that-programmers-from-top-technology-companies-Facebook-Apple-Amazon-Netflix-Google-and-Microsoft-etc-can-do-which-programmers-from-small-companies-cant-do
2,"Here is something that comes up often at work that I see great programmers do that average programmers don’t.I’ll give a quick example and then break it down for you…I was on a project recently that was a pretty significant undertaking.

Think on the scale of a 6–12 months project.We had a PM who was excited to push us to some arbitrary deadline so that his boss could be happy with him hitting the deadline. There was a nice set of timelines and charts and whoozits and whatsits and so on explaining this brilliant plan.The entire team of developers and QA’s was stoked. We were going to do this in like 2 months with plenty of time to hit the 3 month later launch date. Oh, and this was attached to a larger arbitrary goal (ever heard of OKRs? or KRs? Or Quarterly Targets? Or Big Rocks?, it was one of those deals).After the full presentation of the plan was complete, I raised my hand and asked a question.“That’s a great plan, but what happens when it doesn’t work?”The room filled with silence. I got some sour looks, but I continued.“There are a bunch of unknowns. We don’t know how long issues X, Y, and Z will take at all. We are guessing and hoping for the best. Yet, every time we do this we uncover some messy thing that often takes weeks or months to unravel. What makes you think this will be any different?”The PM went on to explain that we really needed to hit our quarterly targets and that reality was basically unacceptable to them or their boss.I said, “Okay, well best case scenario is 6 months, it will probably take 12. Even if you don’t like it, plan accordingly.”Long story short, it took at least 12 months. I left the team before the project finished.The point of the story is not that I was right. It’s that most programmers love optimistic estimates. They want to say that something will be done quickly so that they look good to their boss and teammates.In almost every case something goes wrong that makes things take longer. Unforeseen problems and so on.In my experience, great programmers know that things will go wrong. They plan for it. They can usually tell you in advance what parts of the software are most likely to cause problems and sometimes even can pinpoint why.Unfortunately, honesty can be quite unpopular as great programmers aren’t often listened to unless they are in a position of authority. It is often the opinion of the most optimistic (or foolish) person that wins the day, even if it leads to catastrophe.Great programmers know-BrianP.S.

In the key growth areas of cloud, ML and AI assistants, it is either a major player or market leader. In the best case, those trends could become extreme and Google could skyrocket in value. More likely, the outcome will be less extreme.Amazon not only has two massive, dominant businesses in retail and AWS, it has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to enter and control new markets. It has done this in cloud, video, tablets, assistants, and is now doing it in grocery and probably healthcare. Additionally, Amazon's main markets are massive. It controls only 25% of the projected cloud market and only 5% of US retail - even less worldwide.

Most of Apple’s revenues comes from the iPhone which has been un-inspirational in recent cycles and in many ways outclassed by rival products - and this dependability on the iPhone also means the company is not as diversified as Google or Microsoft. If Apple loses its sex appeal with fickle consumers, like Blackberry did - it just takes a few bad product cycles for that to happen - things could turn around for the worse relatively fast.Saying this, I don’t think any of them are going to fall anytime soon.",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,13.2K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-something-that-programmers-from-top-technology-companies-Facebook-Apple-Amazon-Netflix-Google-and-Microsoft-etc-can-do-which-programmers-from-small-companies-cant-do

I had to check in weekly on progress on the project, however it is clear in hindsight that my manager had already made up his mind and was just going through the required motions to cover his (and Apple's) ass.The month passed, and I had met all of the criteria that he had laid out for the project. So I believed that I was out of the woods. The next week, I had my normal 1-on-1 with him, and absolutely nothing was mentioned about the Improvement Plan.The following week (i.e. two weeks after the ""Improvement Plan"" was over), at the time of my normal 1-on-1 with him, he came to my office with *his* manager. They came in, closed the door behind them and handed me a letter, saying, ""read this.""The letter stated that I was being let go, and that I *hadn't* met his requirements. Nothing said *which* requirement I hadn't met. I told him that this was a surprise, and that up until that moment, I thought I was doing well. I asked him what requirement I had failed to meet and he literally said nothing; just stood there blank-faced.I spend the next few hours, deleting Apple data from my personal laptop (VPN software, source code, etc.) as well as wiping the work-provided machines. I then had to turn in my iPhones, iPads and badge and clear my personal stuff from my office (good thing I took the SUV to work that morning; an office tends to accumulate a lot of junk over nine years :) ). I was not allowed to interact with anyone else for this time; I couldn't even say good bye. As far as anyone else was concerned, I had simply vanished.In many ways, I should have seen it coming; my manager had become increasingly rude and hostile; leveling overly harsh criticisms that no other manager had ever had for me, but I had given him the benefit of the doubt (we were all under a lot of pressure leading up to the release of two big products; I naïvely assumed that it would pass once the pressure let up). I interpreted his hostility as a misguided attempt to motivate me (this was his first job as a manager). When eating lunch with the team, or during meetings, he always behaved as if he was our friend; he was careful to only be insulting or hostile when we were alone (going as far as saying that ""nobody respects you anymore"").Having never been fired from a job before, I don't have any experience to compare this to, so I can't say if it's any different from the way firings are handled at smaller companies. Ultimately, it was a blessing in disguise; I treated the following two and a half months of unemployment as a vacation; I had plenty of savings, I went to Mexico for a week with my wife, and I spent a bunch of time at home with my children. After the end of that period, I had a job at another well-known tech company, making nearly $20K/year more.The lessons I took away from this:Update: I am actually back at Apple, in a different department. Being let go from Apple can actually be a blessing in disguise:Getting fired in Silicon Valley is not the end of the world, and provided you haven’t burned any bridges, the demand for your skills is more than enough to allow you to bounce back.

They can afford to pay the best and they know that A-players want to work with other A-players. These are the New York Yankees of tech. How can you beat that?Innovation. Sears used to be Amazon. You could buy freaking anything- clothes, tools, tractors, even houses off of the Sears catalog. Just wait 6–8 weeks for it to ship and it will come to your door, or you can come pick it up in your semi-retired conveniently located local store.K-Mart came in and ate a large slice of their pie by selling a smaller selection of fast moving goods at a discount (purchasing economy) and locating closer to customers.Then Wal-Mart came in with a superior supply chain strategy and was able to undercut k-Mart prices and offer more selection to boot.Then Amazon revolutionized the shopping world with free two day shipping and a selection of just about everything in the world.So what's next in retail? If Amazon keeps its eyes open, they have the talent and horsepower to stay King of the Hill. But if they get complacent, some other company will change the rules right out from under them and win the advantage. That's why at Amazon we talk a lot about how ""It's always day 1"" and we stay relentlessly focused on doing better for our customers.What about the others?Well Facebook bought some time by acquiring Instagram and copying the best parts of Snapchat (stories), but their core product isn't all that cool anymore.Apple hasn't done anything new in a while, and eventually people will stop getting so excited about the same damn iPhone with a slightly bigger screen and nicer camera. They're sitting on almost a trillion dollars in cash but they seem to be out of ideas without Steve around.Google- they're working hard and diversifying well. At the end of the day their only revenue is still from Ads (and a little cloud) but I think they'll stay dominant for a long time because they, like Amazon, are pushing the envelope every day in many directions.All these companies can hold or extend their market position if they stay customer obsessed and keep innovating. But if they don't well…Remember Ask Jeeves, or Nokia, or Myspace, or Sears? Yeah you can still find them. But they used to be Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon. They got complacent and they got bested by more customer obsessed, innovative, hungry companies.Stay thirsty my friends.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,5.2K,65,4.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-something-that-programmers-from-top-technology-companies-Facebook-Apple-Amazon-Netflix-Google-and-Microsoft-etc-can-do-which-programmers-from-small-companies-cant-do

20,"Having grown up in the US, and living in Germany (DE) for 4 years now, and having read the other answers, I offer my own: I would say that DE is more developed. I am basing my answer off of the factors that are used by the UN development program. So let’s review a bunch of factors that could be applied to measuring development:1. Employment: both countries are for the most part at full-employment. Jobs can be acquired more quickly in the US, but you have far superior protections in Germany. If I become unemployed in DE and could not find work with my qualifications, I can go to a trade schoolHaving grown up in the US, and living in Germany (DE) for 4 years now, and having read the other answers, I offer my own: I would say that DE is more developed. I am basing my answer off of the factors that are used by the UN development program. So let’s review a bunch of factors that could be applied to measuring development:1. Employment: both countries are for the most part at full-employment. Jobs can be acquired more quickly in the US, but you have far superior protections in Germany. If I become unemployed in DE and could not find work with my qualifications, I can go to a trade school or college to learn a new skill, paid by the govt. I think DE wins here.2. Poverty: poverty levels are similar. Unofficial rates for the US are around 14%, with DE reporting around 16%. (I didn’t research the definitions to see how similar they are) However, I think the outcomes are different for the very poor. I have seen VERY FEW homeless people in DE. There are thousands living on the streets of many cities like Seattle, SF, Denver, etc. I believe you can live with some dignity being poor in DE. If you are a black teenage male living in poverty, you have a 60% chance of ending up in prison. Advantage (slight): DE3. Health care: all DE residents are required to have health insurance. Hundreds of thousands of americans go bankrupt every year (passing the costs on to every one else) because of medical bills. Level of care is very similar. Out of pocket costs in Germany are minimal. Obesity level and child mortality is much higher in the US. Strong advantage: DE4. Education: all public higher education in DE (trade, college, university) is nearly free. Much stronger support for public pre-schools in DE (though not good enough TBH). Advantage: DE5. Social cohesion: germans have very high social cohesion. Teenagers yet today embrace their regional traditions. A cornerstone of adult life in DE is to be part of one or more clubs, where you might play soccer, play music, drink beer, bird watch, or whatever. You don’t feel the class-divide in DE like in the US. People generally don’t look down on other people in lower social classes in DE like exists in the US. Advantage: DE6. Safety and security: I haven’t yet seen a place I wouldn’t walk alone at night in DE. The US leads industrialized countries in their murder rate and incarceration rate. I also have strong job security. Advantage: DE7. Good governance: DE has about 7 main political parties. I don’t agree with all of them, but most of them are attempting to make life better for their supporters. US govt has become corrupt and ineffective. DE has a balanced budget while the US is chucking a couple trillion on the debt every year. Advantage: DE8. Freedom: The US offers some freedoms we don’t have here, like hoarding guns, the ability to throw a ‘sieg heil’ in public or sell swastika flags. You may find it interesting that DE’s press is considered more free. I’ll just attribute this one to the US, but don’t want for any freedoms here in DE.9. Environment and conservation: cities in DE don’t expand that often. For the most part, you can’t build outside of a city or village boundary line, so there is not much sprawl nor fracturing of the forests happening in DE. DE produces more power than is needed by the entire country on sunny days from solar. DE has the highest recycling rate. The US has fracking and is now the #1 oil & gas producer, and has far inferior mileage standards. DE has higher standards for pollution and water purity. Advantage: DE10. GDP & income: GDP is not an indicator of personal income, but a lot of other answers mentioned it. GDP is slightly higher in the US. Average income is also slightly higher in the US, but disregards many factors, which erases the advantage IMO. Income inequality is much higher in the US. Advantage US.11. Military: many other answers mention this one. The clear advantage here is the US, but I don’t see how that benefited me when I lived in the US.13. Infrastructure: DE has a huge train network and the autobahn. The US has a massive deficit of infrastructure spending, causing the roads and bridges to be in a pretty bad state right now. US has a vastly better general aviation system. Internet and cellular coverage is similar for both countries (could be a lot better!). Regulation in DE allows for many competing mobile providers, internet providers, even electric providers. Advantage: toss-up12: Transportation: Using buses, trams, subways, light rail and long-distance trains, you can get from nearly any point in DE to another using public transport. If you live in most cities, there is no need to own a car.Based on these points, I cannot see how anybody wouldn’t agree that Germany is the clear winner.",469 followers,Daniel Cohort,11.9K,377,1.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-something-that-programmers-from-top-technology-companies-Facebook-Apple-Amazon-Netflix-Google-and-Microsoft-etc-can-do-which-programmers-from-small-companies-cant-do

Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party.
