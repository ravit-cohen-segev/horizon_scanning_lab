And the guy who missed it gets an earful.While other car manufacturers might build one or two models fairly well, the other cars they build like crap ruin their image. But Toyota builds every car with the same diligence as its Lexus models. Even the lowly Corolla.

1,"Slow depreciation is the same as higher-than-average resale value, so I'm going to answer the question ""Why do Hondas and Toyotas have good resale value?""Resale value is effected by:1. Vehicle scarcity (but only in the extreme)Slow depreciation is the same as higher-than-average resale value, so I'm going to answer the question ""Why do Hondas and Toyotas have good resale value?""Resale value is effected by:1. Vehicle scarcity (but only in the extreme)Here's a little more detail on each of these points, as well as an explanation of why Toyota and Honda do so well.Scarcitydoesn't really effect used car prices, unless the car we're talking about is very rare. A limited edition version of a popular car can be very valuable (like a Ford Raptor, a limited edition F150), as are most limited production exotic and luxury vehicles (like any Bentley or Ferrari).Honda and Toyota, however, produce incredibly high volumes of Civics, Accords, Corollas, and Camrys...these vehicles are anything but scarce. Honda and Toyota help to prove that scarcity only effects resale value in the extreme.Perceptions of durability and reliability are powerful. JD Power - an independent company that evaluates vehicle durability - has frequently identified makes and models of vehicles that are exceptionally reliable. Yet resale value doesn't typically follow JD Power rankings. If you look at 2013's rankings, for example:2013 Vehicle Dependability Study [ http://autos.jdpower.com/ratings/dependability-press-release.htm ]You'll see that Lincoln does quite well. Yet Lincoln performs quite poorly in terms of resale value...the MKS is listed as one of the 10 worst cars (in terms of depreciation) for 2014:Top 10 Worst Car Resale Values for 2014 [ http://blogs.cars.com/kickingtires/2013/11/top-10-worst-car-resale-values-for-2014.html ]and a bit of comparing on KBB's ""5 year cost to own"" tool (Kelley Blue Book [ http://www.kbb.com/new-cars/total-cost-of-ownership/ ]) will prove thatthere's no such thing as a Lincoln with above-average resale value. While there are reasons to argue that Lincoln's resale value is poor (uninspired vehicles, poor marketing), I'd argue that perceived reliability is part of Lincoln's problem.On the other hand, Honda and Toyota often lead the market in both JD Power ratings,Consumer Reportsratings, and consumer perceptions.It's not exactly rocket science - people will pay more for vehicles they perceive to be better.New vehicle incentives can single-handedly ruin resale value. If, for example, a new car that normally sells for $25k is discounted $3,000 (via a manufacturer's rebate), used versions of the car automatically become less valuable.Typically, a one year old car is worth about 70% of a new car's value. If the new cars are selling for $25k, than a 1 year old version is worth $17,500. But if the new cars are effectively selling for $22k (because of a massive rebate), 1 year old used cars fall to $15,400 (70% of 22k). This decline in price on 1 year old cars reduces the value of 2 year old cars, which reduces the value of 3 year old cars, etc.While the declines in used vehicle value aren't quite this predictable, the basic concept is always true...the more the manufacturer discounts the new car, the less valuable used cars become.Honda and Toyota rarely offer cash rebates on their mo...",132 followers,Tyler Carey,741,117,1.3M,2014,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-Hondas-and-Toyotas-especially-sedans-depreciate-so-slowly-Are-there-any-real-technological-reasons-like-more-reliable-or-easily-replaceable-parts-or-is-it-based-only-on-customer-perceptions

Renault isMy 1998 Toyota Camry LE 2.2L has over 437,000 miles (over 704,000 Km) on it, original engine, transmission, and upholstery. I regularly meet other Toyota owners with approximately 300,000 miles (480,000 Km) on their cars. A few weeks ago I met a guy with an early 1990s Honda Accord who said his car had well over 600,000 miles (1,000,000 Km) on it.Occasionally a Honda transmission will die. These days, with all the gasoline direct injection engines and the smaller turbocharged engines, vehicles from all brands are becoming less reliable. Some of these newer engines are suffering serious carbon buildup problems (hard starting, failing emissions tests, poor drivability, etc.) in as few as 30,000 miles (48,000 Km) to 60,000 miles (100,000 Km). Across the board. Ford & Toyota have recently gone to dual-injection systems with both port injection and direct injection on the same engine. The ECU switches back and forth between the two sets of injectors depending upon conditions.About the only Nissan I would consider buying is the Leaf. No internal combustion engine and no transmission. I am a bit more comfortable recommending Toyota (and Honda), but I would prefer a manual transmission (“stick shift”).As various governments around the world get more and more strict with fuel economy and emissions, and as technology advances, we are getting to the point where it makes more sense to buy an EV. As automakers have to use more and more tricks to meet the ever tougher fuel economy and emissions laws, more and more potential problems arise (One thing is sure -",33 followers,Rodi Palma,686,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-Hondas-and-Toyotas-especially-sedans-depreciate-so-slowly-Are-there-any-real-technological-reasons-like-more-reliable-or-easily-replaceable-parts-or-is-it-based-only-on-customer-perceptions

I personally believe that Toyota is superior, but that's just because Toyotas seem to handle neglect better than Hondas. Though that's a whole bag of worms since GMs seem to handle neglect the best of any car.I'm a Toyota fan so I'll talk about Toyota first.Toyota's tenants are that their cars should be safe, reliable, and built by a corporation with some stewardship. Accordingly, Toyota invests more in R&D than any other automaker in the world. Although that's a consequence of its size more than anything else. Honda actually spends more money as a fraction of their revenue on R&D but they also have a much wider product range (motorcycles, ATVs, heck there's even a Honda airplane!).If you keep that in mind, a lot of things Toyota does makes sense. Their manufacturing plants are the least-polluting in the world. Their line up is mostly of kinda-boring-to-drive cars and trucks, but every one of their vehicles is among the most fuel efficient and safest in the class. One of Toyota's miracles is that all of their cars are pretty similar. Most Toyota vehicles have a pretty similar control lay-out, they drive pretty similarly, and it's almost as if you decide to buy a Toyota and then chose the car that's the right size for you. I have a top of line Toyota (or it was when the prior owner took it off the lot) a Lexus LS430. It's big and nice and I love it to death. But when I go home and drive my Mom's Toyota highlander, I realize that they drive pretty similarly. Although my car is quieter, and faster, and nicer, they both have their controls in about the same location and they feel really similar behind the wheel.Honda wasn't taking things seriously from about 2000 to 2014, but I think they're back in the gameSoichiro Honda was probably one of the finest engineers that will ever grace humanity and there's a million and one ideas from him about what Honda should be. But Soichiro Honda was adament that any cars with his last name should be something like a Japanese Ferrari. In fact, one of the first Honda Cars (I think the T360 or the L700) had a very bad safety reputation because it had some brake problems (every Japanese car except for Toyota had brake problems at the time) but more sinisterly it had a really aggressive, racing style suspension tuning, which works great until it doesn't. A lot of Japanese people died in the early Hondas because they'd lose control and couldn't recover the vehicle before it hit something else or went off a mountain.At this point, it'd be worth noting that Honda is a engine company first and foremost. And they got in the car business because it's where a lot of engines end up.So after some embarrassment, Soichiro Honda relented and thought that making enjoyable cars was a good comprise from making race cars for the street. Fortunately this allowed Honda to pursue more conventional vehicles. Privately, Soichiro said that Honda would use BMW as its target for vehicle performance and Toyota as its target for reliability. Honda's never drove as nice as BMWs but they held together almost as well as Toyota.In my opinion, Hondas need more servicing than Toyotas and Honda is way more likely to use proprietary fluid formulations. For instance, Honda recommends Honda specific coolant, an item called Hondabond in a lot of rebuilds, Honda specific brake fluid, Honda specific power steering fluid, and Honda specific gear oil in its all wheel drive systems. Whereas Toyota is much more likely to use standard fluid types. Not to mention the Honda valve trains need clearances checked, whereas Toyota uses maintenance free systems in its valvetrains.All in all, Honda is a lot more willing inject some sport in their vehicles. And capable of doing it. Toyota doesn't make sporty vehicles by itself, they get help from Subaru and Yamaha. Whereas Honda routinely drops sweet engines into their Civics and gives us sweet cars like the S2000 and NSX once a decade or so.To sum it up,",23 followers,Kevin Ferguson,2.3K,1.3K,2.8M,2014,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-Hondas-and-Toyotas-especially-sedans-depreciate-so-slowly-Are-there-any-real-technological-reasons-like-more-reliable-or-easily-replaceable-parts-or-is-it-based-only-on-customer-perceptions

9,"No, because a job is a means to an end, not and end in itself.There's an argument that having technology replace people's jobs is a good thing because it frees up those people to go out and find other ways to benefit society.

Human demand is not infinite, we all have limited time, there are only so many TV series we can watch, houses we can build, or lattes we can drink.Maybe we'll get to a point where machines handle so much of what we want/need that there just isn't enough for all 7–10 Billion people in the world to do for 40 hours per week. Would it then be a good idea for governments to limit how much automation corporations can use?Still no. Should that scenario ever occur, society would need to abandon the ‘Protestant work ethic’ that says that a job is an end in itself. We'd have to find some new way of distributing the wealth that all the robots were producing.

The large user base occurs because the most popular publishing platform on the web still relies on it.The problems JQuery/Bootstrap were built to fix are now better handled using JavaScript and CSS3. These problems included;* Weaker cross browser support for programmatic tag selection and DOM manipulation.So* JQuery is clearly legacy (and Bootstrap v5 doesn’t even use it anymore).So both are pretty much legacy. What’s the issue?JQuery/Bootstrap are still heavily used.JQuery is still well within the top 10 most used frameworks as of this writing for example. Closer to top 5 in many places, and It goes up to the number 1 JavaScript lib if you include that publishing platform (more on this later).Confusing mixed messages!What do do?As a web application developer (using React/Angular/Vue), you still need to know both JQuery/Bootstrap as you will see them often in legacy code. You would not intentionally use either in a new project though because JQuery has some serious problems; it doesn’t scale as well as modern frameworks, caused by;* Poor DOM redraw efficiency. You can also get into performance sapping update loops, caused by naïve polling (i.e. code directly checks a bit of DOM every few milliseconds, but that DOM read actually causes a redraw - this is far more common than you think!). A more modern way is update to a lifecycle (so changes are batched together in a single update), and detect changes in underlying data rather than DOM (which is faster as well as much more efficient - you only write to DOM when there is actually a corresponding data change, and you rarely read from it).As you can see, these problems are all significant. So much so that JQuery is often seen as an anti-pattern. So it is definitely legacy as far as this group is concerned! But see note 1 below.As a front end developer or the old term, web designer (building standard websites, perhaps with a CMS and some API calls but no front end framework), you will see JQuery a lot, and not just for legacy. It is still used heavily in the currently best selling, commercially available website templates for example. You should really avoid JQuery though, because native browser stuff (CSS3 and JS) are preferable for future-proofing. It is also worth noting that the ‘Bootstrap look’ is now quite old fashioned. The more modern way is to build the look and feel towards the company brand rather than use a default like Boostrap. Even when the UI follows a generic default, that default is now often a lot cleaner, allowing content (or brand) to take prominence. See Design Systems Repo [ https://designsystemsrepo.com/design-systems/ ] for curated examples.The big issue for front end developers is of course that publishing platform that is used in more websites than React, Angular and Vue put together - WordPress. Around 35% of the entire web is built on WordPress. And guess what it comes bundled with. Yup, JQuery. If you are a front end developer building WordPress sites, you need JQuery. There are many knock-on effects caused by WordPress’s untouchable popularity; if you wondered why all those website templates use JQuery, you now know… they assume you will be using WordPress. It may be wrong vs a modern JAM-stack, but it is also an easy option.There is an additional issue that is often forgotten; many ad-tracking scripts still require JQuery. This is an easier problem to fix; just import JQuery in your page head and forget about it. If you build ‘creatives’ (the industry name for online ads), are hands-on in engagement tracking tags (Tealium, etc), or work in ad-serving, then jQuery is still part of your bread and butter.Also, the elephant in the room - I suspect there is also an issue of teaching. Many teaching organisations create courses that go from simple to hard. They put Flexbox and JavaScript in at the end with the ‘hard’ stuff, and start with JQuery/Bootstrap.

19,"Your question is kind of ambiguous as technology itself cannot replace an activity,for example reading a book. Maybe you meant addiction to technology may result in less interest in books. That is possible , however many people nowadays prefer reading e-books instead of paper-cut versions of those. Yet, there are a lot more people who do not use the opportunities provided by technology in order to read a book , yet they prefer scrolling down the Facebook page.

People who grew up pre-Kindle and pre-smartphone often developed a visceral love of the act of reading on paper — the feel, the smell, the way the words look...Kids born in the portable-device era don’t really have this association, and for a lot of them reading just means E-reading. I don’t think of that as a “loss”, any more that it’s a loss for people driving cars to never experience the sound of a buggy whip or the smell of a horse. Everyone is nostalgic, to some degree, for the things they loved as children.Physical books were a very big part of my life as a kid, but I’ve been spending most of my days online since the mid-1970s — long before there was a proper worldwide web for people outside the computer field.Since about 2010, I’ve shifted almost all of my reading, including book-length material, to portable electronic devices — initially Kindle, and mostly my iPhone these days. E-books and E-magazines offer several advantages for me:I still do buy some P-books, but mostly these are things that I use for reference, or that don’t exist in a good electronic form. Or P-books that will look good on the bookshelf behind me when I’m making a Zoom call. :-)On the question of whether the technology is pushing us toward shorter-form works, I think that to some degree it is. I should say that very little of my own reading these days is fiction, but that’s not due to technology — it’s more a case of being in a fast-moving technical field and a faster-moving society, and wanting to keep up.I do find that much more of the time that I used to spend on reading long-form books is now spent reading short articles online. There is a huge amount of stuff available now — mostly crap, which is certainly not a new development — and, thanks to technology, it is much easier to find things that are interesting and perhaps useful than it used to be. Quora and Medium and Wikipedia and certain blogs, for all their flaws, have a lot of great material, and it’s pretty easy to find enough really interesting stuff to fill the available time.That’s partly the result of “AI” recommendation engines, but owes more to having gradually built up a network of topics and people that I follow, and a network of friends who recommend things to me.",1 follower,Ruth Eve,649,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-Hondas-and-Toyotas-especially-sedans-depreciate-so-slowly-Are-there-any-real-technological-reasons-like-more-reliable-or-easily-replaceable-parts-or-is-it-based-only-on-customer-perceptions

He has read 365 books in a year. A book a day!Here are his tips on how he did it!Define your why for yourself before starting. This is a very personal thing. The more intellectual your goal is the better. Your why for reading a book could be for getting new ideas, seeing new perspectives and improving your life. It could also be to escape the reality and be entertained. There is nothing wrong in that just know that if you are reading books just to show off a number to people, it would be a very shallow goal and your efforts will be worthless.That is the first mistake we make. We think we need to read every book cover to cover to understand it. Not all books are written that way. Jay Shetty gives a really good example of how reading every book cover to cover is like searching every isle for the thing you need during grocery shopping instead of having a list and picking out only the things you need.In non fiction books it is much easier to pick out the things that are going to benefit you the most and only target those areas instead of reading every word.If you are struggling to get through a book and every page seems longer that the next and words keep getting smaller and smaller the more you read, chances are that you are using your willpower to get through the book to get over with it or just for the namesake. Whereas if you are really excited to learn and love the topic of the book, it will make the whole reading process much easier and enjoyable.Unless you are reading Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, chances are that you will find ample video content of the author online. It could be a podcast episode or a Ted talk. Go through them to understand what the author stands for and what is he trying to share to the world. This way you will grasp majority of the concept and idea of the book before even reading it. Doing this will give you an understanding of whether you find the subject of the book compelling and whether you are still attracted to the field it belongs.Chances are you might not even need to read the book. Biggest example of this is the 5 second rule by Mel Robbins, all she does in the book is explain the same principle again and again through examples of people who have changed their life by using it. Watching a few of her interviews and Ted talk is enough to grasp the whole principle.Once you are convinced that you want to go ahead with reading the book after watching a few videos, go through the list of contents and highlight the areas that you find interesting or you are keen to learn. It is similar to looking at a menu while ordering things that you want.The author has put so much energy in writing that first chapter and that is why you should read it. In several books the first chapter is usually a guide by the author in how you should read the book and that's why, do not miss it. After chapter one feel free to dive into the areas that you have highlighted.All audiobook apps provide the feature of speeding up the whole process of reading a book. For classic old school readers, there is a very simple way to speed up the process of reading by using the finger as a guide. The faster you move your finger the faster you can read. It may sound too simple but it actually works!The brain is more powerful than you can imagine . It can extrapolate 90% meaning from a sentence by looking at just 30% of the words. Use that to your advantage by focusing on the important words within the sentences that you are reading.We usually read by using a Start-Stop method. While reading a sentence completely, it is only when you stop that the brain starts to making meaning of it. This slows down the reading process. Focus on the important words instead and you will flow through the sentences instead of starting and stopping.Authors place importance in the first three lines and last three lines of a paragraph by loading it with key information. Read them and then decide whether you want to read the full paragraph.Read the subheadings within a chapter and feel free to highlight the ones that you find interesting and then dive into them. There is no need to read even the chapter from start to end just because you have highlighted it and find it interesting.We all have thisIt is important that we change our perception from number of books read toImagine spending two months reading a book cover to cover and not having gained a single bit of knowledge from it. This in turn demotivates us.Through the tips mentioned above you will be able to get through a book in a day andAlways remember that learning from a book is far more important than just finishing it.Now repeat after me -","8,569 followers",Yannick Duchscher,4.6K,425,10M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Statement-If-hexadecimal-replaced-base-10-in-our-schools-we-would-be-20+-years-ahead-in-every-area-of-technology-Is-this-true

Orwell even dives into how language can be manipulated to protect authoritarianism.2 points resonated with me the most1984 explains Hitler, Stalin, Mao, and Castro. It exposes why and how authoritarian happens and convoys not only the importance of privacy but of information, language, and history.Above all EVERYONE can understand it. I love Dostoevsky and Nietzsche more than most but I will openly admit not everyone can penetrate these dense works. 1984 manages to entertain and also conveys its message in a way that everyone can understand. You can hand it to a 5th grader or a Doctoral Poli-sci student and both will understand and appreciate it.Honorable mentions",3 followers,Renuka Rajendran,670,82,762.5K,2020,https://www.quora.com/Statement-If-hexadecimal-replaced-base-10-in-our-schools-we-would-be-20+-years-ahead-in-every-area-of-technology-Is-this-true
