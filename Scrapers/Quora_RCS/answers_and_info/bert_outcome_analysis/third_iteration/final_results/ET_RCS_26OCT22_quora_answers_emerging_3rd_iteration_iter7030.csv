Success in these areas would benefit greatly from mastering C++.Ruby and Python are popular multi-paradigm modern scripting languages. Mastering them would take considerably less time than C++ and there is great demand for either. They are very useful for writing web applications, something that is usually ugly, long and cumbersome in C++. However, their runtime environments come with enough baggage to restrict their versatility. Ruby is also currently is waning in popularity (but still fairly popular).I would recommend getting a good general understanding of C++, as well as the fundamentals. After that picking another language, especially one where the syntax is sugar coated and a lot of the subtle challenges are hidden is not as hard as the other way round.","29,209 followers",Mattias Petter Johansson,579,1.1K,16.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Which-technology-is-best-in-software-development

The site looks pretty awesome now, but does it really work ?Do those buttons do something or are they just there to make the site look pretty ?Our site currently is like that cute and good looking girlfriend who cannot interact.What I mean by interactivity of a website is that does your website respond when you click a button?Nobody needs a website or a girlfriend that does not interact with you no matter how pretty they are.To add interactivity at the front-end we use a client side programming language like JavaScript.JavaScript:This is where need arises that you learn a programming language.With JavaScript, you can interact with your website by keyboard inputs, mouse movements, clicks etc.Which is what will make your site interactive.As you now have learned JavaScript, you will be able to build simple front-end based applications like a calculator:That’s alright, now we are done with the front end part. Lets get to the back end.Back end(server side):Lets assume you want to build a complex application like a banking system where you wish to record and store thousands of transactions every day.To build a site like that, you can easily use HTML,CSS & JS for the front-end but how exactly will you store the user data?Here is where we need databases to record all those transactions. Its like a central location where all of your site data is stored.The back end is not only responsible for storing the user and transaction data, but it also should be able to serve web pages upon request.For example, when a user wants to have a look at his transaction, he may visit the URL like “http://www.bank.com/mytransactions” when the user does so, the server should be smart enough to return a web page that has transaction details of that specific person.Like the above URL request, thousands of users might be making different kinds of requests to the server and the server is responsible for serving all those respective requests.How do we program the server so that it can handle user requests and serve them ?This is where back-end programming languages like Python, PHP, C#, Ruby, Perl, Java come into play.You may use any one of these languages to program your server to handle and server incoming requests.These languages not only let you to handle request but they also allow you to query the database to get information and also allow you to save information into the database.There is one problem though, programming a server from scratch is a pain in the head!Here is where back-end frameworks come into play.These frameworks allow you to build your web-app much quicker and in a proper manner.Each programming language has associated frameworks.Python has Django, Flask etc.PHP has CodeIgniter, cakePHP, Aura etcC# has .NETRuby has Rails.Java has Spring.These frameworks not only allow you to build database oriented web apps but also handle complex things like authentication.Here are the steps to be a full-stack developer:I’m assuming you know nothing and are starting from scratch.I would highly recommend that you start from the back end first, the front end stuff is relatively easier to learn if you first start with the back end.Step 1:Python, C#, Ruby, Java, PHP are your choices.JavaScript can also be your choice as with Node.js you will still be able to work on the backend.You don’t necessarily need to keep at a single language, instead you can try learning different ones and pick the one which you find suitable.I would personally choose and recommend Python as it is relatively simple to use.I have written a detailed answer about how you can start learning Python which you can readover here:Step 2:Depending on the programming language you learned, you can now pick a back-end framework accordingly.Popular choices are:Django/ Flask for Python.Spring for Java.Node.js/ Express for JavaScript (although node is a run-time and not a framework)..NET for C#.Rails for ruby.Step 3:After learning back-end programming language and a back-end framework, learning HTML & CSS will feel like a child’s play.Although don’t get me wrong, being able to build good looking websites still would need a lot of practice.Step 4:If you chose JavaScript in the 1st step, you can skip this step.Step 5:jQuery is a lightweight JavaScript library. jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.Step 6:My choice of front-end frameworks are React.js & Vue.js.Vue.js is actually a JavaScript framework with various optional tools for building user interfaces.ReactJS on the other hand is an open-source JavaScript library which is used for building user interfaces specifically for single page applications. It’s used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components.Read my other answers:Saurav Sharma's answer to What are the best learning sites for Python?Saurav Sharma's answer to What is it like to earn 50 LPA in India?","1,194 followers",Saurav Sharma,1.8K,267,12M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-technology-is-best-in-software-development

I was fed up with so many programmers that charged me too much for less than expected, procrastinated, built lower than expected standard etc.So I have had a high motivation to learn this. After two month of learning to my amazement I was able to build a site with functionalities like Twitter, there is no way I was supposing that before start because I always heard porogramming is tough and you need years to learn. I agree that you need about 500–1000 hours to become proficient in programming, but you can compress this time in half year of intensive training. If we suppose that on IT colledge you have max cca 6-8 hrs of programming lectures per week you would need 4 years to collect 1000 hours. So again, it is doable in a couple of months if you are seriously interested.How did I acomplish that? I studied course carefully and stopped video every few minutes in order to to try coding what I saw. If wasn’t easy but this is the only way. There are 100’s of nuances of a topic and concept that teacher doesn’t mention and you have to find out yourself. Internet is a great help. Ofcourse there are hard moments when you start to doubt whether you will ever learn. But as they say if there is desire there is also a way, so you slowly but miraculously start to grasp what is this all about.It is extremeny important to understand concepts and not only to learn facts, becuase programming is like painting, there are not two same path to do something. You are artist that have a goal and you have to use your own creativity to reach this goal. There is no way you can do this if you didn’t understood concepts fully. How arrays work, functions and access to them, superglobals, session, access to database, GET and POST, procedural vc oop - study them fully and you will become a master of programming art. That is where joy and fun starts. Do not user other people’s finished code snippets, it will degradate your skills and diminish your creativity. Do not use frameworks, they will make you lazy and diminish your coding creativity and lean state.Additionally, I laugh at those that swear PHP is easy and Python or Java for example are hard to learn. Concepts are always same, only synthax changes. It all started with C, then OOP version C++, Java and PHP. Python and Ruby are only fancy versions of PHP, nothing more. If you learn PHP there is no need to learn other two except for superficial reason to be ‘in’ and more employable.C++ inherited concept of C, Java also. OOP PHP also. If you learn one, it will not be hard to learn others because concepts are the same.If you want fundamental knowledge of prog concepts and programming fast kernels, drivers etc learn C. If you want programming fast operating systems and games, learn C++. For all other purposes, from parking automates, TV’s, mobile to cars there is Java. For web learn PHP/MySQL/CSS3/HTML5 + javascript. Of course you may learn Python, it’s same. Btw I don’t like it’s synthax, its different than those C/C++/Java/PHP. Ruby is dead. If you want one page apps, asynchronous live chat learn Node and javascript as front end with sockets. Do not bother with Angular, it’s clumsy and not well supported.

The Middle Kingdom considered itself the middle of the universe and the emperor considered himself the middle of the middle!He therefore lacked interest in outside trade because he felt the kingdom already had all the resources and technology it needed to satisfy his wildest imaginations.ConcubinesAnd like the emperor, we should ask ourselves…To reflect on this question, sit on Daddy’s lap, and let me tell you a story about a Chinese farmer and a Western businessman…The Fisherman and The BusinessmanA businessman took a short vacation to a small Chinese coastal village. Unable to sleep he walked the pier. A small boat with just one fisherman had docked and inside the boat were several large tuna.“Only a little while”“Why don’t you stay out longer and catch more fish?”“I have enough to support my family and give a few to friends,”“But …. What do you do with the rest of your time?”The fisherman looked up and smiled,The businessman laughedThe fisherman asked“15- 20 years, 25 tops”“But what then?”The businessman laughed and said“Millions? Then what?”The businessman replied,Where this anecdote can be misleading is it presumes theBut what if the businessman continued by saying,The fisherman must then eitherThis would make the anecdote more historically accurate.Because if the Chinese fisherman was a metaphor forThis is also true for today.If a country or corporation becomes too satisfied then they’ll eventually be conquered by the competition.But what if there was no competition?If there wasn’t a West then Imperial China would likely still exist. Keep in mind a Chinese person of 1400 A.D. lived a remarkably similar life to a person of 1800 A.D and so it’s conceivable to believe that without the West a Chinese person of 1800 A.D. would live a similar life to a person of 2200 A.D.And life was better for the Chinese when they were stuck in theIn businessIn governmentLet’s go forward in time…I believe the pace of change will eventually slow down as global power continues to centralize into fewer and fewer hands.Eventually the global elite will come together under the premise,Now hopefully this decision will be made by some sort of coalition of democratic nations.Because if it doesn’t happen through democratic consensus then it will happen by dictatorial decree.“Artificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia but for all humankind, whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.” — Vladimir PutinBecause left unabated the race for better A.I. will eventually lead to someone getting the upper-hand and so, for example, the Chinese could unlock an artificial intelligence so powerful it gives them control over all the global satellites and therefore the globe.And then they would build a metaphorical great wall around any further technological development that could threaten their power, and then who knows, the world could slowly devolve back into something that looks a little like Imperial China.And as long as there aren’t any alien forces lurking upon the horizon, technology could stay stopped for a long, long time because the only people who could tear down the wall would be the people guarding it.I hope this answer gives you a greater sense of purpose because we can control how the wall is built. Why should we even build a wall around technology?
