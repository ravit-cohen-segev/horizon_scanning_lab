The idea was great, but the execution and development weren’t.Intel recently revealed its smart glass called Vaunt. Vaunt looks a lot like a regular set of glasses at first glance and they are nearly indistinguishable from regular glasses and they only weigh about 50 grams.At its core, Vaunt is simply a system for displaying a small heads-up style display in your peripheral vision.

It is designed to show very simple basic information in one of your eye. It can show you simple messages like directions or notifications. It works over Bluetooth with either an Android phone or an iPhone much in the same way your smartwatch does, taking commands from an app that runs in the background to control it. If there is any notification it can be read or dismissed using certain head gestures.It has little red monochrome projector. that shines an image on the holographic mirror which bounces it directly into the eyeball.Notification can only be seen if you are look down at the display. It does interfere with the standard line of vision.This was the technology which every college kids dreamt and now Intel has finally built it.﻿Thankyou","36,821 followers",Sindhu Satish,845,1.8K,73.4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-new-computer-technologies-now

What if that’s the case?Autonomous vehicles, machines, etc..You will agree with me that 300 years from now is more than enough to perfect Artificial Intelligence.Oh…are you hoping I will tell you about IoTThe World’s First Artificial Intelligence robot citizen “Sophia” may be a kind of ‘Adam’ for the robot generation.Also, with the advancement in technology, comes with a lot of negative effects as well. If I should guess what 300 years from now will be, I’m sorry, but all I can picture isArtificial Intelligence will be perfected by 300 years from now, with robots being able to detect that humans are killing their planet (Maybe). I should also mention that AI perfection will be the greatest technological achievement. That is where AI can not only think for itself, but also able to execute those thoughts. And they will also become autonomous to even write codes to create other robots.Humanity might become extinctI’ve watched movies about how robots turned on humans.

It is more difficult to achieve than the classic fully immersive virtual reality, or VR, where all you see are synthetic images, and in many ways MR is the more powerful of the two technologies.A mind bending as well as a game changing technology of the next decade.Image Courtesy :",0 followers,Hatice Aslan,570,164,11.7M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-latest-emerging-technology-in-manufacturing-trends
