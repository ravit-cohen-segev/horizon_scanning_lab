2,"Transfer learning in ML models.Humans are really good at generalizing. We only have to see a few dogs before we can recognize a dog when we see one.Machines are not. ML models require millions of examples before forming a reliable classifier, and that classifier is very specific to the data on which it was trained. If your training data doesn't include dogs with three legs, the model won't recognize them. A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one.

It's hypothesized that the reason humans learn so quickly is that we are fitting new examples into our existing knowledge rather than forming entirely new categories. If we could teach machines to do the same, they would learn exponentially faster and apply that learning more effectively.Transfer learning is a very hot topic in AI research right now, so I expect major breakthroughs in the next few years. I think this may be sufficient to achieve artificial general intelligence, but even if not, it will dramatically extend the range of tasks that machines can accomplish.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-next-trend-for-Wipro-technologies
3,AI (e.g. Watson) will be added to more applications. Voice and biometrics will be more productive. Vision recognition more accurate. Predictive algorithms based on big data analytics will become more accurate.

5,"Looking back at the last 10 years gives some indication.Git has passed up SVN pretty handily, REST has become more or less the standard, and json has flown past xml for responses. Cloud computing and storage tools have gone from niche to beautifully refined.Things that haven’t quite shaken out are frameworks. Java is still the most used language, Python is at its heels, but then node.js showed up in a huge way, particularly with the MEAN/MERN stack.In all of this, containerization has grown significantly, and I absolutely believe that containerized services prevail.

It is flat out a better way to go with cloud computing being prevalent.In mobile, Swift/Kotlin took over, though as much as people like to pretend react-native is the future, so far native development is completely dominant. Who knows what Flutter will bring.So what’s next?AI and ML will grow into normal life I suspect. AI is like the new gold rush, and companies are shelling out tens of millions of dollars for AI companies with modest code/capabilities, but not quite sure what they have yet.I think we’ll see web frameworks solidify a little bit more, and someone will come a little further ahead in this race, but there will probably still be all the Java, PHP, C#, etc. that there is today, just faster growth in other places like Python/Node. with a lot more React, Angular, and Vue front ends. I bet we see some push for non js front ends, but I doubt it does much in the next 10 years comparatively.Again, with these technologies lending themselves so well to containerization, I think we’ll see a ton of growth in that area.

8,"China is a big contender, simply because they got the biggest funding for artificial intelligence. UK can compete, as well, because they’ve got creative minds, and let’s not forget South Korea, a country that also lives in a somewhat digital age. However, I really won’t ignore the US yet because MIT recently received $1b budget for a college centered on AI so that’s got to count something.

US has plenty of softpower that no other major economy has now.Cultural reach.I will not cover the bigger issue (ageing China) that has been covered already. US will have a much younger population than China in the next 3 decades.In short, China doesn't have most of the advantages that US had in becoming a superpower. China will be a great power, but will never be able to match the US at its heights. More likely, there will not be a superpower in the foreseeable future.US Risks:US Risks:These 3 are huge problems and I don't see easy solutions. That said, in its 230+ year history, US has gone through many crisis situations and have solved its problems through innovation and entrepreneurship.Let us consider other potential targets:People try to write off US prematurely. The next war will be fought over information/communication superiority. US has the base for it as it controls a big chunk of world's information. NSA's PRISM is just a frightening reminder of the advantage US has. Companies that control world's information such as Google, Twitter, Facebook, Apple, Yahoo and Microsoft are still domiciled in the US and plenty more are coming every day (backed by the world's most advanced Universities).

10,"I feel compelled to answer this question, because I disagree with most of the answers here.The common answer here seems to be: yes it will kill jobs, but only the jobs low on the food chain, and it will create more jobs to at least offset the jobs it does kill.I disagree. I think AI will kill jobs, and over time, AI might kill most “jobs” as we know them. I think that people are somewhat complacent in regard to the economic impact of AI, and will likely be ill-prepared for the changes we have to adapt to in the not-so-distant future.First, let's start with the comparisons to machinery and autoI feel compelled to answer this question, because I disagree with most of the answers here.The common answer here seems to be: yes it will kill jobs, but only the jobs low on the food chain, and it will create more jobs to at least offset the jobs it does kill.I disagree. I think AI will kill jobs, and over time, AI might kill most “jobs” as we know them. I think that people are somewhat complacent in regard to the economic impact of AI, and will likely be ill-prepared for the changes we have to adapt to in the not-so-distant future.First, let's start with the comparisons to machinery and automation. They did indeed put factory workers out of work. In that respect, I agree AI today is similar in many applications, replacing workers who have less specialized skills, perhaps call center operators, office assistants (in a limited extent), and maybe soon, taxi drivers and truck drivers. But I would argue that AI is fundamentally different from machinery or most of the other analogies commonly made when answering this question, because AI is growing and is unlikely to stop growing. It's growing in breadth (of applications and industries), in geographic and economic scope, and in power (it's capacity to address increasingly complex tasks). A more fitting analogy would be machinery in an automobile plant that not only made the parts one day, but then learned how to assemble them the week after, and then how to design cars a year later.I think that there is little that is out of reach for advanced AI of the future. Let's leave the question of the AI singularity alone for now. Instead, I think that deep learning efforts at Google and elsewhere are making AI systems learn faster and faster, with a growing rate of acceleration. Advanced AI can now address increasingly complex tasks including medical diagnosis, stock market trading, weather prediction and human behavioral modeling. Very soon, it will be able to take the place of certain types of teachers, and find a role in education. It can already deal with complex systems in software and mathematics, and seems to be only limited in applications that require interactions with the physical world (sensors are still imperfect), and with people.So without projecting too far into the future, we can ask the question, what jobs will NOT be killed by AI? Jobs that involve labor are already (or soon to be) replaced. Jobs that require logical reasoning are being replaced, albeit at a slower rate. What are the qualities that humans have that cannot be captured by AI? Perhaps creativity, emotional responses? So perhaps researchers in academia will survive longer than most, and artists (though AI stylistic mimicry is already quite impressive and their results enjoyable), and counselors/psychologists/case workers, and decision makers like CEOs who cannot be predictable or error prone. And hopefully software engineers and algorithm designers who develop AI systems.This leaves a very, very small portion of today's jobs intact. Many say: we just need to train people to fill higher level jobs created by AI, e.g. Programmers, ML researchers. But this is no easy feat. The US educational system is struggling to meet the demands created by advanced technology today. This failure is in part responsible for the economic divide plaguing the country today. The challenge of educating the public for a job market that is both decreasing in scope and increasing in complexity, is nothing we've ever faced before.I am far from original in this opinion. But if I had to guess, I would say that AI will put far more people out of work than we can (re)train in time. That will have significant economic repercussions as corporations seeking to minimize cost will do so at the cost of rising unemployment. There will need to be dramatic changes in social policies in order to avert large scale economic disaster, first dramatic rises in minimum wage, then eventually some type of universal income/welfare. It's the kind of change that requires significant leadership in our government, something that seems woefully absent today.",UNKNOWN,Ben Podgursky,536,337,9.7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-big-software-technology-trend-of-the-21st-century
11,"The reason that real estate prices in San Francisco respond so vigorously to relatively minor changes in demand is because the supply is so inelastic. I realize full well that so far I have just restated the definition of supply elasticity, but bear with me.Some people would say that real estate in a geographically contained space like San Francisco is inherently in inelastic supply.

And those people would be wrong. The binding constraint on San Francisco real estate is regulation. There are plenty of areas of San Francisco that are relatively low-density, but it is ridiculously hard to develop or redevelop anything.You may counter that here and there you see enormous over-the-top development and re-development projects going on. But that is precisely the problem.Try to buy up four adjacent townhouses in the Sunset and convert them to a 10-unit apartment building. I would argue that is precisely the kind of human-scale gradual redevelopment that can be done without disturbing the social structure of neighborhoods and other such intangibles that development opponents complain about.You will soon find there is no way. The only way to do any sort of development in San Francisco is to amass such enormous resources that you can lobby your way into a mega-project.These real big mega-projects then proceed to antagonize the electorate, stir up anti-development sentiment, and cause people to vote for even more restrictive land use regulations next time around.And that makes it harder for anyone to do the sort of gradual, organically driven, small-scale density-increasing redevelopment of lower-density residential and industrial areas that San Francisco could easily absorb and that existing residents wouldn't generally be all that upset by.As a consequence, supply is very inelastic. When new units become available, it's often in big chunks (see e.g. the big luxury apartment projects around AT&T park), but the total volume of development is nothing like what it could be.The problem is by no means unique to San Francisco, but I do have the impression that San Francisco suffers from this problem worse than other cities in the area.And don't get me started about rent control.","45,628 followers",David Seidman,790,3.6K,85.1M,2012,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-big-software-technology-trend-of-the-21st-century
