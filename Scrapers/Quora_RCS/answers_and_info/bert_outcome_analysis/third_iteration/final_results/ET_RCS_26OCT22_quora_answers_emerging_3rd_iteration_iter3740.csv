Nothing else of their civilization survived, and the machine only functions because the creators intended it to work forever. The machine was to be the ultimate in technology.Their colossal device used incredible power to make objects out of thoughts. Anything the people imagined, could be created. However, the aliens had a subconscious, just like humans, and their latent dark nature was allowed to manifest physically. Their entire race exterminated itself in one night.The human explorer Doctor Morbius uncovered the machine, and using the various devices inside the complex, gave himself the ability to work with their psychically controlled technology. He had only limited success, however, since his intellect is greatly inferior to the average of the aliens. However, he had a disagreement with the leader of the expedition, and with his suppressed rage, killed everyone save his own daughter.The story properly begins decades later when a space patrol ship goes looking for the lost expedition and makes contact with the two survivors. Shortly afterwards, the crew is stalked by the invisible but invincible predator created from Morbius’ resentment.",0 followers,Syed Asghar,1K,137,1.3M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-sci-fi-movies-where-there-is-extremely-advanced-technology-but-even-more-advanced-than-in-any-sci-Fi-movie-and-they-use-psychic-powers-to-communicate

Even China and Russia have avoided this as long as possible.Fortunately, once the open defiance has started now, the costs for smaller countries will decrease. They can now rely on support by Russia and China. That means, open US aggression may be prevented if you side with them in exchange for military protection, and sanctions become harmless once trade with them remains possible.","43,388 followers",Misha Firer,947,1.3K,133.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-sci-fi-movies-where-there-is-extremely-advanced-technology-but-even-more-advanced-than-in-any-sci-Fi-movie-and-they-use-psychic-powers-to-communicate

Finally, we had a domestic Tesla, and in 2011 Putin drove a Yo-mobil for the rolling cameras. Everything looked very bright and promising, but nothing came to fruition. No factory was built. No mass production was launched.The grand total of three Yo-mobils were manufactured. Appropriately, the king court’s jester politician Zhirinovsky bought one and managed to drive 300 miles, at which point the car refused to charge. A Mercedes Benz E-class picked him up.142 millions euro invested in the project had magically disappeared.Looks too good to be true? True.Marussia Sports CarFounded in 2007 by Nikolai Fomenko and partners, Marussia Motors set an ambitious goal of producing the first Russian racing car.They beat Yo-mobil and managed to produce forty four prototypes of varying degrees of (in)completion.Hundreds of millions of dollars went down the pipe, and in 2014 the project was shut down at a loss. The same year, Nikolai Fomenko sailed on his super-yacht into Dubai marina for the yacht-show.His super yacht was neither designed nor manufactured in Russia.Mr. Chubais, the head of Rosnano, a state venture fund, is giving Mr. Putin heads-up on how he’s blowing, sorry, spending budget moneyPlastic Logic 100 eBook ReaderThis e-book reader is based on the developments of the German company PlasticLogic. In 2011, it was on the verge of bankruptcy due to its failed product: the electronic book reader Que.But then Rusnano swooped in and the business of the PlasticLogic went uphill. Until it didn’t.Mr. Chubais paid off $50 million worth of PlasticLogic debts, and another $100 million was offered as a loan guarantee to build a plant in Zelenograd near Moscow. He sold the idea to the government that his eBook readers would be used instead of textbooks in all the schools of Russia. $700 million more were poured into the project.To cut the long story short, in 2012, the construction of the plant and the production of devices were abandoned altogether, citing economic inexpediency.Do you think Mr. Chubais got fired? It’s a rhetorical question.Prime minister Dmitry Medvedev said about YotaPhone, new Russian smartphone: “When Steve Jobs heard about YotaPhone, he was worried.”At the end of 2013, CEO of Rostec, owner of Yota Devices Ltd, ex-KGB general and Mr. Putin’s old friend, Sergei Chemezov presented the highly innovative Russian smartphone YotaPhone with two displays to Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.Observe, they always present their prototypes to the supreme leaders and not to the public.In Russia, government is your investor, your marketer, your consumer, your law, your freedom, your bank, and your career. Public doesn't count for much. They only need to be fed buckwheat and macaroni and entertained with TV fluff and parades.For some unbeknownst reason, all the smartphone components were produced in wealthy Singapore, the E-ink display was from aforementioned PlasticLogic, which explains why sale price was so high.In 2013, YotaPhone was sold for 499 euros. Grand total of 40,000 devices were sold by mid-2014.Riding on the back of their success, in 2014, Yotaphone 2 was released, and 22,760 units were sold.In 2017, Yotaphone 3 was released at the price of $450 with even fewer units sold.Hundreds of consumers await the release of the KGB general’s YotaPhone 4.Meet Boris, a man in Alyosha robot suit passing off as a robotIn December 2018, the story of a Russian cutting-edge life size robot that was the answer to Boston Dynamics’ robot, went on all the federal TV channels.During the nationall forum “Projectors” held in Yaroslavl, the life size robot Boris was showing some cool dance moves to the clapping audience.Turned out it was a human pretending to be a robot by wearing Alyosha robot suit.

It’s a bad combination sure to stretch the differences between the two countries.Additionally, whereas the US spends nearly $800 Billion each year on “defense,” which is actually a Congressionally mandated and controlled form of corporate welfare and a way to “bring jobs back home,” China spends less than $200 Billion each year.While China will have its own brand of social problems, an aging population, and so on, imagine what an additional $600 Billion could do to reduce the US debt and deficit.China will not, nor would it have to, invade the US in any form or fashion.

Even for all of Tony’s polymath genius and being able to do incredibly well in multiple fields, which on its own is already ridiculous and no one could replicate that, but expecting him to replicate the work of another genius in a field totally alien to his own work, is just silly.Pym is a genius all his own, and in a field that neither Banner nor Tony have any experience in, so expecting them to be able to replicate his work just because “they are also geniuses” is nonsense.","1,791 followers",Abhishek Duvvuri,650,7.2K,31.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-sci-fi-movies-where-there-is-extremely-advanced-technology-but-even-more-advanced-than-in-any-sci-Fi-movie-and-they-use-psychic-powers-to-communicate

24,"Hank Pym got dusted.While Scott understood using Pym Particles as Hank intended and was just scratching the surface about the Quantum Realm, he never knew how to actually create them. That was Hank's thing and it stayed that way.Seeing how insane Hank’s former protege Cross eventually became, I kinda get why Hank is such a dick regarding who gets to use his particles.",63 followers,Nathan Zhou,2K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-sci-fi-movies-where-there-is-extremely-advanced-technology-but-even-more-advanced-than-in-any-sci-Fi-movie-and-they-use-psychic-powers-to-communicate
25,"He didn't want to be there, most likely. Although he was once friends with Howard Stark, they parted on bad terms, which lead to him having nothing to do with Tony at all. Knowing the lives Tony touched and the final sacrifice he made, Hank probably felt regret at not getting to know Tony while he was alive.That's all inference on my part. The point is everybody reacts to grief and situations like funerals in their own way.",UNKNOWN,Namish D.

26,"Hank Pym is quite an arrogant person as the MCU has shown us. He doesn’t like people messing with his stuff. I believe he begrudgingly accepts that that it was necessary to save the world. But he is respectful of the sacrifice Tony made in the end, so he won’t bring it up (His opinion of Tony definitely also grew when he found out about his self-sacrifice).I believe Hank would also feel a bit jealous. As smart as he is, Tony Stark is smarter, especially from an engineering perspective.

It took Hank ages to figure out how to even get into the Quantum Realm, and Tony figures out how to use it for time travel in a few hours (or days, it’s not totally clear). And he did so without access to Hank’s research. He also took Hank’s designs for Quantum Tunnel and travel and created far more elegant and advanced versions in far less time.","57,718 followers",Jack Fraser-Govil,3.7K,2.6K,42.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-sci-fi-movies-where-there-is-extremely-advanced-technology-but-even-more-advanced-than-in-any-sci-Fi-movie-and-they-use-psychic-powers-to-communicate
