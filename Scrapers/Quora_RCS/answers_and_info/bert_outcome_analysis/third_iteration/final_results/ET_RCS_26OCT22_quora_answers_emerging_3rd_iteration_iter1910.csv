Students find technology-enhanced education to be enthralling and result-oriented, making it a trendy thing to do.Adaptive learning apps like BYJU’S, Khan Academy and Tailor-ED are based on AI technology that personalises content to fit students’ capability, understanding and previous experience. Virtual tutors can make the process of learning less intimidating and more effective. Bringing in a voice assistant that gives instant feedback perfectly fits a human educator’s role. These voice assistants can even work to remind you of deadlines and homework.These adaptive learning apps break all barriers and make quality education accessible to students of all languages and disabilities. The tailor-made content can be easily translated, slowed down and broken down into smaller segments to enable satisfactory comprehension.Such thrilling ways of learning will stimulate deep interest and communication, simultaneously leading students on the path of research and innovation.The mingling of AR and education has a twofold advantage that would equip the child with holistic development in the long run. By engaging maximum senses in a visual and auditory study experience, AR instigates emotions in students.With AR and AI being the driving force of the skyrocketing growth of EdTech, it is essential to understand its potential. In a nutshell, if utilised strategically, Edtechs like BYJU’S can be the revolution that the world of education desperately needs to switch from rote-learning theories to a practical result-oriented future.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,2.2K,996,156M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-education-technology

They jump from one idea to the next, and never stick to something long enough to reap the rewards. To make things worse, they are constantly looking for the next great thing and want to start too many companies at once.And even if they did stick to one idea, most entrepreneurs give up on it as soon as things get hard.

11,The most common failure idea is the idea of doing multiple ideas at once.  A large number of start-ups are guilty of this.  They take on many loosely tied ideas at once and solve multiple problems at once.  They do an OK job solving many problems rather than a great job solving just one problem.Lack of focus is a great way of doing a lot of cool things but no great things.A start-up should be radically focused on one core thing and everyone in the company should be working on just that one thing.

But Brin and Page knew all along that if they could dominate search they’d monetise somehow.And that has been how they’ve approached everything they’ve gone into. They don’t care about the money as the money will eventually come when they dominate.Chromebook, Android, Google Docs, YouTube, Gmail, their leadership in self-driving cars are all seeds that Google have planted, that will make them huge returns at some point. They’re patient.I mean, despite going in well after Apple into the smartphone arena, they now run 82% of the world’s smartphones. An absolutely incredible achievement.
