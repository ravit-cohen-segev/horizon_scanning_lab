This is a heady political issue, but it ignores three things. Firstly that the bomb came first, both in the world (which in this case means in the USA of course) and in the others that have followed. Nuclear power has benefitted from bomb technology and infrastructure rather than the other way around. Secondly that the cheapest and easiest and fastest and most easily concealed way to produce bomb materials is still in dedicated facilities. And thirdly that the most effective way yet proposed of reducing the threat of nuclear war is the NPT, with its threefold commitments of the many signatories to disarmament, and non-proliferation, and access to nuclear power. (Maybe read the original if you find what the NPT actually says surprising.)Secondly there is the hysteria surrounding nuclear waste. This is a long solved problem technically, and also financially. It can be easily funded by a small levy on the power produced, and mostly is, and always should be. But “Radiation!” and “Radioactivity!” are potent political slogans for the often well-intentioned but ignorant people who use them.Thirdly there is the even greater hysteria surrounding reactor accidents, despite the excellent safety record of properly designed reactors. This hysteria has killed far more people than have been claimed killed even by the baseless claims of large numbers of deaths from the three serious reactor accidents to date, which with the exception of Three Mile Island, where the containment worked well, have both occurred in badly designed and/or constructed plants.And fourthly, there are the vested in interests in fossil fuel and other alternatives to nuclear, real or imagined. Big topic. This post is already long enough.So those are four possible answers. I can’t offhand think of the fifth. Interested in any suggestions.","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.5K,6.8K,91.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-5-challenges-to-using-nuclear-power

Short sightedness - Because of the long times before there is a return on investment, money goes to projects like wind and solar even if these facilities only make a small fraction of the power in comparison to nuclear, and institutionally at least, oblivious to the fact that these modes need thermal backup to be dispatchable.","29,974 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.7K,249.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-5-challenges-to-using-nuclear-power
2,"While I support pure scientific research and development of machines to create fusion, I think it is to little too late to have any useful effect on global climate disruption. It will likely cost many times what other sources cost and would not reach the level of contributing 1% of generation for decades. We don’t have decades to spare.To prevent a global biological collapse we need to act swiftly and decisively. We need to address overpopulation. We need to reduce per-capita consumption of just about everything we consume. Foremost, we must stop burning fossil fuels.

We need to reduce per-capita consumption of just about everything we consume. Foremost, we must stop burning fossil fuels. The best path to the end of fossil fuel use will be from conservation and renewable energy.The cheapest forms of renewable energy are now wind and solar. Wind or solar combined with battery storage is approaching parity with any new fossil fuel generation, and much cheaper than new nuclear generation.Conversion of our transportation system is essential. Every vehicle from trains to automobiles must be powered by renewable electricity. We must stop flying thousands of aircraft 24–7. We need to consider the environmental cost of ocean shipping when we decide to import or export goods.Massively reducing US international military presence will dramatically reduce fuel use.Conservation can accomplish much of what needs to be done. Insulating homes and businesses to reduce heating and air conditioning will help. Cars are a huge problem. Simply doubling gas mileage by driving hybrid electric drive trains will help for a while. We need to abolish manufacture of vehicles with internal combustion engines sooner than later. We should all drive less.","220,638 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,783.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-5-challenges-to-using-nuclear-power

When the atoms fuse into plasma, they release energy that can be harnessed to generate electricity.Double-edged swordAs with most technologies, nuclear fusion is a double-edged sword finding use in hydrogen bombs. But used benignly, it offers several advantages. Just half a kilogram of fusion fuel would produce the same amount of energy as four million kilogram of fossil fuels.

9,"Q “Aren't potential fusion reactors very dangerous since they generate so much heat? What if the heat escapes?”The same could be said of any thermal power station, whether heated by fossil fuels, nuclear fission or fusion. However, of these, the uncontrolled release of heat energy is going to be the lowest with fusion power. That’s because the reaction will stop the instant the extreme conditions required to maintain fusion are lost. On current designs, the total amount of thermal energy stored at any one time in the reaction vessel will be relatively low, as it has to be confined to the fuelQ “Aren't potential fusion reactors very dangerous since they generate so much heat? What if the heat escapes?”The same could be said of any thermal power station, whether heated by fossil fuels, nuclear fission or fusion. However, of these, the uncontrolled release of heat energy is going to be the lowest with fusion power. That’s because the reaction will stop the instant the extreme conditions required to maintain fusion are lost. On current designs, the total amount of thermal energy stored at any one time in the reaction vessel will be relatively low, as it has to be confined to the fuel itself in the form of a plasma (those designs that use laser implosion are even less dangerous in that respect). At any one point, the amount of fuel will be very low, so even thought the temperatures are enormous, the very low mass means that the amount of thermal energy present is not that great.The vast majority of any thermal energy stored will be in the steam generation system, and those systems are common to all thermal power generating systems, and we aren’t kept awake at night by the possible danger of an explosive release of steam from that source.In contrast, fission reactors operate at abut 300 C, which might not sound much, but they contain a great deal of mass. Not just the fuel itself, but the moderators, the primary circuit coolant (which is usually water, but can be gas or even liquid sodium in some designs). Some contain large amounts of graphite too, and all have ways of holding the fuel charge itself. What’s more, even if the reactor is turned off, the fuel doesn’t stop creating heat - it will continue to do so in quite large quantities due to decay processes. That’s what happened at Fukushima, when the primary cooling circuit failed, the decay heat from the fuel wasn’t being taken away, and it was that which caused an explosion.What’s worse, with a fission reactor, what is released in such an explosion contains a lot of radioactive isotopes. With a fusion reaction, this simply doesn’t happen; once the fusion process stops no more heat is generated and the level of radioactive isotopes will be vastly lower. Mostly it will be the effects of irradiating the containment vessel with neutrons, but that isn’t going to be spread around the environment. There will be some very light radioactive isotopes released, such as tritium, but the total amounts will be very small and rapidly diluted and will offer a minimal threat.With a fossil fuel thermal power station, there will also be a large mass operating around that 300C level, and where the fuel is burnt, a great deal higher. However, we don’t generally worry about it, but in principle there is a lot of fuel still about which could continue to burn, although the design of such stations is such that there should be no significant chance of more fuel being added to a failed generator.",0 followers,John Holmes,826,1.2K,784K,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-5-challenges-to-using-nuclear-power
10,"Dangerous to the immediate locality (such as the building holding the device) perhaps, but not dangerous to someone standing a kilometer away.The amount of material undergoing fusion at any one moment is truly miniscule … only a few grams.
