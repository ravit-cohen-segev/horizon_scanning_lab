13,"There would be two method for that to work: cloning and vat growing. Sounds much the same, but there are some differences.Firstly: Cloning, it works for a while, then existence itself figures out that somethin is fucky.

Other than some visual oddities, like absolute albinism, pale alabaster skin and colourless eyes, they are everybit as effective as they sound.

If you ever wanted a regiment composed entirely of Yarricks and Cianes, Machariuses and Marbos, this is it. Other than some visual oddities, like absolute albinism, pale alabaster skin and colourless eyes, they are everybit as effective as they sound. Until they aren’t. They always have a period of success shortly followed by Lamenters level of bad luck, resulting in the Afriels getting wiped out, they start with a bang and end with a wimper. Every single time. So cloning is out of the question for Astartes candidates.Now for the second option: Vat Growing. It is borderline heresy as is. No seriously. Only the Mechanicus has access to the technology, big surprise, and they mostly use it to make servitors, but also to produce skitarii cohorts and emergency labour. All these uses have two things in common: they are created with a single purpose, and only the Mechanicus actually tolerates them, this probably varies from Forge World to Forge World. The rest of the Imperium however aren’t as kind to them, with Krieg being the only world I can think of to have actually used this technology,Corvus Corax actually tried some borderline tech heresy techniques from the mechanicus to recover his legion after Istvaan, which the Alpha Legion sabotaged rather quickly, resulting an unfortunate number of mutant Astartes and permanent damage to 19th Legion gene seed. Corvus took full responsibility for the disaster and gave his mutant sons the Emperors’ Mercy himself, a heavy burden for anyone to carry, on that tore on Corax’ mental health. The threat of sabotage is simply too great.So to sum up.Cloning is a very short term option, they work great until existence itself realizes that the clones shuoldn’t exist, and decides to fix the problem. On top of that:As for vat growing there are three main issuesGeneral stigma: A vat grown chapter would be held in disdain by most, if not all, of the Imperium, and would in all due reality be treated with more distrust than Cursed Founding chapters. For perspective: All cursed founding chapters got something horrible, the Lamenters got extremely bad luck, the Black Dragons got massive bone portrusions, and several chapters suffer fromRisk of sabotage: Sabotage or thechnical misshaps could bring a chapter to it’s knees, or worse, simply wipe it out. Too great a risk for a modern chapter.Legion Building: There is next to no methods to ensure Legion Building does not happen when a chapter grows their Marines. When they have to recruit normally the Inquisition can keep records in secrecy, or just the actual recruiting world for that matter. Astartes don’t like taking orders from, or showing their documents to, anything short of another Marine, and having an Inquisitor show up demaniding to see your vat growing numbers could result in unfortunate accidents anyway. It would also be damn near impossible to ensure the records are accurate, which means even more scrutiny from the Inquisition, which will make this spiral out of control rather quickly.Simply put: growing Astartes Aspirants wouldn’t work, even on paper. Too many issues involved.As for the surgery part of the question: Once more, and repeat after me, it is Augmentation, not genetic engineering. The 19 extra organs are in this regard little different from cybernetics. Hell, Marines can have children, and they would be perfectly normal humans and not genetically enchanced supersoldiers.Some will point out the daemonculaba, but note that this is for the Imperium, and not the sick fucks in the traitor ranks, and of course it was made by an Iron Warrior.Fun fact: there is no decent artwork of burning Space Marines, except the Legion of the Damned, but I will not use deamons instead of Marines.",0 followers,Daniel Peters,695,58,161.2K,2020,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-role-of-IE-in-America-with-advanced-technology-and-autonomation

They don't feel pain, they obey orders without question, they can examine new information in a much shorter span of time, they can relay said information instantaneously, and they're cheap. Very cheap.Let's keep in mind here that, due in part to the Iron Men turning on humanity, the Imperium heavily dislikes almost any form of automated work, to the point that they'd rather use lobotomized human brains to run their stuff than computer networks, and the development of AI is considered tech-heresy. Humanity in the DAoT had no such inclinations; therefore, they see no need to create expensive gene-soldiers when they can just use the infinitely more reliable Men of Iron, whose only actual expense comes from the administrative AI, not the robots themselves.Oh sure, a Space Marine will be able to take down a single one of these drones, but it doesn't matter since you can make a whole lot of them for only the fraction of the cost of a Space Marine. These things can be made on an assembly line by the local AI and sent into combat as soon as they're ready, as opposed to a Space Marine which requires YEARS of training just to become a scout.Of course, we do know that the Iron Men didn't exactly work out as intended, but that in fact only bolsters the proof of their reliability: they didn't just fight the galaxy to a standstill, they came close to WINNING.However, I imagine in the years of the Iron War, Space Marine lookalikes became a lot more common, as normal, squishy, weak humans don't fare so well against such polished war machines of steel.",1 follower,Mark Stamp,663,3.2K,24.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-latest-advanced-technology-in-home-appliances

Back in the beginning of the Great Crusade, 2 Legions where designed to influence the Astartes as a whole to keep emotional touch with the normal humans they were to protect. The II and XX. It failed. I am not going to speak of the II again, at this time.(if you want more details on what went wrong please see my profile). But the XX became addicted to secrets and plots, and murders in the dark. Thankfully, the Salamanders ended up embracing a love and compassion for the mortals of Father’s Imperium. If a Astartes was designed in a lab from the embryo up, we would be repeating the mistakes that happened during the Great Crusade, where Astartes were mass produced to the point of corruption setting in.",10 followers,Aaron Toles,1.4K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-latest-advanced-technology-in-home-appliances
