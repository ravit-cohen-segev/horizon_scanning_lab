This device was necessary according to Edward Teller because the Soviets exploded an atomic bomb in September 1949 only 37 months after the USA detonated its first atomic bomb in August 1945, decades earlier than the CIA estimated this would occur putting US military and State Department into a panic resulting in the arrest and prosecution of the Rosenbergs and the Red Scare ultimately.The atomic bomb involved rapidly assembling a critical mass of heavy fissile material that then promptly underwent a fission reaction of all the material producing all the energy in the fissile material promptly creating a massive explosion. The minimum fissile material from 12 to 60 kg determined the minimum explosive yield 1 quadrillion to 5 quadrillion joules. 240 kT to 1.2 MT equivalent yield. 12 kT yield of first atomic bombs give the inefficiency of the reaction mechanism and made the bombs very dirty.The hydrogen bomb involved fusion of lightweight fusable material that released substantially more energy per unit mass (270 TJ/kg vs 82 TJ/kg) but required very energetic conditions to undergo a reaction. The hydrogen bomb took advantage of a unique feature in the periodic table of elements in the presence of a secondary binding energy peak at Helium in addition to the peak at Iron. This meant that Lithium and Beryllium can be a fission source and Boron has a role to play as well. In 1949 immediately following the Soviet bomb Ulrich Jetter outlined a cycle of reactions that could be made into a pseudo-fission mediated reaction whose primary energy was fusion. That is, a fission of Lithium to Helium and Tritium provided a spark to cause the Tritium to fuse immediately with Deuterium if present releasing the bulk of the energy. This so-called ‘Jetter Cycle’ wasLithium-6 + neutron → Helium-4 + Hydrogen-3 + 4.8 MeV [1]Hydrogen-3 + Hydrogen-2 → Helium-4 + n + 17.6 MeV [2]Lithium-6 + Hydrogen-2 → 2 Helium-4 + 22.4 Mev [1]+[2]This reaction releases 270.3 TJ/kg of fuel and is aneutronic in the end leaving only alpha particles and heat.To make this into a self sustaining pseudo-fission reaction that could be managed with existing techniques required the conversion of energetic neutron flux and energetic alpha particles into more low energy neutrons. The neutron conversion was provided by an admixture of Beryllium to convert energetic alpha particles and neutrons to neutrons. Boron can be used to convert energetic neutrons to alpha particles cleaning up the reaction and leaving nothing but helium with only slight reduction of energy density. Subcritical techniques that produce a pulse of neutrons in a small pellet of Lithium-6 Deuteride provide the means to produce very small very clean explosions.The commercial potential of the Jetter Cycle was explored as part of Project Sherwood. The chair of the Atomic Energy Commission at the time Lewis Strauss reported results to the press suggested that by 1970, a point in time identified by Shell geophysicist Marion King Hubbert said the USA would run out of adequate oil supplies, that energy would be ‘too cheap to meter’. This resulted in a media storm with Strauss on the cover of Time Magazine and feature articles about our atomic future in Forbes. RAND Corporation scientist Herman Kahn said that if energy becomes too cheap to meter in 1970 Communism would be defeated by 1990 because by that date Capitalism would have made all the world’s proletariats millionaires and all would be Capitalists as a result. Congress scheduled hearings on the future of energy and vowed to the public a crash program on the future of fusion energy. Congress invited AEC scientists who worked on Sherwood to give testimony to Congress. Unfortunately, those scientists died in a freak helicopter crash at the Pacific test range before they could give testimony. As a result Strauss himself gave testimony. Apparently the scientists work prior to their appearance were lost or not prepared in the first place. After Strauss was sworn in he gave an opening statement on Project Sherwood but was ambushed by Congress and asked about misappropriation of funds in the AEC and his failure to follow national security procedures and his relationship to the Rosenbergs. This resulted in his dismissal called the ‘Strauss Affair’. Meanwhile, a blue ribbon panel organised by President Eisenhower resulted in the discrediting of Hubbert’s logistic theory about oil, and the oil executives assured the nation that there was plenty of oil in the Middle East, and we could safely rely on that after 1970 for centuries to come. JCS reviewing the dismissal of AEC Chair Strauss in the wake of the Rosenberg trial felt that there had to be thorough review of public information which resulted in the classification of many aspects of Project Sherwood that were previously public information. John Wheeler’s research lab at Princeton remained in the public domain and this has since been the focus of ‘hot fusion’ research which attempts to use magnetic fields to sustain break even. Other approaches attempt to use the ‘hot fusion’ technique absent the use of neutrons to take the obvious route described by Jetter to promote ‘inertial confinement fusion’. Low Energy Nuclear Reactions and reaction combinations have been largely dismissed by the research community, largely on national security grounds.The Brookings Institute released information at this time which was classified in this process. It was partly declassified by Carter who himself was a Navy nuclear engineer prior to becoming President, as he dealt with the aforementioned energy crisis. These notes are not widely published, by they are available to qualified researchers in the national archives. Brookings scientists outlined the following program in 1950s. They concluded given the nature of of the Carnot efficiency and the way heat transfer scales with temperature, that cost scaled as the fourth power of the inverse temperature of the device. They also said that given the large nonrecurring cost associated with each generator, large generators were favoured over small ones. Strauss described it this way, we know how to make a clean ‘humanitarian’ hydrogen bomb for about $5 million that fits in an airplane that can kill 5 million people without leaving any radioactive residue. Sherwood showed that we could build a clean hydrogen power plant for about $5 million that fits in a steamer trunk that makes clean power for 5 million people for 100 years. A penny a person a year over their lives. Too cheap to meter. Brookings went further and outlined the state of the various research programs at the time and how they could be commercialised;A 1 trilion watt nuclear pulse plant was envisioned as a floating platform that at peak efficiency was capable of 80%conversion of nuclear energy to electrical energy but could by introducing inert material to the process provide up to 80% of its energy in the form of process heat. This could be used to power a wide range of thermochemical processes, including recycling waste streams and purifying water. 18 platforms costing $450 million each operating around the world, each producing 1 TW of power, each processing massive quantities of sea water, ore and sewage into fresh water and pure elements, also extracts lithium and deuterium from sea water. Cleanly providing for all energy needs.","29,975 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,3K,7.7K,249.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Even-if-we-could-reach-nuclear-fusion-ignition-how-efficient-would-the-change-from-fusion-energy-to-electricity-be

From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that thereI used to work on fusion simulation codes (particle in cell) with the US National Labs when I was at NVIDIA, and I was very interested in seeing if we could solve the problems with fusion and picked the scientist and engineers' brains endlessly. My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","220,640 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,783.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Even-if-we-could-reach-nuclear-fusion-ignition-how-efficient-would-the-change-from-fusion-energy-to-electricity-be

In either case there must be a decision made to allow this to be done.Without these specific decisions we are left with highly speculative approaches that require significant research that could at any moment be classified out of existence.Without direct application of microfusion blasts in an electromagnetic thrust chamber the fusion rocket remains a theoretical and speculative designSince the design then relies on the development of fusion power technology beyond current capabilities, and requires the construction of rockets much larger and more complex than any current spacecraft.The surest way of building a fusion rocket with current technology is to use hydrogen bombs as proposed in Project Orion, but such a spacecraft would also be massive due to its pusher plate and of efficiency of energy coupling to the vehicle. Electromagnetic pulse and fission pollution make further problems.The Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty prohibits the use of nuclear bombs as propulsion. Therefore, the use of nuclear bombs to propel rockets on Earth is problematic, but possible in space in theory well beyond Earth.The answer here is to create micro fusion only pulse units and don't call them bombs. Also, you may use chemical rockets and solar power to operate well beyond Earth and establish an independent nuclear capacity beyond Earth. This runs up against the same sorts of barriers that keep critical information classified.FutureOnce space travel is solved then developElectricityWe will solve the energy problems of industry.
