A lot of things couldn’t be figured out in the 16th century - then Newton invented the Calculus, and a lot more things could be.

1,"No, it was both the development of the scientific method and the acceptance of science and the scientific method. As we advanced we could communicate faster and faster across the world this lead to even faster technological growth. We saw problems and solved them. People were inspired by others as well and some competition never hurt. We are just clever, there is no need to contribute it to aliens indeed by doing so you diminish what humanity as achieved by itself.","5,085 followers",Bobby Tatro,3.9K,2.2K,45.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-have-we-evolved-technologically-so-much-in-the-past-100-years-Was-it-aliens
2,"No. We have no evidence that any extraterrestrial being has ever been here. We just have a lot of very smart people who figured out a lot of things.

3,"Almost everything becomes digitized these days, creating maps is no exception. Drawing out roads, railways and even complete cities by hand, is not necessary anymore.

A radar device sends out a radio signal, which consists of electromagnetic waves, a pattern of magnetic and electric energy. The radio signal bounces off any object it hits, such as a mountain peak, and is reflected back to the radar device that transmitted it. Because the radar used in mapping is directed sideways from the aircraft, not straight down, several signals come back instead of only one.

4,"Enormously.I was trained as a military cartographer about 40 years ago.

These were large, heavy, finicky, and enormously expensive. I doubt if you could give one away these days. Most photogrammetry nowadays is partially automated, and done on a computer.Maps used to be drawn with pen and ink on draughting film or linen, then later the lines were scribed into an opaque emulsion on plastic or glass with gramaphone needles ground to cut a line of the correct width. These were then used to produce lithographic printing plates with various photomechanical processes. These days, the map detail is created electronically, and printed on a large colour printer, if a hard copy is even required.","5,085 followers",Bobby Tatro,3.2K,2.2K,45.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-have-we-evolved-technologically-so-much-in-the-past-100-years-Was-it-aliens

We’ll have realized that Elon Musks plan for his boring company always included sending the capability to the moon to create an underground moon base.“Cyborgs” will be more common, though you may not recognize them.

So as you belong to the 80's, amazed by the 4G speeds you have these days, (and I still being amazed by the 4G speeds, even though I belong to the late 90's), the need for a faster internet is never ends up. So even the internet speed is then 100 times faster than previous, it will become just a standard.And, I don't think the mobile phones would become obsolete. You can remember the huge diversity of mobile phones you had in the past 10 years.So then poeple realized that all they need, is just a screen to view the content (that is meant by 'using the phone' after all) So, while manyI don't have much idea of the transport though.
