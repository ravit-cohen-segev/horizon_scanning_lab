So right now, you need to worry about finding out what specifics in Multimedia interest you. What you think right now will interest you might not (for e.g. you say Signal Processing side of things. If you take up Image Processing, you might end up liking that), or might accumulate other factors and become something more (Signal Processing as applied to what? Wearables? AR/VR? Audio Signal Processing? Speech Signal Processing? One of these might interest you more than the others.)Based on the above two points, your resume will be a lot more coherent. At any given point in time, your prospective job will want you for what is there on your resume atTip:After your first year, you should try and get an internship at a place relevant to your interests, that is capable of adding to your resume. If it pays, it's good but if it doesn't, focus on your long term goals and how that job will help you.Remember","91,597 followers",Roland Bartetzko,10.5K,3.4K,314.6M,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-top-and-well-paid-around-90K-companies-for-a-USC-graduate-with-an-MSEE-specialized-in-multimedia-and-creative-technologies

When you see their posts, they almost always focus on the same things - even to the point that some are a cliche.The back of your thighs might get a pleasant surprise instead of sitting on a block of ice in winter time, but really, isAnd then the bullet trains. This is closer to significant reality. Japan definitely has highly developed bullet trains and with their nose to the grindstone dedication make them extremely punctual and efficient. Japan is also developing a maglev as an alternative to its already running Tokaido bullet trains. But let's look at this as well. Many nations in Europe also have fast and efficient bullet trains running - mainly it's the US dragging it's feet. Canada and Australia have smaller populations and making such a train profitable would be hard to impossible. And the US prefers to use trains for freight than moving people around, and with growing urbanization putting in new railways is insanely expensive. And while Japan's maglev won't be up and running til 2027, China has a fully functioning maglev running right now.Where Japan's actual high tech lies is more in mass production and robotics. For manufactured goods like cars and consumer electronics, big Japan factories have an amazing array of high tech machines and production methods - and they make far fewer mistakes and help make Japanese products the best in the world. Japan also seeks continual improvement, never sitting on its hands. But here too there are 2 sides to the story. The parts that are required for all those high tech goodies are often made by subcontractors, and they don't have the bleeding edge tech that western journalists focus on. And its high efficiency production methods like 'Just in Time' put more of the burden on the smaller firms and not the big name manufacturers. And while those big factories are about as high tech and efficient as you can imagine, quite often the offices that run them are still backwards and stuck in the 1970s. One prime example is Japan still using a lot of FAX machines, as well as requiring name stamps of documents (just as they've been done for over a millennium) instead of an electronic version of it. The idea of buying something online and 'clicking this box indicates your signature' has a long way to go in Japan.And while Japan has tried to advance in many production fields, it has failed in many others - agriculture being the prime examples. Japan simply doesn't engage in mass production farming, with more farms being small family run enterprises, so it is far less developed and more labor intensive. And while Japan has mass produced cars for several decades, the same effort for its own airplanes has failed miserably. Japan still relies on Boeing and Airbus, and only now has produced its first successful civilian passenger airplane (which will enter regular service in the next few years).The fact is that America still leads in numerous fields - astronautics, aeronautics, pharmaceuticals, computers and AI, chemical research, and of course weaponry. But America often classifies a lot of its technology for the military, while Japan doesn't. That's why you see a lot more development in Japan. If the US released all the tech it's sitting on for civilian applications, it would knock the world on its ear.","4,685 followers",Youji Hajime,538,1.4K,8.4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-top-and-well-paid-around-90K-companies-for-a-USC-graduate-with-an-MSEE-specialized-in-multimedia-and-creative-technologies

With the extra time, I wrote three hundred blog posts and a book. My income tripled, I received speaking opportunities, and created one of the largest marketing communities in Silicon Valley.Being socially confident is about taking action. Because only action can lead to reward.When someone makes fun of you or rejects you, don’t think about it. As soon as you start thinking, you stop taking action and feel anxious. So, move forward with every bad situation while keeping a happy-go-lucky attitude and smile.The other day, I flirted with this cute, dark-skinned girl with long, wavy black hair. She rejected me ten times in an hour before she kissed me.Most guys would’ve given up after the first rejection. No one sticks around for ten.I’m sure there were many times when she thought about walking away, but she was intrigued by the simple fact that I didn’t care.I brushed off rejection like it never happened by moving the conversation forward with jokes and fun conversation.For the entire hour, she couldn’t understand why I wasn’t hurting.Eventually, she got it.“You’re super confident? Aren’t you?”“I don’t think about it. I don’t get mad. I’m just here living in the moment.”“Not even a little mad?”“Are you worried about something?”She looked stunned. I expressed myself as a socially confident person, then indicated her questions revealed her own anxiety.In a couple of sentences, we reversed social standing. Then she gave me a dreamy look of wanting to get to know me better. Seconds later, we kissed.I knew the scenario would play out like this.

Why was there a complete stranger in my house at 1 a.m. when I desperately wanted to go to bed? Out of respect for my husband and his new-found friend, I’d have to stay up and exchange pleasantries, which I was in no mood to do.They both looked up at me in awkward silence, Agassi holding his glass of whiskey inches from his mouth.‘Hello,’ I said, hesitantly, waiting for some kind of introduction or explanation.They said nothing. Just grinned at me like two idiots. I felt like I’d walked in on some secret meeting.‘So? What’s going on then?’ I asked, politely.My husband, still grinning, said ‘I made a new friend at the pub. It’s Andre Agassi!’Very funny. I was now annoyed. It was late and I had to be up for work the next morning. This was no time for childish shenanigans.They carried on with their silly, evasive charade for a while longer. Frustrated, I announced I was going to bed.Agassi got up and sat next to me on the sofa. He looked at me intensely. It made me nervous. I really wanted to punch him.He reached into his back pocket, pulled out his wallet and fished in it for something. He pulled out a photo.‘I’m not Andre Agassi, but you do know me.’‘O...kay...’‘The last time you saw me,’ he grinned, ‘I looked like this.’ He held up a small, black and white passport photo of my cousin, Ali, at age 5. I had not seen him or spoken to him since my childhood.At age 12, I’d left my entire family behind to escape the revolution in my country. My mum, four grandparents, four aunties, three uncles and five cousins. We were a tight-knit family. Always together.My parents were divorced, my father had custody, and he’d decided to take my brother and me to America, for our own safety. It was the right decision, but it meant having to say goodbye to the whole lot of them.It was hard. I was homesick for a long time and missed them all terribly. They would occasionally come to me in my dreams, where we’d be joyously reunited. I’d wake from those dreams in such a state. Happy, but tearful. Lost.Gradually though, the gulf between me and my old life grew wider and quieter. The letters and phone calls stopped. Eventually, as I delved into my new life on a different continent, they all became a distant memory, locked away in that box of sentimental items in the attic of my mind. They were characters from another life. A life that no longer existed.For nearly two decades, I had no family. I never spoke of them or to them. It was easier.Ali had been the baby of our family back then. A darling little angel. He once had a passport photo taken. He looked so cute in it; his expression was so serious, like someone facing the Spanish Inquisition! This photo became a favourite within our entire family. Everyone got a copy to keep on their fridge or in their wallet or scrap book. I had one too, which I’d ended up taking with me when I left my country twenty years earlier.And now, here was this grown man, sitting on my sofa, holding up that very passport photo in front of my face. He had known that I would immediately recognise it.I didn’t say a word. Not one.Instead, I buried my face in my hands and just sobbed. I cried and cried. My heart felt like it could explode. I can honestly say that, second to the birth of my son, it was the most emotional moment I’ve experienced.Ali and that little photo he was holding represented my old life, my entire family, my history! And here he was, sitting an inch away from me.Apparently, my husband had come home from work that afternoon to find a strange man with a rucksack sitting on our front step. Ali had got my address from another relative and had decided to come to the UK, where I now lived, and pay me a surprise visit. It was pre-mobile days, so my husband couldn’t get in touch with me to tell me to hurry home.All they could do was wait for me to return. So, they went to the pub, drank too many whiskies and concocted their Agassi ruse.When I’d finally stopped crying, we hugged and hugged and talked and reminisced the rest of the morning.Suddenly, there was a bridge connecting me to all of them again. They were all real once more, no longer a fairytale or vague memory.I have since reunited with several more members of my family, including my mum. But none of them made me as emotional as Ali, because he was the first.He broke the dam.Edit:","83,128 followers",Anna Sharudenko,13.3K,199,26.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-top-and-well-paid-around-90K-companies-for-a-USC-graduate-with-an-MSEE-specialized-in-multimedia-and-creative-technologies

18,"Here are 25 negative effects technology can have:1. IsolationSocial isolation is characterized by a lack of contact with other people in normal daily living, such as the workplace, with friends and in social activities. We isolate ourselves by walking around in our own little world, listening to our iPods or staring at the screen of the latest mobile device even when we are around other people. Studies have shown that people who are socially isolated will live shorter lives.2. Lack of Social SkillsThe use of online social media outlets causes us to meet face-to-face with much less frequency reHere are 25 negative effects technology can have:1. IsolationSocial isolation is characterized by a lack of contact with other people in normal daily living, such as the workplace, with friends and in social activities. We isolate ourselves by walking around in our own little world, listening to our iPods or staring at the screen of the latest mobile device even when we are around other people. Studies have shown that people who are socially isolated will live shorter lives.2. Lack of Social SkillsThe use of online social media outlets causes us to meet face-to-face with much less frequency resulting in a lack of much needed social skills. We lose the ability to read body language and social cues in other people.3. ObesityThe more time people are spending engrossed in video games, talking to friends online and watching funny cat videos on YouTube, they are spending less time being active or exercising. Also the likelihood of mindlessly eating unhealthy food increases as people are hypnotized by the latest episode of Honey Boo Boo.4. DepressionTechnology creates the perfect recipe for depression with the lack of human contact, overeating, and lack of exercise. There is a reason the use of antidepressants are on the rise and the blame can’t be completely dumped on the pharmaceutical companies. They aren’t carting people into the doctor’s office and force feeding them the pills. This isn’t to say that depression isn’t a real problem, but some people could cure their depression by living a healthier lifestyle.5. Poor Sleep HabitsSome of the negative effects of technology can be linked to the effect it has on sleep habits. We get sucked into online activities that keep us up too late and the constant stream of information can make it difficult to turn off our brains. Also, the ambient glow from screens can affect the release of melatonin, the sleep chemical. Keeping technology out of the bedroom would be a very healthy habit to acquire.6. PollutionWith the rapid-changing world of electronics and technology, the turnover rate for upgrades is staggering. This constant stream of out with the old, in with the new is adding to the levels of toxicity in our air and land. E-waste is not always disposed of properly, causing deadly chemicals to leach into the ground. Plants that manufacture the electronics are emitting toxic fumes into the air. Plus there is little to no regulations on the disposal of personal E-waste.7. Increased BullyingThe use of technology has caused an increase in bullying and escalated the degree of severity. Kids are no longer able to escape their tormentors once they reach the safety of their own homes. Bullies infiltrate the security of their victims’ homes through online avenues. It is also easier to get more kids involved in bullying because people are more likely to say things online that they wouldn’t say in person. The increase in cyber-bullying has also led to an increase in teen suicides.8. Lack of PrivacyThe internet has stripped the world of privacy. Long gone are the days of having an unlisted telephone number and staying offline to keep your information safe from prying eyes. With a few clicks on a keyboard, the average person can find anyone’s address and contact information. For those with more sinister intentions, the use of phishing, viruses, and hacking helps to find any information they wish to obtain. Plus, people have no sense of privacy online. They don’t think twice about tweeting every move they make, freely giving out their location on Google Map and putting their entire life story on Facebook.9. Higher Level of DeceitOn the flip side of having no privacy, people use the internet to deceive others. Most people don’t dig too deeply when doing a search on someone to check them out. By creating a few false profiles, people are able to pretend to be whomever they want. People are being “catfished” on dating sites. Hell, you could be talking to someone on the FBI’s top ten most wanted list and not realize it until you see them getting arrested on the news.10. Warped Sense of RealityUsing the internet as an escape from real life is very easy to do. In real life you only speak to a few people each day, there’s no Photoshop or avatar for the reflection in your mirror, bills must be paid and saying smartass things is frowned upon. However, online you are a freaking rock star! You have enough “friends” to form a small country, you look great in your pics or you have a kickass avatar, plus you get rewards or points for saying clever things (more if the clever thing is also mean-spirited). Unfortunately, we must live in the real world whether we like it or not.11. StressConstantly being “plugged in” and “connected” causes an extra layer of stress that wasn’t present before the overuse of technology.12. Blackberry/iPhone ThumbTendonitis in the thumb, a.k.a. Blackberry/iPhone Thumb, is a form of repetitive strain injury caused by the frequent use of thumbs to press buttons on mobile devices. The same injury can also be obtained from playing too many video games.13. Lack of Social BoundariesMuch in the same way that people overshare on social media sites, there is an increasing tendency to cross social boundaries. Cyberstalking someone or sending unsolicited nude photos are examples of grossly crossing social boundaries.14. Lack of Sexual BoundariesExposure to sexual content is more likely to happen at a much younger age. Before the internet, the only chance a child had of being exposed to pornography was if their dad didn’t hide his Playboy magazine well enough. Now, well, let’s just say you pray your filters are doing their job when your kid searches for “Puss and Donkey” from Shrek.Sexting is also a concern with technology being used at such a young age. There is no way in hell a girl would have taken a nude photo of herself and handed it to a guy before the popularity of texting. Yet, using your phone to snap a quick boob shot and texting it to your boyfriend seems to be no big deal. If you wouldn’t print the picture out and hand it to the guy, then you shouldn’t test it. And guys — girls do not want pictures of your penis. So stop sending them.15. Lack of Social BondsCreating a lasting bond with other people requires face-to-face interaction. The more we isolate ourselves with technology the fewer bonds we will form. People are expected to do more work at home which takes away time they would be spending with their families. Also, younger people prefer communicating online versus face-to-face. When people are in the same room and communicating via text or instant messaging instead of speaking to each other, there’s a problem.16. Constant DistractionWhen we are focused on a device instead of what’s going on around us we miss a great deal. Think of the number of times you have been texting or talking to a friend and missed the opportunity to flirt with the hot guy standing beside you. There is also a rise in the number of injuries incurred by people texting while walking.17. Neck and Head PainConstantly looking down at devices can cause neck pain and over time will cause the neck to lose its natural curve. Eyestrain can also cause headaches, blurred vision, and migraines.18. Shortened Attention SpanThe use of social media has shortened our attention span from 12 minutes to 5 minutes. Constant news feeds, getting information in 140 characters and videos that are 10 minutes or less has literally rewired our brains. People who are online an average of 5 hours a day have trouble remembering people’s names, forget pots on the stove and even their own birthday.19. AddictionPeople are not only dependent on technology they are also addicted to it. Studies have shown that when cell phones are taken away subjects heard or felt fathom vibrations, continuously reached for phones that weren’t there and became fidgety and restless. These are some of the same withdrawal symptoms you would expect from doing drugs.20. Lack of EmpathyThe constant stream of violent scenes on video games, TV, movies and YouTube causes people to become desensitized to the destruction of any kind. The normalizing of bad things happening and the culture of narcissism created by social media creates a society of people who lack empathy. When people stop caring, the world goes to hell in a handbasket.21. More ViolenceAfter people lose empathy and are accustomed to violence, it becomes the social norm. Teenage girls are videoing themselves violently beating another girl; the number of school shootings is rising and videos of people attacking homeless people are a few examples of violent behavior caused by media.22. Higher Energy ConsumptionAlthough individual devices are becoming more energy efficient, the increased overall use is causing a higher consumption of energy. People don’t turn their devices off; they keep computers on or plugged in, mobile devices charging and televisions plugged in. Also manufacturing all of these high tech toys causes an increase in greenhouse gas emissions.23. Developmental Issues in ChildrenChildren are using more technology now than they have ever used in the past. All of the negative effects that social media and television is having on adults are far greater when it comes to the developing minds of children. There is no way to know what long-term effect technology will have on our children because this is the first generation to have unlimited access.24. NeurosisTechnology causes people to suffer from mental and emotional disturbances, such as anxiety, phobias, and delusions, which are all symptoms of neurosis. Being convinced you’re very ill after looking up strange diseases on WebMD or thinking you are famous because you have had a viral video are a couple of ways technology neurosis manifests itself.25. Loss of Hearing and EyesightUsing headphones and earbuds can cause people to lose their hearing over time. Likewise, straining your eyes looking at computer and device screens can cause people to need glasses much earlier in life.Be more mindful of the time you spend using technology. If you have long conversations with Siri than you do with real people, it’s probably time to put the phone down. Force yourself to have an electronic-free day or weekend. When you go on vacation, don’t take your phone or at least put it on “do not disturb”. Creating balance will help you enjoy the benefits of technology without becoming a mindless internet zombie.","135,500 followers",Hector Quintanilla,118.2K,1.2K,88.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-3-effects-of-technology-on-our-social-life

This is how he was looking in that make-upNo one could’ve imagined Cristiano Ronaldo behind that make up. He picks up his football, ties his (borrowed) dog to a chair and starts doing kick-ups. The disguise works.No-one gives him a second glance. To everyone else in the Plaza, he just looks like a homeless guy trying to earn a few euros from the locals.Occasionally, passers-by will stop to watch the homeless man's impressive football skills, especially when he decides to replicate Ronaldo's trade-mark step-overs.Several hours pass before the heart-warming pay-off finally happens. A kid decides to play with him and the two take part in a bit of one-on-one.After few moments, Ronaldo gives him a hug (still dressed as a tramp), picks up the ball and signs it.The little boy looks confused, wondering why this man has signed the football - that is until Ronaldo begins to peel off the disguise, leaving his new best friend in open-mouthed wonder and on the verge of (happy) tears.And, no doubt, everyone else was shocked.There’s a lesson :No one gives a fuck to your football skills, unless you're Ronaldo.What should you learn from this?No one in this world cares who you are, what you are doing, and what you’re going to do unless you’re someone very famous.If you’ve anThere are 7.8 billion people in this world, you can’t expect everyone to appreciate what you’re doing.

I was often considered to be weakest in Mathematics in my class and a shy guy from young age. My teacher often quoted me as average. My parents always said that I was not as smart as my brother.I took it as a challenge. To prove my parents and teachers wrong, I spent sleepless nights with my close friend in researching Numbers theory and tried to find something new. I thought I may not be good at everything, but definitely I will be good at something. After many days I devised my own formula, based on Zeller’s congruence theory. With my formula, I realized I can easily solve some complex Mathematics problems in a short time. I realized that my formula is good enough to break the world record of some popular Maths Wizards.Applying my own formula and I broke one of the world records of Indian mathematics Wizard Sakuntala Devi, who was 82 at that time (4 times elder to me).Here I am, so-called weakest one in Maths, ending up setting a world record, that is yet to be broken. The so-called introvert and the shy guy is boldly answering the questions of media people in this picture.If there is one thing I learned in life, it is that when your close ones mock/degrade you, it hurts. We tend to react either in anger or in tears. I learned it is best to reply in actions than in words or emotions.I’m in the mid-20s now, yet I continue to keep this pic as my FB and Whatsapp DP. This always reminds me of one thing, ‘You are more than what you think you are’.New Update: I have got messages asking me to teach quants for competitive exams. Along with some NIT professors and some friends, we are in the process of registering an NGO with the sole purpose to teach Quants needed for Bank/SSC exams free of cost. The registration process for NGO is going on and if everything goes by plan we will start processing once the COVID goes down. Just a little thing I can give back to society.

I was initially reticent but finally conceded.Until November, I had answered 5–6 questions.Since November, I began writing regularly.To my amazement, I started getting hooked on writing.Quora kept me engaged and, most importantly, happy. The kind and encouraging words of fellow Quorans really made a world of difference in my attitude towards life.I thank them all.Within days, I recovered beyond my imagination.I would not say Quora changed my life.It rather restored my ‛life’.I have become the person I was before- Happy.And I'm grateful to this platform for that.:-)","3,930 followers",Anumeha Sharma,37.3K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-3-effects-of-technology-on-our-social-life

32,Communications. In thirty + years in Broadcasting the technology changed nine times. Now that I have been retired for thirty more years I have found that it is changing even faster (maybe I was the hold-up). have you seen any eight tracks or single recordings for sale as records recently. I can't even purchase a plain and simple radio anymore.Communications are the high-speed highways of today and anyone that manages them or creates good new tools will be so far ahead of their contemporaries that they will have to look back to see the future.

This is even more pronounced with statically typed languages where typechecking as an action is split from editing code. Again, you write some code and then typecheck it; if you have a type error you fix it and repeat, otherwise you're set.Of course, there are some pretty standard tools that are a bit more interactive. A REPL lets you load up some code, run snippets and inspect variables. A debugger lets you go through a computation step by step. An IDE can make error checking inline by highlighting broken code. However, all these are still pretty limited.At first, this is going to be primarily a UI/UX advancement. Bret Victor has a some talks like this, andI've even seen some cool interactive development support in Emacs:However, these tools are still very new. The actual user experience is still being developed, and the backends are still very primitive.Languages will also adapt to be more interactive. Haskell is already going in this direction, especially with ""type holes"". The idea is simple--instead of writing a part of your program, you can leave a ""hole"" there; the compiler can then tell you what type itIn the longer run, we'll see more advanced backend logic taking advantage of interactivity. For example, we could incorporate efficient search to interactively fill in parts of algorithms according to assertions. The programmer would guide the search by specifying some constraints, but the actual code would be produced by an algorithm. Consider various applications ofSo, my prediction: we will see a much more interactive programming environment coupled with sophisticated tools on the backend assisting the programmer","358,842 followers",Sean Kernan,1.8K,5.6K,726.3M,2014,https://www.quora.com/How-and-why-did-Japan-become-dominant-in-creating-advanced-technology

In spite of having easy access to credit cards, social security numbers, and proprietary software, Mitnick never spent a dime of other people's money. Never stole any living person’s identity.

You find their vulnerabilities – trust, mainly – and exploit them.The pre-teen Mitnick was precociously articulate and relaxed around adults.
