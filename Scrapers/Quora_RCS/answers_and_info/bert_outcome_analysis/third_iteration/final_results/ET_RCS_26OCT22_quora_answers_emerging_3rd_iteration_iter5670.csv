0,"Uber will go out of business in 12–18 years, which is 6–10 years after Google’s Waymo starts mass-producing driverless cars.Waymo is way ahead of the competition. And it will not partner with Uber - instead it will go head on - and win.Waymo’s driverless cars’ cost-per-mile will be 20–30% of Uber’s human driven ones. And when Uber does go driverless it will always be playing catch-up, most notably in terms of safety.Sadly, Uber will unlikely survive long into the driverless car era.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,8.1K,996,156.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-did-UBER-make-use-of-emerging-technologies

2,"Avoid booking an uber while your smartphone’s battery is dying. Yes you read it right. Now, what might be the connection between battery and uber?According to an independent company’s study Uber users are more likely to accept surge pricing if their phone is low on battery.The reason here is pretty simple. Anyone with ample amount of juice left can wait for surge price to go down but a person with only 10–20% battery can not book if his phone is dead so, he is most likely to wait for 2–5 minutes and the chances oAvoid booking an uber while your smartphone’s battery is dying.

3,"It’s not hard to build an Uber-like app. It’s not trivial because there are at least 3 parts; a client for drivers, a client for passengers and a server to match then, but it’s simple enough that dozens of companies have done it with little resources.Building the Uber apps proper is much harder though. From a strict front-end point of view, they comprise hundreds of views, which means that they all have to be designed and implemented, along with the transitions between those views. Beyond volume, there are a number of interesting technical challenges in the app, such as map presentation, animaIt’s not hard to build an Uber-like app. It’s not trivial because there are at least 3 parts; a client for drivers, a client for passengers and a server to match then, but it’s simple enough that dozens of companies have done it with little resources.Building the Uber apps proper is much harder though.

4,"Assuming he will not carry a cell-phone continuously, look into a monitored alert system.My mother has a life-alert bracelet with a button, and it served her well when she broke her leg. Nothing is going to respond immediately, but they called her (no answer), then they start calling her children to see if she is okay. As we did not respond immediately, they dispatched paramedics.These bracelets have a base unit in the house that covers all rooms and a bit of the surrounding area; they do not work outside the home.",906 followers,Ardell DellaLoggia,4.3K,2.6K,4.3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-did-UBER-make-use-of-emerging-technologies
