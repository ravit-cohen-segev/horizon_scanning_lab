0,"What an odd question! It contains two completely unsubstantiated suggestions:Some people use Mac. Some people use Windows. It’s largely a matter of taste. In terms of marketshare, however, Windows completely and utterly swamps Mac.So it follows that most developers use Windows.Windows is no more advanced than Mac. Both are highly sophisticated systems. If you think Windows has “better” features, that’s purely a matter of opinion and taste.",201 followers,Tuqa Abumatar,3.8K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-so-many-software-developers-use-Mac-even-though-Windows-has-much-advanced-technology-and-better-features

2,"Lets clear the myth of Mac vs PC, and just understand the simple truth of all Operating Systems…. They all suck! Seriously, I have one of those hate for all OS’s available. I got a Mac because I use command line for everything. I find Mac Finder absolutely horrendous, but some people love it. I don’t get it.Anyways, the main reason I think a lot of developers use Mac over Windows is the fact that most Open Source software utilize a lot of tools and command line tools that is only available on POSIX compatible systems, or it is just easier to use the Mac command line to interact with these openLets clear the myth of Mac vs PC, and just understand the simple truth of all Operating Systems….

4,"Hardware and software.The hardware can be better quality mechanically and electronically because Apple doesn’t need to meet razor thin margins. Lid hinges can be more robust. Parts can be selected which run reliably at lower clock speeds so the OS can throttle more circuits for better battery life. Finely machined metal cases are nice.Apple doesn’t need to cut pennies by changing chips used for a given model as new ones become available so there’s more test coverage on the combination you’re using.Apple produces both the hardware and software with QA on the package which makes it more reliableHardware and software.The hardware can be better quality mechanically and electronically because Apple doesn’t need to meet razor thin margins.

A good soaring plane can get up to 20,000 feet using thermals.

7,"Without a historical time frame this is virtually impossible to answer. What about the wheel?When it comes to the best invention immediately before electricity I think the pneumatic tyre rates very highly. Without it the bicycle, which enabled physical mobility at low price for the mass population (and greatly improved the prospects of randy human males) would not have been so successful and motor transport would be slow and uncomfortable.","1,046 followers",Krishna Teja Mokshagundam,12.6K,250,1.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-so-many-software-developers-use-Mac-even-though-Windows-has-much-advanced-technology-and-better-features

9,"There are many great ancient and modern technologies which don't require electricity.    Anything before 1800 or so ran without electricity.One I like is the diesel engine.    Unlike a gasoline powered engine there are no sparks,  the fuel just combusts with heat and pressure.    Modern cars that use diesel engines have electronics to make things more efficient and startup simpler,  but fundamentally,  diesel doesn't need volts.

11,"Two reasons.Two reasons.The cheapest, fastest, safest, most reliable way to get to space is a reusable conventional rocket, not a hybrid airplane/space plane/winged space station mashup.We didn’t know that when we built the space shuttle (and it wouldn’t matter if we had—the purpose of a National space program is not to get to space as cheaply and reliably as possible, it’s to get senators re-elected).

12,"“Why can't NASA bring back the Space Shuttle program with today's advanced technology?”Because it’s probably obsolete, even if it was updated. When (if) Starship flies, it will outperform the shuttle, and cost less to operate.The entire original idea for the shuttle was to be 100% reusable, but it wasn’t. Not even close.. It had wings, so it could land. Starship will be 100% reusable (in theory), and does not require wings to land. Wings are nothing but dead weight, and a waste of fuel to take to orbit and back.Starship is basically a much simpler orbiter, with a single, reusable booster.
