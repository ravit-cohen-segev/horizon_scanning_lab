1,"We’re continuing to evolve physically. For instance, some people are more resistant to this novel coronavirus than others, either due to their physical makeup or tendency towards healthy lifestyle choices. This outbreak will tend to weigh the surviving population towards those who have genetically better resistance for one reason or another. That is how evolution works.I’m not trying to be cold towards those suffering. I believe I may have the virus myself, and have an 87 year old father to worry about. I am anxious and upset.

3,"They didn’t, they evolvedWe don’t know exactly when we and our fellow apes diverged from other primates (including the various monkeys) to begin our own branch of the evolutionary tree but it may have been as long as 25–30 million years ago. That was when the common ancestor (of humans and monkeys, in your terms) lived. That figure is based on various evidence, including fossil evidence discovered in 2013.You have a very poor grasp of the theory of evolution which means that your question is based on an entirely false premise.",0 followers,Jim Hogarth,10.5K,94,5.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Does-it-really-make-sense-for-humans-to-be-afraid-about-technology-evolving
4,"Yes. That started with the discovery of fire and the technology of cooking. Cooking releases more nutrients from food, enabling larger, more nutrient-hungry brains. Agriculture, one of the largest technological innovations in human history, accelerated that trend.Technology has shaped our evolution since the beginning.","358,985 followers",Sean Kernan,8.6K,5.6K,727.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Does-it-really-make-sense-for-humans-to-be-afraid-about-technology-evolving
5,No. Evolution does not work by the appearance of “features”. Evolution refers to the entire relationship between the species (breeding population) and its ever changing environment over time measured in generations. Evolution is about adaptation to the environment - not about the appearance of “features” in individuals.,"358,985 followers",Sean Kernan,53.8K,5.6K,727.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Does-it-really-make-sense-for-humans-to-be-afraid-about-technology-evolving

9,"Well, we’ll always be part of the clade of hominids, the great apes. It would take a very long time to become a hominid that was no longer considered an ape but something else - maybe if we ever become energy beings.","2,288 followers",Emmanuel Fabella,2.8K,434,3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Does-it-really-make-sense-for-humans-to-be-afraid-about-technology-evolving
