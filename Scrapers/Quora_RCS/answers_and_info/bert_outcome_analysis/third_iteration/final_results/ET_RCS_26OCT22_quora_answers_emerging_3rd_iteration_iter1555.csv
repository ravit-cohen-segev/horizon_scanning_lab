5,"Transfer learning in ML models.Humans are really good at generalizing. We only have to see a few dogs before we can recognize a dog when we see one.Machines are not. ML models require millions of examples before forming a reliable classifier, and that classifier is very specific to the data on which it was trained. If your training data doesn't include dogs with three legs, the model won't recognize them. A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one.

A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one. It's hypothesized that the reason humans learn so quickly is that we are fitting new examples into our existing knowledge rather than forming entirely new categories. If we could teach machines to do the same, they would learn exponentially faster and apply that learning more effectively.Transfer learning is a very hot topic in AI research right now, so I expect major breakthroughs in the next few years. I think this may be sufficient to achieve artificial general intelligence, but even if not, it will dramatically extend the range of tasks that machines can accomplish.","58,987 followers",Michael Wolfe,504,2K,17.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-big-thing-in-Android-technology

9,"Im not certain how many generarions of advancement would be required to gain the technology to do this daunting task. But Moore’s law continues to play out like clockwork so it may not take even that long. Moore’s law states that we increase our technoligical capacity, speed, abilities, etc at a rate that doubles what can be employed for the same cost every 18 months. This is an exponential growth curve that by itself could being the necessary tech to us sooner than we expect.

It is what Ray Kurzweil calls the singularity. That is the moment when our technology reaches the point that it gains the ability to reproduce itself without human intervention. At that point, our machines will be able to not only reproduce independently, but can also improve itself with each generation. And the rate of evolution of our tech will outpace the slow biological evolution we depend on for our advancement so much we will be left in the dust overnight. These machines then could create what is needed for this trip in nearly no time at all. The question is, will they invite us to go with them? And would we meet beings there that are biological like us, or other advanced technological races like ours?",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

10,"Yes or no, depends:Yes or no, depends:BUT VERY IMPORTANT to consider: All those are not some historical evolved technologies but TOTALLY NEW CONCEPTS!Then… here comes the bad news: Even if in 200 years we have advanced so much, from sail ships to jet planes, GPS, internet, space stations and nuclear reactors, justWe are at a bottleneck with space transportationSo what we need in the next 200 years is something totally, but totally new concept in mater of physicsWe need a totally new concept because if we are limited at current concepts, even with advanced technology we will never reach to far. Maybe, just maybe the nearest stars and that’s it. Consider that even a slimmer and evolved faster sail ship, is still a ship, limited to wind and water. The radio was not. But the radio was not some evolved sailship technology. The radio or the planes was radical new concepts!So, if we discover some new radical concept like was the planes, the electricity & radio revolution vs sailships, then we will reach Andromeda. Else, no.In 50 years from the first step on the Moon we are still on Earth, not revolutionizing but just slowly perfectionating the same old rocket/sailship technolgy. Now is slightly better, I agree, but essentially, still just like better sailships.","16,642 followers",Lee Thé,2.6K,10.1K,80.7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Which-technologies-will-drive-economic-growth-in-the-next-few-decades-in-advanced-economies
11,"No, and maybe never. Intergalactic flight is nearly impossible with all known science. In 200 years we will be starting to reach the nearby stars if everything goes really well. And that is pretty cool already. Read the hard science - just the theoretical aspect - here:Bear in mind lunar and interplanetary flight uses essentially Newton’s science and math (from the 1700s), interstellar will use Einstein’s (in 50 to 100 years if all goes really well, in 300–400 years if things just plod along), and we",147 followers,Richard Adkins,1.4K,289,555K,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-big-thing-in-Android-technology

13,I think we cannot predict what would technology give us next.   I am telling so because we did not think couple years of back that the innovations of the new technology now would one day become reality. Technology has become more advanced that changed our lives rapidly. Anyway the advancement of technology has our lives simpler and easier. Everything is available now at our finger tips.
