By the time she had finished her great book,However, as others have said, from a strictly economic standpoint, the plague improved the lives of the lowest classes (if they survived). The living inherited the property of the dead, consolidating wealth into a smaller population, and the price of labor shot up as supply was insufficient to meet demand. The nobility tried to pass laws to fix prices, but people ignored that and established an underground economy (as people always do).As for science, technology, medicine, and engineering, it didn't really hold things up much. They were all in their infancy and not that many people were working on them anyway.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2015,https://www.quora.com/How-far-did-the-Black-Death-set-back-human-advancement-Would-we-have-more-or-less-advanced-technology-in-2015-if-the-plague-never-happened

A day that goes by without any terrorist attacks being conducted, much less reported.. is the only measuring stick many use in that work and that has to be enough.At least with the military you can thank a soldier/sailor/airman for their service and sacrifice.

They farmed the job out to local mercenaries who lacked enthusiasm for the assignment.The CIA knew about two known al Qaeda agents, Khalid Almihdhar and Nawaf Alhazmi, when they were still in the Middle East. The CIA had searched their hotel room and found their US visas. These two went on to be photographed attending an al Qaeda summit in Kuala Lumpur. The CIA lost them in Bangkok, and they flew to Los Angeles. They wound up living with an FBI informant in San Diego under their own real names. They were listed in the phone book and everything. One of their benefactors received a charitable check from Princess Haifa, the wife of the Saudi Ambassador. The Saudi Ambassador, Prince Bandar, was so close to George W. Bush that he was known as “Bandar Bush”.Below is Bandar listening to a fish story from W, probably at the Crawford ranch. Below that is Bandar at the White House two days after 9/11. ( I bet we’re looking at $5000 worth of shoes in that picture.) (Looks like they’re chuckling at some witticism uttered by the President. It appears that the Vice President is not amused.) (Note Bandar’s showing of the sole to the National Security Advisor. Very disrespectful. My guess is that she noticed.)The CIA knew about these two al Qaeda agents. One of them had lived in an al Qaeda communications hub in Yemen for a year. This hub’s communications were monitored by the NSA, and separately by the CIA, and simple audio bugs were installed in the building as well.A couple of FBI guys who had been seconded to the CIA unit wanted to share the information with their FBI colleagues. They were initially prohibited from doing so, but ultimately the FBI got the heads up. The FBI had a bitter argument about whether these two known al Qaeda agents should be subjected to a full-scale criminal investigation or a more limited intelligence investigation. The intel probe was done by a rookie in the FBI’s NYC office. Within days he wanted to run a credit card check on the two terrorists. He was over-ruled by an FBI superior, Dina Corsi.The credit card check would have revealed that these known al Qaeda agents had purchased ten airline tickets dated 9/11/01 under their own real names. The Mossad named these two in their own warning before 9/11, and also named the two alleged WTC pilots.There were warnings before 9/11 from 12 foreign countries, 4 FBI offices, and the CIA. CIA honchos Tenet, Blee, and Black put the blame on the National Security Advisor, Dr. Condoleezza Rice, because they knew that the so-called “liberal media” would never dare to criticize her in any way. The media even gave her a pass on torture. She chaired the Principals Committee that approved the torture policies in the spring of 2002, months before there was any pretense of any legal cover. She told the CIA “It’s your baby, go do it!” The media gave her a pass on perjury. She lied under oath to the faces of the 9/11 widows when she testified that the CIA’s “Bin Laden Determined to Strike in US” memo was “not a warning” and did not contain new threat information.In 2005, the head of the CIA, Porter Goss, told TIME Magazine that he had an “excellent” idea of where Osama was, but they weren’t going after him.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,12.7K,996,156M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Who-has-more-advanced-technology-the-CIA-or-NSA

This tunnel will reduce the distance between Manali and Leh by 46 Kms that is about 4–5 hours.

Because it is all a matter of how much information you are processing.When we are young - time travels slower, because we are processing more new information. Remember how long the summer holidays were? And how bored you got in the back of a car? That’s why. The journey was taking much longer for you.So be merciful. There’s a reason they whine.And when you are old - you can sometimes be shocked while driving. Because if the information you are processing doesn’t vary (as is the case on open stretches of road) the journey can only seem to take a minute.You wonder where the time went - and worry if you fell asleep. You probably didn’t - time just sped up massively for you.But if you crash - then the opposite will happen.People describe accidents as happening in slow motion. And it is not an illusion or trick of memory - it really happened. They will accurately describe events that took a few seconds in great detail.This is because their brain ramped up how much information it took in and processed. And so their perception of time slowed down.All of which means: if you absolutely must kill a bug, be kind and make it quick.Because however quickly you kill them - for a fly, every death is a slow death.Time passes more slowly for flies, study findsMetabolic rate and body size are linked with perception of temporal informationData set used in main analysis",67 followers,Nate White,29.2K,1.8K,8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-far-did-the-Black-Death-set-back-human-advancement-Would-we-have-more-or-less-advanced-technology-in-2015-if-the-plague-never-happened
