Nazi Germany built and laid down a secret North polar Military Airfield and base, including underground tunnels, hot springs and food growing areas. “We have built our Fhurher a tropical paradise at the north Pole” Quoted from Grand Admiral Donitz germanies U boat expert. The Helio gun takes energy from the sun and turns it towards other purposes. it could alos theoreticaly be used to drain waters out from the seas or polar ice fields, tocreate Desert Paradises too by cleaning away the salt from the sea water and using it as massed irrigation. Food for thought now we are all faced with extreme high dry summer temperatres andd roughts. Perhaps someone should go and find whats left of it and bring it back for testing??? We could use them to take sea water and irrigate our dried out food crops….Helios was a type of nazi Star wars weapon like the Fictional “Death Star” lazer weapons used in the Lucas films. But it could also be used to help manking not just as a weapon to destroy him….like so many inventions, it is up to you what you all do with them…German Lazer GunGermany tested and developed a series of Lazer based weaponry. They tested them in the Western Desert of North Afrika “out of sight”. Little technical information or photogrpahic material is available, however, Russia has developed a very similar modern copie in recentyears to the original Nazi german version (probably Russias Red Army catured the information at the close of the German war in May 1945 when it overr an german territories).Below Putins Russia does have a Modern Lethal lazer weaponry system. it may be deployed shortly in Ukraine with disasterous results for Ukraines defenders. if so it must be located and destroyed immediately before it can go into operation….The German device took at least one hour to cool safe enough to be able to transport it on a trailer. The German lazer was mounted on a specialy converted Sonnderhangar (special trailer). and towed by two or three SDKFZ Halftracks.Verdict Did exist and was absolutely LETHAL.Below The original Nazi Lazer weapon. Several were actually built. One was a Mobil version for battle field use and got tested in North Afrika. German scientists at Auschwitz also used a scaled down version, known by the sinister name of the Auschwitz electric chair. it couldmurder two thousand jews in one “sitting”…No further comment.GIANT LARGE OVERSIZED PIECES OR ARTILLERYBelow this is Schwherer GUSTAV, Gustav has two sisters RITA and DORA (Fat Dora named after herr krupps fat daughter). GUSTAV was brought up to Russia and fired giant shells onto the Soviet Fortress being defended at the Port of Sebastopol. One shell fired penetrated sixty metres of reinforced concrete under the bay, breaching the tunnels and flooding them out with sea water…Brigade KOMSOMOL who were defending Sebastopol surrendered shortly afterwards. the giant gun consumed enormous quantities of men and materials and had to have a entire regiment f Luftwaffe anti aircraft protection troops deployed alongside it to protect the giant monster from enemy air raids. Each gun barrle was pecialy designed but could ONLY BE FRED UP TO 64 TIMES. After which the gun had to be withdran from action and the entire worn outbarrel changed;Below GUSTAV Mounted and fully assembled for fireing. The rail wagon cars and giant barrel transported as separate assembeleis and it took five thousand men to re assemble and protect the giant gun in its fireing position. Specialy designed and laid railway tracks had to be laid down in place to make the fireing position….much time was therefore sepnt dis mantelin transporting laying rail tracks and re assembeling again;;;then after just 64 shots the entire barrel needed to be changed again….In order to actually get GUSTAV into Russia fifty thousand german troops were divertedf rom Operation barbarossa and used to take up, modify and then relay several thousand miles of Soviet railway track to be able to take the heavy gun, wagon cars, barrles and supporting ammunitions and technical equipment into Russia itself to be fired ina ction…VERDICTMad…but remotely usefull….Was built, there were THREE of the Super guns , however, despite some effective Military successes, the design was far to large ehavy and clumsy and vulnerable to air attacks. it required special ammunition to be kept in an electricaly refrigerated wagon car, at a specific fireing temperature only.One gun , fat Dora, was used to flatten Warsaw before the Germans retreated in 1944.The other giant gun dissappeared at the end of the war under very mysterious circumstances…Note the giant camouflage netting, large areas of specialy built railway tracks, and the Ammmunition car wagon behind the giant rail gun.OTHER CRAZY SCHEMES INCLUDED…..Himmel Stormer Rocket backpackgermany developed a rocket pack to lift individual soldiers high up into the air to cross fortified walls or other obstacles. The device existed in several formal prototypes and was tested and used on several occassions.Flying Discs or Gun PlatformsCertain German experiments went from the sublime to the ridiculous.Strange Prototype Aeroplane with circular formHorten Flying wing jet designMeschersmidt KOMET jet Fighter Rocket plane.KOMET was built and did see service attacking US Bomber formations over germany late during the war.ARADO BLITZ Secret german Jet bomber Fighter design.GIGANT ME 323 Giant transport aircraft. These were built in both powered and glider versions, and did see extensive if rather costly, service during the duration of the Second world war. 24 of the slow lumbering monsters got shot down in flames in just one hour trying to fly petrol to Erwin Rommels beseiged Afrika Korps in Tunisia. The desing was impressive with huge fuselage capacit and front opening cockpit payload doorways, but was far too slow and bdly defended to be very effective.It had front opening clam shell type doorways and could even carry lorries and semi tracks but an atempt to try to carry a panzer tank ended in total disaster when the entire aircraft crashed and was destroyed…Light Self propelled Gun tanks could however successfully be carried as shown here.Worlds first operational jet fighter the ME 262The ME 262 Jet design was a success and carried great promise, however an over enthusiastic Hitler insisted instead that it got developed instead to use as a bomber to bomb England…This crackpot decision making deprived nazi germany of its one main chance of defeating the allies in the air over germany late war. had enough of the Fighter variant of the aircraft type actually been built, and time not squandered and wasted on bombing development of the type, the air war over Gerany just might have taken a very different direction, even in 1944.Verdict Excellent futurstic Modern design, ruined by poor quality political decision making and delays.","1,281 followers",Sami Kukkonen,753,798,2.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-technologies-are-now-converging-to-allow-for-electric-VTOL-flying-cars-to-be-used-by-civilians

(Photo: Hessen Antiques)When I was a paratrooper in the German Army, we had an FG 42 displayed at the German Airborne and Airtransport school. The Bundeswehr's paratroopers were heavily influenced by the Wehrmacht Fallschirmjäger and a number of WWII veterans had served in our units while others had often come to visit us.The verdict of these old German WII vets about the FG-42 was far less positive than the comments of today's gamers. They hated it! It was originally designed to enable a paratrooper to shoot while he was still in the air with his parachute which was a colossally stupid idea, even for Nazi Germany. They tested it, and, of course, it didn’t work.In addition, at the time of its introduction, the Fallschirmjäger didn't jump anymore. Big-scale airborne operations had been a thing of the past.The FG 42 was meant to be an all-around weapon, doing the job of an infantry rifle and a machine gun at the same time. However, for an infantry rifle, it wasn't accurate enough, and although it could fire Full Auto, it only had a 20 round magazine.Troops also reported problems with its unergonomic grip and lack of sturdiness (in the earlier models), as well as with the side-mounted magazines.It was, as the Germans say, “weder Fisch noch Fleisch” (neither fish nor fowl) and a complete failure.
