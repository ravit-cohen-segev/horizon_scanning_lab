I attended a talk where the speaker had used genomics in the form of DNAseq to map the mutations within melanoma cancers on patients, looking for some set of gene mutations common to every melanoma.

Instead, within a melanoma from a single patient he found overThe problem is that a treatment that kills, say, 99.999% of the cancer cells still leaves a thousand cancer cells alive. These are the ones resistant to the treatment. Now they divide. All the daughter cells inherit the resistance.Cancer and cancer treatments are natural selection in action. During my career I have been at meetings and seen 3 jaw dropping “cures”. In each case, a wide variety of cancers — lung, brain, breast, adrenal, etc. — were “cured”. However, none of these treatments ever showed up in wide-spread clinical use. Why?Today physicians are using combination therapies. If chemotherapy, then they are using 2 or more agents, under the theory that a cancer cell won’t be resistant toThe definitive cure for cancer is surgical removal. However, even if the main tumor is surgically removed, there is the chance that some cancer cells were outside the volume removed. Many cancers, of course, are not amenable to surgery. There are more and more treatments coming online exploiting the weakness of individual cancers. The treatments based on immunotherapy show promise. However, 2 of those jaw-dropping “cures” I saw were based on immunotherapy.There will be progress, particularly now that much research is focused on individual cancers, not cancer as a whole. Treatments are being devised for a particular cancer, not cancer as a whole.But as long as natural selection is true, I am pessimistic about a wholesale “cure” of cancer.","1,121 followers",Ann Silberman,971,381,2.8M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Will-it-ever-be-possible-to-cure-chronic-disorders-such-as-cancer-and-diabetes-with-advanced-technology-in-the-future

4,"Cancer is inherently impossible to turn into a chronic condition that can be managed long-term, because its genomic instability gives it the power of natural selection: the longer it survives, the more certain it is to find new ways to outwit the shackles that are stopping it from growing.

First, there is the burgeoning field of cancer immunotherapy, which has already seen massive success in the past decade (after quite a few decades of not seeing any) and is continuing to progress rapidly. Then there is the one thing that all cancers have in common, namely telomere elongation; a way to kill cells that are elongating their telomeres is entering clinical trials right now.

What happens to one particle, affects the other in the same fashion.A pair is generated and one half (the signal) is fired down range and the second (the idler) is kept and observed. If the “signal” hits something, the “idler” will indicate this. But it gets better. The information that the “idler” can provide is more than usually received with radars currently in use. A standard radar shows the object as a “blob” with a given speed, bearing and altitude. Features of the object are not visible. With quantum radar, the individual features of the object will be noticeable, so a radar operator will be able to identify whether the object is missile, fighter, etc and what type of missile or fighter based on the shape of the object. It could tell the difference between a US F-15 and a Russian Su-35.Here is an image of a B-2 bomber and a bird.(image fromThat is not all. The object being seen by the radar will not be able to detect that it has been detected. Currently, radars send out pulses that bounce off the object and return to the radar system. That signal is detectable at much greater ranges than a measurement return signal can, so a radar can be detected long before it could detect you out of the background noise of signals it receives. This is how a “fuzz buster” radar detector works. With quantum radar, there is almost noway to detect the signal from the radar.Next, the shape of the object will have little effect on the entangled particles. In other words, stealthy features on the object will have no effect on its detection. You could have radar cross section of a golf ball and still be as a detectable as billboard.Even if you detect the signal from a quantum radar (very remote chance), you will not be able to locate the radar itself. Currently, radars are easily located if they are broadcasting. It is like they are shining a flashlight in a dark room. You can see the flashlight and know where the person is, what they are looking at and judge whether they could see you. With quantum radar, you can not track the radar signal back to its sources. This will make suppression of enemy air defense (SEAD or Wild Weasel) missions a lot more difficult to execute.So you have a radar that works against stealthy and non-stealthy object equally, cannot be detected or tracked if detected.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,12.7K,996,156M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Will-it-ever-be-possible-to-cure-chronic-disorders-such-as-cancer-and-diabetes-with-advanced-technology-in-the-future

Israeli Air force personnel fondly speak of it as ""the other IAF"".One of the best equipped air forces in the world along with professional standards, courageous and well trained pilots, the IAF is also the fourth largest air force in the world with approximately 170,000 personnel and 1,400 aircraft - another example of East and West mix - including: Mirage 2000, Sukhoi 30, Mig 29 and 27, as well as Israeli drones and Falcon Intel aircraft systems.​Indian air defense is also very tight and one of its key elements is another Israeli-Indian cooperation: The Barak 8 missile.So in a nut shell, I wouldn't go as far as saying this is common Israeli knowledge.
