You might say the Boomers got more of the extremes - they got to see concerts by Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix and The Beatles. They also got drafted to fight a war that gutless politicians refused to let them win.Growing up a part of Generation X and becoming teenagers in the 80s, we didn’t get drafted. We also didn't have the internet. We were spared both of those atrocities that the previous and subsequent generations had to deal with in their teenage years. What did we have? We liked to socialize. Image, having a sense of style, was important to us.Ric Flair was tremendously entertaining and an 80′s icon. Like I said, we prided ourselves on looking good.Of course things like competence and efficacy mattered. That was a given! If you wanted to be successful, you still had to look the part and we did alright for ourselves. I know these days some people think the 80s style is too ostentatious, but hey, at least we had a distinct, recognizable, immediately identifiable style. Can you say the same?Feathered hair was a part of guys and girls hairstyles. Thats why Stranger Things is total BS. They set the show in the 80s but not one teenager in it has feathered hair and not one girl wears designer jeans. Come on!All the girls in our school in the 80s, at least those with any sense, wore designer jeans and it was awesome. Totally awesome. There couldn't have been a more effective inspiration to get up early and go to school.That would get you up too, wouldn't it?I can't imagine how many days of school I might have missed if it hadn't been for the girls wearing designer jeans.So you see, the desire to look good and valuing looking good are not shallow; they are at least partially responsible for me earning my high school diploma and being prepared for college.Heather Locklear was one of the pop culture icons when I was a teenager.We were the last of the truly social generations. It reminds me of a scene I saw on a show a few years back where a kid tells his dad that he should probably send a text to his friend. The father replied:Hell yeah! What a great response.When we did use a phone, we used to it either make or receive a phone call. Maybe it’s just that I’m a product of my generation, but I truly believe that the human voice is more expressive than little letters of black and white ever could be.I didn't have my own phone as a teenager and didn't want one.I saw another answer with a nice comment about young people hanging out together at the mall. That’s true. When you’re not old enough to get into a nightclub, where else would you go?It would be kind of hard for that to happen now because there aren't many malls left. I guess young people these days like hanging out and socializing apart from each other. That’s what social media is:We liked going to concerts and because the internet hadn't come along and wrecked the music industry, concert ticket prices were only around $12 when I went to my first rock concert. By the time I graduated from college, they may have been up to $18 or so, but still worth every penny.Today they price concert tickets so that you have to take out a second mortgage on your home to afford them and they wonder why more teenagers don’t go to rock concerts?We also had amazing movies.I saw Raiders Of The Lost Ark at the kind of movie theater they don’t make anymore. The screen was five times the size of some of the screens today, the sound was excellent and it made going to a movie a real experience! A ticket cost about four bucks.Teenagers went out and did things in the 80s because we liked it and because it was affordable. Not that we didn't have to work to earn the money to buy records and movie tickets and other things we wanted. We worked jobs like mowing lawns, delivering newspapers and shoveling snow in the winter.Today I see adults doing those jobs and I wonder why aren't the kids undercutting them? As kids, we simply offered a better deal. We worked hard and it gave us an appreciation for the value of a dollar.So there you have it. Growing up as part of Generation X was one hell of an experience. The girls were hot, the beer was cold and the music kicked ass!","22,546 followers",Amy Christa Ernano,3.4K,5.6K,151.6M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-was-it-like-growing-up-part-of-Generation-X

Everyone I knew, including me, had stories of being accosted or mugged or worse. It was part of life.But there were similarities to today as well, at least for me. My friends and I would play video games a lot, first on Atari and later on the NES. We played role-playing games, too. And computer games.It was quite a bit different from how my own kids have it, though. There was far more face-to-face interaction and physical activity. And no one was recording all the stupid things we did. That is the top thing I feel bad for today's kids about. We all did stupid things as kids, but their stupid acts will be preserved.","358,956 followers",Sean Kernan,6.8K,5.6K,726.9M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-was-it-like-growing-up-part-of-Generation-X

We had the golden age of Saturday morning kids TV. We learned how to live without technology but then how to use it. This helps even at my age now. I have met younger generation who literally cannot do simple division in their heads.Like the Silent Generation before us, we have no identity. We were sandwiched between two far larger generations that the advertisers and politicians cared far more about. This is good and bad. On one hand we are forgotten.

But, our early lives were usually quite analog.TV reception (if you had one, of course) depended on where you lived. But, usually, you’d watch the local stations that you could pick up via antennae. In my case, my family was in a lower economic bracket, we had an old black and white TV that was probably scrounged somewhere. It had no knobs, so we turned the channels by using a pair of vice grip pliers. It had rabbit ear antennas. We got a single handful of channels, and maybe two were actually clear.My favorite TV show was MASH. Years later, I saw reruns of the shows in color, and I was sort of confused. My association with older shows was always Black and White, because that was the TV we had. Somehow, I hadn’t realized this show was in color. Cable TV started to become more common in the 80s, but not everyone had it —cost money, of course. If your family had some money, you might get a VHS or Betamax system to watch movies. They cost quite a lot when they first came out. But, the market eventually became more reasonable, and by the late 80s and into the early 90s, a majority of Americans had a VHS player (VHS beating out Beta as the preferred platform/playing system). In fact, this was a defining feature of the era — on Friday afternoon/eve the video stores were packed. If you found a copy of a New Release, you knew your weekend was gonna be lit!Music was played on records or cassette tapes, or even older 8-tracks that we inherited as hand-me-downs. Oh, yeah, and radio stations were a big deal. People would actually call in to the stations and request songs or make dedications (like a “shout-out”). Mixed tapes were made with considerable care and effort, and could even be a symbol of love or affection. If someone gave you a mixed tape with a variety of songs that you were “into” or part of your “style,” it was a big deal. It showed how much they cared for you. This could be a very good friend, or even someone that had romantic intentions. If the tape case paper was filled out neatly with all the song details (and time stamps even) it wasOf course, CDs came later, and they began to replace cassette tapes. If you had a CD player with multiple cartridges (holding multiple discs), you were basically at peak technology.As far as the cultural norms, our childhoods were probably similar to Baby Boomers again. If we were out of school or done with chores, we were largely left to our own devices. Of course, this also depends on individual family dynamics and socio-economic considerations. But, in my case, we basically could roam wherever we wanted as long as we came back home at around dusk. Child rearing was still pretty old fashioned. A lot of us got some form of physical punishment. And there was none of this helicopter parenting stuff we see today. When we fell and got minor injuries, adults would either ignore it (if they were even watching) they’d tell us, “You’re fiiiine.” Or, if it was in a sports setting, coaches might say, “Walk it off.” Oh, yeah, and adults also might laugh at minor injuries.And speaking of injury to children, that reminds me. Growing up Gen X meant that you were around a lot of second hand smoke. And again, adults didn’t give a sheeeeeit about kids’ lungs. If you went to a house party or gathering where the adults were smoking in the house, there were times it looked like a fog machine. Adults did not go outside to smoke. This goes for cars too. Although, in that case, a lot of times, they’d crack the window to draw the smoke out a bit. You’d also see people just throwing their lit cigarettes out of their vehicles. Again, they didn’t give a sheeeeit back then. You’d also go to public places where smoking was allowed. Hell, it was even on airplanes. That is probably the oddest example, as the “smoking section” on a plane is rather laughable. Once the smoking sign came on, the whole cabin was filled with smoke. Most restaurants allowed smoking too. A very common sight in restaurant entrances/lobby/foyer areas was a cigarette machine - like this:A pack would would cost around a dollar, or something in that range.Of course, we also went about our lives without phones on our person. So, if you wanted to check in with your family you had to use a phone at your friend’s house, or find a payphone if you were out/at some event. If you didn’t have money, you could call collect. You actually had to talk to an operator, and they’d dial your number. If someone picked up, the operator would say they had a collect call from…at this point, you’d say your name. The operator would then ask, “Do you accept these charges.” or something to that effect. If they answered yes, then, you’d have your call as per usual. When I was younger, all phones had cords, and they were usually mounted in the kitchen. Some people had extremely long cords so they could walk around the house a little bit, or take the call in another room. I also remember we had a shared telephone line. That meant that you’d have to hold the phone up to your ear first, to see if your neighbor was on the line already. If they were, and you started dialing, they get the loud button tones in their ear.However, we were also different than that Baby Boomer generation because we were largely raised by them (or, older relatives from the “Greatest or Silent Generations”). So, we got some of the traditionalism that was more common in earlier eras. But, we also took the brunt of Baby Boomer critiques or their self-centeredness. Meaning, Boomers grew up in one of the best economic periods in American history, and they developed certain expectations about life. They also focused a lot more on their own needs and happiness, and weren’t a child-focused as parents are today. So, they tended to grow up with more two-parent homes, and yet they basically blew up the divorce rate stats.So, a lot of Gen Xers are “children of divorce.” And a lot of us were latchkey kids. This has a profound effect on our generation.Also, as we got older and joined the workforce, we faced the crazy housing market and the Great Recession. We also saw the insane increases in the cost of college, and simultaneous to that a college degree became a sort of mandatory thing. Well, if you want a “good job.” In earlier eras, one might be able to secure a living wage job without one. And it probably paid health bennies too!So, this is an area were Gen Xers clashed with their Baby Boomer parents. The “slacker” label was often unwarranted, because we were simply facing a new - tougher - economic reality. In that regard, we share some similarities with Millenials, as we are still facing the same economic situation.In any event, I could go on and on about aspects of growing up in this generation. But, I’d summarize it as being “pretty good” and then shrug my shoulders. That’s about as Gen X as it gets!","246,857 followers",Dushka Zapata,897,8.5K,232.5M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-was-it-like-growing-up-part-of-Generation-X

Art analyzerIt takes a large amount of demographic data through out the world regarding the likes and dislikes people have, and when you upload your work, it analyzes and gives you charts on the percentage of people who would love your work, and those who wouldn’t. It also provides the geographical data of the populations who would love your work, so now you know can publish your work in that area and there is a good chance that it would be well received.Many great writers get several rejections by publishers, due to very different reasons that are not always clear. This machine will easily solve the problems and make the life of artists much easier.On that note, similar machines would be- a beauty analyzer, which does the same thing, this time regarding your looks. Now no need to worry whether you look attractive or not.7. Mental activity recording devices, which include devices like-Thought recorder simply records your thoughts. Sometimes what happens is I get an insane idea,, but I get distracted by something and that idea is lost forever. Would be very handy for me.Likewise, remembering your dream is no easy task. Dream recorder records your dream from start to finish so that you can analyze them later after you wake up.8. Thought manipulatorsEarlier I talked about virtual reality extreme.

Set aside for a moment the likelihood that these designations may only refer to spacefaring races, these species may then be assigned a species number without the Borg ever having met a member of that species.Perhaps the Borg never met Ferengi or Vulcans but assimilated information on them from a third species who originated in or passed through the alpha quadrant long before Borg met humans, and had catalogued Alpha Quadrant species in its computer?","4,230 followers",Joseph Reinemann,1.5K,14.9K,37.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-was-it-like-growing-up-part-of-Generation-X

The road surface in their vicinity fails and needs frequent patching. Its not unknown for the vibrations caused by HGVs or fire engines passing over them to cause subsidence in nearby properties. The local taxpayers whose money was squandered installing the things, then gets to pay compensation to the property owner, plus two sets of lawyers’ fees, and the cost of removing the offending item, and the cost of repairing the subsided road where it used to be a few years later.For some motorists with bad backs, they are positively dangerous. Each unnecessary thump-thump further damages a slipped disk, or causes excruciating pain. So these unfortunates slow down to a fraction of walking pace and hold everybody else up.Why not speed-sensitive traffic lights and cameras? Refuse to slow down, get photographed driving through a red light, get fined and/or banned.
