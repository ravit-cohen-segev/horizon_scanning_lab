He will give it a transaction number, and also note down the name of the two parties involved.Understand the fact that whenever you transfer money, the bank is the third party which gets involved to note down the credentials of the transaction.What if there was no bank required to make a transaction?So, when Batman transfers money to Hulk through Bitcoins, all the information related to it is handled by a blockchain.A block chain is a digital ledger in which transactions made in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are recorded chronologically and publicly.It is a continuously growing list of records, which has the time stamps and transaction data.Now, to maintain the block chain, or the list of records you need a network.

3,"Basically, we've decided to do everything in Javascript.That means NodeJS on the backend servers, but also MongoDB because of the JSON docs and mongo shell.
