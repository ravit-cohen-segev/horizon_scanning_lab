Money is really just a lubricant for exchange, keeping track of the rough value of things as judged by individuals from day to day and taking everyone’s decisions into account. Without money, how do you buy or sell things? How do you get paid for work? Do you just do things out of the goodness of your heart? How do you keep track of who owes who what? Or do people never owe each-other things? What incentives will there be to work hard or for businesses to adjust to supply and demand or to even exist at all?Underlying these ideas of getting rid of money seems to be the idea that money itself causes greed (...","1,043 followers",Priti Kairam,784,85,691.1K,2018,https://www.quora.com/You-have-revolutionary-technologies-that-will-surely-make-you-a-trillionaire-Which-country-will-you-choose-for-your-corporation-need-to-consider-political-stability-monetary-policy
5,"Definitely. In the future we won’t be using paper or plastic money, everything will be done online. Now is the time to prepare, and there are many good currencies that one can take a look at today.Cryptocurrency is better than FIAT in several ways:-Speed: Cryptocurrencies offer much faster speeds than, say, a wire transfer. These days, many cryptocurrencies offer instant or near instant transactions, which are far superior to 24–48 hours it can usually take with fiat. I have seen other posters mention that faster isn’t necessarily better, if you sent to the wrong address. New cryptocurrencies,Definitely.

I have seen other posters mention that faster isn’t necessarily better, if you sent to the wrong address. New cryptocurrencies, such as Divi, allow users to associate each wallet’s public key with a unique name of their choice, which can be used by others to send funds or connect with them, instead of the long strings of random characters that are a wallet’s “public key” and are considered a big barrier of entry to the world of cryptocurrencies today. There will also be pin-code confirmation features, and other features to make it more secure and friendly.-No middleman and completely trustless and decentralized. You don’t need to trust the bank to execute it correctly or at all(many errors do happen), it is entirely peer to peer.-Can be used everywhere, by anyone, anytime…even if you don’t have a bank account or are sending to someone who doesn’t have a bank account.-More secure, especially due to the decentralized/trustless factor. Digital ledger technology is virtually impregnable by attackers. The system is so complex that the attacker has to perform multiple attacks on multiple devices at once.-Much lower fees than fiat. Nearly free, basically.Really those are just a few of the main reasons, but overall cryptocurrencies are far superior in speed, cost and security than any fiat currency.What else sets DIVI apart? Divi has a stated goal of mass adoption and the founders claim they want to make cryptocurrency as easy to use as paypal. Divi was created in order to address a number of the perceived barriers to mass adoption by the general public; Among those are speed, scalability and ease of use. Among the advisors of the team are Former CSO of Yahoo! Tim Sanders, and technologist Ramez Naam.Divi utilizes a proof of stake protocol. The proof-of-stake system was designed to address vulnerabilities that could occur in a pure proof-of-work system. It was also developed to address the high energy consumption of bitcoin. The network is maintained and secured by masternodes. The masternode software is really just a different version of mining, with far less power consumption. it only requires the energy to run the client software on a computer, as opposed to running resource-intensive cryptographic hashing functions. The masternode communicates with other nodes in the network and keeps a copy of the blockchain, constantly checking and updating it. In return, masternode owners get rewarded with newly minted coins.DIVI has many innovations, among them:The first cryptocurrency using a 5 tiered masternode system. By doing so it claims to create a more decentralized system, since the entry cost is lowered and the lower tier masternodes are more affordable.Divi advertises itself as the first cryptocurrency to implement the lottery blocks reward system. With this system, every week 11 winners will be randomly selected to be rewarded with extra coins.-Each wallet can have various “Pockets”. For example, a user may have a public wallet that shows very little, or no cash inside, and then “dark send” it to an anonymous pocket. DIVI will also have an Oraclet feature.-Scheduled payments - send money later, or on a specific date-“One Click” Masternode Setup: Divi developed easier to use masternodes that don't require experts to install-Divi claims to be the world’s first democratic blockchain. Because of the easy one-click masternode install, anyone can participate.","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,631,1.5K,2.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/You-have-revolutionary-technologies-that-will-surely-make-you-a-trillionaire-Which-country-will-you-choose-for-your-corporation-need-to-consider-political-stability-monetary-policy
6,"X-rays and radioactivity form a pair of accidental discoveries. Finding one led to finding the other.A German physicist named W. C. Roentgen was using a cathode ray tube in 1895. This device was a glass bulb with positive and negative electrodes, and from which all air had been removed. When he passed a high voltage electrical current through the electrodes, the tube glowed. At this point, he tried something new. He then covered the tube with heavy black paper and noticed that a screen, a few feet away, started glowing green. Shutting off the electricity stopped the glow. He realized that someX-rays and radioactivity form a pair of accidental discoveries. Finding one led to finding the other.A German physicist named W. C. Roentgen was using a cathode ray tube in 1895. This device was a glass bulb with positive and negative electrodes, and from which all air had been removed. When he passed a high voltage electrical current through the electrodes, the tube glowed. At this point, he tried something new. He then covered the tube with heavy black paper and noticed that a screen, a few feet away, started glowing green. Shutting off the electricity stopped the glow. He realized that something unknown was travelling from his cathode ray tube to the screen and caused it to glow. He called that something X-rays, the name we still use. Additional tests showed that X-rays caused many fluorescent substances to glow and photographic plates to become exposed. Roentgen was the first to use X-rays to photograph the bones in a human hand, that of his own wife.The following year French scientist named Henri Becquerel was studying fluorescent minerals in 1895 in an attempt to better understand X-rays. Becquerel experimented with several substances including potassium uranyl sulfate (uranium). He exposed various substances to sunlight and then placed them on photographic plates wrapped in black paper, believing that the uranium absorbed the sun’s energy and then emitted it as x-rays. When he tried the experiment with uranium, he wasn’t able to complete the experiment because it was overcast that day. For no good reason, Becquerel decided to develop his photographic plates anyway. To his surprise, the images were strong and clear, proving that the uranium emitted radiation without an external source of energy such as the sun. Becquerel realized that the uranium emitted something which caused the photographic plates to become exposed.Here is a picture of Becquerel’s plate with his notes. The dark spots were caused by the uranium.The discovery of X-rays and radiation had huge effects on basic science, medicine, and even warfare. It’s hard to think of any discoveries that were more revolutionary.Neither scientist got as much out of their discoveries as they should have.Roentgen was an altruist. He awarded his Nobel Prize money to his university. He never took out any patents on his invention, to ensure that everyone could freely benefit from it. Those decisions were costly. When he died in 1923, Roentgen was nearly bankrupt from the inflation following World War I.Henri Becquerel got the Nobel prize in 1903. But he shared it with the Curies, who got most of the fame and attention. He died just 5 years after getting the prize.","2,115 followers",Pavithran Subbiah,698,110,3.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/You-have-revolutionary-technologies-that-will-surely-make-you-a-trillionaire-Which-country-will-you-choose-for-your-corporation-need-to-consider-political-stability-monetary-policy

This happy accident happened in Yonkers, New York.Today, Bakelite is a National Historic Chemical Landmark in recognition of its status as the world’s first synthetic plastic. Bakelite played significant role in reducing the cost of production of almost everything. The result was cost effective production of both consumer products and war materials. In fact, Bakelite was extensively used in all major production processes during WWI and WWII. Bakelite was even used in developing heat shields of Soviet era ICBMs and spacecraft.",269 followers,Karthik Reddy L,16K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/You-have-revolutionary-technologies-that-will-surely-make-you-a-trillionaire-Which-country-will-you-choose-for-your-corporation-need-to-consider-political-stability-monetary-policy
