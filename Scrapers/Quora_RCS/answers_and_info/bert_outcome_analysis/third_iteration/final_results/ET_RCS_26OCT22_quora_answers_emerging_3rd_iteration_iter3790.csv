It is often the unseen tools to make these artefacts that are more impressive than the artefact themselves, a calliper is hugely important for standardisation, engineering and geometry. A seal of this precision would not be seen again until some time after the age of enlightenment. Its detail is comparable with early banknote plates (around the C18th CE). The section below is approximately 10mm in view size.No, these optical lenses…Similar dating, Mount Ida, Crete, ca 1400 BCE, however, this may be when the lenses were stored in the Caves of Minos. Made from precision ground rock-crystal (natural glass), see what I mean, with a dividing compass (callipers) one can create an arc to create a lens and critically measure the arc to improve; in this case: optics.Hang on a minute, maybe these white-hulled ships…Santorini (Thera) before the eruption of 1628 BCE. The reconstruction team thought they used flax linen cloth in pine resin (a natural thermoplastic) with limestone powder to make the hull white (a composite matrix) over a wooden frame. The reinforcement is shown inside and out, if the hull is compromised on rocks, it will delaminate, keeping the hull watertight to make landfall and repair, saving the crew, ship and cargo. Glass fibre composites were invented in 1950’s COMMON ERA. Flax is almost as strong in tension.No this…Later bronze casting currently in the Met Museum, NY, ca 700 BCE from originally Samos, Greece. It's the closest thing I’ve seen to what Daedalus’ glider may have been. An airframe! If the fabled account of Icarus is correct: the remains of his glider were found at IcariaWe have little idea of what technology the Minoan’s really had, most of it has decayed and is lost to time. The Athenians kept the white hull ship Theseus returned in, it was on display for centuries as a trophy of Athens increasing power. According to myth, Theseus tried to secure magnetite and got thrown off a cliff on Skyros, a source of Magnetite! Athens didn’t know how to make another white-hull, they fell out of use, it is sufficiently advanced that they were unable to reproduce it.A communication network across the Aegean? Well, they had one according to Homer, the fall of Troy was reported to Argos in a few hours using island fire beacons (Peak Sanctuaries which have line-of-sight between them and are present throughout the entire Aegean), e.g. a message relayed at a few hundred miles per hour using long-distance signals, fires at night, gravity cast flat mirrors called Labyrs (double-axe) in the day.Peak sanctuary above.

It was the Wheelwright.Making a wheel from wood with an axle that attaches to a cart and doesn’t fall apart within a mile or two is one of the most “advanced technologies” of all time. Without it, most civilizations would have failed or failed to spread. Cart wheels are complex and the forces must play against each other continuously to hold the wheel together as it rolls. A Cartwright made as much then as a jet airline pilot back does today. In the 1880s when the average wage was $1.50 a day, the Wheelwright was making 90 dollars a week. On the Mayflower they brought one single cart over to America and it was the most valuable thing on the ship manifest, worth more than 10 times the next most valuable thing on the ship.

Things like leaded gasoline, the massive use of fossil fuels, and our toying with atomic energy has left all kinds of easily detectable chemical traces all over the planet. We routinely cut through hills to build roadways. We tear down entire mountains to mine for coal and minerals. We alter the courses of rivers and use dams to make new lakes. And we produce massive garbage dumps full of the broken and discarded products of our technological society with plastics, weird alloys from discarded electronics, and all kinds of other chemicals not found in nature. The changes we make to the environment are profound.So, then, how is all of that going away without a trace? It’s not. It can’t.

What the Egyptians were good at wasThere is NO evidence that the Ancient Egyptian had a battery and this is as close as they got to an aircraft.Peak Egypt is its early periods, engineering went unfortunately downhill thereafter. What the Egyptians were good at wasFor fun, if you want an ancient civilisation which is comparable to this time, then I would look at the Minoans, no papyrus treatise survive. According to myth, they did have an aircraft, optics (see below) and likely a Newtonian understanding of the solar system and Nature (physics). They arguable had a few things that were better than the time of the enlightenment, consider the wedge crescent shown, it will reproduce a natural rainbow! What the Minoans were doing with this is not known, they were interested in colour and this would allow them to define these, they also had an interest in establishing the purity of metals, I’ll leave that up to your imagination. The only Minoan word which survives till modern times is Purple, they invented the processing of murex to make dye.Ancient people only had a basic understanding of electricity as far as we can tell, electric eels and static electricity. The Minoans at least had lodestones (magnetic compasses), there is a possibility they understood that placing magnetite at peaks may induce lightning to strike to make the iron magnetic. Although this is speculative, the myths of Zeus seem to imply this, who was raised by the Dactyls that discovered the lodestone and guarded the caves where precious things were stored and where the above lenses were found. Land-based compass, Minoan buildings being aligned to magnetic north from around 1800 BCE.The Minoans are the only civilisation that I have seen which might have brought about the Industrial revolution sooner (others used slaves for work, not machines), the Minoans never got there, but almost did, a series of calamities (Thera eruption - 1628 BCE, likely a civil war with the Carians and invasion from Mycenae around 1450 BCE) and bronze age collapse finally sealed their fate around 1250 BCE. Their peak is just before Thera and the rate of technical innovation is high, there on the right trajectory to industrialize and are using batch production to make many copies of products for export and have may specialists.According to the oldest accounts, they produce a palace that had doors that opened by fire (steam) and automatons (statues that moved by themselves, those of Daedelus are mercury driven which implies this very dense liquid was used to sequence operations and gravity-powered), they are in the right space, they are fascinated by machines and improving efficiency. Their best engineering tolerances are around 20 micrometres (0.02mm) for tool placement, confirm by this 1mm2 section of a seal from theThe later Greeks likely did get some of their knowledge from this early civilisation and critically set up schools. I disagree with Marks comments. The Minoans could well have had boilers, this is an artefact from Samos, Minoan palaces and did have hot and cold running water to upper floors, their hydro-engineering is considered to be comparable with 18th century Europe!Some Bronze age civilisations did have the materials to build an aircraft! Wicker is a superb light-weight material to build complex structures, it was used to make composite shields, the Minoans produced the finest linen, it has another name aero linen, the first aircraft used it. The team that built this reproduction half-scale white hulled ship, skinned the wooden hull using linen in a pine resin matrix impregnated with limestone powder, the fresco on which it is based, shows this was done internally too (which would likely deliminate if the hulls is caught on an outcrop of rocks, saving the hull, ship and crew allowing them to stay watertight until landfall to make repair). Flax linen is as almost as strong in tension as fibreglass that wasn’t invented until 1950 BCE.This is a curious artefact from the islands, ca. 800 BCE. I have produced a hand launch model using wicker and linen. The only modification I made was to move to a top elliptical wing and used a fantail as shown (linen between splayed legs of a mannequin). This is the most simple aircraft (a weight shift hand glider), it not only flies, it has a better sink rate than a delta framed hang glider!If Icarus and Daedalus studied Griffons (on Crete), produced hand-launched models first and started on the side of hill, then they stand a good chance of pulling it off, a 50% chance to be more precise. Note the wing is fixed after launch!!!The massive intellectual disintegration was bronze age collapse around 1250 BCE. See the trajectory before this. The Greeks recovered, then the Roman came along and that was that. We had to wait for another island to see the light and things really took off, an industrial revolution with incredible efficiency that brought about the modern-day world!

Fantasy aside, there’s simply no way egypt could have had modern day technology, or even 1900s technology, and us not know.","29,926 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,758,7.7K,249.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-we-accept-the-fact-that-ancient-Hindu-legends-could-have-possibly-been-using-advanced-technology-and-not-conceived-as-mythological-mystical

In no particular order:And, of course, all of the so-called evidence in use here are scattered exceptional or unusual items which even at their most wishful extreme suggest the possibility that greater things could have existed but are not themselves those things. Moreover, airplanes, electricity, and other bits of sophisticated technology don’t exist on their own. They require large, complicated infrastructures, which we would expect to leave behind far more archaeological evidence. If there were, say, ancient Egyptian airplanes, there should be plentiful evidence of ancient Egyptian airports, ancient Egyptian refineries producing aviation fuel, and so on. If there were ancient electricity, we’d find evidence of ancient Egyptian power plants and power distribution networks (and no, the pyramids could not have been nuclear power plants). But we don’t find those. The technologies we find direct evidence of are far less sophisticated, and there’s no reason why we should find plenty of hand-made low tech items and",219 followers,Krishnan Raghavan,1.1K,131,630.7K,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-we-accept-the-fact-that-ancient-Hindu-legends-could-have-possibly-been-using-advanced-technology-and-not-conceived-as-mythological-mystical

The Romans actually built toy steam engines that could spin a little propeller gadget, but it never occurred to them to scale them up, nor to use them for practical purposes. TheyOne caveat? Hot air balloons? At the bare edge of possibility. Some people have theorized that the Ancient Inca of Peru might, possibly have been able to build them.
