3,"Old school thermal sight, yes this will work. FILR or modern thermal imaging, no. You will stand out like a sore thumb ( or like a dude hiding under an emergency blanket). Thermal imaging detects the emissions in the viewed area. If it is 98 F and the temperature has normalized at that temperature, then you shouldn't be able to see anything but blobs. But if you have ever used modern thermal imaging equipment at night you have seen leaves, stones sticks, grass. You might look like a rock, but you will be weirdly colored and outlined because the real rock next to you will be radiating infraredOld school thermal sight, yes this will work.

But if you have ever used modern thermal imaging equipment at night you have seen leaves, stones sticks, grass. You might look like a rock, but you will be weirdly colored and outlined because the real rock next to you will be radiating infrared energy.There are actually other factors to the emission from something-the object’s temperature and their  coefficient of emissivity. ""Color, texture, surface material and more cause variations in the emissivity for something.""This is due to emissions and reflections of heat. Everything reflects or emits heat differently and to different levels. If you want to hide from modern thermal imaging, you need emissive cammo patterns. These have small holes and paint that break up your pattern. Some is hidden, some lets a little heat escape and some lets out more. Some colors reflect ambient heat, some absorbs it.""Recently, however, various improvements have been made in night vision detection detection equipment allowing the goggles to operate at longer wavelengths. At longer wavelengths, such as wavelengths greater than 900 nm, many camouflage garments begin to lose their camouflage properties. In particular, at longer wavelengths, the colors contained in the camouflage pattern exhibit the same reflectance characteristics. Thus, when a camouflaged garment is viewed through night vision goggles that operate at longer wavelengths, the colors of the camouflage pattern begin to reflect ambient light back at similar intensities thereby presenting an object as a single intensity silhouette and making the garment wearer easily detectable.""

And remember, the military buys from the lowest bidder and hangs on to that stuff way too long (except for certain operators who always get the good shit).",0 followers,Fred Gibbs,1.8K,5.1K,7.1M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Outside-of-blockchain-cryptocurrencies-what-are-some-other-emerging-technologies-for-implementing-digital-currencies
4,"You can not hide from a thermal imager. You can attempt to camouflage your heat signature but you can't hide it. Your body temp will always show different from ambient temperature. Even at night time during the winter trees and rocks will show as being hotter due the process of thermal absorption where the light of the sun is absorbed, whereby trees rocks and other porous items absorb heat from sunlight. The only time a person could possibly have the chance to appear invisible to a thermal imager is a phenomenon called “IR Crossover” by which the ambient temperature is the exact temperature ofYou can not hide from a thermal imager.

However, that instance would take so many bags of leprechaun farts, unicorn burps and the planets to be aligned in the shape of Zues’ butthole, it is Hohhot improbable to happen. Depending on the ambient temperature, your body will either show hotter or colder than your surroundings.You can even use a thermal camera to find hidden graves or where other things are buried because once the dirt is dug up and replaced it become more oxygenated than the surrounding earth","358,958 followers",Sean Kernan,11.4K,5.6K,726.9M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-emerging-technologies-in-BioMEMS
5,"The US is the most technologically advanced nation there ever was, so obviously not! I had the privilege of living there for 4 years in the 90s. It was a little like a sci-fi movie when someone gets transported to the future - I would just wander about gazing at the technological marvels that surrounded me. Just to pick out some of the highlights:1) Domestic life - I was once visiting a friend’s house and their mother happened to be loading clothes into the washing machine.

I had the privilege of living there for 4 years in the 90s. It was a little like a sci-fi movie when someone gets transported to the future - I would just wander about gazing at the technological marvels that surrounded me. Just to pick out some of the highlights:1) Domestic life - I was once visiting a friend’s house and their mother happened to be loading clothes into the washing machine. She turned to me and said, “Do you have washing machines in Scotland?” Obviously, I was forced to admit, that no we didn’t. Instead we just went down to the river and bashed our clothes off rocks to clean them.2) Transport - I spent two weeks in the lovely town of Columbia. Missouri. There I amazed the locals with my insistence on using a strange outmoded form of transport known as “walking”. Locals would slow down as they passed in their modern cars, pointing and laughing. To them, it must have been like watching a live action version of the Flintstones.3) Voting – would you believe it, but in the UK we still vote by drawing a little X next to the candidate we want to vote for. No sign of the advanced electronic voting they have over in the states. Indeed, we are so old fashioned that we haven’t even outsourced our voting to the Russians yet!4) Guns – It may be hard for an American to believe but almost nobody in the UK owns their own guns. This means that if we have to rise up and overthrow our own government (currently seems like a good plan) then we will be armed with nothing more than some particularly well sharpened sarcasm.Still, perhaps one day we can hope to be as advanced as the US. And there is some hope, as we now have our very own version of Donald Trump as PM!4K",1 follower,Gordon Strathdee,4K,783,12.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Outside-of-blockchain-cryptocurrencies-what-are-some-other-emerging-technologies-for-implementing-digital-currencies
