Exercise Ciliary MusclesWhen your eyes are tired, look away (at least 5 meters away) for a few seconds, then quickly look at the tip of your nose for a few more seconds.

Older people may not need to sleep as much (I am an exception to this). But obviously there are a few things that can enhance almost anyone’s —except extreme outliers—experiences:Go out and be in the sun in the morning and middle of the day. This sets your circadian rhythms properly and leads to a natural cycle of rest later on.Don’t nap in the daytime. I am congenitally incapable of doing this but I know some people do. I don't get it. How can you be properly tired at night if you sleep in the day?Exercise and get tired. ((duh :))Don’t eat or drink anything but a bit of water for at least two hours before going to bed. For drinks, particularly avoid sweet drinks or alcohol in this timeframe. How can you sleep well if your stomach is fighting a lot of food to digest or having the chemical swings of sugar or alcohol?Bed is for sex and sleep. No books, no tv in bedroom/sight, and especially no iPhone. People really mess themselves up with the screen lights waking up their brains. This is where people need to discipline themselves. Most people just don’t want to give up these habits . . . :(Never go to bed angry. Sometimes things may be irresolvable before bedtime but it is enough to speak and say “let’s talk about this more tomorrow. We can’t resolve it now. Sleeping on it will help us calm down and get it solved. “Go to bed at a fairly regular time each night, workday or weekend. Exceptions are fine but be generally regular. This really helps.Start turning things down—-lights, stimulating conversations, provocative media—for an hour or so before going to bed.Are you a night bath person or morning shower person? I am a morning shower person. But, I will sometimes take a relaxing warming bath before bedtime. Not a big deal but just a few minutes to warm my body in the winter. (Yes, this may be influenced by living in Japan. It is not only the norm here but all homes have deep bathtubs for this very purpose.)Room should be cool for relaxing sleep. I don’t wear restrictive or many clothes to bed but have appropriate covers. I tend to like a heavier cover but some do better with lofty light duvets.Bed should be somewhat firm. Too soft a bed will make you tired and not sleep well. We sleep on a big futon flat on the floor (tatami-rice matting) so maybe harder than most . . .Most Important Point (and this is where I think most people fail): develop a strategy for gradually turning off your brain. I do this by saying goodnight lovingly to the whole family, turning off the light, mentally committing to this moment of Going to Sleep, turning over on my side, tucking the covers around me. a couple of deep breaths (sighs), and then I start mentally knitting.Yes, knitting. It is Second Nature to me and the most relaxing and meditative thing I know. Within a few stitches I am deeply asleep. What is your “knitting” . . . that thing that soothes you, that is your balm and therapy? That is the thing you should think about in order to sleep.I hope that these tips help people to take common-sense steps to improve their sleep. I know that some people have trouble “turning off” their brains or may be genetically hard-wired to insomnia. I still think some of these tips may help a bit . . . :)","35,872 followers",Rafael Eliassen,4.5K,631,36.1M,2016,https://www.quora.com/How-long-could-millennials-live-with-healthy-habits-and-upcoming-life-extension-technology

Data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that many diseases are caused by insufficient water intake. Develop a good habit of drinking water, and take inappropriate juices, various soups, and increase the intake of water.2. The eating habits of the inverted pyramid. Your diet must be like a pyramid: based on ample breakfast, followed by a good lunch, and dinner is absolutely rare, like the spire of the pyramid. Remember not to go to bed immediately after a big meal. Make sure to eat more nuts and dried fruits, eat fewer fries and fried snacks. These dietary rules must be followed every day to stay healthy.3. Eliminate stress. Laughter is the pressure of the nemesis. Stop worrying about small things and make your life easier. Don't let yourself carry the unnecessary workload, how much you can do. This way you can choose the things that are most important to you and achieve your longevity.4. Help others. You can help poor people, share food with hungry people, and lend a helping hand to people in need. When you see others happy, you will be happier. This can give you a sense of self-satisfaction.5. Optimistic. Optimistic people are more likely to have long-lived beliefs. In a survey of centenarians in the United States, all the elderly were confident that they had lived a hundred years old. This belief has enabled them to maintain good health habits and a spirit of enthusiasm in the face of life difficulties.6. Life only takes what you need, don't lose yourself. Keeping simple, basic needs is good for your health. Choose to drink boiled water instead of carbonated drinks, choose to walk instead of driving, choose to cook instead of going to the restaurant. The basic needs of life not only meet your needs but also make your body not inert with greed and comfort. In this rhythm of life, you will become more and more diligent, instead of becoming the ""sofa family"" watching TV every day.7. Love your family. A study at the University of Wisconsin in the United States showed that people who love family members have a very average mental health index and are more likely to achieve the goal of living a hundred years old. This is because loving a family can give you a sense of responsibility for your health. At the same time, spending more time with your family and less time can eliminate negative thoughts and nervousness.8. Refuse to take addictive foods and drugs. Spirits, cigarettes, sleeping pills, etc. will keep you away from longevity. Smoking will halve life, and strong liquor will make the memory worse and worse. Relying on sleeping pills can make you lose your ability to fall asleep. Put a sticky note anywhere you can see, remind yourself to quit bad habits, take medicine according to your doctor's advice, go outdoors, and effectively help you to get rid of the addiction.9. Meet new people on the road. Traveling to various places can meet many new friends, look at the beauty, understand the history of the new place, and gain new life values. Meeting new people can make your mind clear, change your way of thinking, and bring new hope to your life.10. Practice yoga and meditation. Yoga relaxes every muscle in the body and removes all toxins from the body by sweating through continuous movement. Meditation can keep your brain calm and clear all distractions to keep your brain healthy.","41,552 followers",Rakshith Akira,4.6K,467,18.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-long-could-millennials-live-with-healthy-habits-and-upcoming-life-extension-technology

Also, on the other side, new technologies in solar bring a promise of better generation, more flexibility and innovation coupled with seamless adaptability across various topographies and landscapes.Let us discuss some major solar technologies which have been introduced or are already in the pipeline.Floating solar:Floating solar power plants, or floatovoltaics are solar power plants which are installed on water bodies like reservoirs, dams or lakes. Such installations are more economical by way of capital cost saving as the need for costly land and real estate is substituted when the plant is installed on water.Ground and roof-top installations require more fabrication for mounting the panels compared to installation of a floating plant. This results in savings in cost, manpower and resources.Solar panels lose generation efficiency in high temperatures. Floatovoltaics, due to their proximity to water, have cooler surroundings, hence giving better generation and faster payback time.As a floatovoltaics plant covers the water surface, blocking sunlight, it stops the photosynthesis process, stopping the growth of algae resulting in the water staying clean. This coverage also helps in reducing the evaporation of water which helps in saving this valuable resource.BIPV & BAPV:Building Integrated Photovoltaics serve in a dual-purpose manner, as an outer layer of the façade of buildings and as a source of electricity generation. As they can be integrated during the initial construction of a building, they save on construction costs by replacing certain standard materials. Besides helping in generating electricity, BIPVs do not disturb the aesthetics of a building but merge seamlessly into the design elements.Building-Added Photovoltaics are added during a retrofit. Both BIPV and BAPV do not require the racks and mounting equipment of traditional solar PV systems, ultimately saving on costs.Solar Skin:A very dynamic innovative design by MIT engineers, Solar Skin uses selective light filtering to simultaneously display a vibrant image and transmit sunlight to the underlying solar panel with minimal loss of efficiency. Due to this revolutionary feature, it can blend across variety of surfaces and preserve the aesthetics of the surroundings along with efficient functioning.Solar Fabric:Imagine every fabric of the clothing you wear being able to harness the power of the sun. Such fabric has the potential to keep your winter jacket warm, power your phone while in the pocket, even light up lamps from the awnings and generate electricity from window curtains eliminating the cost of setting up solar structures and mountings. Once this technology is developed and feasible the possibilities of its applications are endless.Solar Powered Roads:Solar powered roads are a reality now. They are being designed and built not only for their ability to generate clean energy but they would also power LED street lights during the night and in cold countries they can be designed to have thermal heating capacity to melt snow.Beginning from ground mounted and roof mounted systems, today solar has come a long way. Solar is now more efficient, more flexible and more customization with better applicability across various surfaces. Solar is here to stay and the future is nothing but bright.","78,375 followers",Piyush Goyal,1.1K,70,4.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-most-promising-upcoming-developments-in-communication-technology
