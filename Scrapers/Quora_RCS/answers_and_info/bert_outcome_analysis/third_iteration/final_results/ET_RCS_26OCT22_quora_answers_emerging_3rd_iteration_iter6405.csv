The ecosystem is in a constant state of flux requiring organizations to dynamically respond to changing attack vectors and methodologies, says Sajan Paul, Director of Systems Engineering, India & SAARC at Juniper Networks. This shift is evident from the attack profile over the past year, he says.""India has dealt with this challenge by incrementally adding technology layers on its existing infrastructure over the years to deal with each new challenge,"" Paul says. ""There is now a discernible need for awareness and insight into these environments today.""Most security technology floated in the past decade has found its way into Indian organizations. But today, a strictly product-based approach without insight into the environment and your organization's unique risks won't help in protecting against advanced threats, he says. ""You also can't wait for standardization here because standards take a long time to evolve,"" Paul adds. ""Focusing on standards would mean you'd still be solving problems that occurred in the past.""In this exclusive interview with Information Security Media Group, Sajan Paul chronicles the growth of the technology market for security in India and the various stages it went through, contextualizing it with the current technology landscape for security and its challenges. He also shares insight on:Recommendations for drawing actionable intelligence from existing security;Preparing for predictive analytics and big data in security;Challenges being faced by practitioners today.Paul is the Director fo...",366 followers,Brett Alder,1.1K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-did-security-technology-evolve

If you are moving particles through spacetime and gravity, then the speed of light, Ohm’s law, beam theory, and hydrostatics matter. But when you get into quantum physics and multiple dimensionalities, it all changes.Just remember that a hundred years ago, the idea of putting men into space was considered ridiculous and proponents of it were ridiculed.

In fact, it is necessary for them if they are to cross vast distances that would truly be impossible using Newtonian rocketry and Newtonian thinking.

2,"The answer is yes.Technology, like life itself, has evolved in unpredictable ways over time, from the discovery of electricity to the exploration of space. Our cell phones, for example, might never have happened in another world, or developed in many other ways and directions.Unfortunately, the reality is this is all imagination - and fun imagination at that - but we will never know for sure nor will they ever know about us.

3,Yes.Consider a waterworld where octopuses finally become the dominant intelligent species. Consider a species where dinosaurians evolve to be intelligent or avian creatures.

4,"Probably not. All technologies have to be rooted in engineering, and engineering is rooted in mathematics & physics. Mathematics & physics are the same everywhere, so all engineering develops from an identical foundation. This involves such fundamental disciplines as Ohm’s law, beam theory & hydrostatics.It is perfectly possible that advanced alien technologies may develop along paths that will never be developed here, but they will still have to comply with Ohm’s law, beam theory & hydrostatics.A technology completely divorced from physics & mathematics could only be described as magic.",3 followers,Mark Bradford,12.8K,579,2.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-extraterrestrial-civilizations-in-the-universe-are-based-on-technologies-that-are-completely-different-from-those-used-on-Earth
5,"It all depends on how much fuel you have and how much velocity you can get from it at the most efficient burn rate.If you accelerate at 2 Gs (19.6 m/s²) for 5 minutes, you will reach a velocity of 5,880 m/s.However, if by accelerating at 0.5 G (4.9m/s²) you can extend that burn for 60 minutes you will reach a velocity of 17,640 m/s which is 3 times the velocity.If we can develop an ion drive that will produce a 0.1 G acceleration for 6 months we could reach 15,241 km/s.

At that acceleration a small probe that burned for 6 months on either end would only reach a velocity of 1,430.78 m/s.Basically, modern tech doesn’t have the ability to give us interplanetary flight in short times.Here’s the calculator I used for the velocities.",136 followers,Matt Whiting,854,691,706.7K,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-did-security-technology-evolve

It was briefly clocked at around 165,000 mph (266,000 km/h).I think we've read some of the same things. Unfortunately 200,000 mph really doesn't do us any favors, so to speak. If we use that as our metric, and we wanted to reach out closest star (besides our own Sun!) It would only take us about 75,000 years to get there! I’m a somewhat patient man, but that’s really pushing it!Edit: I’m seeing a lot of people talking about various ideas of accelerating to near the speed of light, while simultaneously ignoring Relativity. The faster you go, the more force/fuel you’re going to need, as you get closer to the speed of light, you’re also getting closer to your mass becoming infinite!There are no types of “engines” that are going to get this done until we can figure out how to alter space-time to meet our specific needs. Electromagnetism, Worm-Holes, some type of “Gravity Drive”. We’ll need to learn how to “surf” various forces that are already there. Accelerating to near the speed of light will remain unlikely. “Hopping on” something already going that fast is another story altogether.","57,719 followers",Jack Fraser-Govil,787,2.6K,42.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-extraterrestrial-civilizations-in-the-universe-are-based-on-technologies-that-are-completely-different-from-those-used-on-Earth
7,"Q: Why is there a need for spacecrafts to take off with so much velocity?A: Otherwise they won’t stay in space.To stay in orbit, a spacecraft must reach orbital velocity. That’s the speed where the pull of gravity and the centrifugal force balances out one another. In Low Earth Orbit, that’s 7.8 km/second ot 17,000 mph. If you don’t go that fast, your spacecraft will drop back to Earth and crash.",0 followers,Brad Moffat,731,3.3K,8.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-extraterrestrial-civilizations-in-the-universe-are-based-on-technologies-that-are-completely-different-from-those-used-on-Earth
8,"Not realistically, no.First, remember that humans are a long-lived species whose generations are 20 to 25 years apart.

Humans are especially poorly suited to this kind of environment. The whole business about being warm-blooded, about having a lot of metabolic activity to support our big brains… it’s hard to imagine how that could work under conditions so drastically hostile to those needs.Third, unless humanity turns surprisingly barbaric, the colony/ies as such wouldn’t allow the kind of selective pressure that would drive evolution in that direction. Remember, natural selection means that lots and lots of individuals die, and evolution is the result of some lucky subset not dying. As humans, our colonists would do everything in their power to keep people from dying to lack of air, radiation, and cold; and that right there would stymie any evolutionary progress in that particular direction.",UNKNOWN,Erwin,11K,7.4K,52.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-did-security-technology-evolve

11,"Probably not - and here’s why:First, you must understand that true biological evolution does not have a ‘direction’. It is initiated by purely random events that cause some unpredicted change to t he genetic material of an individual. This change may be passed on to offspring which may display mental or physical changes arising from that change.Then the local environment determines whether that/those change(s) help or hinder the individual’s chances for survival in that environment.

This is the Natural Selection part of biological evolution.So, while biological evolution would be occurring in individuals stationed on Mars, it would not necessarily be enhancing their survival.The other factor you must consider is that living systems consist of myriad chemical reactions that must occur at certain rates to support the life of that individual. The simple fact is that the rate of chemical reactions depends to a large extent on the temperature at which it is occurring. Thus, an unprotected human on Mars would not be able to survive because their necessary chamical reactions would be too slow. A simpler form of life such as a bacteria or virus might be able to survive because its life does not depend on the same chemical reactions.Finally, true biological evolution takes very long times - tens or hundreds of thousands of years - which means the problem isn’t going to be fixed by this means - at least not anytime soon.","105,672 followers",Dave Consiglio,544,6.8K,91.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-extraterrestrial-civilizations-in-the-universe-are-based-on-technologies-that-are-completely-different-from-those-used-on-Earth

Imagine the speed of the vehicles going down where there are more pedestrians and going up where there are less pedestrians without the need for fixed signs. There will be areas where a mixture of traffic, pedestrians, cyclists and related will occur. In those areas or where they are sighted, autonomous vehicles will automatically slow down.There will no longer be any need for road markings, turning lanes, or lines at intersections. Any such will be embedded into the road itself and/or dynamic as the need arises. Transponders, radio signals, and dynamic GPS (or equivalent) will be utilised for positioning vehicles.People will take their own cars home after a night of serious drinking with no consequences whatsoever. You can sleep during the journey or read a book. There won’t be a driver’s seat. Some people may have a bar inside their vehicle.You will arrive at your destination and the vehicle will park itself. It will come when you signal it and pick you up directly from your destination. Parking the vehicle will be a thing that is delegated to automated systems.Vehicles on highways travelling longer distances will minimise the separation between vehicles to maximise road usage. That will be possible because the reaction times of the autonomous systems will be better than human response times, which take at best around 2 seconds. There will be significant savings in fuel economy since the slipstream of other vehicles will reduce fuel consumption. Vehicles will batch themselves in a similar way to flocks of birds, with the lead role swapped from time to time to share the slightly higher fuel requirements of being in the lead. Roads will widen and narrow to accommodate this flocking behaviour, still without the need for any markings.Most journeys will not see the vehicle needing to stop unless in the case of an emergency.Fatalities, serious injury and accidents will be at least an order of magnitude lower than what we tolerate today. Emergency services, such as ambulance and police will have more capacity to focus on their core responsibilities. When they are needed, they will never be caught in traffic as all vehicles will dynamically provide access to where they need to go.Homes will not require garages and most suburban streets will be able to be narrower. Streets will be utilised more by children playing games, as autonomous vehicles can detect them more rapidly than humans could and accommodate appropriately to their presence.People will be able to live further from where they work because the transportation will be more rapid, safer and enable them to relax during the journey.

A city like Tokyo has replaced most road traffic with mass transit. But this gimmick will only work if you have a mega efficient mass transit.The increase of efficient mass transit is also more likely as the population of earth increases. Transporting one person by car is inefficient and energy wasteful. But people won’t give up their cars unless a comfortable,safe and affordable mass transit system can take over the comforts and reliability of a car. And this will only work if the mass transit will actually get you within reasonable distance of your end destination.But before that happens i think another major thing in roads will change. When you look at the map on any given road system. Most roads on maps are curvy on a bigger scale, which is inefficient. Straight lines are more logical. If people ever become logical in the future , they will replace the long distance curved roads with straight line roads. *i’m not talking about the regular curve that you need to take to go just around the corner with your car, those curves are necessary for your car in order to make a turn , i’m talking map sized curves*As far as technology concerns, i think roads will get LED illumination. I think sensors will be put in place for driver less cars. I think more technology will come in place to deal with extreme weather.
