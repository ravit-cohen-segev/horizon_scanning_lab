Don't overwhelm yourself with this but try to go out there, get distracted, seek out new people and new hobbies or interests.Step #2 - delete apps and block websitesLook at your phone, really look at it. What is on your phone, how is it organized and what apps do you really need? Not only do apps take a lot of memory and battery from your phone but they’re also more distracting than they’re useful. Often we don’t even realize how much time we spend just passively scrolling through a feed and consuming all sorts of content that’s not necessarily good for us. So ask yourself, do you really need to have Facebook on your computer and on your phone? Or can you narrow down that usage to only one device? And what about those 5 mobile games, are they really a necessity?As for your computer, every browser has a number of extensions that will block any website, and phones have an app (ironically) for this too. A phone can be used for a business or a hobby that’s healthier than social media, so if you this through and if you’re merciless when cutting down unnecessary apps, you will see an improvement in no time.","118,715 followers",Kalpit Veerwal,2.8K,357,22.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-will-replace-social-media
4,"OK, let’s start with this: automationNow it’s a tiny fraction. The tractor, combine, and other forms of automation destroyed a huge number of jobs. Around 1975, there were vast numbers of factory jobs. Since then, manufacturing output has much more than doubled, but manufacturing employment has fallen off a cliff.Some jobs were lost to offshoring, but most were destroyed by automation (which is why production is still rising).So automation does destroy jobs. But whaOK, let’s start with this: automationNow it’s a tiny fraction. The tractor, combine, and other forms of automation destroyed a huge number of jobs. Around 1975, there were vast numbers of factory jobs. Since then, manufacturing output has much more than doubled, but manufacturing employment has fallen off a cliff.Some jobs were lost to offshoring, but most were destroyed by automation (which is why production is still rising).So automation does destroy jobs. But what about all the new jobs it creates? There are some, of course, but not many. How many jobs do you think were created producing, selling, and servicing tractors, combines, etc? Eighty percent of all US jobs, to replace the farming jobs they have destroyed? How many jobs do you think were created producing, selling, and servicing robots and other factory automation technology since 1975? As many as the 8 million they destroyed? Not even close, which makes sense if you think about it. If automation created as many jobs as it destroyed, it wouldn’t save business money, so they wouldn’t do it.OK, so if automation destroys more jobs than it produces, then why is unemployment at multi-decade lows? Clearly lots of new jobsBut if new jobs are created, who cares whether they’re created by automation or not? The distinction is important because if the companies were able to use automation to produce the extra stuff they want to sell, then the new jobs wouldn’t be created. Automation doesn’t create jobs, it creates demand; if the demand can be filled without creating jobs, that’s what will happen.There’s a second problem. Often people whose jobs are destroyed never find another job. Younger people come along to take the new jobs created, because the new jobs require skills the people who lost their jobs don’t have. So while unemployment is at multi-decade lows, part of that is because after a certain number of weeks of unemployment, people are no longer counted as unemployed, but that doesn’t mean they have work. In fact, the proportion of Americans over 16 who are employed is also at multi-decade lows.So the new work that needs to be done may be done by robots, and even if it’s done by humans, it may need skills that the people who’ve lost their jobs don’t have, and may never be able to acquire. We could have strong demand for workers and still many people who can’t find jobs.Furthermore, there’s an ongoing shift in the kind of automation that’s going on. Up until a decade ago, most of the work that was automated was just repetitive physical tasks. Now Artificial Intelligence technology is starting to be deployed, allowing more sophisticated tasks to be automated. We already have financial reports and sports stories being written by computers, and computers are able to do legal discovery much faster and more reliably than paralegals, andComputers are going to continue to advance, increasingly taking over tasks that require intelligence and judgement, and people are not getting any more powerful. If this trend continues, and there’s no indication that it will not, increasing numbers of people will be incapable of learning skills that make them competitive with computers.So why am I advancing such an anti-automation idea? I’m not. Far from it: this is excellent news. Would you like to be a farm laborer, cutting grain all day with a scythe? I sure wouldn’t. I’m delighted those jobs were automated: I get to eat grain without having to cut it myself. I get to have fancy gadgets like the one I’m typing this on without having to work in a factory. Automation is an awesome thing.There’s just one catch. Kind of obvious, really. If automation replaces most jobs, then how will we live? The companies will have robots building all this wonderful stuff, as much stuff as we could want, but only company owners will be able to buy it. Right now our economy works because businesses need to hire workers to produce their goods and services, and pay those workers, who spend that money to buy the stuff the companies produce. Without workers, the companies earn all the money, and don’t spend it, so the money stops circulating.When this starts actually happening, you can expect to see workers earning a decreasing share of the national income, with businesses retaining more. In fact, that’s well under way already. In the early 1960s, workers took home more than 67% of national income. By 1997 it had fallen below 62%; in 2001 it had recovered to 65%, but since then it has fallen to 59%. The trend is downward and accelerating.So the problem is not automation. Companies can produce an abundance of everything we want, and more automation means more ability to produce. The problem is that our economy cannot distribute that production without people working to earn their share. We’re going to need to think of another way to distribute that production. Right now the best we have to turn to is our social welfare system, which doesn’t do very well and doesn’t look likely to scale to ongoing mass unemployment.

This is the normal history of new technology. It took us from about 1984 until 2007 to go from the first personal computers to the computer in our pocket that is the smart phone. We usually over-estimate technology in the short run and under-estimate it in the long run.Many think we will achieve general AI with robots being as functional, mobile, agile, and versatile as a human being. I think that as technology approaches this point, such a robot would consume so many resources, that it would be cheaper to just use people. For example, we have already designed flying cars, but we don’t all have one because they would cost as much as a Rolls Royce. Instead we will have lots of narrow AI like Siri and Watson. They will do a few things well. Given this, I predict unemployment will top out at around 25% and this will take another 25 years.I also think there is a long shot that the same technology that makes jobs go away may wind up being utilized some how to make those unemployed able to take care of themselves.","135,500 followers",Hector Quintanilla,3.1K,1.2K,88.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-will-replace-social-media

I had read every book I could about Warren Buffett. And a year later I even wrote a book (I was fascinated. He was my hero. But I knew the truth about him wasn’t so simple.I was scared and jealous and shy at the annual meeting.(don’t judge a man by his clothes)I got there at 5 in the morning and there was already a big line to get in. Thousands of people there. Krispy Kreme donuts were being handed out in the dark.When the doors opened, everyone ran in to get a good seat. The floors had just been washed so everyone was slipping and falling.The annual meeting was only ten minutes. Then the rest of the day was made up of people asking Buffett and his partner, Charlie Munger, questions.After the meeting I was taking a cab back to the hotel. The cab driver said, “Do you want to see Warren Buffett’s house?” I said, “Sure.”We drove up to a regular house on the corner of a suburban block. There was a car parked out front with a man sitting inside of it. Security.“This is it,” the cab driver said. Then he drove me back to my hotel.I ordered room service, slept, and went home. I had been too shy to talk to a single person.(Buffett’s Omaha house)Oh! Except for one.One guy told me he had bought 200 shares of Berkshire Hathaway in the 1970s. “Someone told me this guy was smart so I bought 200 shares.“It doubled within a year. I felt like I was rich!“I sold 100 of the shares and started a restaurant. We ran that restaurant for 20 years.“The other 100 shares is worth $15 million.”“What do you do now?”He laughed. “Half the time I ski. And half the time I regret selling those first 100 shares.”There’s a lot of myths about Warren Buffett.And he’s not your grandpa.WARREN BUFFETT RULE #1: USE THE RIGHT BUSINESS MODEL TO INVESTFirst, some basic concepts that are important to understand:WHAT IS A HEDGE FUND?:The hedge fund manager makes money by charging you 2% per year of the money you put in (if you put in $1,000,000 they take $20,000 per year).They also take 20% of the profits. (If they return 10% on your $1,000,000 - a $100,000 profit - they take 20% of that, or $20,000).So a “2 and 20” fund would make $40,000 on a $1,000,000 investment that returns 10% that year.If a hedge fund has $1,000,000,000 in it then they would make $40,000,000 just on the fees.THAT is how hedge fund managers get rich. From fees.WHAT IS A BANK?It’s important to know how banks make money. Because it’s not very different from a hedge fund.You “Lend” the bank money when you open a checking account or savings account.They then give you a small interest rate return on your savings account (let’s say it’s 1%, although even that is high right now).They lend out the money to people who buy homes (they do other loans but this is most common). They charge (let’s say) 7%.The difference between 7% and 1% (minus the cost of their branches and bank tellers) is what they make. (This is rough but roughly accurate).So if you put $100,000 in a savings account, you might make $1,000 a year. They lend the $100,000 out at 7% (7,000 a year) and they make $6,000.That is how a bank makes money. In one sentence: you lend them money, they invest it (by lending it to homeowners) and they take 100% of the difference each year until you take your money out.Note: hedge funds make 20% of the profits. Banks make 100% of the profits.INSURANCE COMPANY:Similar to a bank and a hedge fund: You give them money, they invest it.Small differences: You give them money, but YOU NEVER WANT THAT MONEY BACK. If you get that money back it means something bad happened to you.This is different from a bank where the bank is simply holding your money until you take it back.An insurance company tries to never give you your money back.Then they invest it in (mostly) whatever they want. And they keep 100% of the profits. You don't keep any of that.An insurance company takes money from you every month (so you keep having insurance).Sometimes they return money each month to people who get sick.This is called “the cost of the float”. Sometimes they make money on that (they give out less than they take in). Sometimes they even lose money on the float. And then they only make money on their investments (minus the cost of the float).A bad insurance company has a high cost of float (they give out more than they take in).A good insurance company breaks even on float (they give out each month, roughly what they take in - i.e. people get sick, etc).A great insurance company makes money on BOTH the float (they only take money from people who they think won’t be sick and will never get their money back) and on their investments.(Foreshadowing: Warren Buffett runs a great insurance company).Insurance companies use statistics to see who are good risks to take money from and they use statistics to figure out how much money you should give.Extreme example: A 90 year old who wants life insurance will have to spend a lot more money than a healthy 20 year old woman.These are important things to understand to understand Warren Buffett.NOTE: Banks and Insurance companies both make 100% of the profits. BUT insurance companies don’t have to give the money back when the customer wants.To summarize:A hedge fund takes your money for a short time and takes 20% of the profits.A bank takes your money for a period of time and takes 100% of the profits until you take your money back.An insurance company takes your money FOREVER and keeps 100% of the profits.—Warren Buffett made his first million by running a hedge fund.Then he switched to owning small banks. Then finally he shut down his hedge fund and put all his money into running an insurance company.An insurance company is a hedge fund that KEEPS the investors money and KEEPS 100% of the profits.It’s the best business model in the world.It makes FIVE TIMES what a hedge fund would make and never has to worry about anxious investors pulling money away.WARREN BUFFETT SECRET #2: GET A DEALWarren Buffett doesn’t buy stocks like you and me. He doesn’t say, “Oh! Apple dropped 9% yesterday, I better go out there and buy shares.”This is how weak investors invest. Warren Buffett is not a weak investor.You always want to get special treatment over everyone else in order to make money.Else you are like the masses who, on average, do not make money. The average retail investor loses money every year no matter what the stock market does.What do I mean by, “A deal”.If a stock is at $100, that’s where civilians are buying it.Warren Buffett is not a civilian. He gets it cheaper, better, smarter.ExampleThe stock was at $115. Warren Buffett could have just bought shares. He was a believer.(Goldman Sachs stock crashing between November 2007 and one year later. Guess which point in this chart Warren Buffett got his “deal”).But that’s what a civilian would do.Instead, Warren Buffett called them up and offered them a deal they couldn’t refuse when everyone was losing faith in them.Lesson #1: Find a company that is desperate.Here was the deal:He invested $5,000,000,000. That would be 50,000,000 COMMON shares if he was a normal investor.A) Get 50,000,000 PREFERRED SHARES at $100. What is this? If Goldman goes bankrupt, then Warren Buffett would come BEFORE regular shareholders (the civilians) when Goldman liquidated.He would be FIRST in line to get the proceeds of the liquidation. So the odds of him losing money were basically zero.And note: he paid $100 a share instead of $115. So he got a discount nobody else could get.B) He got 43 million warrants FOR FREE to buy GS stock at $115. We’ll see what this means in a second.C) He got a 10% dividend. That means while he was still in the investment Goldman Sachs would pay him $500,000,000 A YEAR.So if he just sat on the investment for 10 years, even if GS stock went down to $20, he’d make all his money back. So he gives himself several ways to make money back even if things go bad.NOTE: GS only pays a 1.93% dividend. So Buffett was getting five times the normal dividend.Here’s what happened:2 years later, Goldman Sachs bought back his preferred shares for $5.64 BILLION.They paid him a premium to convince him to sell. And they gave him his dividend. So he made a quick $640 million.When Goldman Sachs stock was at $190, Buffett (who at this point had made $640 million profit in the bank) who had paid ZERO dollars for his warrants did something called “Exercising the Warrants”.He FINALLY paid $115 a share for his 43,000,000 shares (this is what a warrant is. It’s the right to LATER pay the price for the shares.) and then A SECOND LATER, sold those shares for $190.This was an extra 3,225,000,000 profit FOR FREE.So altogether, because of the fact that he got a special deal, he made a $4,000,000,000 profit.If he DID NOT have the special deal, two things would have happened:A) He was at much greater risk of losing all his money. The “preferred” aspect plus the dividend helped reduce the risk considerably.B) He got his money back with profit just two years later. So now he had his 43,000,000 warrants without paying a dime for them. Anyone else would have just made the profit and that’s that.He made an extra $3.22 BILLION dollars at ZERO COST.That’s a deal!He got that deal because he was “the Warren Buffett”. A persona, a super hero, a beacon of confidence that Goldman Sachs desperately needed.You get GREAT deals when you build up a significant persona, and the other side is significantly desperate.Else, the best strategy, as Warren Buffett says, is to “sit on your hands”.BUT…CAN YOU GET THESE DEALS IF YOU HAVE NOTHING?Yes, Warren Buffett has been getting deals since the day he started. He almost NEVER bought a significant amount of stock without a special deal.ExampleHe once saw a small penny stock (when you have a smaller amount of money, you get deals on smaller stocks) that was trading for less than their liquidation value.In other words, let’s say a stock was $10 but if you sold everything they had, you would have $12 a share in cash, then you can buy a lot of the stock, confident that in a worst case, they would liquidate and you would either make money or at least get your money back.These are called “cigar butt stocks”. The phrase was coined by Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett’s mentor (who wouldn’t hire Warren because he was only hiring jewish people).Warren saw a stock that was trading below liquidation value. So he bought a lot of the shares, and then HE CALLED THE CEO.He gave the CEO “advice”. Since you have so much extra money and assets, buy back shares at a higher price than you are trading so your stock price could go higher (the fewer shares outstanding, the more likely the stock will go up if there are buyers).The CEO told him what price he would buy Warren’s shares and they did the deal. So Warren basically worked out in a private deal with the CEO an almost instant profit.This was in the mid-60s. Warren was a young hedge fund manager. Nobody knew who he was. But he was aggressive about always getting a deal.Then he bought shares of the same company again.He called the CEO. He made the same deal. But this time the CEO said, “I’ll pay you less than you want but still a decent price.”Warren didn’t like that at all! Don’t mess with Warren Buffett!!!He bought up more than 50% of the shares. He then fired the CEO.The company was a little-known penny stock that made textiles. It was called “Berkshire Hathaway”.Warren knew that insurance companies were better business models than hedge funds. He had been running his hedge fund for ten years but he wanted a better deal than only 20% of the profits.He wanted 100% of the profits!So he started buying insurance companies.He shut down his hedge fund and switched all his focus to the better business model. And he kept doing deals with small penny stock companies.EXAMPLE 3:After 9/11 Warren Buffett went on CNBC and said there is an almost certain chance that a nuclear weapon will be used on US soil in the next 50 years.Shock and Awe!With his insurance company he then started a new product: nuclear attack insurance.Big events like the Super Bowl would buy Nuclear Attack Insurance for millions of dollars.If there was no nuclear attack (highly unlikely) then Buffett would collect millions for free (this is how he kept the “cost of float” profitable for him).If there was a nuclear attack then, well, we have more to worry about than insurance.WARREN BUFFETT RULE #3: KEEP OTHER PEOPLE POORWarren Buffett has a folksy story about his secretary. “She pays more taxes than me!”That’s because she makes a salary!Warren Buffett is rich because he owns $80 BILLION worth of Berkshire Hathaway stock. BUT YOU DON’T PAY TAXES until you sell the stock.His salary is something like $1 a year.So EVERYONE pays more income taxes than Warren Buffett.(Warren Buffett’s will do anything to avoid paying taxes)But he uses that line to get Congress to raise taxes on the middle class and upper middle class. Higher taxes means the middle class has less money to spend on products and they have to work harder for every dollar they save for retirement.If you are rich and most people are desperate, then you find more deals.WARREN BUFFETT RULE #4: BUILD A PERSONAWarren Buffett is everyone’s grandpa.He has folksy wisdom like: “When hamburgers are cheap, buy them. Why do people buy stocks when they are more expensive?”Or, “Long ago, Charlie [Munger] laid out his strongest ambition: All I want to know is where I'm going to die, so I'll never go there. “Nice and folksy way of saying, “life is uncertain but you can’t worry about that uncertainty.”Using this folksy wisdom he has been an advisor to the CEOs of the biggest companies, Presidents, other billionaires, etc.Why be an advisor? To get deals!Part of his persona is to be relatable.He focuses on his small house in Omaha. He never mentions he used to have an enormous mansion in California.He focuses on the fact that his kids will inherit nothing.He doesn’t mention he gave them each a $3,000,000,000 (three billion!) charitable foundation.With a charitable foundation like that, they can take a salary of tens of millions per year.And because these were set up as charities, when Buffett dies, none of his kids will have to pay an inheritance tax.Nor will Buffett pay the enormous estate tax that every other rich family has to pay because he has pledged to donate the remainder of his money to Bill Gates charity.I am not saying this is not a generous thing to do. It is very generous. But it does mean I will not listen to what Buffett says about taxes since he has done a very good job at avoiding them.WARREN BUFFETT RULE #5: TIME IN A BOTTLETime management.Warren works all day. As he says, “I skip to work” .But he delegates the management of all the businesses he owns (from Fruit of the Loom to See’s Candies to the huge insurance companies).And he only gets involved in investments when he gets deals so good that they are easy for him to say “Yes” to. Which is rare but he is fine waiting and being patient.And then rest of the day he reads and he plays bridge.(the most valuable Bridge game in the world. Get in this game if you can).He has a great life. I wouldn’t trade mine for his but I admire how he set up his life.Reading is the best way to make sure you have more knowledge than the people you are doing deals with.And bridge is his favorite game. It uses the brain, it uses his passion for statistics, and it’s fun (his bridge partner is usually Bill Gates)He loves his day. He loves his life.Invest your energy and time wisely because the dividends compound and produce a great life.And THAT is how Warren Buffett gets rich.SOURCESNote: Some of this is based on the book I wrote in 2005: “Trade Like Warren Buffett”.Some of this is based on the many articles I’ve written about Buffett since then.Some of this is based on research I did as an advisor to the TV show “Billions”.Some of this is based on the many discussions I’ve had with billionaires for my upcoming book, “Think Like a Billionaire”.And some of this is based on my years as a hedge fund manager.Other sources:","21,229 followers",Charles Tips,11.7K,4.4K,25.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-sector-in-technology-do-you-think-will-make-the-next-billionaires

Leisure... but how much of all that can one person accumulate? Or even a family? Even dynasties, considering they tend not to lose the fortunes they accumulate, instead accumulating even more wealth?We've reached a point where there are people in the world for whom it would be absolutely impossible to spend all their money without creating enough inflation to precipitate global financial crisis. Think about that: there are people in the world who could destabilize it with a single transaction.Money is, at heart, a cushion. A bulwark against fear, and yet it brings its own fear along with it.I do have an answer for this question, though. I expect it might be controversial.The United States is trying desperately to straddle the divide between two identities: a manufacturing economy and an information economy. This isn't the first time it's weathered a transition; not long after the Industrial Revolution led to the rise of factories, the agricultural South fought a bloody civil war against a more industrial North. Farming was labor intensive and required large amounts of cheap slave labor to do profitably. The efficiency that machines brought to certain industries meant that factory owners could pay their workers a small amount and still realize a reasonable profit. Slave labor was no longer 'a necessity' to them.Efficiency continued to improve and the US became a manufacturing titan, with the vast majority of its working citizens employed in these industries. And then, we invented the digital computer, and in less than a century, the greatest increase in new wealth comes from technology-related sectors. Since the rise of public access to the Internet, an even greater amount of wealth has concentrated in those who work in the 'information economy'.But we fell behind in our ability to produce hard goods at sufficient scale and cost. The vast majority of our computer chips are designed in the US but produced in Asia. Almost everything you find in a Target or a Walmart was made anywhere but the US. Our automobile industry continues to struggle to remain relevant. But look at what the globalization of our manufacturing has done for the economic and political clout of not millions - billions - of people. China has experienced a modernization boom in the last three decades, allowing it to far surpass us in transportation, public services and many other areas. Japan, Korea and other Asian countries are experiencing great influxes of wealth as we stop resisting what is now happening to the United States.By resisting the end of the manufacturing economy in the United States, we are not only creating a dangerous income gap within our own population, not only providing subpar education and wages, and not only clinging to xenophobic and archaic concepts like 'Made in USA', we are also hoarding wealth and depressing the economies of much of the rest of the world.That means we stop propping up old manufacturing companies, and we export the work that makes sense to export. It means we retrain and refocus people as necessary, and adjust our education systems to ensure that we are creating not only workers but thinkers, too, and preferably both -- and that we get over our fear and belief that a job that moves out of the US necessarily means a job lost in the U.S.That's not true. Think about this: the people who oppose free trade the most are the ones who are the quickest to send jobs overseas, to close call centers in the US and replace them with those in countries like India. Those who shout the loudest that taxation costs jobs are the ones who try hardest to pay the least while pushing for the sort of incentives and government funding that contributes to deficit spending - and the need for taxation. Those who proclaim 'Made in the USA' are the first to oppose minimum wage and benefits increases, because they know that they cannot compete with the rest of the world unless they globalize.With the proper education, support, and retraining, we could shift from reliance on local manufacturing and create more higher-paying jobs than ever before. And we need to, or we risk creating a system of economic equality so great that it could threaten to tear the country apart. We see the symptoms of this divide already growing more ominous every day.I work in the information technology sector. I don't work harder than most other people, and my work is far less physically demanding. I've worked in service industries, I've worked in the lumber industry, I've even moved around big boulders as a landscaper, and I can tell you... there's a part of me that just doesn't understand why I get paid what I do for sitting in a chair all day. No... there's a part of me that doesn't understand why others DON'T get paid what I do despite the tremendous amount of blood and sweat they put into their jobs, especially when their upper management makes orders of magnitude more than they do for living lives of leisure.And it's partially because these economies are dying here, and the only way for the rich to remain rich while still keeping things the way they are is to keep wages low, to resist benefits for their employees, and to cut corners wherever possible. That's no way to create a beneficial company, and companies that behave with this mindset (such as Walmart) actually cost the world more than all the money they make for themselves. For every dollar in the Walton's pockets, it could cost the rest of us two.So where will the next billionaires come from? It'll be the people who figure out how to successfully navigate this transition, who help us evolve our thinking, our education, our workforce, and our management into a mindset of globalization and of excelling where we excel now rather than clinging to the industries of the past.Our next billionaires, quite simply, will be the people who break the wage and opportunity ceiling - not just for the US, but for the world as a whole.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,4.8K,996,155.9M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Which-sector-in-technology-do-you-think-will-make-the-next-billionaires
