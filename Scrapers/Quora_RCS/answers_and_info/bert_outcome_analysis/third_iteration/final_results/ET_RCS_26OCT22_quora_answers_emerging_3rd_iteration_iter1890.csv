The Internet of ThingsThe Internet of Things has long been talked about amongst tech insiders as the next big innovation in home technology. In recent years, IoT has begun carve a niche for itself in everyday life with the growing adoption of systems like Google’s Home and Amazon’s Alexa. These devices will continue to integrate more aspects of the home into one harmonious system by utilizing the internet, allowing a user to control anything from the air conditioning to their security via voice command and a small personal assistant.Apple has announced its plans to roll out the HomePod this year and Samsung is reportedly working on their Bixby technology in order to compete with the success of the Google and Amazon systems. You can expect that one of these devices will be simplifying life in your home and the homes around you by 2020.2. AutomationWhile large-scale innovation in automation has traditionally been limited to the production side of society, the technology will have far reaching implications for consumers by 2020. Amazon’s automated grocery store, eliminating the need for cashiers, has been one of the first major tech triumphs of the year.The store has proven itself successful as an efficient alternative for shoppers in its first location. The current cost of this technology, however, puts it out of the reach of pretty much any other storefront. As the technology continues to develop, consumers can expect that pressure sensors and cameras that automate pay and alleviate long lines in stores will be coming to groceries and pharmacies near you in the next couple of years.3. CryptocurrencyAfter Bitcoin’s meteoric price jump in 2017, major tech players have begun to take cryptocurrencies seriously. Along with major Initial Coin Offerings that have hit major news outlets like Etherium, smaller companies are developing Stablecoins that provide attempt to provide all the pros of cryptocurrency transactions without the price fluctuations that have plagued the system.As these coins begin to work themselves out and exchanges even out the fluctuations in prices, expect these assets to be mainstream methods of payment by 2020.4. BlockchainBlockchain, the decentralized ledger that holds together cryptocurrencies, has applications reaching far beyond financial transactions. Companies have applied the technology to everything, from simplifying tracking and access to information in academia to interesting and amusing games that use complex algorithms to create unique experiences.5. Artificial IntelligenceArtificial intelligence, which once may have seemed like something out of a Sci-Fi novel, is seeing the light and applications of the technology are already being worked on. In particular, with the rise of the Internet of Things, Information Technology and Cybersecurity firms have begun to adopt artificial neural networks in order to monitor and prevent DDoS attacks.In addition to its security applications, companies like Amazon and Google have begun to apply the technology to regular consumers in order to simplify shopping and searching experiences on the platforms. With all the current progress of AI technology, it is reasonable to expect that by the year 2020 the innovation will be deeply entrenched in both business and consumer activities.Hope this was helpful.",0 followers,Peter,2.8K,43.6K,167.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-upcoming-technologies-that-will-change-the-daily-life

Of all the technologies invented to date, which one was most life-changing?Anyone who thinks AI is going to be the most life-changing technology of the future must necessarily answer that computers are the most life-changing technology to date. That’s a reasonable answer.But here is the odd answer that jumped to my mind, when I look backward:The invention of cooking food with fire.This was the invention that put humanity on the path to being able to create all of the other technologies that happened since, as it is what enabled our runaway change in brain size compared to body size.Without being able to cook our food, we simply wouldn’t have found a way to eek out the living that gave us enough calories per day to sustain the demands of a large brain.And without the larger brain, we wouldn't have the capability to invent any of the technologies that most people will offer as the answer to this question.",0 followers,Anshu Bharti,7.1K,789,26.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-upcoming-technologies-that-will-change-the-daily-life

It is not one of the top notch, even if we discount all those tier 1 colleges, but its great nonetheless.Full disclosure, I myself reached this number after 10 years of experience, back in 2016, and it was a pretty good number back then. I switched my job at that time, reached at 32 after 33% of hike, and I earned more than my then manager.Even in toady’s inflated times, you are earning well, my friend. Infact by all national and international studies on the subject, you have reached the number that makes you extremely happy. You will be able to pay off your bills with ease, send your kids to nice school, will be able to get a home for yourself, have a nice car, and then save some for your and your family’s future, so congratulations.The uphill battle actually starts now, because now every 20k that you get, will not add as much of happiness in your life as you got when you were at say 10 LPA. You have hit the point of diminishing returns when it comes to happiness as a function of salary. Any incremental increase in salary will have exponential increase in responsibility and stress, while not adding proportionately to the happiness of you or your family.From this point onwards, you will start taking your family for granted, start ignoring them, you will start traveling with your laptop at all times, you will start checking your emails even while watching movies in theater, you will start keeping an eye for each and every incoming email, even the ones where you were in CC, and there will be lots of those CCs now.So, I will again congratulate you for getting where you came, the balance is the key moving forward.

As your are paid higher than market, they might expect more quality in work. Don't freak out n just do what you do the best without many distractions. But remember fun, right family time and free time are never a distraction but a necessity.Cheers and upvote if helpful.",145 followers,Sandeep Patel,518,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-upcoming-technologies-that-will-change-the-daily-life
