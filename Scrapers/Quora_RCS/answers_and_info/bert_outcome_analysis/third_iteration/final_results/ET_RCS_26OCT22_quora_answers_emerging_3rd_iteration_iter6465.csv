5,"The process of evolution requires three things:The process of evolution requires three things:So the answer is NO, our technology and agriculture have not stopped humans from evolving.Furthermore, we are using our technology to increase the size of the human population by keeping some people who would have died prior to having a child, or even just another child. This may reduce the impact of some specific kinds of selection, but it won't eliminate the impact of those kinds of selection unless we can save EVERYONE from those selective pressures, and we are not yet close to doing that even for the selective pressures we understand. A larger population size, all else being equal, makes even small selective pressures more effective at determining gene frequencies. This is due to reducing the relative importance of random chance (genetic drift) compared to natural selective pressures.It is certainly true that our actions are changing the course of the evolution of our species, but the changes we are making are not as simple as just turning off all of evolution.

Let's call that `domain A’.Now, [filmmaking] did not start out cold. It did not spring from the brow of Jupiter, complete and ready to go. The domain of [filmmaking] is related to other artistic domains that existed for a long time, such as theThese already existing domains were combined to make the first movies. Any culture is made up of thousands and thousands of domains like these.To be creative one must have a domain from which one can learn a cultural tradition. For instance, a person interested in movies may want to become a director, screenwriter, cinematographer, actor, film editor, or maybe a producer. This person will turn to the already existing domain of [filmmaking] and bring to it something new that may change that domain.The individual learns from that domain and tries to produce a novelty in it. Depending on whether the novelty is accepted by the field of [filmmaking], the person will be recognized as someone creative who has contributed to the domain. The field of [filmmaking] is made up of producers, investors, directors, critics, script writers, and The Academy of Motion Pictures.These are the people who can decide whether a new film or a new cutting technique is or is not worth including into the domain of [filmmaking]. You could have a lot of very interesting and novel ideas about making movies, but unless those ideas are selected by the field, there will be no change and therefore no creativity.Once the movie is accepted by the field, it is added to the domain and the contribution enlarges the domain from what it was before. The new generation of movie makers will see the work as being part of the domain and react to it by saying something like, ""Gee, look how well he cut the scenes or how well he used pan shots. I am going to try something like that, but different."" This process is part of a continuing spiral. A person absorbs certain rules or techniques from a domain and makes a change, which might or might not be accepted by the people who control the domain.TheCsikszentmihalyi, M.

At a mundane level, a filmmaker wants to achieve some pattern or effect… Or an adventurous filmmaker may actually court problems, laying down self-imposed constraints in order to stimulate her or his imagination… Every decision is a trade-off, yielding not only benefits but also costs.’ (Bordwell 2008, p. 25)This view correlates with Brian Boyd’s problem-solution (and `cost-benefit’ ratio) model - for both artists and audiences - in`Artists of any kind will seek to minimize composition effort – by operating within existing artistic modes and traditions, by recombining available models, by adopting readymade subjects – as much as is compatible with maximizing the attention and status a work can earn.Like artists, audiences too seek a favourable cost-benefit ratio…Problems emerged with life, with the challenge of maintaining a structure complex enough to maintain and reproduce itself. Biologists accordingly see physiological features and behavioural choices as attempts to solve particular strategic problems.A biocultural approach to the arts will analyse an individual artist’s situation in the process of composition as a series of particular problems and solutions.Following on from the discussion above,As in biology, solutions may often be compromises, trade-offs between the benefits of one move and its costs for other parts of the emerging work.And just as in biology old elements provide a ready base for many new designs, as fish fins could become amphibian legs and then bird or bat wings, ape arms or seal flippers, so artists can combine ready-made solutions in new ways to answer new problems.Current practices will incorporate more or less successful solutions to prior problems that can then be improved, recombined or redirected to new problems.And individual artists will each have their own personal problem of capitalizing on the attention their previous work has earned, without boring audiences by merely repeating past successes.TheAudiences will tend to seek the engagement that matters most to them, not necessarily to the artist, and even to appropriate the work in ways the artist did not intend…The problem-solution model emphasizes individual choice within a specific context.Artists make choices within the unique landscape of their individual preferences and capacities… Not only is each problem situation subtly different, but the individual mental landscape within which each of us searches for answers will have unique contours and preferences… Personality differences have been found even in invertebrates, as animals as neurologically simple as guppies can detect and act on differences in personality.’ (Boyd in Boyd, Carroll and Gottschall, 2010, pp. 437-40)In the essay `Convention, Construction and Cinematic Vision’ in`If we consider culture to be an elaboration of evolutionary processes, there’s no inherent gulf between `biology’ and `society’ in this explanatory framework …a great deal of what is conveyed in a movie is conveyed naturally – through those perceptual-cognitive-affective universals that are part of our biological inheritance.’(Bordwell 2008, p. 79)Returning to Csikszentmihalyi and Wolfe’s (2000) definition, that `Creativity can be defined as an idea or product that is original, valued and implemented' (Csikszentmihalyi, Mihaly & Wolfe 2000, p. 81) and combining this with the notion of creativity as “novel and appropriate” we can see why these ideas spread to become popular as memes (i.e.: as filmmaking ideas/techniques/processes).Once each of these ideas (cinematic styles, techniques, narrative devices) were implemented (i.e.: viewed by an audience, in a film) they were adopted by more and more other filmmakers in the field, to eventually become a part of the canon (and conventions) of filmmaking practice and culture.This is certainly not to suggest that the transition of each new idea (meme) may have been smooth, nor even uniform across the field; some of these ideas may well have appeared at various times, and in various films - yet at the time, may not have `caught on’, and furthermore, other memes in film have gone out of fashion, or been superseded, such as: the `overly-theatrical’ style of acting, and `tableau’ style of camera coverage in early silent films (Bordwell 2012).Writing about the evolution of film style fifty years ago in 1964, Koestler states:`Greek tragedy, as far as we can tell, starts with the `goat song’, derived from the worshipful ceremonies in honour of Bacchus-Dyonysius. These in turn originate even further back in the past, in rituals accompanied by human sacrifice, which the Bacchantae enacted in symbolic ways, that is, by implication; their traces can still be found in Euripides.At some stage, the epic recital of events branched off from their direct representation by actors in disguise. The early bards were probably still impersonating their heroes by voice and gesture, as theAnd even legitimate histrionics, the art of acting, shows a trend towards less emphasis, more economy. Not only do Victorian melodramatics strike one as grotesque; but even films no more than twenty years old, and highly valued at the time, appear surprisingly dated – overdone, obvious, over-explicit.Moreover, in the evolution of the film form to date, there may well have been manyYet at some point, these now-widespread cinema memes were widely imitated, and were also accepted by audiences. The most-likely reason suggested by the evolutionary view is, because:These memes (innovations in style, technique, technology) can each be viewed as `solutions’ to `problems’ in the domain of film.As Bordwell (2008) notes, some example film domain `problems’ include:How might we indicate a `flashback’? (Solution: the ripple-dissolve).How might we best show one actor’s face, and then another’s facial reaction, without confusing the audience? (Solution: the shot/reaction shot convention, without crossing the `180-degree line’).How can we `compress’ time in a continuous sequence? (Solution: the jump-cut). (Bordwell 2008, pp. 57-82).In`Explaining artistic continuity and change through a rhythm of problem and solution has a long lineage, running back at least to Vasari’s account of the mastery of realism during the Italian Renaissance. The idea has been recast and nuanced by E.H. Gombrich in the course of a scintillating career…Some advantages of the problem/solution model are immediately apparent.It allows us to focus on particular aspects of film style – certain problems rather than all of them – while still acknowledging that patterns of problem and solution can intersect with one another or with other factors (technological, economic, or cultural)…In addition, the problem/solution framework leaves room for the possibility that varying tendencies can coexist within the same period, as filmmakers conceive their problems and solutions along competing lines…During the 1970’s Grand Theorists took individual agency out of film history; since then they have been struggling to put it back. The problem/solution model faces no such difficulty. It invites us to reconstruct decisions made by active agents, and it treats persons as concrete forces for stability or change (or both)…The history of style will be the history of practitioners’ choices, as concretely manifested within films. By granting a role to the artist’s grasp of the task and of her own talents, the problem/solution framework acknowledges various reasons for the agent to act. The job need not be imposed from without: as Gombrich points out, innovation often springs from an artist’s urge to be different, to compete with others, to savor the exercise of skill, or to seek new challenges.Nor does this frame of enquiry obliterate the possibility of errors, accidents (happy or unhappy), unintended consequences, spontaneous and undeliberated actions, and decisions made for reasons not wholly evident to the agents. Even as it centers upon choices made by social agents, the problem/solution model recognizes that individual action takes place within a social situation with its own demands.The artist’s choices are informed and constrained by the rules and roles of artmaking. The artistic institution formulates tasks, puts problems on the agenda, and rewards effective solutions.Gombrich points out that even that precious resource individuality can be achieved only when the artist asks “What is there for me to do?” within the artistic institution and the larger culture. Standard Version historians were right: individual initiative matters. Bazin and Burch were right: group norms matter too. Problems stand out against a horizon of purpose and function.Once films are supposed to tell stories, filmmakers must try out ways to tell them clearly. How do you ensure that viewers recognize the main characters on each appearance? How do you delineate cause and effect in unambiguous ways? How do you portray psychological states that propel the action? How do you draw the viewer’s attention to the most important events in a shot or scene?…A mischievous boy who looks at the camera not only acknowledges the viewer’s presence but also makes his own reaction hard to miss. Later solutions to the problem of clarity, such as cutting in to a closer view, will yield different benefits (as well as different costs).’(Bordwell 1997, pp. 150-1)It is also worth noting in passing that art historian E.H. Gombrich was Sir Karl Popper’s bestest-buddy, and that both influenced and cited the other in various works.One further quote from Bordwell citing Gombrich is required:`The filmmaker pursues goals; stylistic choices help achieve them. But no filmmaker comes innocent to the job. Task and functions are, more often than not, supplied by tradition. For any given stylistic decision, the artist can draw on the solutions bequeathed by predecessors. Most minimally, as Nöel Carroll has suggested, the artist can just replicate devices that have proved successful. The formulaic shot/reverse-shot handling of dialog is an example. Gombrich calls such ready-to-hand formulasReplication, revision, synthesis, rejection: these possibilities allow us to plot the dynamic of stability and change across the history of styleFrom the standpoint of problem and solution, it is not surprising that a filmmaker who innovates with respect to one schema may prove conservative with respect to others… Once we recognize as well that alternative devices are available – there is always another way to do anything – we can see that schemas often compete with one another…So the history of a technique is not likely to consist of one problem and one solution; often a problem links to a solution and thence to a new problem… the dynamic of problem and solution can lead to quite diverse, competing outcomes, all coexisting at the same moment, none of them emerging as the preferred solution…This approach does not seal film off from social processes. Tasks, problems, solutions and schemas can issue from any domain in the filmmaker’s community…Culture or social context will not be the source of every plausible explanation for a stylistic choice…It is more likely that, as directors who were asked questions all day they hit upon sound answers through craft wisdom, trial and error, and a sensitivity to some of the transcultural appeals that shape viewers’ experience of cinema.’ (Bordwell 1997, pp 151-7)The above sections highlight that Bordwell is talking about evolution here in a way that can be seen to apply to both biology and culture: just as genes in a gene pool undergo `replication, revision, synthesis, rejection’, so too memes (e.g. schemas) in the meme pool (culture) undergo the same process.Anyway… so there you go.
