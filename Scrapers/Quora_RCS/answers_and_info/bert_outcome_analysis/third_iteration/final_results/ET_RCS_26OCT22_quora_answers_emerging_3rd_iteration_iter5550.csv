There isn't anything left to figure in that area. So the only thing left to figure out is finding the right technology.By technology I mean the design of spaceships, the efficiency of fuel, survival of humans in space and millions of other things which we will only find out if we went to space ourself.

There isn't anything left to figure in that area. So the only thing left to figure out is finding the right technology.By technology I mean the design of spaceships, the efficiency of fuel, survival of humans in space and millions of other things which we will only find out if we went to space ourself. Humans have been to space but Interstellar travel is still a longway. Do we need it really?Wether your answer is yes or no depending on our present, it is pointless because first question which should be asked is, can we afford it?Our technology is pretty decent when it comes to design and our survivality, but what we actually lack is the efficiency of our fuel. Do you know if earth was even 50% more massive we would be stuck here forever with the technology we use for sending rockets into space? 90% of the rocket's mass is just fuel. Just recently, we started using reusable rockets, thanks to spacex befor that 90% of the rocket was distroyed just to get that rest of 10% into the Earth's orbit.Getting out of Earth's gravity or any planet which is bigger then earth, if we are considering Interstellar travel would be the hardest part, and with corrent technology it's impossible because after doing it once you need a refill. Once we are in the space fuel is not a problem but some other things like time. Space is so bit and things are so far apart, that even our lifetime is not enough to get to the next star system. Not that we need to go there, just for tourism maybe. So we could hybernate but that has its own technological problems. So I guess, we need more speed and spaceships that can sustain it.The main technologcal improvements that can contribute to better space travel can come from material science. With better understanding of solids we can make better material more suited for space and materials that can be used to improve the efficiency directly of indirectly. For example we can improve our solar cells and bettries to store more energy in smaller space. Even fitting a nuclear reactor inside a spaceship would require a lot of contributions from material science. We would also need better prediction capabilities and more autometed controlling so I guess a semi AI technology can also improve the situation. If we could develop an AI and learn to live with it, then almost all the technological developments would become so much faster and cheaper.",4 followers,Dan Bradbury,4.2K,21.7K,235.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-sort-of-technologies-could-be-used-for-Interstellar-travel-Based-on-what-kind-of-knowledge-should-these-technologies-emerge

2,"I would answer this question little differently based on my 17 years of experience in security.Certifications DO NOT matter. I repeat certifications do not matter.

Your background2. Your interest (red team versus blue team: red team attacks and blue team defends and both are equally important)3. Market/job opportunityYou can be an inch deep and miles wide in security or you can be inch wide and miles deep. For example there are different skill set required based on at which layer(network, OS,application , data) you are providing security. For example1. Network security (IPS, proxy, web filtering, email filtering, firewall, APT detection, next gen firewall and so on )2. Endpoint security (mostly desktops,mobile and laptops)3. Application security (code review, white box testing, black box testing and all three requires different kind of skill sets)4. Server security (web server, application server, database servers)5. Data security ( encryption, DRM, tokenization, compliance , data classification and policies and so forth)6. Network forensics or endpoint forensics7. Incident response and security monitoring8 malware analysis and reversing9. Hardware hacking (p0wning IoT devices smart meters, phones or Barbie dolls for fun)10. Surveillance (man in the middle for cell phones, sessions , cookie stealing, and so on)These are some of the high level buckets you have to think about and what matches your background.But before you do that I would strongly advice following .1. Read the entire TCP/IP illustrated volume I and when you finish it, read it one more time. If you can't finish the whole book atleast read first 10 chapters. You can thank me later.2. Read basics of port scanning on3. Read up on cyber kill chain4. Download kali from5. Once you are familiar with Kali and tools, Start with CTF (capture the flag) and try and solve few challenges.Now you have basics to conquer any advanced stuff in network and data security. For application security specially for white box testing or security code review you should have some programming background.Application security , malware reversing and security monitoring are really hot. Depending on the vertical you choose data security and compliance can be really in demand for example financial , healthcare or retail.Last but not least, there are ton of books on the topics I mentioned above , and ton of material onNow after all this if you say on top of this I have CISSP or CISA then it holds some water but it won't automatically get you a job just because you are CISSP . By the way there is an inside joke within security community but may be will table that for some other time.Good luck and I promise, you will never ever be bored in security.Regards,Vijay""If you can see the invisible you can do the impossible""P.S : the question was changed after it was answered. The initial question was how can you get a job as a cyber security expert and now it was change this is unfair to people who have spent time answering your initial question. If you wanted to change the question you should have asked separately.","1,355 followers",Vijay Upadhyaya,1.2K,140,700.9K,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-new-emerging-technologies-a-system-engineer-5-10-yrs-exp-should-learn-in-order-to-keep-him-competitive-updated-skills-and-in-demand

Day by day, for more than four years, he carried an animal on his shoulders.

Day by day, for more than four years, he carried an animal on his shoulders. While people were laughing at him, the small calf slowly grew into an adult ox and Milo got stronger and stronger along the way. What an awesome idea. Every day, when Milo woke up, he lifted the calf, put it on his shoulders and carried it around all day. After four years, Milo was lifting and carrying around an impressively big ox. By then, people stopped laughing a long time ago, when they saw Milo’s muscles and strength grow.Here is the main lesson of his story.Milo didn’t start by lifting a big heavy ox. He started with a calf. Whereas his competitors attempted to lift an adult bull instead. That gave him the chance to master the fundamentals.He went with a smart approach toNo matter what skill you want to learn or which area of life you want to improve, you have to start small. You have to start with the fundamentals. Because you can only build a majestic skyscraper of success on strong foundations.Think big, have a great vision, but start small. Don’t overestimate what you can achieve in a year, but don’t underestimate what you can achieve in five years.In five years, you can dramatically improve your health, wealth, relationships, competences, happiness or whatever your goal is. But start by saving a few dollars per day. Start with walks in nature, then progress to jogging, running and weightlifting. Read one page per day and then add an additional one every day. And choose maximum one or two areas to improve at once.While doing that, don’t compare yourself to other people who are already masters. Beginnings (after the initial motivation wears off) are always hard, but the hard road becomes easy with time. Thus, manage your expectations and keep the long-term view in mind.And remember, if your expectations are too high when you undertake a new challenge, you will be greatly disappointed and give up sooner or later.Long-term thinking means that you planMilo of Croton knew that consistency is keyHard work beats talent every time. But hard work is hard, since it demandsHard work requires putting effort into your goals on a daily basis. That means you have to cut the bullshit and focus on what really matters. Day by day.You have to persistently follow a carefully orchestrated process that leads you to your big vision. Consistency and never giving up, while staying flexible, are the key to everything.

Do not be afraid of the complex differential equations.Trying to visualise any situation involving these equations will make life easier for you.Do not solely depend on mathematical knowledge,visualise it's application to the real world.Do you know how many differential equations come into play when a footballer kicks the ball?Solid mechanics,fluid mechanics,theory of elasticity ….all of these will be jumbled up.If you look up any research paper,this simple thing like kicking a football will blow your mind.Thus,Try not to complicate simpler things.4.Be it mechanical or any other engineering,Team management is very important.Be a leader.Be it in your lab groups or project groups,be the one to take everyone forward.If you want to venture into corporate life,this sense of leadership can take you to places.5.Be updated.About almost everything we learn in our course text books are technologies which are way to old for the modern world.So when you step out of college into real life,you are clueless..Watch Discovery Science,National Geographic…stay updated with the technologies incorporated in building the modern marvels,be it the Airbus A380,or the Underground Metro..6.Welcome change.Mechanical engineering does not mean simply sticking to machines and cars.In this current scenario ,biomimetics,geophysics ,material research and many more areas require knowledge of mechanical engineering.so don't be afraid if machines are your nightmare.Genetic engineering may come to your rescue.So always welcome the interdisciplinary approach to engineering,because every major project requires all types of minds and need a leader to work them through.I hope this was satisfactory.Do Upvote and share if you liked it.All the best.","129,188 followers",Jessica Su,3.9K,1.5K,49.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-new-emerging-technologies-a-system-engineer-5-10-yrs-exp-should-learn-in-order-to-keep-him-competitive-updated-skills-and-in-demand
