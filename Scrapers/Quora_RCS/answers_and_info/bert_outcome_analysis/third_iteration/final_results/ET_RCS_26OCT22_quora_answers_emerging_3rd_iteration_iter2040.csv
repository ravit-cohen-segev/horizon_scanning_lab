0,David O. White is the best speaker I have heard in this area recently. Contact: http://tallblog.conted.ox.ac.uk/index.php/author/whited/Here is a recent example: http://tallblog.conted.ox.ac.uk/index.php/2010/09/30/product-or-public-good/,UNKNOWN,Hector Quintanilla,22.6K,1.2K,88.6M,2011,https://www.quora.com/Who-do-you-see-as-an-upcoming-speaker-blending-the-best-of-education-and-educational-technology-in-their-presentations

With no thrust and little altitude, he decides that a turn and glide back to LaGuardia is not a viable option.A few seconds later the controller comes with the confirmation.Harten:3:28 pmWithout thrust Sullenberger begins his glide towards the Hudson. The only major vertical obstacle in his way is the George Washington Bridge, which Sullenberger clears with about 900 feet to spare.3:30 pmSullenberger makes his only announcement to the passengers.3:31 pmWith its nose raised and traveling at 150mph US Airways Flight 1549 completes an unpowered ditching in the Hudson.Sullenberger gives the evacuate command.All 155 passengers and crew on board US Airways Flight 1549 survived.Now, tell me, what are the odds of a rookie pilot accomplishing this landing? Close to zero, right?

3,"I have answered this question several times and I usually mention Cold Fusion or some sort of battery technology that will concentrate more power in a smaller area.My answer has not really changed. However, I will modify it to say that I think we will make some sort of breakthrough that will allow us to either generate electricity so cheaply as to preclude metering, or else perfect storage to the point where all the “free” energy that is wasted in the form of heat, wind, sunlight, etc., can be captured and held until it is needed on the grid.The ways to accomplish this might include cold fusioI have answered this question several times and I usually mention Cold Fusion or some sort of battery technology that will concentrate more power in a smaller area.My answer has not really changed. However, I will modify it to say that I think we will make some sort of breakthrough that will allow us to either generate electricity so cheaply as to preclude metering, or else perfect storage to the point where all the “free” energy that is wasted in the form of heat, wind, sunlight, etc., can be captured and held until it is needed on the grid.The ways to accomplish this might include cold fusion or some sort of battery tech that is as far advanced from what we have today as a lithium battery is to a Leyden Jar. Once we make non-polluting power generation a reality, so much more becomes available.Of course, the above is only true if they can never perfect my first love, the ability to ECONOMICALLY negate gravity on a local basis. THAT would be the game changer of all time. It is easy enough to defeat gravity if we are willing/able to throw unlimited energy at the problem. What I want is the ability to fly, so to speak, either a few feet or to the stars. Right now, it just costs too much to lift any meaningful amount of mass above the Earth. By meaningful, I mean enough to build starships or to make Moon and Mars colonies a reality. We just cannot afford to use the whole GDP of the Earth for many years to accomplish this… Cheers!!!",78 followers,Rajan Singh,1.5K,360,25.2M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Who-do-you-see-as-an-upcoming-speaker-blending-the-best-of-education-and-educational-technology-in-their-presentations

We become its proponent and wake up only when the game is over.I will end with a quote from a Yahoo engineer I was talking to in 2006 - 'Gmail has only 5 million users, we (Yahoo Mail) have 30 million. Older people will never switch to Gmail.'Note: It is not my case that you can’t have a point of view on the future of technology. But remember that it is a hypothesis.

5,"Transfer learning in ML models.Humans are really good at generalizing. We only have to see a few dogs before we can recognize a dog when we see one.Machines are not. ML models require millions of examples before forming a reliable classifier, and that classifier is very specific to the data on which it was trained. If your training data doesn't include dogs with three legs, the model won't recognize them.

It's hypothesized that the reason humans learn so quickly is that we are fitting new examples into our existing knowledge rather than forming entirely new categories. If we could teach machines to do the same, they would learn exponentially faster and apply that learning more effectively.Transfer learning is a very hot topic in AI research right now, so I expect major breakthroughs in the next few years. I think this may be sufficient to achieve artificial general intelligence, but even if not, it will dramatically extend the range of tasks that machines can accomplish.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Will-mainframe-technology-grow-up-in-the-upcoming-years

I want your imagination to jog with me too. So, clear your mind. Here we go:It's the year 2040Scientists atBy making nanometre thick slices of the cortex and then painstakingly studying them using microscopes.Entirely new branches of medicine and technology open up. This feat is akin to the Human Genome Project but at a far more grander scale. It has huge implications in unlocking the mysteries of the most complex and elusive object in the universe. The blob of fatty tissue and water in your skull. The human brain.We can now use targeted drug delivery systems to correct the exact neuornal disarray which may be responsible for disorders like Schizophrenia, Bipolar disorder, etc. We can treat personality and psychiatric disorders as efficiently and as accurately as we treat broken bones and infections. No more just behavioural therapies and counselling. We have found the solution to eradicate the problem from it's very roots.It's the year 2062Scientists and Neural engineers atYear 2080People can now attach anWhat about skills like hardwork, loyalty, determination? Won't these non cognitive skills be lost in a world where everything has become downloadable. Not necessarily. People can now download positive emotion module softwares consisting of compassion, empathy, etc. They can delete negative emotions, which are generally axonal neural patterns stored in the cerebral cortex and amygdala and purge them.One of the ways we can defeat the rising fear of a future advanced AI with malevolent intentions to decimate the human race and sterilize the planet is to merge with technology and become cyborgs. If we advance ourselves why would one even need an AI?The Year 2094The cyborg brain technology has magnified research and development by massive amounts. Nanotechnology research in particular has grown by leaps and bounds. Nanites have been invented which can be injected into the blood stream to give out real time readings of the human body. Cancer cells can be detected and tracked to the first cell that had the error in the genetic algorithm and the nanite can just rewrite the gene and inactivate the oncogeneThe year 2115Scientists have successfully used quantum processors and neural circuits to simulate a complete working human brain.The year 2197Nanites are used to effectively upload the human consciousness into computers. Humans now live on in computers.The year 2244We have reachedThe year 2389Nanites can be used to terraform other planet using raw material from the planet. Nanites also have the ability to build synthetic bodies into which our consciousness can again be downloaded. In case, we need to interact with our surroundings physically.Any primitive species in other extrasolar world will surely view us as Gods who can create and destroy worlds with consciousness that doesn't depend on a physical body but exists as an ethereal stream of codes in a body made of nanites.So yeah, I think the technology which will change the course of humanity forever will be along the lines of Neural engineering, Computer brain interfacing and Nanotechnology.I don't know if our future will have the same course but I hope it does. :)Limitless potentials.Edit:Sources and further readingImage Sources:","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-advanced-technologies-that-will-occupy-human-place-in-the-upcoming-future-Do-you-really-agree-with-it-or-not
