China builds the fastest computer in the world.China has a strong nuclear program.China has the longest high-speed rail system in the world. The design and development of the system is indigenous to China.China is the world leader in quantum communication.

2,"In the last several weeks there have been peaceful mass protests on the streets and squares of Belorus against President Alexander Lukashenko.A large number of security forces have been deployed. And they have not been so peaceful. They have been beating up demonstrators, shooting at them with tear gas, pulling people out of crowds, hauling into vans and taking them away to jail.With their faces covered with masks, members of the security forces have done their best to remain incognito. Belarus is a small country, and a person you are dragging across the street might be your neighbour.And thenIn the last several weeks there have been peaceful mass protests on the streets and squares of Belorus against President Alexander Lukashenko.A large number of security forces have been deployed.

Belarus is a small country, and a person you are dragging across the street might be your neighbour.And then Artificial Intelligence came to help demonstrators. A group of Belarusian programmers said they have created a computer program that can recognize faces of the security forces even when they are wearing masks.The programmers made a special video showing how this technology works.“You will pay for your illegal actions, no matter how many socks you wrap around your head,” said the author of the video, Andrei Maksimov. “This is your last chance to quit,” he warned.The video has already received over half a million views on YouTube.According to various sources, the level of the program’s correct face recognition is between 70% and 90%.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-recent-advanced-technologies-developed-in-face-recognition
3,"Recognition by the industry that it requires certification to operate facial recognition software, due to the fact that large numbers of every day people have what I’m unofficially naming Racial Blindness. Racial Blindness is the inability to distinguish between near age siblings and/or people of similar appearance of an ethnicity other than your own.If a person cannot tell the difference between two near age people, that’s a huge problem. That inability grows exponentially when that same person is presented with near age siblings from an ethnicity not their own.

That inability grows exponentially when that same person is presented with near age siblings from an ethnicity not their own. If such a person were a police officer or some other security/safety professional and they cannot distinguish between individuals in a facial recognition system they are operating, that person should not be operating the software.This should be common sense, but the subtle nuance of a human’s quality of recognition of others has never really been scientifically measured, nor has it needed to be, until now.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-recent-advanced-technologies-developed-in-face-recognition
4,"Transfer learning in ML models.Humans are really good at generalizing. We only have to see a few dogs before we can recognize a dog when we see one.Machines are not. ML models require millions of examples before forming a reliable classifier, and that classifier is very specific to the data on which it was trained. If your training data doesn't include dogs with three legs, the model won't recognize them. A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one.

A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one. It's hypothesized that the reason humans learn so quickly is that we are fitting new examples into our existing knowledge rather than forming entirely new categories. If we could teach machines to do the same, they would learn exponentially faster and apply that learning more effectively.Transfer learning is a very hot topic in AI research right now, so I expect major breakthroughs in the next few years. I think this may be sufficient to achieve artificial general intelligence, but even if not, it will dramatically extend the range of tasks that machines can accomplish.","246,851 followers",Dushka Zapata,787,8.5K,232.4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-recent-advanced-technologies-developed-in-face-recognition
