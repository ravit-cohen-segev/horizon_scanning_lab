If humans create machines capable of replacing most jobs, a lot of people will end up out of work.Yet history has shown that employment is not a zero sum game. Technology can displace a massive number of workers while simultaneously producing new opportunities.Consider that just under 200 years agoThe Value of EfficiencyThis is a good thing, not because displacing workers is favorable, but because making any process more efficient is a win for society. It is this reason why you can walk into a grocery market with a few bucks in hand and find more than enough options to feed yourself for the day.But we forget, because we're not after mere nourishment ~ that's beneath most of us. We buy items based on flavor, and thus, a few bucks doesn't cut it.Yet consider what it would take for you to produce some of the meals you regularly eat on a farm of your own. How many hours (more likely days) would it take for you to produce even a crappy version of eggs, bacon, toast, and orange juice.Make no mistake, technologyWhy? Because technology makes things more efficient, and that efficiency vastly improves the average quality of life for everyone, even those that lose jobs in the short term.So what if its different this time?As the saying goes, past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. What if technology really does eliminate the need for enough jobs for everyone. Suppose we're all fighting for a much smaller portion of working hours. What then?Perhaps we're not asking the right questions.If you knew that you'd earn a little less money in the future, but you'd only have to work 50% as much, would that necessarily be so problematic?Stretch it out a little further. If you knew that you could maintain close to the same quality of life while having to work only 1 hour a week instead of 40, wouldn't you jump at the chance?Maybe the right question should be what we're aiming for as a society.Why is employment even the goal?The folly is trying to measure everything by a static definition of what is ""good"". If your income dropped 10% but everything you buy gets 20% cheaper, this is a good thing - butUntil the early 1900s, the 8 hour workday was not the norm. The average workers put in 12-14 hours/day to make ends meet, and often worked 6 or 7 days of the week.You're asked to do a lot less today just to be average, but you don't compare yourself to people in history, you compare to those around you, so these benefits go completely unseen.ObjectivesOur standards change with the technology we build. Why is working an 8 hour/day job so vital?We're so obsessed with trying to ensure that everyone can find employment that maybe we're shortchanging ourselves. What's really important in the big picture?Perhaps its time. We want as much time as possible to do the things we love doing.Maybe we should be aiming to maintain the same quality of life by having everyone work 4 hours a day, or even less. That seems to be a much better goal than ensuring everyone is working 40 hours a week.But that would require embracing technology in lieu of the possibly of job losses, something not everyone is ready to do.For related reading:","135,539 followers",Hector Quintanilla,3.1K,1.2K,88.6M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-feel-bad-if-you-develop-a-new-technological-product-that-can-replace-existing-jobs-of-related-skills

Personally, I don't believe that the problem is about how representative our votes are, but about how good they are. There are many examples of unpopular justifiable measures, like taxes and minority rights, for instance. But that's why I mentioned economists. They have better understanding of some issues, as I have better understanding of other issues. And if they who truly knows more than me about that particular subject think that we should pay some more taxes, I may get angry, but the best chances are that they are right.The strange thing in democracy is that we (who are all big fat ignorants in most important topics) elect some people that are dumber than ourselves to vote on subjects that even we cannot fully understand!

5,"The drum scanner.This is a piece of equipment used by high-end printing plants and service bureaus to convert photos into computer files. You taped your images onto the drum. When you did the scan, the drum spins while a lens travels down the length of the image feeding data into your computer.The drum scanner beats the hell out of a digital camera in resolving highlight data. A proper printed highlight is supposed to have some color in it - my standard is 7 percent cyan, 4 percent magenta, 4 percent yellow and no black.

6,"A while ago, when we were exhibiting the Mitra robot at an event, a doctor walked up to me and broached on this subject. He was quite strong in the view that we are killing jobs of receptionists, security personnel and so on.I told him politely that doctors like him have put most shamans, black magic healers and village medical practioners out of business. Is that not wrong? To make it worse, their science has removed many diseases and make it hard for other doctors to get business. Dammit you scientific people - destroyer of jobs!And the mother of all job killers in humanity was agriculture.A while ago, when we were exhibiting the Mitra robot at an event, a doctor walked up to me and broached on this subject.

Is that not wrong? To make it worse, their science has removed many diseases and make it hard for other doctors to get business. Dammit you scientific people - destroyer of jobs!And the mother of all job killers in humanity was agriculture. General purpose AI and singularity would not even come near the “chaos” that agriculture created. Until 12000 years ago, ourThen these random dudes and dudettes come with their mastery of wild seeds. And before long, food production became a much easy thing. A single farmer in a few acres of land could produce more food than dozens of hunters attacking many square miles of forest. This gave rise to the “Instead of foraging and hunting, most people got involved in other things - like pottery, painting, urban planning, building homes & drainages, administration, mining, jewellery, accounting, medicine…A few thousand years later, another bunch of dudes would start harnessing the power of steam and create “nasty” things like locomotion. Rather than beating our horses to get to the next village, we would get to the other end of the continent reading newspapers. We moved around, explored things. Rather than using little children for many jobs such as chimney sweeping we kept finding better methods. Eventually the horse carriage workers and others moved on to other things.We often confuse general purpose AI with robotics.Let’s assume the worst case and we have a general purpose AI - that can do everything a human can. What would happen?It would be only as bad as agriculture - that destroyed most of what we did everyday. We could be doing things like sports. In most video games, bots are way better than humans. Does it mean we are less likely to play with other humans? In fact, we would play more with other humans just because the bots are better than us.We would do art, psychiatry and so many more human fields that we have not even created. Just like people could not imagine separate professions like art before the invention of agriculture, we have a problem with imagination.And we would spend more time with our children - who often grow alone with their TVs and more time with our parents - who often rot away alone.But, this is assuming there is a general purpose AI. Robotics is not the same as general purpose AI.Oh, what about movies like The Matrix and Terminator. Oh, you guys are now giving us Hollywood? If you believe in those weird movies, do you also believe in other dystopian movies like “I’m a legend”? In the latter movie, a germ gets out and wipes out most of humanity. Does it mean we have to close down the pharma and medicine industry?Hollywood can paint a dystopian picture from anything possible. They have even made something as harmless as vacuum cleaners into dangerous things. Should we stop doing all of them?In fact, anything useful can be made dangerous - think fire, water, air, cars, electricity, trains, medicines, petrol, sugar - any of them can kill you very easily.Anything that cannot kill you, is not of much use to you.Robotics, like any major revolution, can indeed cause chaos in the society. No different from agricultural revolution or industrial revolution. There will be displacement. People said the same for computing too. Could the people who were worried about computers doing spreadsheets in 1970s have thought about the whole new industries created by computing 40 years later?But, there are a whole set of important things that are not effectively today and we need robots there. Let me give you some examples of these:It need not always be life threatening. You walk into most stores now, and it hard to find anyone to assist you. The robots could walk with you, understand your requirements, help you shop and get things on your vehicle. It could play football with your children and take them off TV.I could give you 100s of such examples and that is the future. But, to get there we have to have more simpler robots doing more mundane things. A baby has to go through the toddler stage before becoming an adult.40 years ago, your parents would not have imagined what you do with computers. They could not have thought of the kind of revolutionary applications that we take for granted.A new revolution is beckoning us.
