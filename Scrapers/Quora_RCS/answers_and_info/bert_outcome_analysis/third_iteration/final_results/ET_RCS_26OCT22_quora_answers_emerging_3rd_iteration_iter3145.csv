0,"Under very specific circumstances, as long as it is done correctly. For example, blowing up bridges and other types of infrastructure still slows down militaries. Not by a lot, but if you’re losing, every bit helps. Long bridges can be replaced by barges, which are vulnerable to sinking and take time to deploy. Short bridges are also overcome by bridging vehicles, which also take time to deploy.Another example is during the gulf war, when mining the oil fields and setting them on fire was a tactic used by Iraq.

It cost them a shit tonne in reparations later, but during the war it almost slowed the Coalition forces. In an interview with Collin Powell, commanders thought it was impassable, so the plan was to rapidly surround them from the sides. But as Powell said, “marines being marines” found a way through it somehow and “military doctrine dictates you exploit an advantage like that”. They crushed the Iraqis which was inevitable, butEdit (21/10/21):Side note:Doing it better with modern technology, especially those banned under International Law like plastic mines, would make this scorched earth policy effective if a commander is vigilant of the possibility that it may not work.As for what it won’t do, it absolutely won’t “starve” the enemy like WW2. Modern militaries won’t live off the land or take food from the civilians, inciting them to become insurgents to fight. Food will be flown in. They also won’t need shelter, they’ll be building forward operating bases anyways. This goes for communications or any other vital resources/infrastructure except potentially for water and fuel, but even that will have a negligible effect. It’s just going to be flown or tanked over. Also, an ‘occupier’ that is super nice to the locals after you just took everything away will win them support.",469 followers,Daniel Cohort,11.9K,377,1.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-if-I-used-advanced-technology-to-build-a-heavily-defended-nation-in-the-Pacific-without-informing-any-government-or-authority

Head to head it will beat any Trireme in battle without any difficulty.Even a pillow can be improvised into a lethal weapon.If humanity attempted to conquer an alien race of that level of advancement, I strongly suspect that within a week our entire invasion force will find itself suddenly incapacitated by a strange new completely incurable epidemic disease, or something like that.","68,778 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-if-I-used-advanced-technology-to-build-a-heavily-defended-nation-in-the-Pacific-without-informing-any-government-or-authority
2,"So, here is the thing.If they just stuck in an anonymous warehouse in the desert and left it there, probably a long time. You’d likely let a whistle blower or information leakThe issue is that if you have advanced alien tech, you are probably going to want to use it rather then put it in an anonymous warehouse in the desert.So, to answer your question, they could keep it secret up until the point ISIS are disintegrated with quantum death rays shot from a flying saucer.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-if-I-used-advanced-technology-to-build-a-heavily-defended-nation-in-the-Pacific-without-informing-any-government-or-authority

5,"I always thought there should have been more Andorians in Starfleet. I really can't recall any at all. We see tons of Vulcans serving on ships in TNG, DS9, and VOY, but no Andorians. Andorians like the Vulcans were one of the founding races of the Federation. They are a formidable species on par with the Vulcans. We never even really saw them until the last two seasons of ENT when we finally got to see their homeworld.

9,"You don’t advance technology as a monolith.

Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party. Because radiation from nuclear accidents is apparently scarier than way more people dying of regular pollution constantly and the total annihilation of all life on Earth as the oceans boil away.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-if-I-used-advanced-technology-to-build-a-heavily-defended-nation-in-the-Pacific-without-informing-any-government-or-authority
