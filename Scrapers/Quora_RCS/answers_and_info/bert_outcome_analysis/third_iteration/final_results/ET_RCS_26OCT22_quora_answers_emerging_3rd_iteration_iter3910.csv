But it may continue to live on as a niche technology for specific purposes.Funny enough, when Hadoop popularity was at an all time high, sometime circa 2016 I posted a humorous take on the google searches for Hadoop and predicted it would die around October 2018. That month was the date that Cloudera and Horton announced their merger. That was for me the bonafide sign that Hadoop commercial market was no longer sustainable.Data sometimes is scary that way.Hadoop is dead.

2,"""Big data"" is literally just a lot of data. While it's more of a marketing term than anything, the implication is usually that you have so much data that you can't analyze all of the data at once because the amount of memory (RAM) it would take to hold the data in memory to process and analyze it is greater than the amount of available memory.This means that analyses usually have to be done on random segments of data, which allows models to be built to compare against other parts of the data.To break that down in simple words, let's say that Facebook wants to know which ads work best for peopl""Big data"" is literally just a lot of data.

Let's say there are 200,000,000 Facebook users with college degrees, and they have been each served 100 ads. That's 20,000,000,000 events of interest, and each ""event"" (an ad being served) contains several data points (features) about the ad: what was the adYour goal is to figure out how which features are most effective in getting college grads to click ads. Maybe your first-pass model on a random sample of 1,000,000 users finds that ads with people in them that are 200x200 pixels big and about food get the most clicks. Now you have a ""prediction model"" for what college grads want, and you can then test that to see how well your prediction (based on the 1,000,000 college grads) holds up when you compare it to the other 199,000,000 college grads.Now, for what it can do in ""daily life"", well, pretty much any company with a significant tech group (Google, Twitter, Facebook, any bank or financial institution, any communications and mobile service, energy, etc.) are doing this kind of thing. To serve ads, to improve their services, to predict future growth and demand needs, whatever.But what about other uses?Google famously showed that they could predict flu outbreaks based upon when and where people were searching for flu-related terms [1]:There's the famous story about how Target's algorithms discovered a girl was pregnant [2].Researchers are using Facebook statuses to look at how gender and age is affecting language use [3]:Doctors can look at what patients are writing about in online disease forums to try and get an idea of how off-label drug use affects certain diseases [4].We can look at the evolution of language [5]:or the suppression of ideas [5]:or the suppression of ideas [5]:We can look at how people move based on their cell phone use [6]:How money physically moves [7]:How money physically moves [7]:Or, like my work withThese are only the tip of the iceberg. 90% of the world's digital data was created in the last two years [9] so we're just starting to figure out the possibilities.

3,"During the mid 32nd Millennium the Imperium became complacent in patrolling what was considered it's territory. After the destruction of the Horus Heresy, The traitor Legions were thought to be a greater threat than any other faction and the Eye of Terror was the focus of much of the Imperium's millitary might. Rebuilding rather than colonisation had taken many centuries so conquered worlds that should have been developed, remained undeveloped and forgotten.This neglect allowed a new and powerful Ork empire to rise around Ullanor, previous seat of power of Urrlak Urrak and thought to be secureDuring the mid 32nd Millennium the Imperium became complacent in patrolling what was considered it's territory.

Rebuilding rather than colonisation had taken many centuries so conquered worlds that should have been developed, remained undeveloped and forgotten.This neglect allowed a new and powerful Ork empire to rise around Ullanor, previous seat of power of Urrlak Urrak and thought to be secure after the Ullanor Crusade.These Orks had over a thousand years to fight amongst each other, getting stronger and expanding until one ‘Prime Ork’ united the empire by securing alliances with five other massive but intelligent Prime Orks. Each one corresponded to the major Ork Tribes seen in the 41st Millennium. The Beast of Beasts seems to have been of the Goff Clan but was as cunning as it was brutal.The Galaxy wide WAAAGH! was heralded by a number of planeroid sized craft appearing in orbit of planets throughout the Imperium inflicting devastating tidal forces to these worlds.The Attack Moons as they came to be called were agglomerations of rock and metal, most often resembling a great Ork skull. Capable of altering it's surface by the shifting of metal plates the size of mountains and even opening it's massive ‘jaw’ to release swarms of Ork warships.They were armed with gravity weapons that could swat aside squadrons of eacort ships or even crushing capitol ships in a single strike. Once the system was subdued, these weapons would tear the planet apart, pulling chunks to the moon to feed the Ork war machine. The shields the Attack Moons possessed made them invulnerable to most attacks and even caused Imperial Void shields to detonate on contact.But these were not the greatest technological achievements the Orks were capable of. The Moons themselves were not conventional starships, they were actually the end point of subspace corridors the Orks dubbed “Waagh! Gates”. With this technology, Orks could instantaneously travel anywhere in the galaxy, attacking with little warning other than a brief gravitational anomaly just before the moon appears.The Orks were finally defeated at a terrible cost before they could apply this subspace technology to the their homeworld Ullanor, which they were to use against Terra itself.",0 followers,Christopher Bowers,1.1K,1.2K,5.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-technology-is-in-peak-now-apart-from-big-data-and-Hadoop

An Ork warboss the size of an Imperial Knight with the intelligence of an Archmagos and the tactical skill of a Primarch. Plus there was the small fact that there was not one beast nor two but rather six of these monsters.This fearsome foe managed to unite much of the Ork race under their banner and with so much WAAAGH energy in one place, Da Boyz started to become stronger, smarter and more united than ever before seen in all of recorded history.This WAAAGH birthed some terrifying examples of Orky might such as Orkz that could speak fluent high Gothic, Warbosses that could plan entire campaigns without devolving into internecine fighting and even Ork ambassadors.But the most fearsome weapon created by these Orkz was the Attack Moon.Yeah, that's pretty much what it sounds like, Da boyz turned several moons into gargantuan weapons platforms/barracks.These Attack Moons travelled through an entirely new form of FTL technology by utilising subspace corridors which allowed them to bypass the Warp entirely and appear at their destination near instantaneously.During the War of the Beast, Attack moons would simply pop up out of seemingly nowhere. Normally they would arrive impossibly close to a planet causing immense seismic disturbances and then just let their Gravitic whips tear the world apart. That's right, Da Orkz had technology that even the greatest minds of mankind could not even begin to fathom.An it waz proppa funny watchin’ dem stoopid ummies try an’ figure out ‘ow we waz doin awl o’ dis.But the Attack Moon was not solely a weapon. It also acted as a gravimetric anchor point enabling other Ork vessels to travel to the afflicted world instantly. So the arrival of one of these bad boys in your system was just the beginning of your problems for they were just the precursor for a much larger wave of the Ork armada.And here is the truly terrifying (AN DAT WULD ‘AVE BEEN A GUD OL’ TIME FER EVERYONE IF DEM UMMIEZ DIDNA MUCK EVERYFING UP!

5,"Ork technology is a bit like a Bethesda game. It “just works” for the Orks but not really for anyone else. This is due to the Ork’s unique psychic natures. Ork equipment works because enough OrksThe result is that while Orks will heavily scavenge any wreckage remaining on a battlefield, I am not fully confident in saying they are scavenging the technology itself. The engineering that created that Leman Russ tank is irrelevant to the Mekboy. Rather, it is the idea - the shape and the image - of the tank that matters.

The engineering that created that Leman Russ tank is irrelevant to the Mekboy. Rather, it is the idea - the shape and the image - of the tank that matters. He doesn’t need to understand the engineering that created the tank. He’s just using the impression (what the tank looks like it should do) to create what it does do.If the Imperium ever manages to recover the tank, they may find that, while it has a new “Orky” engine in place of the original damaged Imperial engine, the new engine shouldn’t have the power to move the tank at all - let alone at the faster speed that the “Ork” tank achieves simply by being painted red.In other words, the Orks are happy to turn Imperial, Eldar, Necron, Tau, etc. technology into the raw material to make their various stubbers, meks, armor, and whatnot but, it isn’t really accurate to say that they are using the actual technology.Even the raw material probably isn’t important. For example, Imperial armor plating resists as much damage as it does because of the metallurgy used in its construction and composition.While the armor on an Ork ship resists damage mostly because itIn a sense, everything the Orks make is “Ork” technology because it doesn’t work the way it does for anyone else. If an Eldar picks up an Imperial Lasgun and fires it - the lasgun performs just like it would if a guardsman fired it. But if an Ork picks it up and fires it - it could fire rainbows if enough Orks are convinced it shoots rainbows. When a Mekboy welds a bunch of metal bits to the same lasgun to make it do more damage - it will do more damage even though a few metal bits welded to the exterior shouldn’t do anything of the sort.

6,"There is no indication that they ever were. In fact, all the lore we have so far instead increasingly imply that they are an incredibly dangerous, eldritch, extragalactic forceFirstly, the Tyranids 5th edition codex explicitly stated that they have already consumed 12 galaxies worth of biomass already. And depending on whether you consider Ian Watson’s 1993 novel of Space Marine canon, it is entirely likely that at least several of the galaxies that the Tyranids consumed had interstellar civilizations capable of putting up a united offensive against the Hive Mind.

And depending on whether you consider Ian Watson’s 1993 novel of Space Marine canon, it is entirely likely that at least several of the galaxies that the Tyranids consumed had interstellar civilizations capable of putting up a united offensive against the Hive Mind. The current Hive Mind we know of would automatically have all of the genetics from those past galaxies incorporated in its genome. So unless the DaOT humans had access to all those bygone genetic lineages, it is highly impossible for them to create the Tyranids. In fact, Xenology corroborates this claim by stating how Genetors who analyzed the the genetics of various Tyranoforms they collected samples of found how each Tyranid is comprised of a mess of genes unfound in the current galaxyFurthermore, the overloading of the Pharos warp beacon during the Horus Heresy alerted the Hive Mind that was living in the intergalactic void. If you read the Pharos novel, you would see that the Hive Mind was stated to have been slumbering for at least aeons. Therefore, it is chronologically improbably for DaOT mankind to have made the Tyranids. This is also corroborated by the fact that the Silent King in his 65 million years journey into the void personally witnessed the Tyranids consuming a galaxy.I hope this makes sense",16 followers,Gary Zhang,1.1K,538,15.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-greatest-ork-technology-ever-produced-at-the-peak-of-their-biggest-WAAAGH
