1,"As far as evolution in tech is concerned.. I think most of our world is some how revolving around mobile phones, laptops and other such gadgets we use daily. And since we try to make most of our work from them.. always make sure your phone and all the apps are up to date since every day is a new day and every day new things are discovered, added, modified or replaced in our gadgets.With that said, also always take a moment to appreciate what the developers have made for you and if you dislike something about anything, just let them know so that they know you care about the right things and theAs far as evolution in tech is concerned..

Technology is advancing very rapidly.My grandfather would have grown up in a world very similar to that of his grandfather, but in just my lifetime, there has been enormous change. When I was a student in the 1970’s, I lived in a house with no central heating, one telephone wired into the wall, and a black and white television with two channels. My Dad had a car, but it was technically not much different to the car he would have had twenty years earlier.

For example, a middle aged man thinks, good and stable salary, marriage, building home, are the major achievement in their life.But many youngster gets good salary (at young age), and they don’t want to commit anything of such kind. They want to live freely without commitment. This shift in thinking happens because, information technology brought pros and cons of commitment. Part of youngster lives, they are living in cyber world, and they are able to imagine, how their life will be, if they bring commitment in life!This thinking becomes the game changer. People projected themselves in social media as more successful in their life, but really it is not! Success measured by showing, their status in their social media and what they have? Indirectly, it only advertise ones money power, and ultimately, making money in life, is the only requirement of every youngster. in life, inA smartphone and internet has many advantages, but many of us are using it for audio, video streaming, chat, posting and gaming purpose.

4,"No, the technology isn’t the problem. The issue is the system which exploits the technology - Capitalism. Look at the internet BEFORE the social-media giants: it was a thriving world of peer-to-peer sharing, fun stupid flash games, and forums to talk about this and that. People often had their own blogs, and would often have a link to this blog in their signature on the forums they used (or would just share it). There wasn’t serious concern about “Big Brother” watching you either.Now, after the Facebook usurpation (along with the other wolves of FAANG), everyone is locked into these digital prNo, the technology isn’t the problem.

It doesn’t need to be this way… it’s just the most profitable, and because profit trumps all in Capitalism, here we are. In a hyper-isolated world where your phone and everything you do spies on you.We can move past this. Such would require allowing the use of the various protocols (ie what makes Twitter run the way it does (the retweeting, sharing, limit to X amount of characters, etc.)) in different platforms - in other words, being able to use Twitter from whatever App you chose, not just Twitter’s official app.Second, building on that, are interoperable protocols, such asTechnology can be used for good or evil.

5,"That OP is a technophobic trope and I should really report it as insincere. However, I will assume it is a genuine question rather than someone promoting fear of technology.Recall when we were in lockdown, how did you keep in touch with friends and family who did not live near you? I used Zoom, WhatsApp and Google Hangouts. OK, I would have preferred to have seen them face to face but technology gave us the next best. So rather than isolating people, it allowed us to connect!","220,628 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,783M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-latest-evolving-technology-that-we-should-be-updated-with
6,"I do it for 2 reasons:I do it for 2 reasons:I also don’t like people very much. I suppose I’ve become a misanthrope after isolating myself for so many years, but I wasn’t very fond of people before that, either. As soon as you have more than one person in a room, you have the foundation for conflict. And whereas I’m not the kind of person to tell others what they should or shouldn’t do, most people seem VERY keen on telling others how they should live their lives. So rather than spending endless hours justifying why I’d rather keep my own company, I just keep my own company and leave the rest of you to live out your domestic dramas on your own.",366 followers,Brett Alder,1.1K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-latest-evolving-technology-that-we-should-be-updated-with

8,"You'll need to define ""meaningful technology."" It would seem to me that meaningful technology predates Homo sapiens sapiens. Our not-quite-human ancestors were already using fire, something no other species (well, genus anyway) has ever done, and we were making unprecedented use of stone tools.

9,"Yes. That started with the discovery of fire and the technology of cooking. Cooking releases more nutrients from food, enabling larger, more nutrient-hungry brains.
