1,"Well, I worked for a company that was the first in the UK to bring 3d printers into High Street shops.We’d had rapid prototyping machines since the 1990s. They were big and expensive to buy, run, feed, and mantain. The things we were doing started with the Velleman kits that you could build yourself and went up to the £1,000 things that would just plug ’n’ go (well, you had to install drivers and software).People thought it was going to be like Star Trek replicators.

Then they discovered how hard it is to do 3d modelling on a computer, especially when the shapes are organic rather than mechanical.Because in reality 3d modelling is the modern-day counterpart of the old pattern-maker’s job. Pattern-makers used to be the most highly-skilled people in the foundry because they worked in all sorts of materials to make the original patterns for casts. It wasn’t easy.Did you know that you can’t have right angles when you’re casting or injecting plastics? If you do, you end up getting a different cooling rate and the cast or injection will come out wonky at the edges and it might even fracture very easily. You have to introduce radii. You didn’t? Neither did a lot of people doing additive on their new machines, either. Neither did they appreciate that delicate bits might need a support in the manufacturing process that you’d have to fettle off afterwards. And certainly they didn’t take into account the properties of ABS and PLA. Saw some grand fails because of that.And that’s before we actually get to the software. have you ever done any 3d modelling? Bugger me, it’s hard when you’re doing mechanical things. If you want to create something like this:you get yourself on an art course for the next three or four years because look at all those bastard polygons you’ve got to mush about to get the form. And I bet those back feet needed some support that needed fettling off, too.And that was the problem. People saw experts, who’d spent ages getting good at this, knocking stuff out and making it look easy. Because for them it was. And so they bought these machines and the software and as soon as that software opened they were faced with things like primitives, compounds, tapers, free-form deformations, parametric deformations, polygons, vertices, XYZ axes and all the rest of it and they hadn’t got a bloody clue how to do any of it. And precious little layman’s resource available to help them; most online tutorials assumed you knew the basics of CAM and CAD and started at too high a level for beginners.And so people shied away from it because it’s bloody hard. You need perseverance, patience, and above all a lot of time to get any good at it. Most people were lacking in at least one. Some in all three.I blame the EU.

This kind of idiocy is what happens when you let journalists talk about technology (especially if they’re talking to a lot of non-techy entrepreneur types trying to pump their startup). The reality is that 3D printing is a very technical process and requires a lot of operator knowledge and skill. It’s not “wave magic wand, get object” and it never will be. I have a 3D printer and use it loads. It’s brilliant. But here’s the thing: I’m a massive geek. I have a degree in engineering. For me, putting in the time and effort to learn how to use it properly is fun and fairly easy. Most people are not me, and don’t want to deal with the kind of faff it takes to produce good prints. The resin it uses is nasty, sticky and pretty toxic. I don’t let my kids near it.3D printing / AM has already been pretty revolutionary in some fields. Probably at least as revolutionary as other new manufacturing techniques developed relatively recently such as CNC, CAD and even welding.","3,716 followers",Andy Duffell,5.1K,6.2K,26.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-emerging-technologies-that-are-coming-up-now-like-3D-printing

Then, if you still decide to do so, learn and learn as it is to be emphasized enough. The advantage to an engineer learning AI or IoT, or robotics is that they will already have the skills and technical knowledge required in these fields.Looking from a career perspective, it will be a great decision since, in the coming years, these technologies may impact certain jobs that will make them useless. So deciding to switch to them now can be one of the wisest decisions. According to surveys and reports, many hiring managers, while looking for AI or robotics professionals, choose engineers.Since they possess solid professional knowledge, soft skills, strong programming skills, emotional intelligence, and the capacity to monitor, anticipate, and embrace change quickly. Lastly, do what you want to do, not what everybody does. Create your path and choose according to your individual personal and professional goals.","9,885 followers",Kenzi Mudge,1.8K,1.3K,8.3M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Regarding-the-Google-Glass-controversy-is-there-an-emerging-science-technology-philosophy-addressing-its-introduction-as-a-societal-norm
