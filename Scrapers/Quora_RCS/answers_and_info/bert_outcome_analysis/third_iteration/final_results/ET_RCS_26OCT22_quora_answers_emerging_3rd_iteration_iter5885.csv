1,"For the start, let's first define Big data and opportunities in it.Big data are extremely large data sets. These are 'just data' collected via multiple channels from social media, mass and media to even capturing real time effects of tv ads on consumers. (I can take up how are these data collected and sources later).So its not about fields other than Big data, but opportunities and fields leveraging Big data:For the start, let's first define Big data and opportunities in it.Big data are extremely large data sets.

Its us. Every product we buy on Amazon, every Google search, every photo we like on Instagram, every information we share on Facebook. It is being used by every company and they get back to us. Data data everywhere.These are few to mention in the world where things are moving towards interdisciplinary perspective, where we learn from one field and apply to other. It's interesting how things are changing.Other than these using Big data, i feel other emerging fields are:Feel free to comment and suggest.Thanks for reading. Let me know if your thoughts.

Basically people saying “I have one and it’s fine” and “I refuse to believe I bought garbage”.Fact isThis simple bar graph doesn’t reveal theAcer, for example, looks almost as bad but their failures tend to be largely things like broken plastic hinge covers and key caps coming off, not cool, but the computer is still usable. Though they do seem to have a lot of motherboard failures as well.Now Dell, they look pretty middle of the road, but they are actually the best mix of price-performance-reliability-repairability.So if we start by dismissing every brand to the right of Dell as less reliable, I’ll explain why every brand to the left is disqualified as well.AppleSonyToshibaAsusDellSo Dell wins. Not because they are super fantastic, no one “builds them like they used to” but because literally everyone else is either worse, or double to triple the price for slightly better.I could go on and on with far more details and reasons for each of these points but I think you get the idea.",129 followers,Exedor Montag,1.9K,91,951.1K,2017,https://www.quora.com/Which-emerging-technology-has-better-prospect-for-managers-AWS-or-Big-Data
4,"By accident.I went to a college for the diplomats because my aunt said there was a good school across the street from her house.I went to law school because I immigrated into a rural area and there was no diplomatic prospects there. And my ex had mentioned that law would be a great profession. It was!I became an entrepreneur after my best friend had asked me to find her a job, but she didn’t speak English and didn’t drive. So, we’ve made a job for her.",107 followers,Ram Ghotekar,719,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/Which-emerging-technology-has-better-prospect-for-managers-AWS-or-Big-Data
5,"I can only speak for when I started in the year 2000 until I left less than a year ago. For me the benefit is what I learned while there. When I first got to Apple there was an excessive attention to detail for anything and everything. This included writing email, making meetings efficient and making sure visual presentations were very neat and used the proper Apple fonts. A lot of time was spent on this by everyone. When I left Apple there was not as much attention to this detail. I think this is because the Apple got bigger and less personal. And of course as you get bigger, the corporationI can only speak for when I started in the year 2000 until I left less than a year ago. For me the benefit is what I learned while there.

And of course as you get bigger, the corporation creates more distractions. There is still attention to detail in product design and manufacturing. But corporate administrative communication deteriorated. One thing that never left my psyche is the obsessive attention to detail and craving for minimalism. It became part of my life then and still is in everthing I do.",326 followers,Anubhav Jain,660,4.4K,123.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-emerging-technology-has-better-prospect-for-managers-AWS-or-Big-Data
6,"Your first priority should be your career.At some point of our life we think loving a person is everything. But what if you gave 100% to your love & someday your love is gone due to some reasons.But if you give 100 % to build up your career rather than only focusing on love , then you can achieve a lot in your life.Your first priority should be your career.At some point of our life we think loving a person is everything. But what if you gave 100% to your love & someday your love is gone due to some reasons.But if you give 100 % to build up your career rather than only focusing on love , then you can achieve a lot in your life.If now you won't focus on your career, then the so called love of your life will also be not there.First focus on making your career, love will automatically come to you.If you want to give priority to love only, then love to build up your career & give priority to that.A small example,Just imagine you are suffering from a big disease. You need to be operated soon & before that you have to deposit huge amount of fees. At that moment of your life will “Love” be the solution to deposit your fees. NO….. all you need is “money” & from where that money will come from if you are unemployed. Then lying on the hospital bed you will realise, I wish I would have given priority to my career.I am not saying don't love. You should love. But love wisely so that it dont affect your future.Atlast, concluding here i ll say if you want your love to be with you forever then give priority to your career first.",28 followers,Shubham Tiwari,4.2K,666,2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/If-you-could-choose-between-working-at-Dell-as-a-Practice-Leader-for-a-very-cool-emerging-technology-or-working-at-Apple-to-improve-existing-technology-which-position-would-you-choose-and-why
