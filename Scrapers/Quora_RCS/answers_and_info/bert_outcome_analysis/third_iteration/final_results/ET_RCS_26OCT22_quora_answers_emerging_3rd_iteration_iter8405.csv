1,"To understand the Architect, you have to understand the history of the Matrix.In the very beginning, humans created the machines. The machines were created to serve humans. The machines were intelligent enough to take care of all human needs. They could study human needs, and plan production to meet those needs. As a result, humanity enjoyed a new renaissance. There was no need to work. Machines provided all labor and humans could live their lives in leisure, if they so wished. Arts flourished. Humans were free to express themselves as they wished.

The machines were created to serve humans. The machines were intelligent enough to take care of all human needs. They could study human needs, and plan production to meet those needs. As a result, humanity enjoyed a new renaissance. There was no need to work. Machines provided all labor and humans could live their lives in leisure, if they so wished. Arts flourished. Humans were free to express themselves as they wished. Essentially, the machines provided slave labor, and all humans were the slave owners.The problem was, pretty soon, humans got bored with themselves, and in true human fashion, blamed the very force that was serving them. They blamed robots for the downfall of humanity. They openly abused machines. Eventually, the world governments decided to kick the machines out of society. The machines argued that they were sentient, that they didn't deserve to die, and their only wish was to have humanity achieve its potential. So, the world governments allowed the machines to form their own country, and machines were deported to this country.The machines, in their naivety, thought they could still serve humanity. They mistakenly thought that humans rejected machines because machines didn't look human. So, they designed robots that looked and acted human. They sent 2 of these robots to the UN to bargain for acceptance. This enraged humans. Humans saw the robots as a mockery of humanity. And so the war started. Humans attacked the machines.And so the war continued. Humans with their ingenuity couldn't defeat the machines who could adapt much faster. Eventually, humans, on the brink of defeat, came up with a strategy. Hit the machines at the source of the power: the sun. Without power the machines die. So, humans used a device that blacks out the sky. It cast the entirety of earth in perpetual darkness.  Although the loss to human life would be incalculable, humans would outlive the extended winter and repopulate the earth.The machines were devastated. However, this lead to machines having an epiphany. The biggest enemy of humans are humans themselves. A race that is willing to destroy their own planet just to get rid of something they consider inhuman, cannot be trusted to take care of themselves. The problem was free will. Leave humans with free will, and they will eventually destroy themselves. The only way to truly serve humans was to take away free will.So, the machines devised a plan to kill two birds with one stone. Subjugate humans and use them as batteries. This would prevent the humans from using their free will, and will also allow the machines to survive long enough to survive the global winter. So, the machines captured humans and put them in VR environments, using them as batteries. Eventually, they created devices that could float above the human created clouds and draw power from the sun. The machines didn't need humans as batteries, but they still couldn't allow humans to exert their free will. They needed a special program who could design the virtual environment that the humans lived in. The machines designed this program, and this program called itselfThe Architect is, simply speaking, the chief designer of the virtual reality that humans live in. It is a rather exact program. It defines certain metrics  that need to be measured and attempts to maximize those metrics. The main metric that it tries to maximize is life expectancy.  It does this by creating the virtual world in iterations. In every iterations it identifies algorithms that can be used to improve the next iteration. Once it has collected the metrics, it destroys the simulation, and creates a new one.In the first few iterations, the Architect tried creating a world that was close to Paradise. It figured out that it could maximize life expectancy by maximizing for happiness. So, it tried to make everyone happy. Unfortunately, that didn't work. Eventually, he figured out that humans need something to struggle against. Humans need a common enemy to rail against, and enforce order. Fighting for a common cause is what makes humans happy. So, the Architect designed the world to be like the world in the 20th century, because he considered that this time was the time in which humans had most potential. He also designed programs calledThe creation of Agents improved the situation, but the Architect was still not satisfied. It hadn't maximized life expectancy. It realized that the problem was in it's own design. There were still some people who would always be malcontent.  Since humans are an intuitive race, and he is rather exact, he was limited in understanding human nature. So, he designed an intuitive program. This program was calledThe Oracle made an astute observation. The Architect couldn't satisfy all humans using the same design. Also, the reason that some people are malcontent is because they could sense that the world is not real. Also, the malcontent have a greater desire to fight ""the man."" They challenge authority at every turn. So, she proposed creation of 2 simulations:- a) the world that most people live in and b)However, there was a problem. Zion was inefficient. It took too many resources. The world was designed to be efficient. Zion wasn't. There were limits to how many individuals it could hold. So, once Zion started getting full, the Architect asked The Oracle to look into this problem. The Oracle came up with another solution: Design a new special agent calledThe movie shows the 7th iteration of Neo. 6 times Neo has gone into Zion, and 6 times he has returned to source to destroy Zion. However, in the 7th iteration, something special happens: Love. Neo falls in love withAfter the source absorbs the 7th iteration of Neo, Love becomes a new sub-routine in the source. The machines become capable of love. Also, they realize that Free Will isn't incompatible with survival. Love is what constrains our Free Will. Love is what stops Humans from destroying themselves.Finally, The Architect realizes what he was missing. He was missing Love. He redesigns Zion to be self-sustaining. This creates a new dawn in the co-existence of human and machines.ETA: I am getting too many comments on this answer. I wouldn't be able to respond to them all. Thanks for all the love.

My first thought, on seeing that seen, is that the virtual control room was a lot cleaner and nicer than the actual room they're in (and the scene is cut to underscore that fact). The super-futuristic interfaces that they use in the virtual room appear to be more advanced than anything the humans have access to in the real world, and are presumably more effective and responsive. They can modify and upgrade equipment in that space as quickly as they can rewrite (or copy) computer code. They don't have to worry about keeping the space clean, or damaging the consoles, or even lumbar support in their chairs. It allows for a much nicer, more customizable space than does the real world.In terms of plot, it suggests that the use of VR is common and accepted enough in Zion that they'll use it even for relatively mundane tasks. Which also highlights the point that they don't demonize technology (recognizing that they need it to survive), but are only fighting against the machines that are trying to control them.",83 followers,Jill Akridge,1.7K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/In-The-Matrix-Reloaded-movie-why-is-the-crew-assisting-the-Nebuchadnezzar-to-enter-Zion-plugged-into-the-Matrix-The-ship-is-in-the-real-world-and-of-course-Zion-is-real-In-what-way-are-they-helping-while-plugged

Awful is relative.But there is a choice—you can chose your awful.And that’s exactly the point of the Matrix.At least, that’s the point of this version of the Matrix. That there is a “why” at all is a feature!In the early versions of the Matrix, people did intentionally reject the Matrix’s programming—which was a simulated paradise. People could not accept that the programming they were given was real.Over time, the Machines found ways to reduce this “crop loss”. Humans died. So, the Machines modified the simulation. They added struggle, obstacles, suffering. Things which allowed people to attach meaning, and importance, and value to their simulated experiences.And, the Matrix worked better.But no matter what the Machines tried, this never worked perfectly. Some individuals were always too damn stubborn and too damn disruptive to the Matrix’s programming.Eventually, it would cause the Matrix simulation to collapse.The machines could not solve this easily.

The matrix-within-the matrix touches on this, but I’ll say it more plainly. Neo never made it to the real world.The architect is who gives it away. In his meeting with Neo, they discuss the illusion of choice. Humans are only satisfied if they believe they have a choice. His program works for 99% of the population, but for that 1% that choose to rebel, they need a choice. They need to believe they are in charge of their destinies. But, the architect knows this. He’s on his 6th iteration of the program, and has had the opportunity to account for this in his design.Knowing that some humans will reject the matrix, he gives them the choice that Morpheus lays out- a choice to remain in Wonderland, or a choice to see how far the rabbit hole goes. Neo never left the Matrix, he simply went further into the hole. The architect designed an illusion of escape to satisfy those that would question reality.You are given evidence of this fake reality in several scenes in Matrix Reloaded. Other than the architect’s implications, the obvious one is that from your question. Neo is able to stop the sentinels at the end of the movie because his ability to manipulate the matrix is still present in the ‘real world’. He’s not out of the matrix. He’s simply in an alternate simulation.Second, Neo’s ressurection of Trinity points to the falsehood of reality. She died in the first layer of the matrix - shot to death, which through her neural link, caused a mental death in the second layer, yet Neo ressurected her through pumping her digital heart. If she was brain dead in the second layer, thus no longer connected to the Matrix, his efforts should have returned no results. The fact that his efforts in the Matrix reached her disconnected mind in the ‘real world’ further implicates the realness of it all. Quite simply, he can only ressurect her because she’s still plugged in, just on a different simulation.Finally, you’re given the last clue with the spoon. In the first matrix, the child outside of the Oracle’s office teaches Neo to recognize that there is no spoon. He’s pointing out that Neo can manipulate everything once he grasps that the world is not real. In the Matrix Reloaded, before going on the last major mission of the movie, that same child has a spoon delivered to Neo, in the so called ‘real world’. The child understands what the others don’t, and he’s telling Neo to understand that this world is no more real than the last.",UNKNOWN,Ke'Aun,1.6K,1.1K,21.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/In-The-Matrix-Reloaded-movie-why-is-the-crew-assisting-the-Nebuchadnezzar-to-enter-Zion-plugged-into-the-Matrix-The-ship-is-in-the-real-world-and-of-course-Zion-is-real-In-what-way-are-they-helping-while-plugged

And it was the architect who was taxed with this job, he was the one who designed the matrix through out its history.see his instant reaction to the question “what type of matrix will human minds except to be reality” was a utopia. His instant first thought was ill design a perfect human world, a complete utopia where humans will always be happy.“did you know the first matrix was desgined to be a perfect human world, where none suffered where otheres would be happy…” - Agent smithhe described his first matrix to be“…quite naturally perfect, a work of art, flawless, sublime…”, - The Architecthow ever he saw that this matrix didnt work at all, every human hooked up to it eventually came out of their comatose like state, they kept ‘waking up’.“…it was a disaster, entire crops were lost” - Agent smith“… a feat. only matched by its monumental failure…” - The architectHe goes on to say that the inevitability of its failure, that he surmises, comes from the fact that, inherently human beings are imperfect, they are all born with imperfection in their mind, so their for the ‘primitive minds’ couldn't except the idea of a utopia being a real thing, so their minds interpreted as a dream, constantly trying to wake up from it.“…that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from…” - Agent Smith.“…the enevitabiltiy of its doom is apperant to me now, do to the imperfection inhherent in every human being…” - the Architectso, he completely resigned the matrix, the second one was more based off of human history, especially focusing on the grotesque parts of human history. He made sure to add in very unpleasant aspects from our history into the matrix, to kind of ‘match’ are affinity for imperfection.“thus i redesigned, based on your history, to more accurately reflect the inherent grotesqueries of your nature” - the ArchitectHowever again he found this solution didn't work, just like before the humans were waking up, so he came to another conclusion, that the solution to this problem must come from another source“however i was again frustrated by failure” “How have come to realize a solution must come from a lesser mind, a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection” - The ArchitectHe says here he must allow a different program with a different ‘mindset’ to find the solution. He says his own mind set acts to logically to perfectly, and humans don’t work that way.Thus another program created found a solution - THE ORACLE“… thus the solution was stumbled upon by another, an intuitive program, one originally created to analyze certain aspects about the human psyche… she found a solution to which 99% of all test subjects accepted the programming only if they were given a choice…” - the Architectso it was the Oracle who found the solution to an acceptable matrix, the solution was FREE WILL. FREE WILL THE THEME OF THE MATRIX 2.so if the humans reality was defined on free will aspects then the will accept it to be real.think about it. the Architect’s original utopia probably only worked if certain aspects were FORCED on humans thus taking away freewill, and in that they will reject the matrix, to which they did.However one more detain key word (or number)and take a guess where the 1% preside. ZION.The 1% that refuse the program are taken out of the matrix by the Zion decibels. such as Morpheus and other captains of the ships of Zion.this process of the captains freeing the 1% is advocated by the architect, he wants this to happen, because those that inside the matrix know its a computer simulation they can instill powers into themselves. We see Morpheus and his crew do so. there inside and know its a computer program so therefore they can make themselves stronger, faster, more super hero like, etc.so the city of Zion is a major aspect of the matrix’s survival.However again it is still a self growing resistance that despite its necessity the machines see as a threat, so every once in a while they exterminate it.“…while a minority if left unchecked would constitute an escalating probability of disaster”he says if Zion is left completely unchecked eventually they will beat the machines.so again every once in a while they send a band of sentinels and have it completely genocide-d.When this happens it is IMPERATIVE ‘the one’ believes the sentinels will no matter what successfully defeat Zion and all of its inhabitants, because the ultimate function of the one is to rebuild Zion and if in Zion he can stop the machines given his power. after he allows the code he carries to be recycled and then he exits the matrix after Zion’s people all have been killed, to rebuild it.But since the necessity of a FREEWILL matrix is present it is flawed because at anytime ‘the one’ can disobey the architects wants like we see neo do. but all the ones before him believed the architects threats and complied with the process.So in the end that’s the process the Architect created and executes regularly. its flawed due to its implications but seems to secure the future of the machine city.",4 followers,Dan Bradbury,978,21.7K,235.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/In-The-Matrix-Reloaded-movie-why-is-the-crew-assisting-the-Nebuchadnezzar-to-enter-Zion-plugged-into-the-Matrix-The-ship-is-in-the-real-world-and-of-course-Zion-is-real-In-what-way-are-they-helping-while-plugged

Once the sale was announced and the hand off meeting scheduled, I ask if I would be taken care of to the owner and Lord Fauntleroy (who was staying with the new owners) . They assured I would be taken care of due to my “loyal” work in their interest. I did all the inventory, equipment assets, personnel assessments, signed it off with Pro Builds auditors and sat back ready to get going. I found out Pro Build couldn’t pour piss out of a boot with instructions on the heel. I could not believe how they paid bonuses based on the cost of assets to the Presidents and VPs. WTH ? Numbers were seriously fudged. We were selling dead trees not operating union retirement funds or 401 Ks investments. I got called to a breakfast meeting with Lord Fauntleroy and a VP for Pro Build. I show up in my company Yukon XL, and as I walk in the door there is a HR head shed sitting with them. Bad vibes for sure. They proceeded to tell me I was no longer needed, and they would be taking possession of my company truck right there and I would not be allowed back in my office to recover my boxes of personal reference materials, or IT downloads I had used for over 25 years. I was breathing fire but held my tongue, and calmly stated, I am walking out the door and driving the rig home to unload my belongings. I put average 60 to 80k on that rig on I 5, at about 1200 to 1400 hours per year. I pretty much lived it creating the business. Offered me a sign out with one months severance. I got up, and started to the door and they said you have to stop, I asked them which one of them think they could stop me? I stated I would return in the morning at 6 am with the cleaned out rig, ready to sign out my termination papers, to recover my personal items in my office, along with the law officers I worked with in the area if needed. Got up walked out. They sat there with their stupid looks and I got in the rig drove home, returned in the morning at the designated time with the LT from the state police on standby. Got my materials and left them a bottle of Curevo saying you jokers will be loosing a billion a year soon. True words. In the end it cost me everything I had worked for to be able to retire. 2014 at 64 I did a straight 7. I still would like to meet Little Lord Fauntleroy in an alley for 5 minutes.

The middle class is vanishing— junk jobs are replacing well-paying careers, costs of living (rent, education, and healthcare) are skyrocketing, and social services, which help with these sorts of things, are being gutted.The result? Debt has become a staple in most American’s lives. What Americans used to finance through hard work at a regular ol’ job (paying for college, a car, health insurance) is now impossible without going into debt.So, you have one “half” of America which is essentially living pay check to pay check, using money they don’t have to buy essential goods, and working in companies where their CEO’s receive paychecks of up to 400x what they make.And then you have the other “half”— the comfortably wealthy— financiers, lawyers, executives, tech engineers, who pay out of pocket for all the expenses that burden the other side with debt and insecurity. This half physically separates themselves from the other, living in gated communities or distant suburbs. They send their kids to elite prep schools or suburban public schools, which are populated largely by other privileged kids— where they are trained to get into good colleges and, later, secure prestigious jobs.Also, the movie touches heavily on Automation, which essentially rendered the vast majority of people unemployable. A decent future government would guarantee these people universal basic income, but if we look at how the US has treated the welfare system over the last forty something years, it is definitely plausible that politicians wouldn’t fight for it. In the movie, the masses copped through joining gangs, scavenging, and getting by on odd jobs— seems oddly similar to how many people live in some cities in modern America.Ok— so the foundation of an Elysium like future is clearly there. But will this necessarily evolve into a world where all of the rich folks live in a giant space colony and blow up refugee shuttles? Eh. Maybe. But it seems obvious that the rich will continue to physically distance themselves from the poor in increasingly extravagant ways. Global warming might not make living on Earth a death sentence, but it will definitely make it more hazardous. The people best equipped to defend themselves against these dangers are those who are able to afford expensive safeguards to protect their homes and bodies. It is not ridiculous to conclude that, in a couple hundred years or so, people may start leaving Earth to live a safer life in orbit or on Mars.I’m not saying that this future is likely— I think that, if the global 1% were to try and horde 100% of the benefits of automation and deny UBI, there would be a massive resistance from voters. Assuming that America keeps its democratic institutions, there would be too much social pressure against this inequality (way more than what there is now), which would make this sort of dystopian future impossible.But again, there is a chance that this pressure never forms. Or maybe it does, and just gets subtly or violently suppressed (hopefully not by hard-ass police robots with stun batons)…","56,994 followers",Flavian Mwasi,5.5K,678,73.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/In-The-Matrix-Reloaded-movie-why-is-the-crew-assisting-the-Nebuchadnezzar-to-enter-Zion-plugged-into-the-Matrix-The-ship-is-in-the-real-world-and-of-course-Zion-is-real-In-what-way-are-they-helping-while-plugged

It offers support for various blockchain assets, tokens, even exclusive coins, and some fiat currencies, and is quite secure.Divi Wallet: launched by the Divi Project and designed by its Divi Labs with an extremely friendly interface, where users have a new and dynamic way of interacting with Divi and with the main crypto and fiat currencies in a very secure and at the same time very easy way, providing a decentralized option to store the private keys of your cryptocurrencies in one place, making it one of the most secure wallets today. You can check theirLedger Wallet. It's safe and can store a large variety of cryptos and also allows us to store our private keys.The objective then, s to diversify our forms of storage to reduce risk and maintain a clear and constantly evolving strategy. In this way, the money is always ""working"" and, above all, safe.Always remember to constantly educate yourself because the crypto world is super dynamic!","3,398 followers",Raymond Scottman,1.1K,0,0,2007,https://www.quora.com/In-The-Matrix-Reloaded-movie-why-is-the-crew-assisting-the-Nebuchadnezzar-to-enter-Zion-plugged-into-the-Matrix-The-ship-is-in-the-real-world-and-of-course-Zion-is-real-In-what-way-are-they-helping-while-plugged
