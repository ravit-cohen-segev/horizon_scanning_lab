So if a woman shoots a man for no apparent reason, the AI can simply assume toxic masculinity played a role. If a minority man commits some act of aggression toward a white woman, we can assume racism her played some part.These days most people in the west don’t follow any moral code other than narcissism and self absorption. The things they think are ‘values’ are mostly lies designed for self aggrandizement, and political power. These aren’t morals, they are the pretense of morals. They are individual vices that powerful groups have an interest in promoting as virtues in order to divide and manipulate the population with the anger and resentment they foster.Why in the world would you want an AI to participate in that?I think you mean well with your question. I think you’re trying to get at what might, in more rational times, be an interesting examination of public sentiment. But the western world is so shattered at the moment, and run by such despicable and brazen liars, that I don’t think we can get anything useful from it at the moment. I think the public is too confused, and intentionally deluded to offer much that will stand even the most cursory examination.I think the powerful have spent so much time and energy celebrating ugliness and vice, and denigrating virtue and beauty, that very few people can tell the difference anymore. There is no point in asking someone in that tragic state what their ‘morals’ are.

1,"There’s no if about it. What I designed for morals was computational morality which I derived from the Golden Rule, but I had to correct its many faults to turn it into a perfect method. That method is simply the application of the following:-In a single-participant system there is no role for morality: everything is simply a matter of harm-benefit calculations to decide what’s the best course of action in any situation.In a multiple-participant system morality has a role, but we can reduce any such system to a single-participant system by the simple trick of treating all the participants as iThere’s no if about it.

The entirety of morality is accounted for by this.This way of calculating morality has no bias in it: it doesn’t discriminate against race or species but treats all sentiences as equal.","3,905 followers",Monica Anderson,806,148,1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-you-were-to-program-the-emerging-technologies-specifically-the-intelligent-machines-what-morals-should-you-program-to-these-machines-and-why

We can hope that Marvel will have begun with mutants and maybe bringing the tv characters into movies. Here’s what we know we have to look forward to.Ant Man and The Wasp- this movie will be set sometime after Civil War and before Infinity War. The main villain is Ghost, and Goliath will feature in the movie. Hank Pym and Hope are on the run from the government who wants their tech, and so far the reviews that have come in seem fairly positive.Venom-this is the first in Sony’s Spider-verse, although it may feature Tom Holland, technically making it part of the MCU. Carnage is the suggested villain and the movie Venom will feature a very different version of Venom, not impacted by Spider man at all.Captain Marvel- Marvels first movie with a female protagonist, Captain Marvel will be set in the 90’s and feature a younger Phil Coulson and Nick Fury. The kree empire will be present on screen, featuring characters like Yon Rogg, Ronan and Korath. Set pictures seem to indicate that Captain Marvel will use her old suit for part of the movie. The main villains of the movie will be the shapeshifting Skrulls.Avengers 4- one of the most anticipated movies ever, not too much is confirmed about it. The title is unkown, and no trailer yet exists. The movie appears to feature time travel to retrieve the infinity stones. Set photos and released art hint at some interesting concepts like Cap wielding Mjolnir and Professor Hulk.Spider-Man: Far From Home-this movie is the first to appear after Avengers 4 and is set in London with Mysterio as the villain. The movie is said to feature and older and more mature version of Peter Parker.Guardians of the Galaxy vol III- almost nothing is known about this movie except for the fact that it is the last Gotg. Mark Hamill is confirmed for a new role in the movie. It will likely feature Nova or Adam Warlock as new additions to the team. Who will even be in it with almost every Gaurdian currently dead is a mystery.Black Widow- this movie has a director and a leading actress. It could incorporate storylines featuring the other Black Widows, the Red Room or even Budapest.Those are all the confirmed MCU movies. They have hinted at movies featuring the Eternals. Marvel did say they had many more movies in production, although the exact number is unclear. Marvel likes trilogies, so movies we can expect are:Dr. Strange IIDr. Strange IIIBlack Panther IIBlack Panther IIISpider-Man III (and hopefully more)Captain Marvel IICaptain Marvel IIIAnt Man IIIThese are movies we can almost certainly look forward to do the the success of the first one for each of the characters. Possible other movies could include Namor, Adam Warlock and more Captain Marvel movies. With Disney’s acquisition of Fox the Fantastic Four and X-men may be the main focus of the MCU movies for the next couple years. Kevin Feige also stated they are planting seeds for a new group of Young Avengers, with Cassie Lang (Stature) and Miles Morales (Spider Man). If Avengers 4 does feature time travel, then it’s possible that there could be an alternate reality where the infinity stones were removed from certain situations. Possible future villains could be the likes of Galactus, Skrulls and Dr. Doom.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,17K,996,156M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-Marvel-technologies-are-actually-likely-to-emerge-in-the-real-world-in-the-next-25-years

6,"Updated AnswerFirst, I’ll start with what is more certain. During Hasbro’s New York Toy Fair 2020 presentation, they revealed Marvel’s game plan for the next two years. (i.e. see below)It is clear they will expand their “cinematic universe” into limited series in addition to movies. They will also continue their strategy of introducing new heroes (e.g. Shang Chi, Ms. Marvel) while expanding the story of their older characters (e.g. Hawkeye, Thor).Marvel was scheduled to formally expanding into theme parks with Avengers Campuses in three continents (i.e. California, Paris and Hong Kong).

They will also continue their strategy of introducing new heroes (e.g. Shang Chi, Ms. Marvel) while expanding the story of their older characters (e.g. Hawkeye, Thor).Marvel was scheduled to formally expanding into theme parks with Avengers Campuses in three continents (i.e. California, Paris and Hong Kong). These will combine existing Marvel attractions with new attractions themed within the MCU.Marvel Studios Head, Kevin Feige, was also promoted to Chief Creative Officer of the entire Marvel Entertainment. I predict this will eventually lead to more MCU tie-ups in comics, video games, animation and more.Unfortunately due to the pandemic, Marvel Studios has been forced to push back the MCU’s phase four which consists of both movies (i.e. Black Widow, Eternals, Shang Chi, Doctor Strange & the Multiverse of Madness, untitled Spider-Man sequel and Thor: Love & Thunder) and direct-to-Disney+ shows (i.e. The Falcon & Winter Soldier, WandaVision, Loki, What If, Ms. Marvel and Hawkeye). I assume they also pushed back their announced but undated movies (e.g. Guardians of the Galaxy 3, Black Panther 2, Captain Marvel 2, Blade) and shows (e.g. She-Hulk, Moon Knight). After that, I assume they will reboot characters from the Fantastic Four and X-Men into the MCU similar to what they did for Spider-Man. Speaking of Spider-Man, I understand the recent Disney-Sony agreement only extended their deal for one stand-alone Spider-Man movie from Sony (i.e. the above mentioned untitled Spider-Man sequel) and one ensemble MCU movie.While I am fairly certain of the movies and shows above, there is still much speculation on Marvel’s plan. These include adding “new” characters (e.g. Nova, Namor, Kang) & teams (e.g. Young Avengers, Thunderbolts, Illuminati), rebooting “old” characters (e.g. Deadpool, Daredevil) & teams (e.g. Inhumans, Defenders) and adapting comic book storylines (e.g. Secret Invasion, Secret Wars, Avengers vs. X-Men). Given a decade, its even possible that all the rumors are true.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-Marvel-technologies-are-actually-likely-to-emerge-in-the-real-world-in-the-next-25-years

But on being asked whether that was true, the kids themselves noted that there were many types of punishments they received:They did not even think that losing screen time was their most frequent mode of discipline.Most of the time, the best consequences for less-than-stellar behavior are those that arise logically. Did you forget to flush the toilet? Having to stop what you are doing right this minute to come flush it can be quite annoying. But it is a logical follow-on to not having done it when you ought to have, which was before you left the bathroom in the first place.Some behaviors are even self-punishing. “Taking care of your things” is often addressed this way; if you didn’t take care of it, and something happened to it, you just don’t have it anymore.So in my house, the loss of access to technology as a punishment is almost always the result of undesirable behavior that directly resulted from having access to technology. Common offenders are:In many households, though, loss of access to technologyAs far as needing it for school or communication in emergencies goes, no, I don’t think it overrules the effectiveness. In an emergency, the ubiquity ofIt’s true that if your child uses a chromebook or laptop in school you won’t be able to control their use of it within the school environment. But at home, it’s easy enough to say that it can only be used at the kitchen table, under supervision; similar rules might apply if they merely need access to a computer for online assignments even if they don’t take one to school. Depending on age, many kids will find that needing to be supervised on the computer like a smaller child burns even more than loss of access to the non-academic activities they would be using it for if they weren’t restricted.That last bit is key. There are two aspects of punishment that happen when you restrict access. The first is the loss of use, the loss of whatever it is that they would do if the restriction weren’t in place. But the second is the loss of",0 followers,Evelyn Krasnik,18.8K,750,11.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-you-were-to-program-the-emerging-technologies-specifically-the-intelligent-machines-what-morals-should-you-program-to-these-machines-and-why

It is technology, but that doesn’t mean that it is necessary by any means. Is it useful in an emergency? Sure! Still… I’m thinking back to when I was a freshman in high school. I can’t remember ever having to make an emergency phone call. Zero times. Ever. The parent gets to do what he or she wants. I would argue that cell phones are extremely unlikely to be necessary for a teenager in terms of an emergency. Plus, the phone belongs to the parent unless the kid is making the payments. In the event that one isn’t available, I would say, “Adapt and overcome.”Also, what is the alternative? When I was a kid, you couldn’t take a cell phone. My parents cut the cable on the television, but that was just as much a punishment for them. Kids are more than willing to do without videogame consoles. They presumably do that for most of the day.Instead, you metaphorically cut off their right hand. You go after the thing they love more than just about anything else. You take that phone. The magic box full of texts and social networking.Now… I will say that this isn’t necessarily going to be super-effective. It’s at least a step above beatings, but taking technology didn’t do much to me. I was getting suspended too often to get my grades up, so I never really got to watch a lot of television.","105,671 followers",Dave Consiglio,1.6K,6.8K,91.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-you-were-to-program-the-emerging-technologies-specifically-the-intelligent-machines-what-morals-should-you-program-to-these-machines-and-why
