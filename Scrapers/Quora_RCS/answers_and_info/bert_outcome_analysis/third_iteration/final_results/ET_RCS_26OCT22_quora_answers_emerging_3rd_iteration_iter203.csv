Supposedly, this technology was used to help cripple the Iraqi air defense system when the US invaded.This was important to Cisco because we were working in security and cryptography and the NSA was forever trying to get us to corrupt our products so they could un-encrypt foreign transmissions on the fly. One time we were required to corrupt product that had been shipped to China and it started a major debate about our fiduciary responsibility to the country or to the customer. The issue was that if you sell a security product that you know is corrupted, you are knowingly committing fraud and are liable. As the Product Manager at the time I asked the NSA if they would stand behind us (and me as I might be personally liable) in court if we were discovered. Of course the answer from the NSA was “Hell no.”We were on our own. We then entered into a long debate about how to detect Easter eggs and other corruption introduced into security products unknowingly through another vendor’s corrupted hardware. The issue was never resolved but it should be known that our security source code HAD to be provided to the NSA in order to get FIPS certification and they made certain changes to it.So to answer your question, USA military technology is advanced far beyond anyone’s knowledge to describe the extent.On the other hand, the Chinese probably know more about our technology than we do since they perpetrated the greatest security breach in history by compromising the RSA key technology used by almost everyone in the world. We only learned of it through the vigilance of Lockheed-Martin who discovered the breach accidentally. But for months the Chinese had the key to almost every computer in the world.","358,938 followers",Sean Kernan,11.4K,5.6K,726.8M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advanced-military-technologies-that-may-be-for-civil-use-in-the-next-decades

15,"Gold is a rare metal in the crust of the Earth because gold is a siderophile element. When the Earth formed by accretion of dust and rocks in the early solar nebula, the heat generation by gravitational infalling and radioactive elements caused the early Earth to become molten. In the molten state certain elements like iron and nickel separated from the predominantly lighter silicate minerals. Siderophile elements like gold, manganese, cobalt, platinum and palladium preferentially settled with the iron core. This left the core of the Earth enriched in gold and the crust relatively impoverishedGold is a rare metal in the crust of the Earth because gold is a siderophile element. When the Earth formed by accretion of dust and rocks in the early solar nebula, the heat generation by gravitational infalling and radioactive elements caused the early Earth to become molten. In the molten state certain elements like iron and nickel separated from the predominantly lighter silicate minerals. Siderophile elements like gold, manganese, cobalt, platinum and palladium preferentially settled with the iron core. This left the core of the Earth enriched in gold and the crust relatively impoverished. The core probably contain 2 to 4 parts per million of gold, while the crust is perhaps 1 to 2 parts per billion of gold.While the crust of the Earth is relatively poor overall in gold, many geologic processes have worked to produce concentrations of gold. Thus the gold content of the great Witwatersrand reefs averaged around 10 parts per million - a ten thousand fold concentration from the crustal abundance. Even the lowest grade mines worked today require at least 1 part per million - still a one thousand fold increase.Current mined production of about 3,000 tons of gold per year requires the mining and processing of about 500 million tons of gold ore. Many mines are at their technical limits. For example the Mponeng mine in South Africa is mining ore from a depth of 4 kilometers, where the rock temperature is 66 degrees C. In my opinion current gold production is close to its peak, and will start to decline in future years.Mining gold will never be similar to mining coal (70 - 90% carbon), because carbon is a million times more abundant in the crust of the Earth than gold.","15,091 followers",Jason Almendra,569,21.3K,105.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advanced-military-technologies-that-may-be-for-civil-use-in-the-next-decades

Personally I don’t think that we’ll be seeing any true colonies on Mars in our lifetimes, but the Starship does enable something even more crucial, and that’s the expansion of our industry into space. Once you make launch costs a trivial part of the total project budget, you find that activity in space will absolutely take off (if you’ll pardon the pun). It all starts with extraterrestrial resource extraction and processing. Once you get this established, then manufacturing will logically follow and we’ll see the genesis of a new space based solar economy that will eventually far surpass what we currently have on Earth.","135,532 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advanced-military-technologies-that-may-be-for-civil-use-in-the-next-decades
