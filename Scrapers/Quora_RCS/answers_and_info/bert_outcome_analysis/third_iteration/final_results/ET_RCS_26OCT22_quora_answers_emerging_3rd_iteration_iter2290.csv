So far, as far I know, Chobham Armor is the most effective armor available. There is probably something else in the works, but we won’t know about it until it’s ready. In the meantime, they will continue to upgrade the weapons and guidance systems, and do so as quietly as they can.

NATO allies would have to fear Russian tanks again leading to a need for a 5th Gen plane that can do CAS.

The previous ‘largest’ forward leap in technology was the introduction of the T-34, which represented about a 30% improvement in those categories over previous tanks for both the Soviets and German armies.The improvements since the 1980s have been in fire control, communication, sights, thermal viewers, main gun, etc. which have improved the M1 series, but not to the extent of fielding another vehicle.Why not? There simply hasn’t been the need. The M1 is still a viable Main Battle tank, and the Cold War arms race had ended by 1989. It is unlikely to be re-established. Despite the fielding of the Armata and other talk about Chinese tanks, neither of those armed forces are in any way a threat to either NATO or any western interests.

6,"The Soviets actually started with the gun first and then decided on heavy armor later. So it was the fact that they realized how powerful an anti-tank gun could be that they started building tanks with armor strong enough to stop those guns.The Soviet tank that everyone forgets about is the T-28:The T-28 completed development in 1931, and in most respects it was an early 1930s tank. It had multiple turrets, thin flat armor, and an overly complex drive train. What made it exceptional was its all-purpose 76.2mm gun.

(its welded construction was also ahead of its time, but that’s a separate topic)The 76.2mm KT-28 gun was quite unique for its era because it was meant to target both infantryTanks were supposed to be targeted by a small caliber, high velocity, fast firing gun, usually a 37mm, like the one mounted on the first German Pz.III marks:Panzer III B, the German tank armed with the 37mm anti-tank gunInfantry and fortifications were meant to be targeted by a high caliber, low velocity, slow firing gun like a 75mm. The best example is the early Pz.IV:Panzer IV E, the German tank armed with the low-velocity 75mm howitzerThe best illustrations of this dichotomy were tanks that were mounted with both types of guns. Case in point, the French Char B1:Developed 5 years after the Soviet T-28, the Char B1 heavy tank sportedThis layout was quite popular. It persisted well into 1941/42 with the American M3 Lee:Ironically, the M1 75mm gun on the Lee was quite effective against armor as well, but it was still primarily meant to fire HE shells. The turret-mounted 37mm was the primary anti-tank weapon. Even this far into the war, the 37mm was still considered sufficient (albeit marginally so) against German armor.The problem with this two-gun concept was that the 37, 40 and 47mm AT guns had reached their limits in terms of penetration. They were never going to make it far past 40 mm or so of flat armor penetration at distance. So the tank designers of these countries were content that they wouldn’t need to build an anti-tank tank that could support heavier armor. All their true heavy tanks were built to fight alongside the infantry, and were thus torturously slow. The Char B1 and Matilda are the best examples of these “infantry tanks”.—Going back to the Soviets, their experiments with the all-purpose 76.2mm gun made them realize that there’s actually nothing stopping potential enemies from mounting a higher velocity 75mm gun in a medium tank. These 75mm guns would have more than double the penetration of the common 37 or 47mm guns in service at the time.This kernel of an idea lay on the back burner for many years while the chaos of the Purges swept through the USSR. It wasn’t until the Spanish Civil War that Soviet planners were reminded the hard way of why they needed to stay one step ahead in tank development. The Soviet T-26 and BT light tanks sent to Spain had proven lacking in all respects, but armor was the most concerning. German AT guns made short work of the Soviet light tanks, and even the extreme mobility of the BT tanks weren’t enough to keep their alive.The Soviet BT-5 was an exceedingly fast tank for its time (and really, even today). It mounted a 400 horsepower engine in an 11-ton tank, giving it a mind bending 35 horsepower per ton! But that’s still not fast enough to escape the traverse gear on a German 37mm PaK36.Sure, the Soviet could have simply done what the Germans did and added a few millimeters of armor to their designs so they could take on the most common threats of the era, but instead the Soviet chose to make their tank future-proof by armoring it against guns that hadn’t yet been fielded. Thus started the KV heavy tank development program in 1939.This program progressed with remarkable speed thanks to the availability of all the major components. The 76.2mm L-11 was already developed for medium tanks (soon to be mounted on the T-34), the legendary V2 diesel engine had been ready to go for years, and the Soviets already had a decade of experience with welding large armor plates.Thus before 1939 closed, the KV-1 was ready for action… sort of:1941 model KV-1 with the upgraded ZiS-5 gun and additional 25mm add-on armorThe heavy tank program ran in parallel with the the medium tank program that eventually developed the T-34.In combat The KV-1 proved to have too little mobility and perhapsThus the KV-1S was developed as an upgrade, a tank with the same engine butThe KV-1S was one of the very few examples of armor being reduced in tank design evolution. The Soviets determined that they needed more mobility and less armor protection even in a heavy breakthrough tank.Later modifications to the KV series focused on improving its firepower rather than its armor. The Soviet 85mm was the natural next step up in firepower and it was mounted to a number of KV prototypes. The model that went into production was the renamed the Joseph Stalin - 1 or IS-1 (the letter J doesn’t exist in Cyrillic).The IS-1 marks the true end of the KV line. It’s the last tank were armor outpaced firepower, and the gun was equally suitable against both tanks and infantry. The later IS-2 with its 122mm long-barreled howitzer was primarily meant to be used against fortifications, not other tanks (though it was still quite effective against tanks).BONUSFun fact about Soviet gun diameters:Some people might wonder why these oddly specific calibers like 76.2, 122, 152, 203mm exist alongside more rational calibers like 20, 45, 85, 100, 125mm.The reason is that the former set derive from Imperial conversions. And yes, even the Russians used Imperial. The 76.2, 122, and 152mm Soviet guns were derived from Czar-era 30, 48, and 60 line guns respectively. A “line” was the old Russian measurement for 1/10th of an Imperial inch. So the Mosin Nagant rifle was referred to as the “3-line rifle” due to its 7.62mm caliber.",32 followers,Michael DeWayne Toombs,997,0,0,2006,https://www.quora.com/Why-havent-tanks-advanced-technologically-in-the-80s

Seriously.  We can barely get atoms up to that speed.  They're going to have really advanced engines, alloys that can withstand anything we throw at them, etc.  If their weapons technology is as far ahead of ours as their astronautics is, our only hope is to communicate with them.
