Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party. Because radiation from nuclear accidents is apparently scarier than way more people dying of regular pollution constantly and the total annihilation of all life on Earth as the oceans boil away.","246,833 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-dimensions-of-an-advanced-technology-extended-motherboard

9,"In a few areas, actually. First is infrastructure. The Chinese planned waaaaaaaaaay ahead while building. That’s why there were ghost cities.

Smaller cities have buses available that will take you just about everywhere within the city and bigger cities have subways as well as buses. For going between cities and provinces, China has a high speed rail system in place that is more extensive than the American highway system! For example: I lived in a city called Nanjing in China - about 200 miles/300 km from Shanghai. I could take a high speed train from Nanjing to Shanghai in about 1.5 hours!In contrast, I took an Amtrak train from Detroit to Chicago (about 300 miles/480 km) and it took over 8 hours!Another area China wins at is public utilities. They provide electricity, water, and gas for billions of people for very affordable prices! I paid maybe a total of $20 (US) per month for all utility bills, whereas it cost me over $100 in America! Atop of that is wireless technology (which is considered a public utility in China). I paid 100 rmb ($15) monthly for 16 GB of 4G data, with 1000 texts and 500 minutes of talk (which pretty much meant unlimited everything for me). In America I pay $50 a month for my unlimited plan. Yes, the 4G is a little faster, but that may just be because I’m not trying to access the foreign web here…A third area (kinda related to the second) is how the CCP controls markets and prices so everyone can live a comfortable life. I ate a big plate of food at a small restaurant for between 10 and 20 rmb… ($1.25-2.50). The government controls the means of production, so there is plenty of food for everyone!I hope you enjoyed my answer!","43,401 followers",Misha Firer,5.1K,1.3K,133.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-dimensions-of-an-advanced-technology-extended-motherboard

11,"Planned obsolescenceThis is the F-16. First manufactured in 1974, the Air Force plans to phase these out of service by 2025, but they’ll most likely remain in use by our allies for decades later than that. If an F-16 was manufactured in 1974, and was never shot down, then by 2025 it will have had 51 years of active service.So why is the US government still using jets that are almost half a century old?

If an F-16 was manufactured in 1974, and was never shot down, then by 2025 it will have had 51 years of active service.So why is the US government still using jets that are almost half a century old? Consider the following. The base version of the F-16 costs an estimated 30 million dollars. Fully upgraded it can easily cost twice that. For this amount of money you want to get as much usage out of the machine as possible.Furthermore, there’s really not much you can do to improve on the design. The human body can only handle so many G forces before it dies. The F-16 is every bit as effective a weapon now as it was when it was first created, and barring a major paradigm shift in air combat, it will remain effective for the foreseeable future.Compare this to a Commodore personal computer from roughly the same time period. This machine is hopelessly outdated. It would have a hard time running a modern word processor, let alone anything I’d actually want to use a computer for. But the machine was only a couple hundred dollars, which is what it would cost me today to get one about a million times more powerful.To be more precise, if we look at transistor count, a computer from 1974 has roughly 10 million times fewer transistors than a computer made last year. Let that sink in.And the people who manufactured both devices knew this. Military engineers knew they were making big, expensive products that were going to be in service for decades, and which wouldn’t really need to be improved upon until there was another major war. And at that point there’s no telling what improvements would be required.Consumer products engineers knew they were making small, cheap, disposable products that the customer would probably throw away in under a decade, because by then an improved version would appear. They could make the device sturdier, but that would increase the cost to the consumer for a device they were going to throw away anyway.If a Commodore microcomputer was indestructible, you’d still have thrown it away by now because you don’t need it anymore. So why bother?Although, with careful use and regular maintenance, even old consumer products can last for decades. You just need to be really careful with them.","18,451 followers",Nathan Stanish,12.5K,2.3K,62.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-dimensions-of-an-advanced-technology-extended-motherboard

Live telecastAs Dhritarashtra was blind but wanted to know what was happening at the battlefield, Krishna gifted Sanjay with ""Dibya Drishti"", so that he could see a “Live Telecast” of “Kurukshetra” and describe that to Dhritarashtra. “Dibya drishti” is analogous to modern television set in the sense that Krishna could not give it directly to Dhristarastra but needed Sanjay.3. AstrasThe function of an Astra is more than that of a missile. It is said that Astras used in Mahabharata probably might have also used technologies of emitting most dangerous rays like Gamma and others, which have exceptional powers to penetrate. Some Astras returns to the person who launches it, for instance, Krishna's Sudharsana Chakra. This may be similar to the reusable missiles which the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) is working on.Astras were also used for defensive purposes similar to a Tesla Shield which is used to destroy the enemy Astra coming towards it.
