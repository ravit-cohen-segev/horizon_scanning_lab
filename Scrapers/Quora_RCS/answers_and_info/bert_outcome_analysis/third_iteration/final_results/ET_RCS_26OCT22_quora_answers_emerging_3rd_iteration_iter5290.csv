0,"I don’t know the answer, but here is something important to think about.Creativity is a certain measure of intelligence. If you are creative, you are good at non-repetitive work; work that evolves and requires thinking. It is easy to swap an employee that folds boxes with a robot because this is conscientious, repetitive work. The production is directly correlated with how hard you work, not how smart you work. But this robot would not be called intelligent by today’s standards. Almost by definition, artificial intelligence would require technology to be creative.So how is it that some humansI don’t know the answer, but here is something important to think about.Creativity is a certain measure of intelligence. If you are creative, you are good at non-repetitive work; work that evolves and requires thinking. It is easy to swap an employee that folds boxes with a robot because this is conscientious, repetitive work. The production is directly correlated with how hard you work, not how smart you work. But this robot would not be called intelligent by today’s standards. Almost by definition, artificial intelligence would require technology to be creative.So how is it that some humans have become creative? We are told that anyone can be creative, but it is really just a small fraction of the population that actually has creative talent. And don't think that being creative is a blessing. Most (almost all) creative people are never discovered. They end up having to force themselves into a role that is more fitting for a conscientious person or face starvation and bankruptcy. Only a select few people can actually capitalize on their creativity.But if someone can actually capitalize on creativity, as the story of JK Rowling would tell you, they can become extraordinarily famous and wealthy. It is some goal to shoot for, you just have to risk your whole life.But human creativity and its evolution can be traced back to a simple stimulus: there are problems that our tribe faces and we have a physical body that can be damaged by those problems. You cannot have creativity without problems and you cannot have creativity without a mortal body.As creative beings, we are not satisfied if we are not pursuing the answer to some problem. If we managed to create a utopia, and it was good, and all that any of us had to do is eat and bother ourselves with the procreation of the species, we would immediately tear it all down just for something exciting to happen. Creative beings need a problem to solve.Creative beings also need a body to inhabit. It may be difficult to see why at first, but after you think about it, it makes perfect sense. If we don’t have a body, we don’t have any skin in the game (literally). You are not risking anything if you don’t have a body. But if you have a body, everything you do is a risk.Why would an immortal being cross the street if you knew that there was a chance that you could die? If you were mortal, you know that you are going to die anyway. You know that there is meaning in crossing the street, there is something that is waiting for you on the other side. Sure, it might all end. You might die. But you are going to die anyway, so the risk is not as great as if you were immortal.By having a finite, vulnerable body, we learn to carefully weigh risks and rewards. We learn to think. Creative, intelligent people can weigh risk and reward the best, resulting in their tribe’s survival. Because we do not have the defenses and strengths possessed by other creatures, it makes our risk/reward game at much higher stakes. A turtle has a thick shell. We don’t. We are at a higher risk operating in the world, but there is a higher reward of producing technologies for protection.Now, everyone can't be creative in a society. There are natural laws in place that prevent this. A tribe would only need, say 10% of its people to be creative in order to survive. Any higher and there are not enough conscientious people around to actually get anything done. Any lower and the tribe will turn to stone; there wouldn’t be enough creative people around to deal with unforeseen problems.These are the conditions that lead to the rise of creativity in our own species. Whether technology can have creativity, I do not know. If a technology was creative, I believe, it would follow at least some of these structures that I have laid out above. If you are interested in the development of creativity, I suggest the works of Jean Piaget, the Swiss psychologist.",366 followers,Brett Alder,1.1K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Can-human-creativity-be-replaced-by-technology

6,"I believe this is the great question of our times. While we can't be certain how pervasive or how fast the job losses will be, they are certainly coming.

This would be far more extreme than the Great Depression.I see no reason why job losses could not reach 95% in the decades ahead.

Fortunately, such are now possible, for the first time in history.I have offered one such solution in my book and website, and it has been well received. Other designs are also possible. Far more important than choosing a particular design is choosing some design that is based on abundance.

To get an idea of where a jobless, welfare economy could wind up, read Kurt Vonnegut’s 1952 satirical novelNo one really has developed an adequate economic theory for separating the broad distribution of income and wealth from human labor. The economics profession is mostly in a state of denial about this immense challenge. The political class for the most part is blind to it altogether.Demography also comes into the equation. Populations in industrialized countries, as well as China and others, are aging. The impact of disappearing jobs will be masked somewhat by shrinking workforces, for a while. But without larger, younger workforces to pay their costs, retirement and other entitlement programs — the existing doles for the elderly — become unsustainable. No easy fix for that dilemma has come along yet either.The prospects are not all gloomy. Some foresee an economy of “abundance” produced by canny and highly productive advanced technology — one that can satisfy most or all economic demands at low cost with little or no human labor. The challenge, in addition to coming up with a way to distribute the abundance, is also to satisfy what seems to be an innate human need toThe former might be served by greatly broadening equity ownership to most of the population. (In theory there is no reason most people could not live as the rich and many retires do — managing their investments and collecting dividends.) The latter, the need to feel productive without a “job,” might be met through artistic and other creative activities — like the “maker” movement.Culturally, even in an economy where automatons can make any product or provide any service people need, there still could be a demand for “human-made” things that are valued just for being human. Such creative production could be rewarded not even with money but with social appreciation. To a significant extent, bellwethers of such arrangements already exist: crowdfunding of commercial and philanthropic projects/ventures, along with collaborative creations like Wikipedia, Github, Linux, the ‘sharing’ economy, and such.There is much more to the sociotechnical transformation unfolding in this century than just economic restructuring. Public trust in most institutions is at historical low levels in large measure because so many traditional institutions are obsolete and unresponsive to fast-changing realities. This is a time not for mere reform, but reformation.Historically such epochal shifts have been marked by social upheaval, distress, and violence. But times change. Perhaps this great transition can remain reasonably peaceful and not repeat the horrific, bloody destruction of the last century.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,6.1K,5.6K,427.2M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Can-human-creativity-be-replaced-by-technology

This is why the only current 5G networks in existence are only in very large cities.However, there is always a use for faster wireless communication in urbanized areas, which tend to be the centers of business and commerce. Telecommunications companies already had one go at this back at the turn of the last decade with 4G WiMax technology—I even used a WiMax network for my home Internet service from 2010–13—but it wasn’t reliable and rarely achieved the promised connection speeds, which is why the technology was abandoned. But WiMax (IEEE 802.16) was basically WiFi technology on steroids, and 5G is very different. It uses a completely different part of the radio frequency spectrum and new propagation technologies, and it’s not only faster than any 4G, whether it be WiMax, HSPA+ or LTE, but also outperforms most WiFi networks, which means it can eliminate the need for a router; each machine can directly connect at high speed over the air.As 5G ramps up over the next several years, expect to see many articles about how the United States “lags behind” in its deployment, because most of the country won’t have access to these networks. This will, of course, be because the USA is an enormous country and most of it has low population density, making 5G deployment not cost-effective. Much of the country has nothing better than 3G and/or HSPA+ access, because even LTE signals don’t work well. (I didn’t even bother owning an LTE-capable phone until last year.) And most of us really don’t give two cents about having a car or a refrigerator that “phones home” or whatever, anyway.But for the places that are able to get 5G technology, you can bet they’re going to find ways to use it that the developers haven’t even thought of yet.","9,880 followers",Kenzi Mudge,1.8K,1.3K,8.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Can-human-creativity-be-replaced-by-technology
