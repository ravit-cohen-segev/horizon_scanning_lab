1,"The example that springs to mind is Britain from around 400 A.D to around 800AD (which you can read about in Bryan Ward Perkins's book ‘The fall of Rome and the end of Civilization). It is hard to work out what was going on in this period due to a paucity of historical evidence. One way to get around that is to look at pottery. During the Roman period even a peasant would have access to good quality pots from a number of different kilns. After the Romans leave Britain the pottery becomes very local, badly made and porous. By 500 AD no-one appears to be making wheel turned pottery.

During the Roman period even a peasant would have access to good quality pots from a number of different kilns. After the Romans leave Britain the pottery becomes very local, badly made and porous. By 500 AD no-one appears to be making wheel turned pottery. No new mortared buildings are being erected. Writing disappears in Anglo-Saxon England in the fifth century and doesn't come back until the return of Christianity in the sixth.Good comparison is between that of a 4th century Roman farmstead at Bradley Hill in Somerset and Yeavering; the royal estate site of the 6th and 7th century kings of Northumbria (see pic below). The Roman farmstead had a tiled roof, contained 3,500 shards of Roman pottery and nearly 78 coins. Yeavering was made entirely of perishable materials which have left no trace. The pottery is scarce and that which remains falls apart very easily.  Little trace remains, despite the site being used over a century by around 100 people – the Roman farmstead was occupied by around 20 people for around 50 years.It is hard to explain something as basic as wheel turned pottery disappearing but a good theory is that the market collapses. There is no market which would require people specialized enough to invest in potters wheels to make pots because to do so they would have to sell more pots. Technologies depend on a market in order for people to put the investment in to train themselves and make specialized tools.It is hard to explain something as basic as wheel turned pottery disappearing but a good theory is that the market collapses.

Complex native industries gradually begin to re-emerge, particularly in East Anglia and coinage was slowly re-established from the 7th to 8th centuries. By 800 Britain was roughly similar to what it had been in 1AD in the immediately pre-Roman period.",6 followers,Michael Hutson,7.5K,3K,2M,2012,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-documented-case-of-a-culture-going-backwards-in-terms-of-its-technological-development

3,"I would answer No, because I believe that there is no such phenomenon as technological regression. Viewing the development of technology as normally moving forward, punctuated only by occasional or remarkable instances of it moving backwards, implies that technology ""advances"" ever upwards towards some undefined point of, presumably, perfection. One could call this categorical error, ""technological teleology,"" and it infects many history books and much historiography. It's merely a materialist rewriting of the Divine, Whiggish, or Marxist conceptions of history.I'll give you a brief example.I would answer No, because I believe that there is no such phenomenon as technological regression.

It's merely a materialist rewriting of the Divine, Whiggish, or Marxist conceptions of history.I'll give you a brief example. In the sixteenth-century, Japan banned firearms whereas in Europe conversely, the trend towards firearms adoption (seemingly) accelerated. On the face of it, the Japanese, by regressing technologically, began a long slow descent compared to the European powers, which raced ahead. But this perspective only works if you assume that firearms are more ""advanced"" than -- by which you really mean, ""superior to"" -- iron, edged, or arrow-based weapons. They're not, necessarily: A particular weaponry's efficacy depends on local conditions and contexts (political, economic, administrative, diplomatic, geographic, social, military, organizational), as well as the impact of historical contingency. Put it this way, colonists in New England in the 1600s were at a murderously great disadvantage when they fought bow-armed Indians with their ""advanced"" flintlocks.So, you see, when societies ""regress"" technologically, it's really just a trick of the light.

The history of USA begins with revolutions - the rail road connecting the west to east - the inter state highways etc…It is easier to show than to tell. Let me show you a few maps and try to figure out why China is developing faster than India.Exhibit 1 - USAExhibit 2 - CANADAExhibit 3 - EuropeExhibit 4 - ChinaExhibit 5- IndiaTHE YELLOW LINESDo you see the yellow lines? The yellow lines are six lane express ways - Interstate high speed lines. Do you see how many highways exist in USA? USA is filled with yellow lines - These yellow lines are like high speed - 1GBPS optical fibers laid across the country i.e. I can take my huge truck full of cars from one corner of my country to the other without applying any brakes in full throttle and conduct my business. i.e. SELL;Now COMPARE USA with CANADA.In Canada - Unfortunately only three cities are well connected with Highways - Toronto - Ottawa - Montreal - Qubec city and Nova Scotia - The rest of he nation is a barren waste land - Yes people live there but - they are virtually disconnected - unless they are willing to fly!So is USA better than CANADA - Not Really - USA has a better climate than Canada - If Canada was not the SIBERIA of AMERICAS it would have been filled with mesh of express ways like USA.EUROPE VS RUSSIAThe tale repeats - The most concentration of expressways is in a few countriesNetherlands - Belgium Germany -Denmark - France - Have this tightly knit spider web of express ways - Check them outCHINA vs INDIANow let us take a look at china - They laid so many roads that it is filled with express ways - six lane roadsCompare that with IndiaIndia has only two express ways - For a country of Billion People(1) New Delhi - Agra - Lucknow - The Yamuna Express way - (Vishal Khanna - Thanks for the edit )-(2) Ahmedabad to Vadodara - Barely visible on this mapPAKISTAN - It has one huge expressway connecting - Islamabad - Lahore - Peshawar - Thank to CHINA.What is TRADE?(1) MANUFACTURING AND SERVICES - Development Products (R&D) or People (training)(2) LOGISTICS - The movement of Goods or People(3) SALES AND MARKETING - The art of Selling Goods or PeopleLet us take this simple definition - for practical purposes - There are tons of other factors involved in trade and development - like Imports - Exports - Comparative Advantage - Exchange Rates - Fiscal Policy - Monetary PolicyLet us ignore all of them for a moment - Let us consider internal trade of various countries.The hallmark of a developed country is the ease of trade - The ease of starting a business.If I do not have a place to sit - i.e. to set up shop - Where would I start Manufacturing or Training PeopleIn India - If I wish to set up a factory - I would not have any buildings - I would not find any free space - If I do find a free space - There would be tons of red tape before I can get approvals - If there is no infrastructure to begin with I would not be able to do anything. I visit the local government school and I find that the roof leaks when it rains - does not have a fan in hot summer - is not connected by roads - the roads that are laid - were laid ten years ago and are now filled with pot holes. LOGISTICS i.e. the art of moving goods - there are no roads - There are no air ports - there are no shipping ports. SALES and MARKETING - selling Indian Goods - is pain not just in the ass but all over! You will understand this because - every Indian Good falls short in quality - according to international standards - most of the Indian goods are discarded i.e. thrown away because they don’t fit the requirements set by the buyer. Corruption is not a problem - it never was - Businessmen would earn more profits to pay for the corrupt - but the problem is that the corrupt money is not being used for infrastructure - China is as corrupt as India!What is China Doing?China has many structural advantages compared to IndiaThey are communists - They will kill anyone who stands in the way of the state! They will not hesitate - They will not forgive - They will exterminate ruthlessly.The state is atheist not secular - The state only tolerates religion and culture - mind the word TOLERATES i.e. if the state at any point of time believes that the religion is against the state or any culture is against the state - It will exterminate the religion or the culture. The great cultural destruction during Mao’s era is a proof of the extremes to which Chinese would go!It is a very good thing - China had a clean slate - a fresh slate - a slate cleansed with blood of many people who died during the struggle. China got rid of all the superstitions along with their old culture. India on the other hand lives in these superstitions -China is a COPY PASTE MACHINE - of profit makingChina copies - it copies profit making machines - If a business model is working - they will copy it - They copied Iphone - not just the phone but the Istore - that is an incredible achievement - They copied KFC - They copied McDonalds i.e. in china there is a chain of McDonald stores - not owned by McDonald. They have a copy of facebook - they have a copy of uber - they have a copy of twitter - they have a copy of a copy of a copy i.e. there are other companies trying to make copies of the chinese copies.The entire chinese state understood - the necessity of development - and they are pushing for it at any cost. Most of the chinese cities are covered with smog - but chinese can’t afford to stop their development - They need to make goods - services and sell them to make profits - as long as they make profits they develop.The Chinese are done with roads within their countryThe Chinese are done with RailsThe Chinese are done with PORTS - All these are ports developed by ChinaThe Growth Engine of China owes a lot of its Exports and Export trade is done by ships - not by road or by rail. Globalization happened over Container Terminals, Ports and Oceans - Unfortunately most of Indian - Ports are unfit for Docking International Ships - Hilarious but True - Indians never invested in making their ports world class - Chinese are done with ports not only in their country but also internationally -The Chinese are NOT Done with AIRPORTS YETThe only comparable infrastructure of India with China is in terms of AIRPORTS - India can compete with China on air traffic.But this too will pass - With China building hundreds of airports - by 2020 they will induct more than 100 new airports - to tackle the extreme congestion and delays in air port travel across the nation.I WILL SUM IT UPIndia pales in comparison to China in International PatentsNOTHING CAN BE DONE WITHOUT INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE - i.e. utilization of WEALTH to create more WEALTH - which starts a virtuous cycleEquivalent to investing the first twenty years of your life to education - China spent twenty years of its life from 1980 to 2000 in learning about developing profit making machines and investing in them - building cities - tows - roads - railways - and everything and anything in a mad rush to build - sell - repeat;make - sell - repeat; after millions of these selling cycles to international customers - The Country is now reaping the fruits of its investments made decades ago and pursued relentlessly.",189 followers,Prashant Kumar,5.7K,428,335.4K,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-documented-case-of-a-culture-going-backwards-in-terms-of-its-technological-development

But, anything that went up must come down. The curve below mimics the GDP growth curves.India is controlling the birth rates too, but at a much smaller rate. The two countries are now seeing their favorable labour demographics intersect and thus India is getting an upper edge in growth now.The second key factor is that China was more keen toIndia allowed foreign companies only in select industries — such as software — and those industries performed very well and provide good jobs even today. But, in industries that deal with the masses, India has kept the cards too close to the chest and has prevented the poor from enjoying globalisation that the middle class enjoys.The third key factor is thatIndia never got the urgency. India’s neighbors were even worse than India. While China started growing the previous couple of decades and brought the leadership out of the stupor, that neighbor is still quite far away in terms of economy, culture and language. India’s trade with the neighbors thus is quite poor.

But I think the main reason is complacency and a tendency of resting on her laurels of past greatness.During the Qing dynasty, there was a very narcissistic emperor by the name of Qianlong (乾隆), who self-styled himself as a “十全老人” (perfect old man) in his old age. He also thought that there was nothing China could learn or gain from others, including the west. So, when the first British mission to China led by George Macartney met emperor Qianlong in 1793, and requested freer trades with China, among other things, Qianlong rejected all of his requests.But we all know that this was the time when Britain had already undergone its First Industrial Revolution from about 1760, and was on its way to industrial greatness, scientific discoveries, technological advances, and also further on to international colonial expansion. So, what followed were the 1st Opium War in 1840 and the 2nd Opium War in 1860, when China was utterly thrashed; and then the cession of Hong Kong to Britain plus all the other unequal treaties forced on China.So, as we can see from what happened above, one of the major reasons of China falling behind the west was China's complacency; they rested on the laurels of China's past achievement. And emperor Qianlong's attitude was a classic example.As a matter of fact, for the most part of human civilization prior to 1800s, China had been THE leading nation in practical innovation, as exemplified in the four great inventions the compass, gun power, paper and printing, without any of which, our world would still be in a medieval era. Added to these, the Chinese also invented a seismograph almost 2000 years ago. Other inventions like the porcelain and paper money surely have profound effects on man's daily life. But sadly, instead of following the path of inventing rockets and weapons, the Chinese used gun powder for leisure and pleasure: making fire crackers and fireworks. Perhaps the Chinese are innately peace-loving ! On the other hand, the Europeans made deadly weapons like rifles and cannons to conquer and colonize the world with their gunboat policy. Now the Americans go one step further: they have even established theIn actual fact, China lagged behind the west only in the last 300 years or so.Even in the seven great voyages of exploration by admiral Zheng He 600 years ago all the way to Africa, his treasure ships were very much bigger than Columbus' small vessels:Scale models of Zheng He's ship compared to Columbus's vessel.And, while European sailors in those days were plagued by scurvy (a disease caused by a lack of vitamin C), it was never a problem in Admiral Zheng He's fleet, because the Chinese grew vegetables (and fruits?) on their ships. Historically, Chinese might not be the greatest theorists, but they were great observers of phenomena and they made good use of their observations in daily life. And we should note that they have today placed both theory and practice in relative importance.As mentioned earlier on the First Industrial Revolution, which used water and steam power to mechanize production, the westerners fully capitalized on it. The Second used electric power to create mass production. The Third used electronics and information technology to automate production. The Chinese lost out to the westerners and the Japanese on all these counts. But in this coming Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is characterized by a fusion of technologies that is blurring the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres, China is seen ready to grasp the opportunity and compete with the rest of the world to be the top runner. And chances are that they will be the top runner. But being an ethnic Chinese myself, I know China will share her fruits of achievement with the world at large.",624 followers,Jake Godfrey,14.7K,103,2.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-documented-case-of-a-culture-going-backwards-in-terms-of-its-technological-development
21,"It is not difficult to answer the question.First of all, the Qing Dynasty had the largest trade surplus on earth before the first opium war.

There was no material necessity at all to change the status quo from which the Qing benefited the most.Second of all, the Qing army had always been keen on upgrading military equipment, contrary to the popular belief which is bent for political propaganda. We can even be very specific on that part.In the first and second opium war, the Qing army can exchange fire with the British (and French) army on the battlefield, but the former was poor in close-range combat so they were defeated once the British soldiers charged. This indicated the Qing army was relying too much on guns and cannons.And it was not that the Qing army was gathered to fight the British army, but rather the Qing army was scattered across the country to deal with multiple opponents and factions internally and externally (such as Russian, Mongol, Miao, Hui, Uighur, British, French and etc, like the British were fighting the Japanese in Singapore when facing Nazi Germany in Europe). This was very typical in the second opium war when there was also the Taiping Heaven Kingdom rebellion going on in the South. So the Emperor Xianfeng planned to get rid of the Taiping Kingdom first and then gathered all the forces to deal with Britain and France, but he died before the annihilation of the Taiping faction. So it was never an even match, to begin with.And the Taiping rebellion and some other rebellions had a lot to do with the failure of the first opium war and the influence of unequal treaties. In other words, they simply lost their job so they had to go against the government under some kinda flags. So the Qing was unable to have a stable development and reform to solve all the problems. The Empire was simply too big to manage and too big to fail that one failure was leading to a chain effect on every part of the body. This is why there were some radical proposals suggesting that the Qing should abandon Xinjiang, Mongolia, Manchuria in order to concentrate all the resources to develop and then think about retaking them later. The Qing ruler and bureaucrats, of course, weren’t out of their mind so they chose the conservative treatment under all the options available which led to Tongzhi’s revival.Later on, one major mistake the Qing Dynasty made in Tongzhi’s revival in terms of the military reform was not training enough modernized military officers but focusing on improving soldiers’ capability and better weapons. This was a tactical failure. In contrast, Japan learned from Prussia and set up the modernized military schools to train officers and they became successful. Without enough modern officers, there was a disconnection between the general and soldiers in the Qing army.Till the eight nations’ coalition, the thing got even more complicated. Again, it was not that the Qing army was gathered to fight the eight nations’ army, but rather other major factions were not involved in the war for political and economic interests (Southern China, and Northern modernized army under Yuan Shikai’s command). They stood aside and watched the “show”. In other words, the Empire was disintegrating and going to the warlord era.So the Qing Dynasty was not a savage when it came to technology, especially in warcraft, though it did lack motivation to become more industrialized before the first opium war. The difficulties they encountered later had more to do with the imperial management (objective difficulties and some subjective mistakes) rather than their willingness (so-called arrogance and ignorance) on tech.",5 followers,Jack Barrett,513,2.9K,6.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-documented-case-of-a-culture-going-backwards-in-terms-of-its-technological-development

OTOH, China did have better printing press.And here’s a Western text on Archimedes’ spiral.The illustration alone is way ahead of anything China ever had before contact with the West.Eastern math has failed to develop the necessary sophistication for direct scientific application that by the time of Copernicus (15000s AD), East Asia was still stuck with (figuratively, not literally): “I have 3 apples, I ate 1 apple, how many are left?”Galileo Galilei established his work before Nurhaci was even born (so don’t blame the Manchus). By Ming dynasty, China was already falling behind in cartography, that China never had a “real” map until the arrival of Matteo Ricci (利瑪竇).What about direct technological applications? Well, the best artillery during Ming dynasty was known as 紅夷大炮, made by Portuguese.Of course, that’s not the only reason. For a better part of 1000 years, the West also has failed to further development its math (early Christianity stifled much of Medieval intellectual development), and both India and the Middle East fell behind the West at around the same time (XVI Century AD) as China, despite head start in math.It surprises me (if not down right appalls me) that all these Chinese “engineers” know so little about math outside of their immediate areas of expertise. Guess the ultra-competitive nature of Chinese education means they can’t afford any “distraction” beyond their career goals. It has deprived a whole generation of Chinese from wholesome personal development. What happened to the Confucian concept of wholesome gentry class (君子)? Of the 6 gentry arts (禮樂書數馭射), we’re left with 書數 only. Most Chinese can’t even climb more than 6 flights of stairs (please don’t quote how many Olympic medals has China won, how well canNot saying post-modern West is any better, as they’re even less “wholesome” in their personal development (Kim Kardashian comes to mind); otherwise they wouldn’t be in decline at this moment.

And these military inventions provided the civilization spin-offs that improves agriculture, transportation and so on.The Chinese adopted a consensus based civilization whereas the Western cultures on the other hand depends more on aggressions, conquests, dissent etc… The west had to invent democracy as an arbitration scheme.Hence for the Chinese, to arrive at the best decision, they don’t have to run the gauntlet of mortal combat. But Sometimes consensus based decisions are bad.When Zheng He, China’s version of Columbus, toured the pacific and Indian oceans with the largest Armada of his time, his conclusion was not conquest, colonization and plunder. It was that the world was an interesting place, but that China doesn’t need the rest of the world.But we are now, humanity taken as a whole, a mature enough civilization to realize that we don’t need war in order to spend on R&D to improve our living conditions. We don’t need the spin-off of war to improve our conditions. hence in my opinion humanity will ultimately pick the consensus based model rather than the contentious and divisive one.Zheng He - Wikipedia",2 followers,Richard Muller,12.1K,2.3K,202.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-documented-case-of-a-culture-going-backwards-in-terms-of-its-technological-development

Unable to sleep he walked the pier. A small boat with just one fisherman had docked and inside the boat were several large tuna.“Only a little while”“Why don’t you stay out longer and catch more fish?”“I have enough to support my family and give a few to friends,”“But …. What do you do with the rest of your time?”The fisherman looked up and smiled,The businessman laughedThe fisherman asked“15- 20 years, 25 tops”“But what then?”The businessman laughed and said“Millions? Then what?”The businessman replied,Where this anecdote can be misleading is it presumes theBut what if the businessman continued by saying,The fisherman must then eitherThis would make the anecdote more historically accurate.Because if the Chinese fisherman was a metaphor forThis is also true for today.If a country or corporation becomes too satisfied then they’ll eventually be conquered by the competition.But what if there was no competition?If there wasn’t a West then Imperial China would likely still exist. Keep in mind a Chinese person of 1400 A.D. lived a remarkably similar life to a person of 1800 A.D and so it’s conceivable to believe that without the West a Chinese person of 1800 A.D. would live a similar life to a person of 2200 A.D.And life was better for the Chinese when they were stuck in theIn businessIn governmentLet’s go forward in time…I believe the pace of change will eventually slow down as global power continues to centralize into fewer and fewer hands.Eventually the global elite will come together under the premise,Now hopefully this decision will be made by some sort of coalition of democratic nations.Because if it doesn’t happen through democratic consensus then it will happen by dictatorial decree.“Artificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia but for all humankind, whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.” — Vladimir PutinBecause left unabated the race for better A.I. will eventually lead to someone getting the upper-hand and so, for example, the Chinese could unlock an artificial intelligence so powerful it gives them control over all the global satellites and therefore the globe.And then they would build a metaphorical great wall around any further technological development that could threaten their power, and then who knows, the world could slowly devolve back into something that looks a little like Imperial China.And as long as there aren’t any alien forces lurking upon the horizon, technology could stay stopped for a long, long time because the only people who could tear down the wall would be the people guarding it.I hope this answer gives you a greater sense of purpose because we can control how the wall is built.
