(#8)What else you know depends on your profession.If you are a Geologist, you might know what some elements look like in nature.If you are a Miner, you might know how to extract some of them from the earth.If you are a Refining Plant Manager you might know how to refine some of them.If you are a Materials Scientist or Metallurgist you might know how to combine some of them into polymers or alloys.If you are an Engineer you might know how to design parts of a cellphone, but probably only some of the parts.If you are a Mechanist or Factory Worker you might know how to build some of the parts.If you are a Software Engineer you might know how to program some of the electronics.What we are getting at is that there is no such thing as a “Cellphone Maker”.But it gets worse.While the professions listed above know aspects of how to make a cellphone, they also rely on other technology in order to do their jobs.For the Geologist, lets say he really knows his rocks and doesn’t need any fancy electronic testing equipment, which is a good thing, because such equipment is just as complex as a cellphone.But he needs the Miner to dig and get at rocks and oil underground before he can identify them. For this, theSo before we can start making a cell phone, we’re going to need to make an steel pickaxe.How to make an Steel Pickaxe:Oops. We don’t have a pickaxe yet, that’s what we’re trying to make.

We need leather first. Where are we going to get leather?How to make Leather:Oops. We don’t have any cows because they haven’t been domesticated yet. We’ll have to make our leather out of something else, such as a deer.How to kill a Deer:Really? A bow and arrow? How do we make that? Better just look for a dead deer lying around somewhere.

It seems like technology is progressing really fast today, but that is because of all the technology that literally took ages to figure out.How long would it take to figure out how to do any of the simple technologies above, simply by trial and error? It could take a really long time, for example, to figure out what Iron Ore looks like, and how to build a forge hot enough to melt it. Especially if you didn’t even have any idea that Iron even exists.I mean, come on. Everyone knows rocks don’t melt. If they did, how could we use them to build ovens. Right????So there are a lot of hurdles. But once a technology has been figured out, we can build on it to create the next step.These days, we’ve figured out enough things to do a lot. We’ve also figured out something called science, which is the art of figuring out new things.Tasks that were once really hard, become much easier.

For quite a while after that, we were still just spending time surviving. Language is evolving, we’re doing the hunter gatherer thing. Our days were mostly consumed with subsistence and learning how to express abstraction. There was no such thing as abstraction before we came along. We had to invent how to talk about the future, plan, and communicate with other tribes without killing each other. There were lots of things to work out with this new hardware upstairs.Finally, we learned how to control plants on a wide scale, i.e. agriculture begins. That was about 10,000 years ago. At this point, we have an abundance of food and we don’t have to chase animals around the land all year. So, we’ve really only had 10,000 years to develop anything resembling technology. Before we had an abundance of calories, we were too busy surviving and figuring out what to Do with a brain like this before that.If you think what has happened in 10,000 years, it is almost mind blowing. Everything in history, everything that has ever been invented, written, or built was effectively done in the last 10,000 years. Wow, incredible!Last thing, it was really industrialization that led to the acceleration of technological development. You have to have machines to build new machines. “Machine shops”, where they build parts for other machines, took off. From the early part of last century on, we built a ridiculous number of machines and figured out how to use electricity as a power source. Remember, that’s only about 100 years ago. Another wow. So, in 100 years, we went from a light bulb to a computer doing billions of calculations a second (that’s on almost everybody’s desk top). We built a huge machine, stuck a few computers, and some bottled up fire in it, and flew some humans to our moon. In about 100 years. Again, mind blowing.I’m almost scared what is going to happen in the 100 years, let alone 1000. We’re almost too smart for our own good.

When we filled that range some humans created new technologies of clothing, fire and shelter to extend their range. This expanded range is called the frontier.

New resources are found in the frontier enriching all. In this environment cooperation is favoured over competition, since cooperation brings more resources from the frontier into the center enriching us all.In the present age our frontier is interplanetary space, and beyond that, interstellar space. Interplanetary space is traverse by chemical rockets. The first large chemical rockets were developed in the 1940s and advanced continuously since. Investment in rocket technology reduces the cost of momentum delivered by rockets. This increases the mass flow per dollar between points where the change in speed is fixed to connect the two places. Thus development follows a well defined arc;At this point serious investment in lowering the cost of momentum delivered by rockets was abandoned. Project funding for atomic rockets was ended, and previously declassified materials were reclassified. Had funding and focus continued apace we would have hadThe founding of Space in 2002 resulted in a rocket with a reusable first stage. This dramatically cut the cost of space launch and allowed SpaceX to come to dominate space launch and earn significant profits doing so.It takes 52 days 16 hours to fly to Pluto at 1/10th gee using photonic thrusters.To perform interstellar trips requires vastly more energy. Yet, that energy is available from the Sun. The way we tap the sun’s energy at the scale needed is by creating an optical machine made of plasma. You see, the refractive index of hot plasmas changes with temperature. So, by projecting a pattern of laser light into the chromosphere to create an optical element that is capable of communicating, computing, generating controlled laser beams, and making copies of itself. So, taking an hour to replicate, projecting a single square meter of plasmonic structure into the sun it takes only 62.4 hours to cover the entire sun with an array of such machines, and capture 18% of the sun’s luminosity for human use. The entire sun may be considered a single optical element and thus can project similar patterns to nearby stars. Those stars signal back their status, and repeat the process, expanding outward. In this ways the interplanetary cyclers are upgraded to interstellar cycler operating at 1 gee. The sun boosts the photonic thruster at 1 gee to the half way point and light originating from the destination star slows the ship’s speed beyond that point. In this way humanity will be able to travel freely across the galaxy.All products and services diffuse into use in a well defined way.It is no different for interplanetary settlement or interstellar settlement. The interesting aspect it that population grows at 1.06% and even with unlimited life span, population wil grow at less than 2%. Innovators constitute 2.5% of the population, whilst Early adopters constitute 13.5%. So as soon as cost effective interplanetary travel and interstellar travel is available everyone will make use of it within 20 to 40 years, and the Earth will be depopulated, and later, the Solar System will be depopulated.Time Dilation and the Ultimate FrontierNow, after travelling 2.15 light years at 1 gee acceleration — half way to the nearest star — a ship attains 95.15% light speed slowing time aboard ship (and reproductive rate) by 3.25x. This distance is half way to the nearest star. Longer distances produce even higher speeds and higher dilations. Creating extreme dilations in time. This means that populations that are moving across the galaxy do not reproduce until they get to where they are going. Yet, the loss rate of ships scales with distance. At some point the loss at a given range equals the total births within the volume of the sphere with that range. Beyond that range, the number of humans fall off. Humans becoming increasingly rare beyond this range. Even if starships are safer than sitting in your living room, this will occur because of time dilation.This is the final condition of a technical species. Occupying a sphere of over a billion stars that is 10,000 light years across, commanding vast material and energy resources, living a cooperative life style in a post scarcity civilisation.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,1999,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-pyramids-havent-been-fully-explored-with-robots-or-advanced-technology-There-should-be-a-way-where-the-ancient-workers-led-the-pharaohs-sarcophagus-to-the-main-room

Amazingly blameworthy!I’d at least think there was some standard thing to do with apps, or perhaps some kind of locational research network that could be going on by now.What if Starbux had been more about research, or if they converted public libraries to gamified knowledge networking centers? Some of this would be a big improvement. Although, people say not everyone is like Nathan, or your local programmer, or has much of an agenda anyway.You’d think people would have purpose in their lives with all the machines and pretense of scientific progress. I think the answer is to use more materials by Nathan Coppedge.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-pyramids-havent-been-fully-explored-with-robots-or-advanced-technology-There-should-be-a-way-where-the-ancient-workers-led-the-pharaohs-sarcophagus-to-the-main-room

Today's principle of nuclear fission reactor power generation is not fundamentally different from steam engines hundreds of years ago! Regardless of the current thermal power or nuclear power, it is heating water: heat converts water into steam, and the steam drives the turbine to generate electricity. (Note: The conversion rate of nuclear fission we use today is only 0.135%)It is most likely that human beings will not be able to ""go out"" the solar system, and even be ""trapped"" to die on earth!The nuclear fusion conversion rate is 0.7%. If nuclear fusion power generation is realized, it may alleviate the current energy crisis. It is not enough for interstellar flight. (Note: As science fiction says that ""Positive and Anti-Matter Annihilation"" is the most efficient, can achieve 100% quality conversion, can help us fly out of the solar system. )Realistically, if we fail to master the controllable nuclear fusion before depleting fossil energy, it is not only ""Civilization Retrogression,"" but the entire human sci and tech civilization will be ""locked out"" until we die. Because in those days we will be unable to ""organize higher-scale industrialization"" and not be able to further test our scientific theory.Human beings are powerless and insignificant. Think of Traveler 1, the man-made object farthest from the Earth, and the fastest man-made object. It takes 40,000 years to fly to the AC+79 3888 star of Ophiuchus. It takes 73,600 to fly to Proxima Centauri of Centaur. The interstellar voyage for it is just a simple fantastic lies. How negligible us? Please be humble~As for interstellar travel, if the person who does not wear the spacesuit leaves the surface layer, just like ""The deep sea fish leave the deep sea will detonate himself"", yes, in any other environment, the human body will be vulnerable to ""cannot withstand even a single blow"". Hey, we humans are the creatures born in the surface environment. We are destined to be inseparable from such environment, and it is even more difficult to cross the ""space measured by light years."" The earth is the cradle of humankind and it will surely be our destination and cemetery.Almost all of the Earthian is still bound by gravity, and it is difficult to fly out of it.Humans used to go to the moon with ""The primeval Chemical Rocket,"" but never went to Mars. Most people are trapped in the earth's tiny plot of land, let alone the universe.Although we can now ""observe dozens of billions of light years of the universe"", no matter how influential bigwigs can't leave the earth. They can only be like the common people who feet can't leave the ground. Exhausting the limits of the power of human tech can barely enough landing on the moon, its number can be counted on the fingers of one hand.The natural resources in the universe are inexhaustible, but we can only divide into some hostile factions, scheme against each other, intrigued, mutual suspicion, resorting to deception… excessive competition for such a little bit of unremarkable resource on earth. The human civilization at this stage is still too primitive.I really want to ""strive for the cause of human civilization in the universe all my lifetime"", but now I can only ""work for the sake of making a living and fortune"", such a life is not reconciled.We even have not been able to explore the earth.In terms of crustal exploration, the deepest borehole that our drilled has just reached more than 10,000 meters depth. Our drill bit with difficulty went to the bottom of the crust for humans and took a look at the edge of the mantle. This depth is only equivalent to ""The worm takes a bite of apple peel."" This is why we cannot predict earthquakes because even the ""normal state"" of the crust can only be inferred by indirect evidence, and the judgment of its ""abnormal state"" is even more unreliable.…SummaryIt seems that some of today inventions of ""redoubtable and formidable"" are mostly the advancement of Applied Science, not the progress of Basic Science. The development of personal computers is only consistently integrated and shrinking smaller, supercomputers are always stacking and piled up, naturally, their computing performance is strengthened…But quantitative change is unlikely to trigger a qualitative change. It won't bring us quantum computers.The so-called ""innovative tide and creative spoondrift"" is just something ""in application-level."" Basic theory has been stagnant for a long time, and superstring theory has not progressed for many years. In any case, ""Basic Theory"" is the ""source power"" of human sci and tech development. Tomorrow, we may have some room for growth in the application of tech, but the development of the ""fundamental power"" has not been reformed for a long time!Chier Hu's answer to Has fundamental physics stagnated?Chier Hu's answer to Do you think our technology is primitive?Chier Hu's answer to Why is medical technology so primitive compared to computer technology?Chier Hu's answer to What are some examples showing how underdeveloped or powerless present-day human technology is?","74,722 followers",Tiny Nair,776,689,28M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-has-most-of-the-advanced-technology-evolved-in-the-last-150-years-but-mankind-has-existed-for-millions-of-years

23,They wouldn’t be blind since that suggests that having sight is normal and the individual is deprived. That is not your question.The human race would deal with the stars like any data they experience that they cannot directly see. It is irrelevant to consider the stars differently from microbes or background radiation.Humans can detect these things regardless of their ability to be sighted,5 followers,Dave Williams,891,878,682.4K,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-pyramids-havent-been-fully-explored-with-robots-or-advanced-technology-There-should-be-a-way-where-the-ancient-workers-led-the-pharaohs-sarcophagus-to-the-main-room
24,Well. Perhaps it's equal to our discovery of radio and electromagnetic waves. These blind aliens (let's use aliens) will deduce that heat are transmitted though radiations and by detecting fainter radiation (light) they will conclude that the “upward” (or sky) is not empty from radiation. They would perhaps have more detailed star map since they were not bound to detecting visible light.It is possible albeit harder.,366 followers,Brett Alder,1.1K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-pyramids-havent-been-fully-explored-with-robots-or-advanced-technology-There-should-be-a-way-where-the-ancient-workers-led-the-pharaohs-sarcophagus-to-the-main-room
