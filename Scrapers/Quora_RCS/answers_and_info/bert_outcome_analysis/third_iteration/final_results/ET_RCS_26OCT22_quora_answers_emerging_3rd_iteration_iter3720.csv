That's where they built the wall, to keep those raiding gangs and banditsWest: Afghanistan. Again, barren mountain ranges, fierce warlords, no crops.

6,"The reason, I believe, is fairly simple.Europe has, for the past 1500 years, been a very divided place.

Yes there have been very famous periods of civil war in Chinese history, as well as external invasions mostly from the north. But for the most part China has always been China.How does this make a difference?Europeans made fighting a way of life. When you make fighting a way of life, your sole purpose for existence is to figure out better ways of killing your neighbor, who in turn is figuring out a better way to kill you. The fractured state of Europe’s political landscape meant that at any one time in Europe’s history between the 5th century until just prior to the mid-20th century - a span of 1500 years - European nations were either actively AT war, or at peace but preparing for war, or at peace but actively engaged in an arms race with someone they’re expecting a war with. The old saying goes, necessity is the mother of invention. War is the ultimate necessity. You have to invent, or you lose. The rapid technological advances that occurred in Europe were almost all related to the field of war. Metallurgy to produce better weapons, industrial advances to produce more weapons, food preservation to feed soldiers. The competition between European powers basically triggered the industrial revolution as countries were trying to out-gun each other constantly.China on the other hand, enjoyed vast periods of peace between its civil wars or external invasions. And most of these invasions were from relatively primitive tribes from the north. While fearsome and skilled warriors can be an extremely tough opponent, technological advances that can be achieved from fighting them come at a much slower pace. You don’t need to upgrade your spear because you’re confident the Mongols aren’t gonna come packing a bazooka. And the instances of civil war, of which there were many examples, were relatively brief compared to the 1500 year arms race occuring in Europe. The civil war would eventually end and peace and stagnation would return to China. While there were many MANY technological advances that came from China, the Chinese simply didn’t employ them the same way Europeans did. Chinese invented gunpowder, but it was little more than a novelty for fireworks. Europeans saw that same technology as a means to kill people. Different mindsets spawned different technological adaptations.When Europeans first employed their “gunship diplomacy” in Asia in the 19th century, the technology gap was tremendous. Because those Europeans had been using those weapons on each other for centuries, perfected not only the weapons but the industries to mass produce them, and finally started turning them outwards.","1,367 followers",Rahul Badami,16.4K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-did-a-small-number-of-Europeans-subjugate-and-humiliate-China-the-largest-population-country-in-the-19th-century-Why-so-many-Chinese-defeated-by-a-tiny-number-of-Europeans-Why-couldnt-China-invent-more-advanced

Overseas trade was so important, in fact, that for the only time in Chinese history the Southern Song Dynasty of the 1100s AD and 1200s AD had its capital on the ocean, in the modern-day port city of Hangzhou. (All Chinese capitals before and since have been deep inland, far away from the coast, like Beijing. Most Chinese dynasties except for the Southern Song deeply distrusted trade and the powerful, rich merchants that trade tends to foster.)The below is a model replica of a Southern Song Dynasty ship of the 1100s AD. It was quite impressive, being bigger and more technologically sophisticated than any ship being built in the world at the time. These ships had huge rudders and divided sails that efficiently tacked to the wind, and compare favorably to the Spanish galleons that the Europeans used for their exploration and colonization in the 1500s and 1600s (an example which is below the Southern Song Dynasty ship picture).China’s seafaring technology reached its apogee during the Ming Dynasty, in the early 1400s, when the Yongle Emperor recruited one of his trusted eunuchs, Zheng He, to sail the “Treasure Fleets” to demonstrate to the world the power and riches of China. The Yongle Emperor was, as far as I can tell, the only Chinese emperor since the Tang Dynasty who seriously considered maritime exploration as a primary tool to expand Chinese influence, and who put huge amounts of resources into making it happen.These “Treasure Fleets” set out from Nanjing, the Ming Dynasty capital at the time, and went throughout the Indian Ocean, some making it all the way to the East African coast. There were 7 expeditions that took place between 1405 and 1433.The below is an example of how sophisticated China’s shipbuilding technology had become. The very big boat was one of the flagships of Zheng He’s “Treasure Fleets”, which sailed from China to Indonesia to India. The much smaller boat was the European flagship that Vasco Da Gama, the Portuguese explorer, used to sail around the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa on his way to “discover” India in 1498. That flagship was at the cutting edge of European sailing technology. Just look at how massive the differences were in technological know-how.Below you can see a whole “Treasure Fleet” decked out, sailing the seas. Each fleet contained hundreds of boats, each boat with hundreds of men. In total, around 20,000 people would be on board one of these fleets, which made a fleet as populous as a contemporary city and the largest armada of its kind in the world at that time. And these fleets sailed for thousands of miles per trip. It was quite impressive. By contrast, Vasco da Gama’s fleet in 1498 contained four tiny ships and at most 170 men.China, as a result, would’ve crushed Europe if it had been competing as a colonizer in the early 1400s.Alas, that was not to happen. China after the Yongle Emperor’s death in 1424 and the last “Treasure Fleet” in 1433 turned in on itself and began to close itself off from the outside world. Subsequent Ming emperors dismantled the great ships of the “Treasure Fleets” and used the huge amounts of money devoted to maritime exploration into building the extremely expensive Great Wall, and into building and maintaining huge armies to ward off the newly powerful Mongols on the northern borders.It was a bad time for China to cut itself off, as it was during the 1600s and 1700s that Europe began to grow technologically by leaps and bounds. And it was colonization, and the continual competition it fostered among small European kingdoms (small in comparison to China, that is), that caused these technological leaps and bounds.It was the centralized nature of the historical Chinese state that led China to not explore, colonize and expand outside its immediate sphere of influence in East Asia.In the 1,400 years after China attained in the Tang Dynasty the technological, logistical and resource capabilities of carrying out long-distance colonization, there was only one period of sustained political division of warring small kingdoms similar to what characterized Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire—the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (五代十国), which ended in 979 AD when the Northern Song Dynasty was founded. This period of disunity only lasted around 90 years or so. Otherwise, all emperors who founded dynasties after the Northern Song Dynasty just took control of the previous dynasty’s powers with a rebellion or rebellions. As a result, there were no “warring states” that preceded the Yuan Dynasty, the Ming Dynasty or the Qing Dynasty.Because of a highly centralized state, any decision that happened in the imperial court either advanced or stopped projects that could lead to colonization. It’s not a great leap of logic to think that if the Yongle Emperor’s “Treasure Fleets” had continued for another 100 years after 1433, that one or two high court officials or emperors would’ve thought it would’ve been a good idea to take some land—and thus colonies—in exchange for all the money and trouble they were spending on these huge maritime expeditions.Unfortunately the Ming court turned very conservative after 1433, concentrating its energies on land-based enemies, mostly the Mongols. The Qing court after 1644 continued with that same land-based foreign policy, very much ignoring what was happening in maritime technology. And both the Ming and the Qing courts remained deeply distrustful of overseas trade, regulating and controlling it with a weird anti-outsider paranoia that kept foreigners and Chinese traders heavily monitored and restrained. It was an almost 180 degree policy turn from the openness, trade-friendliness and cosmopolitanism of the Southern Song.The Europeans, because they were so politically divided, did not face the same problem of over-centralization of exploration and colonization decisions as happened in China.Christopher Columbus is a great example of this.Columbus had this rather crazy idea that if he sailed due west from Europe, that he would eventually hit Asia on the other side. Astronomers and other learned men in various European courts countered that this was impossible since, considering the circumference of the Earth known at that time, he would have to traverse an ocean 15,000 miles wide to get to Asia. Columbus thought not, that the ocean was just a mere 3,000 miles wide and that he would have enough supplies to make it across to Asia. Neither astronomers nor Columbus, of course, knew that a huge continent lay in the way.Columbus, with his new ideas, first went to the King of Portugal to see if he could get the money for his expedition. The King conferred with his experts and advisors and turned Columbus down on precisely the grounds I gave above. After a few years, Columbus went to the King of Portugal again, and again the King turned him down—this time because Portuguese explorers had just rounded Africa and the King needed to conserve his money for expeditions to India. He then went to the courts in Genoa and Venice in Italy—at that time very rich cities capable of giving him the ships and money to sail across the Atlantic. They also turned him down. He sent his brother to the King of England to see if he could sell that court on his expedition idea. The English King turned him down. Columbus was finally down to the Spanish court of Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand. Isabella remained skeptical, but Ferdinand became intrigued. Columbus finally convinced him, he convinced his wife, and off Columbus went in 1492 with the necessary ships and money to cross the Atlantic.So Columbus had to be rejected by 5 rich and powerful monarchs before finding one who had enough faith in him to give him the money and ships he needed.And even if he had failed with the Spanish monarchs, Columbus could still appeal to and convince the King of France, the King of Scotland, the various kingdoms and rich city-states in Italy that were not Genoa and Venice, the Pope, the King of Denmark, the Holy Roman Emperor, and the various kingdoms and city-states of Germany. Columbus, in other words, had a lot of choice in finding his “venture capitalist investor” so to speak. His goal was to clinch one sale with one single monarch to be successful.Imagine doing that in China—a Columbus-like explorer with a crazy exploration idea would only have one court to go to, the Ming court. And if the emperor turned him down, that was it. End of story. There was no other recourse, there was no choice at all.So it was this hyper-centralization of the historical Chinese state that strangled what little appetite there was for exploration and subsequent colonization among the Chinese.","1,724 followers",Alex Neuenfeld,1.1K,2.8K,4.8M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-did-a-small-number-of-Europeans-subjugate-and-humiliate-China-the-largest-population-country-in-the-19th-century-Why-so-many-Chinese-defeated-by-a-tiny-number-of-Europeans-Why-couldnt-China-invent-more-advanced

True for building codes, true for the builders.It may look like modern Las Vegas, but really, it isn’t. Ur, one of the first cities, shows signs of early social organisation - the emergence of ruling and priestly classes ruling over a vast peasantry - but the technology was strictly Stone Age. Metal working was not discovered until 3,300 BCE, ushering in the Bronze Age.There are many ancient cities in the world, some in ruins in jungles, many others still occupied today. The first recognised civilisation is the Sumerian, and their baked clay cities in the Tigris and Euphrates region (ancient Mesopotamia, modern Iraq), notably Uruk and Ur, are dated to around 7,500 BCE, which makes them nearly 10,000 years old.Incidentally, the first buildings were followed by the first building code, but not for another 5,000 years or so. Perhaps the writing of Babylon’s “Code of Hammurabi” around 1,750 BCE is the proof of another first - the first bureaucracy!Archaeology clearly indicates progressively less advanced technology and social structures as we look back in time, with smaller and smaller human populations. Before the earliest cities, humans were, as far as we know, dispersed in small tribal or family groups, practicing the proverbial hunting and gathering lifestyle to survive. In most parts of the world, they migrated seasonally, following the game and the annual growth cycle of the plants they used as food.The process is described in Jared Diamond’s 1997 best seller, “Guns, Germs, and Steel”.From roughly 7.8 million to 2 million years ago, the most intelligent creatures on Earth were probably the Australopithecines (‘the Southern apes’), represented here by the species Australopithecus afarensis, whose most famous member is Lucy, the name given to a small female whose skeleton was discovered in 1974 in Ethiopia.But couldn’t much earlier humans, say, two million years ago, have built a civilisation from which no physical evidence survives?The problem here is that there were no humans as we know them that long ago. Two million years ago, the African hominid known as Australopithecus was just giving way to a new variety of bipedal mammal, Homo habilis (“handy man”), from whom in turn would develop the well-known human ancestor Homo erectus.“Upright man” was the most upstanding member yet of a rather crouched species. But he still lacked the brain capacity to build a hut, let alone a company like SpaceX.Equally important, the evidence for verbal communication and the development of language, with its ability to preserve and pass on ideas, would have to await the next upgrade.The evolution of stylishness: from left to right, three species of men, the first two eventually overrun by and absorbed into the vastly successful third, Homo sapiens (right).Anthropologists now believe that the transition from brow ridges in earlier hominids to the flat foreheads and eyebrows in H. sapiens was one of several key reasons why modern man becameLike the antlers on a stag, a pronounced brow ridge was a permanent signal of dominance and aggression in our ancestors, which anatomically modern humans traded in for a smooth forehead with more visible, hairy eyebrows capable of a greater range of movement.Highly mobile eyebrows gave us the communication skills to establish large, social networks; in particular to express more nuanced emotions such as recognition and sympathy, allowing for greater understanding and cooperation between people.The gift that set Homo sapiens apart from the hoi polloi is reckoned to be communication, and that skill has been attributed to changes in the mouth and vocal cords allowing the development of verbal communication; who would have thought that the last word in communication would actually belong to the much-maligned and neglected eyebrow?This work indicates that humanity’s first “language” may well have been… the facial expression!But the more important point to take from all this is that Homo sapiens appears to be the first life form on the planet with all the physical and mental tools necessary to build a technically advanced civilisation.But we are such latecomers to the scene that this feat could not have been accomplished before our own century. Archaeologists and anthropologists have a fair grasp of our species’ development around the world during our historical spread.There is unfortunately no gap in the record, and no unexplored part of the world, in which we could have built a society capable of space travel in a relative eye-blink, and then have left the planet, leaving no sign to show that our space-capable civilisation ever existed.The genus Homo emerged two million years ago from the small-brained homonid, Australopithicus, with Homo habilis (‘handy man’) giving rise to the most successful early species, H. erectus, whose maximum dispersal is shown in yellow. H. neanderthalis (custard colour) and H. sapiens (red colour) - us - emerged only 300,000 years ago, with nearly all of our cultural and technical development happening in the last couple thousand years.If we are assuming that Earth is being visited by outsiders with technology far beyond our own, and those outsiders are not humans, then the most logical assumption is that they are extraterrestrials. Personally, I think it’s hopelessly parochial to imagine that such people could not possibly exist, just because we insist on not believing in them. We know way too much now to discount the possibility.Every star that astronomers have examined in their search for exoplanets has turned out to have its own planetary system. After having examined thousands of star systems to date, we can say with some confidence that roughly 60% of stars similar to our sun have rocky planets in their Goldilocks Zone (the distance from a star that is “just right” for water to exist in the liquid state, considered a prerequisite for the development of life like ours).Considering that 100% of the Earth-like planets with which we are familiar have evolved intelligent life (!) it may be that the process by which life is created may be quite common in early planetary evolution. If true, it means that there are likely to be millions of other intelligent species in our galaxy, some of them thousands or millions of years older than our own.As much as humanity has discovered in the past 400 years, what might a species like ours discover in 4,000 years, or 40,000, or four million?What indeed. And there is some compelling evidence that a small percentage of UFOs, or ‘Unidentified Aerial Phenomena’ in current governmentspeak, are “real” vehicles, intelligently guided, and seen by many military personnel, including pilots sent in response to radar contacts or visual reports.Writer and investigator Leslie Kean co-authored an article that appeared on the front page of the New York Times in 2017, regarding Pentagon investigations of UFO’s. The article is regarded as a turning point in the Pentagon’s pivot from secrecy and ridicule, to admitting the phenomena are real and a matter of national concern.New Yorker journalist Gideon Lewis-Kraus notes that the Pentagon’s initial response to sightings of unidentified and unresponsive aerial vehicles by US pilots was taken seriously in the early Cold War era, until the US Air Force decided to reverse the policy and begin disparaging and ridiculing sightings. This led to the “giggle factor” around the subject of UFO’s, a campaign that was successful in diverting public attention from a real phenomenon.Unfortunately, it also created such a stigma around reporting or even discussing UAP encounters that the American government has, for decades, failed to acknowledge, let alone address, the fact that US air space is routinely violated by “aircraft” of unknown origin. Perhaps they are Russian or Chinese, and represent a startling technological advance by a near-peer rival of America, hence a high security risk. And if they are not from Earth, there is still an unknown element of risk in the fact that American aircraft cannot catch them, or generally even lock on to them with their firing radar. Jets that have attempted to close with them have reportedly completely lost power, resulting in the loss of the aircraft and, occasionally, the pilot.With hard sightings increasing, and being verified by other sensors,Last summer [of 2020], David Norquist, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, announced the formal existence of the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force. The 2021 Intelligence Authorization Act, signed this past December, stipulated that the government had a hundred and eighty days to gather and analyze data from disparate agencies. Its report is expected in June. In a recent interview with Fox News, John Ratcliffe, the former director of National Intelligence, emphasized that the issue was no longer to be taken lightly. “When we talk about sightings,” he said, “we are talking about objects that have been seen by Navy or Air Force pilots, or have been picked up by satellite imagery, that frankly engage in actions that are difficult to explain, movements that are hard to replicate, that we don’t have the technology for, or are travelling at speeds that exceed the sound barrier without a sonic boom.”Another source, an Israeli think tank calleddives down the rabbit hole with Defense Department insiders, scientists, and declassified material to find answers to a host of questions: Are mystery craft near-peer adversary platforms or exotic US platforms? What is the technology behind them? What kind of threat do they pose? What are the geostrategic implications? And what are we not being told?The report includes some stunning information from physicists who have analysed sensor data from military UAP encounters to gain insight into the technology these vehicles must possess to manifest the performance they do.After reading both of these lengthy sources, I will answer the last part of your question by saying I do not believe the most unexplainable UAPs belong either to near-peer nations, or to a secret US service testing advanced technology on the other US services without telling them. Too many highly placed politicians, generals, and other officials claim to have seen artifacts from supposed recovered UAP crashes, or to have stated that these vehicles cannot be from a nation on Earth.That leaves, to my mind, one explanation: they are from off-world, and further elaboration on that term must await better information.One imminent source of information on the topic is due to be released next month (June 2021): a Congressionally mandated report from the UAP Task Force, prepared for Congress and intended for public release, providing a massive amount of information on what the Government knows about UAPs, with a focus on a threat assessment.This UAP Task Force Report is going to be “big,”The report must include “detailed analysis of unidentified aerial phenomena data and intelligence” gathered by the Office of Naval Intelligence, theIt also calls for “a detailed description of an interagency process” that will ensure that data can be gathered and analyzed across the federal government. The report could document sightings from “all over the world,” Ratcliffe said.“There are instances where we don’t have good explanations for some of the things that we’ve seen,” he added. “And when that information becomes declassified, I’ll be able to talk a little bit more about that.”Considering the decades of secrecy on this subject and the institutional jealousy and compartmentalisation (referred to as “stovepiping”) that has prevented sharing of information, the UAPTF Report may fall short of what is expected. However, just the fact that the Department of Defence is now addressing the topic seriously is information in itself, isn’t it?",366 followers,Brett Alder,1.1K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-did-a-small-number-of-Europeans-subjugate-and-humiliate-China-the-largest-population-country-in-the-19th-century-Why-so-many-Chinese-defeated-by-a-tiny-number-of-Europeans-Why-couldnt-China-invent-more-advanced

There are certainly a lot of unexplained phenomenon and eye witness accounts, but nothing which could be considered as undeniable evidence.Assumption 3 - Earth is the only place in the universe where intelligent life formed.Again not completely unreasonable but potentially unlikely.Assumption 4 - These inhabitants were advanced enough to leave earth but left no mark.This seems very unlikely. There is no fossil record for them. Considering there are fossils that are 3.5billion years old, if there was intelligent life they would have left something in the fossil records. Even if you say buildings and infrastructure are destroyed, we, in our short history have already left our mark on the geological record.Assumption 5 - they all left at onceThat the entire population left earth. To be developed enough to leave would suggest a big population. But a big population would mean it would be extremely challenging for them all to leave. Again this doesn't seem that credible. If some remained why did their species not survive on earth? You could argue that they left due to changing climate etc but that seems to be finding a reason rather than a likely scenario.Assumption 6 - where are the creatures they evolved from?Although we wouldn't have to see fully developed intelligent animals, you would expect to see something in the evolutionary record which would develop into these intelligent beings. You would expect these to have remained, or for there to be evidence of these even if the aliens had somehow removed their own record.Assumption 7 - They want to come back?So they have travelled round the universe for potentially billions of years, but they want to come back here? Why? What's the reason? They have technology to travel round the universe, but choose to come back here? Why? Curiosity? I suppose its possible, but I wouldn't say likely.Assumption 8 - There is only 1 race of aliens.If we assume that the reports are real, then they seem to differ massively. There are the traditional reports, and you classic looking alien, but there are lots of others. With this hypothesis, that they are from earth, that would mean there are only one type. Perhaps you could say it was long enough ago that they have all subsequently evolved into different species, but that seems unlikely.Assumption 9 - they are sort of making contact but not reallyThere is a race of highly intelligent alien beings who sort of make contact, or who are inadvertently seen. Most of them are seen by randomers, in random locations. Why not stay hidden, or otherwise announce they are here? I suppose there is some logic that they want to see how people react without announcing to the world.Some of these assumptions are plausible, most are not. Put them all together and I think it is highly unlikely to be true. Do I have a good alternative? Not really. I would say that the most likely explanation for “alien” activity is that it is a number of alternatives.

If the spray has droplet size of 80 microns it will fall at a rate of about 0.2 m/s. If it is sprayed at 10 m above the sea it will take 10/0.2=50 seconds to fall to the sea. With a wind blowing at 3 m/s the spray would travel 50x3=150 m. So you will constantly have an area of 1000 m by 150 m with spray in. When the humidified air blows to land the chances of rain would be increased. It would cost a mere fraction of the cost of building another dam. I used a terminal settling velocity formula to calculate the rate of falling. It seems an extremely cheap method of humidifying the air and getting more rain. Probably a few lines of floating spray pumps would be needed.​Example: Suppose sea and air temperature above the sea and over land is 20 deg C. Suppose the relative humidity (RH) is 60%. Then the wet bulb temperature is 15.21 deg C. If we assume fine mist evaporative cooling with an efficiency of 80%, then the evaporation of spray will cool the air down to 16.17 deg C. This is 3.83 deg C lower than the 20 deg C. With sea at 20 deg C and air at 16,17 deg C the air can be heated from below by the sea. This would simulate the situation in option 1. I calculate that 1.9 g of water needs to be evaporated into every cubic metre of air to result in a temperature lowering of 3.83 deg C. If the spray generators were permanent, a cooler micro-climate would result, but sea temperatures would stay more constant and convectional rain should occur. Calculating relative humidity (RH) after an 80% efficiency fine mist cooling, I get that RH=90% after evaporation. With such a high RH, if you heated an air parcel 2 deg C to 18.17 deg C, it could rise 606 m by virtue of being 2 deg C warmer, and it would only have to rise 456 m for cloud to start forming (used general sorts of lapse rates).One may note that in winter minimum air temperatures in Cape Town are about 7 degrees colder than sea temperatures, so mist at night over the sea will hold in a lot of infrared radiation from the sea and significantly warm and humidify the region.",0 followers,Hatice Aslan,570,164,11.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-did-a-small-number-of-Europeans-subjugate-and-humiliate-China-the-largest-population-country-in-the-19th-century-Why-so-many-Chinese-defeated-by-a-tiny-number-of-Europeans-Why-couldnt-China-invent-more-advanced
