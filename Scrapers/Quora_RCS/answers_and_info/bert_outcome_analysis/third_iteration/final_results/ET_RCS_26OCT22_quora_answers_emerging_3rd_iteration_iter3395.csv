We have no idea what the “chance” of it happening was, or how easily it could have happened elsewhere as well.But my hunch is that if there are others, they are far away. I do think there is a very real chance that we are currently alone in this galaxy, at least. There could be many other worlds with life, but only what we would call animals. No technology-building species. Once one emerges, it (or its self-replicating robotic probes) would likely spread throughout the galaxy in a relatively short time.

We have to get the data from light of Bigbang to understand how universe formed. But I also said it may be difficult in future. Dark energy is continuously accelerating the expansion of universe and thus it may be difficult for us to capture that light. Today, we can see objects billions of light years away with our telescopes. But it would be difficult for future astronomers because objects are moving away to us with expansion of spacetime.

The average person may know that steam engines use the power of expanding steam to drive pistons, but, if provided with pen and paper to design a functional steam engine, would be unable to do so. They may know that light bulbs work by running current through a metal filament, but not be able to adequately explain how to remove the air from that glass bulb or replace it with a noble gas, how to generate electricity (something to do with magnets? OK, how do you get or produce decent magnets and what do you do with them?), or even how to make adequately clear glass and blow a bulb with it. Even relatively simple ideas often have supporting technologies lurking behind them. Moveable type and the printing press seem simple, but does the average person know that it requires oil-based ink to work well, and if so how to make that ink? Stirrups seem trivial and obvious, but they weren’t invented for thousands of years because they actually hurt the horse unless they’re attached to a saddle with a saddle tree, a solid frame rather than the kind of glorified blanket usually used on horses up through late antiquity. The best an average person is likely to do is communicate a few science facts but have little to back them up with.That said, there are one or two things which a well-educated-but-not-exceptional person might provide. Better math is the obvious candidate, since it translates well between languages and doesn’t require a vast web of supporting technologies.

We can tolerate their breaking into our trash on occasion, but when they break into our houses and take things from our kitchens, we won’t be so tolerant anymore.Their best and brightest will get into our stuff, and get killed for it.

We know we can… because we did it.The smart mouse with the half-human brainWe could do it without creating any part-human chimeras, too. For instance, the primate brain (including ours) is extremely dense with neurons. It has many more neurons than the brains of most other animals that are the same size.Simply giving, say, a dog, the gene or genes that make the primate brain so neuron dense should result in a dog as smart as a monkey. It would still be a dog, it wouldn’t have any undoglike behaviors, but it would be brilliant.Engineering true sapience, on the other hand, WOULD require using some of our DNA. We would have to ensure that the animals we engineered had enlarged cerebral cortexes, packed with dense neurons.That’s the reason why elephants haven’t crossed the threshold into sapience — their cerebral cortex has significantly fewer neurons than ours.But we wouldn’t do this to elephants.
