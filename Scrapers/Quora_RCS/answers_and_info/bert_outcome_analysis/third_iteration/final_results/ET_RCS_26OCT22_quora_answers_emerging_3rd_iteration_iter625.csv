The very heavy weight and very high dropping altitude granted its unparalleled ability of penetration. It can penetrate concrete of 60 meters or rock of 40 meters.This guy is GBU-43. It’s even bigger, but doesn’t have the ability of penetration.This guy: GBU-57GBU-57 is the most powerful penetrating bomb ever built.

4,"A CSE professor of IITB is indeed a great person, else he would never have been in the department. The greatness can’t be defined as such, it can only be experienced.

I guess I don’t need to list down his credentials now. He happens to be my far off relative and some of our common relative asked me to meet him. So i called him on his phone. He happily invited me to his office, without hesitating for a second. This was quite surprising for me, since I have experienced how people make you wait for no reasons and then there was this guy, extremely busy at his 65 years of age but still happy to meet a suddenly appearing odd relative student like me. So I reached his office on the said day and his receptionist halted me for the purpose of visit. I explained her that I am his relative and if you can please let him know that Atharva has come. He came out of his cabin and greeted me and took me to his cabin as if he was expecting me from last few weeks. He was getting phone calls at the speed of light, but still he was attending me as if I am so important person like a VVIP. We discussed all those topics one can’t imagine when you meet a Padmashree holder. He also told me his interesting marriage story and how fun it was to be a young guy.In the end I asked him a question, “Sir how exactly a person should be so that he gets successful like you?”. His answer was very interesting. He said “ I will tell you an anecdote. I am chairman of certain bank body where we conduct elections for nominating a board member.

6,"There actually aren't any. That's not to say that the industry isn't changing, though.The most impactful change in how houses are being constructed is prefabricated construction technologies. 3D printing gets a lot of popular press, but as I've mentioned in other answers this is most likely centered on how cool it seems, not how practical or useful it is. It is unlikely to dramatically impact the industry, barring some large, unforeseen changes to how it works.The issue isn't that there's no change happening, just that the technologies aren't new.

It is unlikely to dramatically impact the industry, barring some large, unforeseen changes to how it works.The issue isn't that there's no change happening, just that the technologies aren't new. Rather, they're improvements on what has existed for decades or centuries, depending on how you look at it. If you look at a new home in the US, all of the roofs are made with prefabricated trusses. This has been the case for a couple decades now:Improvements in the manufacturing and design process allow for more flexibility in this regard. There are now also prefabricated wall and floor systems:In China, they are developing larger precast systems for high-rise building construction, with more integrated components:It's important to note that, although this is somewhat revolutionary, it's simply a natural progression of mobile home design, which started as single unitsAnd progressed into more complex designs and compounded construction:Yes, that is also a mobile home.People are obsessed with automation currently, and more broadly the implication that automation will completely replace human workers in short order. That's been ongoing for centuries, and nothing happening in the construction industry promises to radically change that. We're not really on the verge of a revolution so much as seeing the natural progression and development of standardization, modularity, and unitized construction.It used to be that you'd go to the store and buy lumber to build a wall, but nowadays you can go to the store and just buy a whole wall. But still, that's not new. Arguably this has been ongoing since bricks were invented, around 7000 BC (or possibly even before that).",256 followers,Priyal Gupta,9.7K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Military-Technology-What-is-the-most-powerful-non-nuclear-bomb

Because I believe the above incidents reflects most of the youth’s paradigm towards IAS officials. Yes obviously the post is very prestigious, attractive but the engineering graduates should understand what they truly want to do! Nowadays,The day engineering graduates will start to understand what they want to become then maybe the preferences will start to change. If movie industry starts making some attractive movies on ISRO/DRDO/BARC scientists then maybe the preferences will start to change. The answer to your question depends on the mentality of our youth.
