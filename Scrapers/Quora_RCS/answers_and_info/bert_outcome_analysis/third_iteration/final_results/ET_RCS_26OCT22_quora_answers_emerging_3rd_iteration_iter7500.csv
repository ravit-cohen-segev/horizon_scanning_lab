We’ll call him Daniel (keeping his identity from getting known on here). While I can answer this, his life would be more interesting just because of the fact he became a multimillionaire from literally nothing just off of Bitcoin.To begin with, Daniel bought Bitcoin back in late 2010/early 2011 when it was priced at $0.90ish a coin. Very cheap. He was working at a tech company and wanted to “gamble” because he was tired of blowing his money on rent and other expenses, but at least he had $55k saved up. Remember, Daniel was 29 years old at the time so he had a couple years where he just focused on saving because he wanted to try and buy a place in the future.This is where the fun comes in. Daniel with his risky natureDaniel ended up getting a position with better pay and eventually was able to buy a house, and with bitcoin gaining popularity and moving up in price extremely quick, he decided to just hold it for the long-term since he had his short-term goals already met. This alone shocked him and he thought he won the lottery.Bitcoin has had its ups and downs, and after Bitcoin bursted its first bubble, Daniel was pissed because he could have locked in a mighty profit. This is when Daniel came up with the attitude to hold long-term for sure. His life was the same until 2017 when bitcoin hit around $11k when he sold.Fast forward to 2017: Daniel sells 2250 bitcoins each at around $11kWith Daniel being more of a new-money person, he did not manage his money well and bought 4 Ferraris (his favorite brand), a BMW X5, and a Bentley spending a total of over $1.5 million and also purchased a dream house worth $7 million. Easy for him to afford, but he only had around $17 million left which is quite a bit still. The rest of the money ($12–13 million) he bought a shopping center elsewhere and is making income from that, and also bought some rental houses and put $800k in high-risk but possibly long-term growth stocks.I won’t show his exact house because he did not want to be revealed, but it is about the size of this:It isn’t too big, but it is 6000 square feet in the silicon valley. Yes, houses are expensive for those who aren’t from here and this is why there are many places above $5 million here.Being a bitcoin millionaire to him he says feels like winning the lottery. Since I am in the bay area (San Fran) silicon valley quite often, I come across people like this. Not many, but yes, people have became millionaires from bitcoin.Fast-forward to today, we still see each other, he sold 2 of his Ferraris and bought a white Lamborghini Huracan and also a new Tesla Model S and still has the cars he kept. He still lives in the same house and has more rentals to build up his real estate empire. He still has almost 3000 bitcoins left which he plans on keeping for long-term. He wants to see bitcoin reach higher levels. He wished he sold everything, but he has always had a vision for bitcoin so that is why he still have nearly 3000 bitcoins.Daniel travels once every 6 months but he doesn’t have a family. He doesn’t spend lots of money on clothes though but will eat out so he does live a wealthy lifestyle, but not what you would think for someone worth $20 million if he didn’t have the cars and house. Oh, he also doesn’t have the career he had before, he mainly focuses on managing his real estate portfolio, keeping track of bitcoin, and his other investments.With all of Daniel’s assets and bitcoin left, I would sayUpdateDaniel currently has around 2500 bitcoins he still plans on keeping. At this time of writing, the value of these alone would be around $85 million. He sold a few hundred bitcoins to fund another small real estate project and invest in some stocks which have done really well, and he told me that between his stocks and small real estate project, this also added another $60 million to his net worth.Thus, with what he has done to increase his wealth and such, he is on track to beingLook at what happened to GameStop stock and other companies over last several weeks. Money can and still will be made with other things. Don’t think it is impossible to be like Daniel.","1,306 followers",Romano Miller,4.2K,497,7.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-be-a-Bitcoin-millionarie

Took only a few months to realize it. I traveled for a bit, spent a ton, had a lot of fun, ate everything I could find, everywhere I could find it. Saw places I never thought I’d see, did things I never thought I could afford.It was surreal, and fun, at first. It gets old though and soon the necessity to return to normal life compels you.For a variety of reasons I didn’t tell anyone in my family. Took care of my parents, my grandparents and direct family. Bought some nice gifts for Christmas and took some time to really think about life and what exactly it meant to me now.Everything has changed though. My friends and how they acted around me more than anything. Thankfully my closest friends were equally invested and one even made more than me.I’d say the reality of being wealthy after a lifetime of mediocrity was the biggest shock to me. It’s taken a while to really settle in and understand my new station in life. Deep down I’m still the same guy but no one treats me like I am.I still have all the same problems of course. I just don’t worry about where my next meal is going to come from.I will say it’s sad when everyone around you expects you to share your money, and perhaps I should, I’m just more concerned about my kids education and future safety at this point. I spent a lot but I saved a lot as well.I don’t need people coming at me about money. I have a good amount left but I’m living a common meager life again, just relaxing, patiently awaiting the next run. I have no interest in living outside my means and overspending at this point. Having a few million is nice but it doesn’t last in this world if taken for granted.Perhaps this next run will propel my life into a whole new category. Perhaps it’ll never happen.

Although, it is Bitcoin code that lies in the basis of LTC, the coin is much “lighter” than its predecessor. In particular, miners can mine blocks in the network many times faster, and therefore LTC transactions are much “faster”.

Although, it is Bitcoin code that lies in the basis of LTC, the coin is much “lighter” than its predecessor. In particular, miners can mine blocks in the network many times faster, and therefore LTC transactions are much “faster”. For example, now the extraction of a block in the bitcoin blockchain takes about 10 minutes, while for Litecoin this figure is 2.5 minutes.A lot of people do not know there are so many ways to earn cryptocurrencies by investing legitimately in platforms like www.coastminers.tech where they can get double of their investment in 7 days without losing them(thank me later).There are other features. Litecoin is based on the Scrypt algorithm, unlike BTC, which runs on SHA-256. It is more resistant to mining on specialised ASIC devices, which supports “equality” in the system. Therefore, ordinary users can get LTC on their home PCs without huge cash injections.Such features made LTC one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world. Now, according to Coinmarketcap, Litecoin ranks 6th in terms of market capitalisation, which is at $ 5.4 billion. And if bitcoin in a crypto community is called “gold”, then LTC is called silver.Already in August of this year, “silver” has to survive one of the main tests for the sustainability of its ecosystem. The developers planned to cut the unit’s mining premium twice in the last month of summer — a process known as halving. And it will significantly affect the life of this top cryptocurrency.Litecoin halvingReducing the block reward by half is an essential process for almost every cryptocurrency. It was originally incorporated into the coin algorithm, and is designed to control inflation in the ecosystem. After all, each cryptocurrency has its own “ceiling” of emission, which cannot be exceeded, otherwise it will become like fiat money.If we talk about Litecoin, halving in its blockchain occurs every 840,000 mined blocks. And, as in others, the mining reward is halved.Litecoin has already had one of the halvings. It happened in 2015. Back then it also occurred in August. But the price of cryptocurrency had begun to “prepare” for the event since the beginning of the summer. According to Coinmarketcap, in the spring of 2015, the LTC price fluctuated in the corridor of $1.5–2 per token. By the end of July of the same year, the rate overcame the $3 mark, and in July the price came close to $7. In August, after the halving, LTC fell to $ 3–4, and the exchange rate in Litecoin history did not fall below this mark.Such growth is quite standard for halving. The BTC itself is steadily becoming more expensive after reducing production. Why does this happen — no one will say with 100% certainty. The most common theory says that with halving, cryptocurrency supply decreases, and demand grows or stays at the same level as it supports the asset price upwards.At the same time, halving beats miners the most, because in the end, their incomes suffer. For example, before halving in 2015, the power in LTC systems collapsed by 15%. This can be explained by the fact that some miners have switched to mining more profitable cryptocurrency. But the “outcome” was completely uncritical for Litecoin. After all, a holy place is never empty, and others have come instead. Moreover, hash rates recovered very quickly, and they only were growing afterwards.What will happen to Litecoin in AugustAccording to the plan, this year the Litecoin halving is going to happen around August 7 on the block at number 1 680 000. Then the reward will decrease from the current 25 to 12.5 LTC.As for the price, it is already growing now. Since the beginning of May, Litecoin has risen in price by 20%. However, there are no direct evidences that this is happening precisely because of the upcoming event. Rather, this is due to the general situation on the market, which in May finally knocked the bears out of a rut. On the other hand, there are also no strong prerequisites for the growth of the entire crypto market — neither strong positive news, nor fundamental prerequisites for the bull run. So soon crypto enthusiasts can expect the same powerful fall.Anyway, as we know from the history, Litecoin may well continue to grow. And the closer it is to the target date, the more this growth will increase.There are risks, however. When reducing the reward for the blocks extraction it is miners, who are the first to suffer. And they can arrange “a rebellion on the patch.”According to a SatoshiFund developer Andrei Sobol, sabotaging halving might be quite realistic. Moreover, it is quite simple to do. You would need a hard fork to do that, however.“From a technical point of view, it’s very easy to change a few lines of code and release a new version. From an organisational point of view, you will need to convince everyone to use this new version. And that is almost unreal, ” says Andrei Sobol.Indeed, there are no visible prerequisites of the Litecoin sectioning. Usually, speaking on this cryptocurrency, they say “either good or nothing.” Moreover there aren’t many scandals associated with the leaders of the coin. However, it is also true when talking about disputes over the future of the coin. And Litecoin has not yet gotten its Craig Wright, who would actively promote an alternative chain of blocks.Of course, the risk of hash rates drop in the system remains. The possible effect, however, might be short-term and insignificant, just like the previous time.Subtracting halfHalving is an important event for any cryptocurrency. Canceling it means that the developers and the community are not ready to follow the original plan and are pursuing their own interests. Just like the Central Bank of a country that prints money for short-term gain. But the long-term effect of this is terrible — rapid inflation, a fall in people’s living standards, and a complete collapse of the economy. Venezuela is a prime example.Litecoin loyalists understand that and do not plan to abandon the halving. So, it is quite possible that the market will soon see another Litecoin rally before the production reducing",27 followers,Fernando Reyes,707,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-be-a-Bitcoin-millionarie

Then, we’ll zoom out and use a version of Chris Burniske’s cryptoasset evaluation model to consider what a fair price for LTC could be today under various assumptions.What Causes Litecoin’s Price to Increase?In contrast to some other blockchains and cryptoassets, Litecoin and LTC have a single, easy-to-understand use case: ever since Charlie lee created them in 2011, Litecoin has been intended to serve as frictionless, borderless, peer-to-peer electronic cash. That means that the factors that contribute to fundamental increases in LTC’s price are fairly straightforward:The increase in price that Litecoin has seen in early 2019 could possibly be attributed to a constellation of five factors, all of which relate to Litecoin’s value proposition as digital cash:These factors allude to a broader insight about how Litecoin distinguishes itself from Bitcoin and some other crypto projects:Factor #1: Increased AdoptionThe fundamental determinant of whether something can function as a medium of exchange is whether or not people, merchants, and institutions actuallySimply put, the more parties that accept a cryptocurrency such as Litecoin, the more value it may have. And Litecoin adoption appears to be steadily growing: LTC’s partnership with Spend, announced on February 13th, increased the number of locations LTC can be spent by 40 million locations. Where it was once a Herculean effort to get a pizza with BTC,now you buy a suabru off lots of LTCAlthough some sites, such as uselitecoin, attempt to keep records of merchants that accept Litecoin, there’s unfortunately no singular transparent data source to track the rate of LTC adoption by merchants worldwide. Responding to a request for such data, the litecoin SFOX that LTC is accepted by “tens of thousands [of] merchants worldwide and growing.” So, while it’s challenging to corroborate LTC’s adoption rates with hard data, it may be that the market is reacting to at least theFactor #2: Lower FeesOne of the original motivations for peer-to-peer digital cash like Bitcoin and Litecoin was the desire toAs Litecoin’s transaction fees decrease, it becomes more valuable as a medium of exchange, which can potentially lead to increases in LTC’s price. Litecoin has been in the spotlight for a while for its low fees, which have been proving stably low for even the largest transactions:We saw this factor rear its head in February 2019 amidst expectations of Litecoin Core 0.17.1’s release: this release was expected to reduce Litecoin’s transaction fees by 10x, sonews that release was imminent may have contributed to the climb in its price.Factor #3: Faster TransactionsBeyond transaction fees,Even Litecoin, one of the faster-growing blockchains, only has blocks added about every 2.5 minutes — if you need to wait for your transaction to be added to the blockchain before your payment can be considered validated, your shopping experience will be much slower than it is with cash or a credit card.Recently, however, Litecoin has been focusing on getting speedier — with a little help from Lightning Network.lighning network is aIt’s not clear that the increase in Litecoin’s Lightning Network nodesFactor #4: Private TransactionsBack in October 2018, Litecoin creator charlie lee said that he believed more privacy and fungibility were necessary for both Litecoin and Bitcoin transactions:I’m a big proponent of adding more fungibility to Litecoin, and also to Bitcoin. I think it’s one of the features of sound money that is missing from Bitcoin and Litecoin. […] [Adding] fungibility — something like confidential transactions, or something else — would definitely be good. But there may also be pushback from the community. It’s going to be controversial because maybe an exchange might delist a coin if it adds confidential transactions. We’ve seen exchanges in Korea forced by the government to delist privacy coins because the government didn’t like privacy coins. So Litecoin could potentially be a good test bed for things like that.Perhaps it should not have been surprising, then, when it was announced on February 7th, to add confidential transactions to the Litecoin network. Whether or not the market was surprised, it certainly seemed toAs Lee noted in the above quote, it’s not totally clear that privacy for a cryptocurrency is a net positive: it may, for instance, create new roadblocks for its adoption and support in a rapidly maturing ecosystem. However, insofar as people areFactor #5: Decreased Rate of New LTC SupplyWe can’t forget about the fundamental law of supply and demand: when there’s a decrease in the supply of an asset, all else being equal, theory tells us that its price will increase.One way in which the rate of supply periodically decreases for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Litecoin is through what’s called aWhile halving events are relatively infrequent and don’t attract much attention in daily price discussions, they’re worth keeping track of since they have such a stark impact on coin supply. You can track the times and stats related to Litecoin’s halving events at litecoinblockhalfLitecoin: A Valuation ApproachThe dramatic climb in LTC’s price naturally invites the question: Is LTC’s current price appropriate for its underlying value?That’s not an easy question to answer. Because cryptoassets constitute a new asset class, there isn’t anything like a standardized valuation framework for them yet. When we analyzed the ethereum price drop last year, we experimented with back-of-the-envelope valuations of ETH using DCF (discounted cash flow) analysis. That was possible because, since Ethereum basically functions as a big computer, we could analyze the inputs and outputs to that computer as a proxy for “cash flows” of some sort. But LitecoinOne possible valuation method, borrowed from Chris Burniske, is theMV = PQIn this equation, M = the size of the asset base (the cryptoasset’s market cap), V = the asset’s velocity (the rate at which the assets in circulation change hands), P = the price of the resource being provisioned by the cryptonetwork (the average transaction value on the network), and Q = the quantity of the asset being provisioned by the cryptonetwork. To determine a valuation for an asset like LTC, we first calculate P and Q, then make an assumption about its velocity, and finally use these values to calculate a projected market cap, from which we can arrive at a price per coin.Let’s plug in some values for Litecoin using the timeframe of the past year and see what the equation yields. (Note: all data for valuations sourced from bitinfochrts on March 14th, 2019.)PQ = average transaction value on Litecoin in the past year times the quantity of the asset being provisioned by Litecoin = $8,941 USD (average transaction value) * 25,206 (average number of daily transactions) * 365 days =The velocity of LTC is hard to calculate precisely since it’s difficult to tell how many coins are actuallyAs james discussed, the velocity of M1 money — the most liquid (i.e. easily convertible to cash) assets — is usually between 4 and 15. On the assumption that Litecoin is comparable to M1 money, we can explore the range of its valuations by setting V to three different values within this range: 4, 10, and 15.What, then, does this model imply about the current price of Litecoin — $60 USD, as of today? In the first place, it implies that LTC currently has aSecond, the model implies thatIt’s worth emphasizing two further points about this kind of modeling:The Future of LitecoinWhile Litecoin started out as a clone of Bitcoin, it’s come into its own since those early days as a cryptocurrency on a mission to give the world frictionless, digital cash. The more it’s able to succeed in that mission, the more utility it will have — and the more appealing its fundamentals will look. With a clear leader driving the project forward, it seems as if Litecoin is well-poised to execute changes designed to further improve those fundamentals.While the crypto space is rapidly developing, we’re still in its earliest days. If you want to keep apprised of the sector’s real growth, consider focusing less on hype and more on meaningful statistics like adoption, transaction efficiency, and modulating coin supply.",6 followers,Ryan Burner,1.7K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-be-a-Bitcoin-millionarie

There is no doubt that Litecoin has shown huge amounts of growth last year, making it one of the top ten cryptocurrencies by percentage growth.Another important thing that you should know before we get into our Litecoin projection is that Litecoin has a high trading volume. This means that more and more people are selling and buying Litecoin in the cryptocurrency market. Litecoin is fourth in terms of trading volume, just after Ethereum.After much investigations and research i have made about how to earn more profit on cryptocurrency legitimately, I will recommend libraforex Investment Platform and cloud mining(www.libraforex.io) as it has been relatively on for a while now as it was launched mid 2016 but has become the largest Cryptocurrency Investment Platform right now with a volume of over 150 million dollars where you get different ROI’s on your invested cryptocurrency after every 10 days. It supports variety of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin and other Altcoins.Litecoin Price PredictionsThere is no doubt that the cryptocurrency market moves very fast, making it very difficult for investors to decide how to choose the best investment options.In this situation, it is best to do your research to help you understand what the current market trends are. In fact, yListed below are the top Litecoin predictions, which you can use as a starting point in your research to help you understand the market better.Litecoin Prediction Using Technical AnalysisFirst, let us explain technical analysis so that you have a clear understanding of the basis of this prediction.The technical analysis considers only the facts of the past and present price trends, and trading volume trends. It does not consider things such as how good the technology behind a cryptocurrency is etc.Technical analysts run the data through mathematical functions to come up with price predictions. What is good for us is that we do not need to worry about the mathematical part as there are many analysts who perform the analysis and share it on the internet.Walletinvestor, a website that performs technical analysis, has made a 1-year Litecoin price prediction of around $0,000001. They predict that Litecoin could be a tragic investment option in the long run.Another technical analysis website believes that if Litecoin crosses the $220 mark, it will be the starting point of a further price rise. Their Litecoin projections, for the short term, is set at $300.Another kind of analysis, called the “Monte Carlo” analysis, has been performed on Litecoin. What it predicts is a price range of $6 to $507 for Litecoin up to November 2019.Yes, I know what you’re thinking — That is such a huge price range to predict! Right?Well, what we can take away from this analysis is that the price of Litecoin, like other cryptocurrencies, may change a lot this year. See, it is not completely useless!Litecoin Price Prediction Based on the Price of BitcoinThere are many predictions that say Litecoin’s growth will be higher than that of Bitcoin. Nobody really knows what will happen, but here are some good reasons as to why there are predictions like these.According to oracletime, the advantages of Litecoin over Bitcoin will interest many new investors. Their Litecoin forecasts for the end of 2019 is $1000, but there are predictions that it could even rise up to $2000!There is another projection by investingpr that expects the price of Litecoin to reach up to $1000. They expect that more investors will start to invest in Litecoin as they look out for options other than Bitcoin, and to cut down their risk.Just how Bitcoin is often compared to gold and Litecoin is often compared to silver…what do we do with gold in real life? Store it. Similarly, Bitcoin will be used for storing value, while Litecoin will be used for transacting.Yes, it is true that Litecoin has advantages over Bitcoin. However, it is also true that Litecoin might be losing some of its advantages which relate to mining and costs.So, as much as the Litecoin price prediction above might make you want to invest. You should first take a look at the other factors before making a decision.Litecoin Forecast by Experts Such as John McAfeeYou might be asking yourself, who is John McAfee? Even if you are just slightly serious about investing in cryptocurrencies, then it is time for you to recognize the name. John McAfee is a big-time crypto investor and a very active promoter of cryptocurrencies. His price projections can have a real impact on the prices of cryptocurrencies.So, what are his views on the future of Litecoin?John McAfee believes that Litecoin has not risen in value as much as it should have. He said that Litecoin can rise just as much, if not more, than Bitcoin. If we believe that John McAfee’s prediction for Bitcoin is correct, then who is to say that he is wrong about Litecoin.George Tung, a cryptocurrency analyst, had his say on the Litecoin price prediction. He said that the price of Litecoin rise as high as $1500 in 2019. He is not alone as there are many experts and analysts that believe the price of Litecoin price will continue to rise in 2019.How much can it rise to, though? Well, I guess only time will tell. But at least you now know what the experts are making of it.One of the reasons why many believe that Litecoin will perform well this year is because of the return of Charlie Lee, the founder of Litecoin. He left Litecoin and decided to join Coinbase, but has very recently become an active member of the Litecoin team again.Charlie Lee has said that 2019 will be a good year for Litecoin. However, he has refused to give his projected price of the cryptocurrency.WhatCryptocurrencies have started to get attention from Wall Street traders and investors too. Just like us, they couldn’t stop themselves from taking an interest in cryptocurrencies.Wall Street has lots of experience when it comes to making investments in stocks and other assets. Which means they should have a good idea of what is, and what isn’t a good investment.Kelly, the head of BK Capital Management (LLC), is a Wall Street trader whose job is to keep a track of the cryptocurrency market. BK Capital Management is a company whose focus is to make investments in cryptocurrencies. Kelly gave a Litecoin forecast ofKelly is positive about Litecoin because of the advantages it has over Bitcoin. He thinks that quicker transactions and low fees are what make Litecoin an attractive investment option for everyone.Try thinking of Litecoin as iPhone X and Bitcoin as iPhone 8. The only difference is that iPhone X is cheaper in this case.Litecoin Price Prediction 2020If you are planning on investing in Litecoin for the long term, then it is a good idea to look at price predictions for 2020.Introduction - Long Forecast is a website that specializes in giving long-term financial forecasts using technical analysis. Longforecast.com’s Litecoin projections 2020 is in the range of $780 to $1374.Oracletimes is another website that expects the Litecoin price to be $1000 by 2020.This projection is based on Litecoin’s 2017 performance —which was better than Bitcoin’s 2017 performance. However, it is not based on technical analysis or expert opinion. That is why you might want to focus more on other predictions.Another Litecoin forecast for 2020 has been done by steemit. They have set their Litecoin price prediction 2020 at $3500 for the following reasons:Other Factors That Could Affect The Litecoin FutureThere are a few other factors that could affect the future of Litecoin.TechnologyThe changes made to the technology of Litecoin itself is an important thing to take note of. Litecoin recently went through an event called a “Hard Fork”. Let me explain it to you what is a hard fork.Simply put, it splits the cryptocurrency into two. One part of the split is still the older version, Litecoin in this case. The other part of the split results in the birth of a new cryptocurrency, which in this case is Litecoin Cash. Litecoin Cash claims to offer certain advantages over Litecoin, but we will save that discussion for another time.So, what happened when this split took place? Well, something good should have happened, but nothing did happen. In fact, Litecoin has performed very well since the hard fork while Litecoin Cash hasn’t.Coindesk has also had its say on Litecoin price prediction. They believe that if Litecoin stays above $240 for a short period of time, then it could reach the $300 mark very soon. According to them, Litecoin could benefit from the positive news of the founder, Charlie Lee, and the launch of its new features.",6 followers,Ryan Burner,1.7K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-be-a-Bitcoin-millionarie

Be careful out there for there are so many fake investment website claiming to be paying.In late August or early September, Litecoin will experience a halving.A halving is when miners receive half as much compensation for mining a single block in the blockchain.Currently, miners get 25 LTC per block and will get 12.5 LTC in three months.Such a halving has occurred in the past as well in 2015 when miners were getting 50 LTC per block. But then, the halving didn’t affect the price too much, as a lot of coins were emitted during it.This year, however, it’s going to be much different. People are saying that 100% increase is likely, but that 100% won’t the for today’s price, it will be for the price before the halving, which could be around $150.What I think is that LTC will grow not by 100%, but by 70%. This is because the halving is always accompanied by coin emission, and this year it won’t be different.Around 23 million coins will be emitted during the halving, which will put it at a grand total of 85 million in circulation. Based on the fact that those 23 million are 30% of the current total, I believe that the price will be affected by around 70%, maybe 50%.The supply and demand will be corrected either way, so an increase is guaranteed.","99,922 followers",Alcatraz Dey,9K,1.4K,68.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-be-a-Bitcoin-millionarie

With cryptocurrency back in the news again, now’s a better time than ever to delve into the weeds and learn more about how to invest. If you’re standing, sit down, because here’s a breakdown of everything you need to know before buying your first bitcoin — or deciding not to.Bitcoin Basics: Why People Buy CryptocurrencyYou don’t have to understand bitcoin to realize that banks, businesses, the bold, and the brash are cashing in on cryptocurrency. In 2016, the price of a bitcoin was $710.09. On February 21, 2019, the exchange rate for a single bitcoin was $3,890. It doesn’t take an economics degree to know that the folks who invested in bitcoin a few years ago are now patting themselves on the back — but the good news is, it’s not too late to get in the game.It may seem hard to believe that a digital currency could be worth thousands of dollars. After all, unlike physical currency like precious metals or printed money, bitcoin is just lines of code. So what makes bitcoin so valuable?The worth of currency used to be stipulated by precious metals. From 1879 until 1933, for example, Americans could trade the federal government $20.67 for an ounce of gold. For the United States, that all changed at the height of the Great Depression when America faced mounting unemployment rates and spiraling deflation. In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt decided to cut the United States’ ties to gold, effectively allowing the Federal Reserve to pump more money into the economy than the federal government had the gold to back.The United States now has what is called a “fiat” money system, meaning the dollar’s value is determined by faith, rather than a physical asset. The dollar, for example, is worth far more than the value of the ink and paper that it’s printed on. Bitcoin functions by the same principles. Although the lines of code that make up each bitcoin are worthless in and of themselves, the international market has come to value each bitcoin at thousands of dollars. That’s because bitcoin is scarce and becomes more difficult to obtain over time. Here’s why:When the bitcoin program was launched on January 3, 2009, bitcoin was produced at a rate of 50 bitcoin every 10 minutes, or 7,200 bitcoin every day. As of February 2019, 7,200 bitcoin would be worth about $28 million, but at the time each bitcoin was worth just a few cents.According to the bitcoin program, however, the rate that bitcoin is produced cuts in half about every four years. On November 28, 2012, for example, the rate of production changed from 50 to 25 bitcoin every 10 minutes, or 3,600 bitcoin every day. That rate halved again on July 9, 2016 to 12.5 bitcoin every 10 minutes and is expected to halve a fourth time sometime in 2020. At this rate, the total number of bitcoins in circulation will approach a limit of 21 million.The rate at which bitcoin can be produced cuts in half every four years, meaning that the currency becomes more difficult to obtain over time. In fact, as of February 2019, 17.37 million, or 82.70%, of the total bitcoin have already been created. If the demand for bitcoin exceeds the rate at which it can be produced, the price will increase. That means investing in bitcoin now should be a sure fire bet to pay off four years down the road, right? Well, it’s complicated.If you’re anything like me, chances are your eyes glaze over at cautionary tales, words of wisdom, and long-winded explainers. That’s all fine and well for the real world, but when it comes to buying and selling cryptocurrency, the most valuable investment you can make is time. Cryptocurrencies are wildly unpredictable, even ones as popular as bitcoin. Although bitcoin is worth $3,890 today, it was also worth $19,783.21 on December 17, 2017.The value of bitcoin is heavily dependent on (a) the faith of investors, (b) the integration of cryptocurrency into current financial institutions, and (c) the public’s willingness to learn and use a new form of currency. Research is key when you’re investing in stocks, but it’s life-saving when you’re investing in cryptocurrency. That’s why we’ve taken the time to explain the technology behind bitcoin before showing you how to buy it. If you feel ready to leave the training wheels behind, you can skip to “Step One: Sign Up for a Bitcoin Wallet.”How Does Bitcoin Work?Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies operate on a technology called “blockchain.” You may have heard of blockchain referred to as a “distributed, decentralized, public ledger,” but the technology is actually easier to understand than that definition sounds. At its most basic level, blockchain is literally a chain of blocks — only not in the traditional sense of those words. When we say the words “block” and “chain” in this context, we are actually talking about digital information (the “block”) stored in an online database (the “chain”). Here’s how it works.You have all these people, all over the world, who have bitcoin. According to a 2017 study by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, the number may be as many as 5.9 million. Let’s say one of those 5.9 million people wants to spend one or many of their Bitcoin. This is where blockchain comes in.With other public recorders of information, like the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), Wikipedia, or your local library, there’s someone in charge of vetting new data entries. With blockchain, however, that job is left up to a network of computers. These networks often consist of thousands (or in the case of Bitcoin, about 5 million) computers spread across the globe. When you go to make a purchase using bitcoin, that network of computers rushes to check that your transaction happened in the way you said it did. They confirm the details of the purchase, including the transaction’s time, dollar amount, and participants.When consumers make purchases using the U.S. dollar, banks and credit card companies verify the accuracy of those transactions. Bitcoin performs this same function without these institutions using a system called “hashing.” When one person pays another for goods using bitcoin, computers on the bitcoin blockchain rush to check that your transaction is accurate. In order to add new transactions to the blockchain, a computer must solve a complex mathematical problem, called a “hash.”Solving a hash takes computers, and even supercomputers, an average of 10 minutes. During that time, computers also check the accuracy of new transactions on the bitcoin blockchain. If a computer is the first to solve a hash, they store newly-made transactions as a block on the blockchain, at which point they become unalterable.How is Bitcoin Created?When computers successfully add a block to the blockchain, they are rewarded with cryptocurrency. Earlier we discussed how the amount of bitcoin produced every 10 minutes cuts in half every four years. At the time of writing, computers receive 12.5 bitcoin, or approximately $48,625 USD, for each block that they add to the blockchain.If the tune of $48,625 sounds enticing, be warned that the process of adding blocks to the blockchain, what the cryptocurrency world calls “mining,” is not easy. In fact, the odds of solving one of these problems on the Bitcoin network are about one in seven trillion (12 zeros). To put that number in perspective, the odds of winning the jackpot lottery are one in 13 million. To solve complex math problems at those odds, computers must run programs that cost them significant amounts of power, energy, and money.Similar to winning the lottery, solving hashes essentially comes down to chance — but there are ways to increase your odds of winning in both contests. With bitcoin, arriving at the right answer before another miner has almost everything to do with how fast your computer can produce hashes. Just a decade ago, bitcoin mining could be performed competitively on normal desktop computers.Over time, however, miners realized that graphics cards commonly used for video games were more effective at mining than desktops and graphics processing units (GPU) came to dominate the game. In 2013, bitcoin miners began to use computers designed specifically for mining cryptocurrency as efficiently as possible, called Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC). These can run from $500 to the tens of thousands.Today, bitcoin mining is so competitive that it can only be done profitably with the most up-to-date ASICs. When using desktop computers, GPUs, or older models of ASICs, the cost of energy consumption actually exceeds the revenue generated. Even with the newest unit at your disposal, one computer is rarely enough to compete with what miners call ""mining pools.""A mining pool is a group of miners who combine their computing power and split the mined bitcoin between participants. A disproportionately large number of blocks are mined by pools rather than by individual miners. In July 2017, mining pools and companies represented roughly 80% to 90% of the computing power on the bitcoin network.In the real world, the power from the millions of computers mining on the bitcoin network is close to what Denmark consumes annually. All of that energy costs money and according to a recent study from research company Elite Fixtures, the cost of mining a single bitcoin varies drastically by location, from just $531 to a staggering $26,170. Based on average utility costs in the United States, that figure is closer to $4,758.What Do I Need to Buy Bitcoin?1. Digital Wallet:2. Personal Documents:3. Secure Internet Connection:4. Bank Account, Debit Card, or Credit Card:5. Bitcoin Exchange:Before You Buy: Is Bitcoin Anonymous?Anyone can view a history of transactions made on the blockchain, even you. But while transactions are publicly recorded on the blockchain, identifying user information is not. When reviewing the transaction history of your bank account, for example, you’ll notice that the names of vendors are included on your bank statement. On the bitcoin blockchain, however, only a user’s public key appears next to a transaction — making transactions confidential but not anonymous.This is an important distinction. International researchers and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have claimed time and again that they can track transactions made on the blockchain to user’s other online accounts, including their digital wallet. That’s a direct result of that Anti-Money Laundering Policy we mentioned earlier.Step One: Sign Up for a Bitcoin WalletIf you’ve made it through the winding road of explanations leading up to this point, congratulations! You may very well be ready to buy your first (fraction of a) bitcoin. The last thing you’ll need before you’re out the door is a place to store them.When it comes to choosing a bitcoin wallet, you have options, but the Louis Vuitton and Gucci of the cryptocurrency world right now are “software” and “hardware” wallets. Software wallets are mobile applications that connect with your traditional bank account. These wallets allow for quick and easy access to bitcoin, but the drawback is they put your money in the hands of a third-party company. Although the leading software wallets are trustworthy, popular third-party companies have collapsed, or been hacked, in the past. Much like you wouldn’t store thousands of dollars in your mattress, users with larger sums of bitcoin should consider storing their money more securely.Coinbase is the most popular software wallet available in the United States, in part because it has a website, mobile application, and stores 98 percent of customer currencies offline for added security. For beginners, Coinbase is the best and easiest place to start because it is connected directly to a bitcoin exchange, which simplifies the buying and selling process. Blockchain Explorer | BTC | ETH | BCH is another popular wallet connected to the bitcoin exchange, but the wallet is not supported by a mobile application. Users can also download mobile-only wallets such as Bitcoin Wallet for Android or Blockchain Bitcoin Wallet for iOS.Hardware wallets are a little more old-school but tend to be considered more secure because they are kept offline. These wallets store a user’s private key on a physical hardware device similar to a flash drive, which prevents hackers from accessing a user’s private key through an internet connection.Step Two: Connect a Bank AccountIn order to purchase bitcoin, you need to connect your wallet to a bank account, debit card, or credit card. Although these payment methods all perform the same function — exchanging traditional currency for bitcoin — they each carry their own set of fees.Transactions made using a bank account can take 4-5 days to process on Coinbase, but are generally recommended for first-time investors. By linking a bank account to your wallet, you can buy and sell bitcoin and deposit that money directly into your account. Bank accounts are generally recommended if you are dealing with larger sums of money. At the time of writing, bank accounts allow users to spend as much as $11,250 per week.Debit and credit cards, on the other hand, allow you to buy bitcoin almost instantly. The drawback is that on Coinbase and other popular exchanges, debit cards can only be used to purchase crypto — and even then, only in smaller amounts. Users cannot sell bitcoin or deposit money into their bank account when their wallet is connected to a debit card.Step Three: Choose a Bitcoin ExchangeBitcoin exchanges are online marketplaces where you can trade bitcoin for traditional currencies, say BTC for USD. Just like when you go to make a purchase online, you have options. There’s eBay, Amazon, Etsy, and Alibaba — to say nothing of the millions of private retailers who use these websites to sell their product. The same is true of buying bitcoin. Even if two exchanges trade the same cryptocurrency, it is likely that they each offer slightly different services. Exchanges can vary in reputation, reliability, security, processing fees, exchange rates, and cryptocurrencies available for trading. Before settling down with an exchange, date around. Here are our top five recommendations for where to start.Best for Beginners: CoinbaseCoinbase is the most popular and respected digital currency exchange in the United States. Although Coinbase only trades in five cryptocurrencies — Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ethereum Classic — the exchange offers a way to securely buy and store cryptocurrency in one location. Coinbase charges a one percent fee for U.S. transactions from a bank account or Coinbase USD wallet. Purchases made using a credit or debit card are charged a 2.49 percent fee. Plus, Coinbase secures cash balances up to $250,000 in the event of theft or breach in online storage.Best for On the Go: Square CashThe Square Cash app is a leader in peer-to-peer money transfers, right alongside PayPal-owned Venmo. The Cash app comes from Square, the company that makes those mobile credit card readers. Square is a huge financial technology company that includes many other services — one of which is trading bitcoin. The Cash App allows users to buy and sell bitcoin without processing fees. Unlike most online exchanges, the Cash App stores your bitcoin in your Square Cash Account, rather than a separate digital wallet. If you’re worried about security, however, you can send the bitcoin in your Square Cash Account to another wallet of your choosing. Square limits purchases at $10,000 per week, but there is no limit to what you can sell.Best for Bitcoin on a Budget: RobinhoodRobinhood launched in 2013 as a fee-free stock brokerage. In February 2018, the company expanded into the bitcoin and ethereum markets, along with market data for another 15 currencies, allowing users to trade cryptocurrency without a fee. As is the case with Square, Robinhood stores bitcoin in the same Robinhood account that is used for stocks. Robinhood is mobile first and just recently added a Web version, so it is best for people comfortable managing money from their phone or tablet. The drawback of trading bitcoin on Robinhood is that the application is only available in 17 states, as of February 2019.Best for Big Spenders: Coinbase Pro (Formerly GDAX)If you feel comfortable trading on Coinbase and want to step up your trading volume, you may be ready to switch from Coinbase to Coinbase Pro. Formerly known as Coinbase Global Digital Asset Exchange (GDAX), the trading platform uses interfaces similar to Bloomberg terminals and active stock, commodity, and option trading platforms. Coinbase Pro offers options to make market orders, limit orders, and stop orders in addition to traditional buying and selling. Instead of trading exclusively from USD to cryptocurrency, Coinbase Pro allows users to trade between cryptocurrencies, say between Ethereum and Bitcoin. Coinbase Pro charges fees ranging from 0.10 percent to 0.30 percent based on your trading volume. Most people trade less than $10 million per month and will fall into the 0.30 percent tier. If you want to try Coinbase but with much higher volume, this platform is the way to go.Best for Branching Out: BinanceBinance may be your best bet if you’re looking to diversify your cryptocurrency portfolio. The online exchange supports multiple currencies and even more digital currencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Litecoin, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, and many fledgling cryptocurrencies you may not have heard of. Many exchanges that trade this many cryptocurrencies charge higher fees, but Binance charges a flat rate of 0.1 percent for trades. While this is platform offers a huge range of currencies at a low cost, there are some bugs reported with the Android mobile app and some users have reported delays withdrawing certain currencies.Best for Buying in Cash: Peer-to-PeerIf you have a wallet, but it isn’t connected to a bank account, debit, or credit card, you can buy bitcoin using cash through a peer-to-peer exchange. Unlike typical bitcoin wallets, peer-to-peer exchanges work similarly to Craigslist for cryptocurrency, allowing buyers and sellers in the same areas find each other and meet up to trade bitcoins for cash. With peer-to-peer exchanges, it’s important to remember that you are trading high-value currency with strangers you have never met before. If you choose to trade bitcoin in this way, we recommend that you meet buyers and sellers in a public place with high visibility.Best PracticesYour bitcoin exchange and bitcoin wallet do not need to be the same. While most exchanges offer wallets for their users, security is not their primary business. If you do choose to use a wallet offered by an exchange other than Coinbase, we do not recommend that you use that exchange's wallet to store bitcoins in large amounts or for long periods of time. Instead, make your transaction and transfer your bitcoin to a more secure wallet.Step Four: Place Your OrderOne exchange, three steps, and four thousand words later, you’re now ready to buy your first bitcoin. It’s important to keep in mind that although one bitcoin costs several thousand dollars, bitcoin can be divided up to eight decimal points. That means you can buy 1 bitcoin for $3,890, 0.1 bitcoin for $389, or even 0.00000001 bitcoin for $.0000389 if it suits your budget.Investing in cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (""ICOs"") is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or ICOs.
