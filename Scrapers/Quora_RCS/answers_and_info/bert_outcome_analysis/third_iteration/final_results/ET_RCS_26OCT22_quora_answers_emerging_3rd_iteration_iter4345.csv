Their equipment was revolutionary, as an example they wore a flat green cap whereas their enemies wore a tall shako with a shiny brass crest, this made a good point of aim for someone with an accurate rifle.

Their equipment was revolutionary, as an example they wore a flat green cap whereas their enemies wore a tall shako with a shiny brass crest, this made a good point of aim for someone with an accurate rifle. Their uniform was a dull green, webbing was black, nothing fancy, the Portugese Cacadores wore brown and trained the same way, becoming as good as the British, so integrated into the Light Brigade did they become that one of their Colonels was known by all and sundry as Jack Nasty Face and when the army split up due to peace lamented the fact he would never be called his affectionate nickname again. Their rifle was robust and accurate, I can personally attest to this accuracy, by leaving out the bullet patch it was as fast to fire as a musket. The sword bayonet equalled them up in reach to the line infantry as well as providing a handy tool. Commands were by bugle call and whistle, no colours were carried in action. The riflemen were expected to be thinking soldiers as well as personally fit. They were both the advance and rearguard of the Army hence their slogan “ The first into battle and the last out of it, the bloody fighting 95th”. They have a special march which is 140 paces to the minute and were expected to keep this up for about Thirty miles a day , indeed the fastest march ever made by a three full regiments was in the Spanish July heat where they forced marched to the sound of the guns to the battle of Talavera. They covered 62 miles in 26 hours. Officers were a picked lot and rose high in the inevitable wars of the British Empire for example Sir Harry Smith rose to be Brigade Major of the Light Division, went to America as Brigade Major of the British Army that torched the White House, in India was the famous victor of the Battle of Aliwal and ended up as governor of the Cape of Good Hope and a Major General. For good measure he married after the capture of Badahoz, the capture of which spelt the inevitable defeat of Napoleon, the great, great, Grandaughter of Ponce de Leon the discoverer of Florida. I give you this to show how good the Officers were.I have realised I should show how Wellingtons Light Infantry were a game changer in infantry tactics. To overcome the lack of training in the revolutionary French Armies, the French developed a system whereby they threw swarms of skirmishers at the enemy lines and advanced behind them in heavy columns to smash through these lines. this was very successful. Then they met the British, unfortunately not good at all for them. Wellingtons tactics were totally revolutionary, heavy infantry wherever possible were on a reverse slope out of sight and cannon fire. On the front were huge numbers of Light infantry firing from long range with their rifles, keeping fire as the enemy drew nearer right up until the heavy infantry rose up in total silence, fired two devastating volleys into the now utterly disorganised enemy and giving a loud hurrah charged with the bayonet. Worked every time.I am happy to answer questions on this, because this is how a small professional army became the Worlds finest.",244 followers,Anthony Graham Dow Woodwark,1.2K,4.6K,1.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-many-potentially-revolutionary-military-technology-innovations-did-Napoleon-decide-not-to-pursue-For-example-steam-ships-and-cartridge-firearms
1,"Such a simple question to ask — Such an enormous question to answer, even for a person with an advanced degree in Military Science.Napoleon made a number of changes in military tactics and strategies.

Many modern military doctrines, organizations, and norms are still based on Napoleonic premises taken from a historical reading of the European war with Napoleon as recorded by the Swiss general Antoine-Henri, Baron Jomini in hisNapoleonic tactics""Under Napoleon, the French cavalry were, in contrast to the infantry, far more renowned for their action in masses than for their duty as light troops. They were deemed irresistible … [in] their superiority over the English cavalry of that day. …. And strange to say, this irresistible cavalry consisted of such inferior horsemen ... no soldiers are so careless of their horses as the French."" (The corps may have been Napoleon’s most meaningful and long lasting innovation. Military theorists believed that corps, separated by no more than a day's march, could move more rapidly than an army marching in column together. An army column might move with its rear more than a day's march from the advanced elements. A force of equal size, advancing in parallel columns as corps, extended over a larger front and a much shorter length, as the corps individually had more roads over which to travel. Such a formation could cover a wider territory when foraging, had a greater possibility of finding the enemy, and could concentrate quickly.[i] Archer Jones,",UNKNOWN,James M.

2,"Whooo, whaa … you mean you can transport ten wagons of supplies ten leauges in an hour on a few cans of this “fuel” thing? With just one or two soldiers??Whoa!!!Napoleon was a competent military leader and he knew the importance of logistics. It is said the greatest loss to France in Russia weren’t the men, France could still replace the losses and their enemies suffered just as badly - most of Grande Armee were Prussians, Germans and Austrians who would then fight against France and Russian losses were as bad as those of the Grande Armee.

Neither was the greatest French loss the cannons left behind in Russia, France could replace those in time.No, the most difficult to replace after loss in Russia for Napoleon were military supply wagons, who were a marvel of crafstmanship and impossible to replenish quickly. This, plus the souring political situaion in France, ultimately brought Napoleon down.I’m sure he’d be interested in modern artillery too, tanks, planes, assault rifles, the lot. But ultimately none of those can compete with the sheer awsomness of a supply truck.","29,949 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,4.9K,7.7K,249.8M,1995,https://www.quora.com/How-many-potentially-revolutionary-military-technology-innovations-did-Napoleon-decide-not-to-pursue-For-example-steam-ships-and-cartridge-firearms
3,"By vastly increasing the number of men in his armies.In the 18th century, armies tended to be small with highly trained professionals on both sides. For example, at the Plains of Abraham in 1759, the British had about 4,400 men, while the French had about 6,800.When Napoleon fought at Borodino 53 years later, he came with an army of at least 115,000 and was facing a force of at least 106,000.And it was largely because of Napoleon that armies became large.

Instead of relying entirely on highly skilled volunteer professionals, Napoleon was fond of putting together armies of lightly trained draftees and overwhelming enemies based on sheer force of numbers.Napoleon really had no other choice. He was short of highly trained professionals, but wanted to fight wars anyway. Draftees may have lacked skills, but they still had to be dealt with and he generally used them in front while holding back his best soldiers to take advantage of any openings.All European armies became larger as a result. Napoleon suffered massive losses in his Russian campaign, but a year later still had an army of more than 70,000 after replacing his losses with new draftees.But Napoleon showed it could be done. You apparently could get effective soldiers with very little training who were largely expendable. That meant you could still attack while the enemy was trying to replace its losses. For example, at Austerlitz, Napoleon lost about 13% of his forces, but the Allies lost about 38% of theirs and really didn’t have an army to speak of after that. They quickly sued for peace. Normally, losing 13% of your forces would break your army, but it didn’t even slow Napoleon down.","12,759 followers",Khalid Elhassan,900,1.2K,38.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-many-potentially-revolutionary-military-technology-innovations-did-Napoleon-decide-not-to-pursue-For-example-steam-ships-and-cartridge-firearms

5,"The are able to and they have! Several mobile phones and many more components are make in Japan. They have a very successful technology industry. BUT… they also have a higher cost of living and higher wages than say Korea, Thailand and many other countries in Asia. Japan doesn't use child labor and has very high safty and good working conditions.A better question is why doesn't Apple make any of there products in the USA.
