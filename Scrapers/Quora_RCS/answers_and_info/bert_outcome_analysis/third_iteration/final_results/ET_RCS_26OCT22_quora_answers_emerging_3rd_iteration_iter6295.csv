2,"All organisms evolve, but the process can be fast or slow.Due to the prevalence of assisted childbirth (Caesarean deliveries) in developed countries, women whose birth channels are too narrow to permit surviving childbirth are passing on their genes for too-small pelvises. This is changing the human form in developed countries (in undeveloped countries, these women die in childbirth and do not pass on their defective genes). If civilization collapses, birthrates in the affected parts of the world will plummet, along with a dramatic rise in deaths during labor.Also, people are getting prettier.All organisms evolve, but the process can be fast or slow.Due to the prevalence of assisted childbirth (Caesarean deliveries) in developed countries, women whose birth channels are too narrow to permit surviving childbirth are passing on their genes for too-small pelvises.

3,"The evolution of human beings themselves, and the evolution of their tools and technology, cannot be separated. They are part of the same process.That is because our ability to invent tools and technologies increases the selective value of our genes for intelligence, social learning, manual dexterity, etc., while, at the same time, our evolution of increased intelligence, social learning, manual dexterity, etc., increases our ability invent new tools and technologies.Ultimately, however, what actually evolves here in the","16,982 followers",Christian Winter,528,18.4K,79.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Are-humans-evolving-or-just-our-tools-and-technology
4,"If humans are evolving in ways we have not detected, we can certainly say that the advances in what humans create, advances in technology, in our knowledge of the universe, is going faster than any ways we might be changing. History teaches us that humans thousands of years ago had the same degree of creativity and curiosity about nature as we do…it just takes a sequence of discoveries and machinery and mathematical skills to slowly develop our tools and technology, and a culture that diminishes the importance of mythology that resents science, so that the discoveries made by humans are respecIf humans are evolving in ways we have not detected, we can certainly say that the advances in what humans create, advances in technology, in our knowledge of the universe, is going faster than any ways we might be changing.

Galileo and Copernicus had to fight the myth makers, but they persisted to help open up the exploration of the universe now and we would be unlikely to say that we had “evolved” since their time!.","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,742,6.8K,91.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Are-humans-evolving-or-just-our-tools-and-technology

7,"It’s important to remember that evolution is not *improvement* per se. Also, that a seeming improvement to the phenotype would be an impediment in different environmental circumstances.To the question: mutations still occur, but selection pressures have been largely modulated via technology and civilization. In the absence of strong selection pressure, ‘evolution’ tends to a random drift.","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,544,6.8K,91.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Are-humans-evolving-or-just-our-tools-and-technology
8,"We are always evolving. Even now, several different parts of the digestive system is starting to behave in some people like a new organ. Our illusion of free will and choice make us complacent thinking that we have somehow reached the end. In 100000 years time humans, or whateer they will be then, will look back at us as a form of clever primate and as less than them, just like we do with the highly intelligent Neanderthals and Homo Habilis (aka tool man)","2,288 followers",Emmanuel Fabella,2.8K,434,3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Are-humans-evolving-or-just-our-tools-and-technology
9,"No, there has been too little time for any significant biological evolution. Much of the technology we’re adapting to has arisen in less than one generation!We are simply adapting mentally to the changed conditions, as humans have always done. You could say we have evolved to use technology in general, in that we have evolved thinking minds that include the ability to invent and use technology. But not in the more specific sense you are asking.","220,631 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,783M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Are-humans-evolving-or-just-our-tools-and-technology
10,"We already have. The survival of Homo sapiens was always dependent on technology. Our success as a species and even our physical evolution were based on tool use as much as on language and social organization. We got this from our Homo erectus ancestors; there have never been humans without technology of some kind. Humans “in the wild” came with stone tools, nets and snares, fire, leather for coverings and for tools, and all kinds of other extensions of our bodies.But as to whether or not we’re evolving to fit a world full of smart phones and easy air travel, probably not. Not yet, anyway. OurWe already have. The survival of Homo sapiens was always dependent on technology.

Not yet, anyway. Our technological development takes place in a time frame expressed in years and decades, while meaningful evolutionary changes take place over tens or hundreds of thousands of years. There may be some kind of selective pressure coming from our current technological environment, but it’s probably a different kind of pressure than what there was a generation before that, which is in turn different from what there was a generation before",366 followers,Brett Alder,1.1K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/Are-humans-evolving-or-just-our-tools-and-technology
11,"We evolved to focus on tool use millions of years ago and we are still doing it. But in terms of your question, no, we are not evolving in this way physically, not on such recent time scales. What is evolving is our culture. Surviving in the wild is losing appeal to our youth. It has no relvence or value to the average person in advanced countries anymore. It is an art form and science that is maintained by only a specialized few.As a civilization, some of us choose to preserve these ancient skills, but the mainstream has abandoned it.

This is not so dissimilar to the way some people work hard to preserve basket weaving, or native languages, or oral traditions, dance, etc. Just a couple of generations ago, the average American could work on their own cars, rebuild their own lawnmower, build a backyard shed. These days, very few know how to do such things, because really they don’t care. Our brains were fully capable of coding advanced video games 10,000 years ago. Today, our brains are just a capable of learning the most advanced outdoor survival techniques. It’s just a matter of what information is available to learn and what our culture tells us is most valuable.Our brains are in fact far too primitive on an emotional level to function properly in our modern world. We no longer need to meet our needs with violence, yet we resort to it far too often. It is an instinct that served us well during the stone age and we can’t seem to evolve it away. Instead we struggle mightily to keep it hidden and under control.","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,544,6.8K,91.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Are-humans-evolving-or-just-our-tools-and-technology
