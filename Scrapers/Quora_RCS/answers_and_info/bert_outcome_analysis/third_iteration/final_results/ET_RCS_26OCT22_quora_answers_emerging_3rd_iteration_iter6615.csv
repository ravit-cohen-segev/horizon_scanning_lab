0,Battery technology has evolved a lot however mobile battery requirements due to the features and screen sizes have grown. My 1998 Nokia 6150i had a NiMH 900mah weighted 142g battery and lasted over a week of combined usage. However screen was small and could only do voice and sms plus had a couple if basic applications and games. Phones at the time were quoted for standby and talk time in term of battery usage. That had over 3h talk time and 200h standbyNow 20y larer my Galaxy S9 has a weight of 162g and a battery of 3000 mah but it does not last that long .

Reason…where do i start… is not a phone any more.. is a smart device. It has a large HD screen and more CPU power and features from an equivalent high end PC from 20y ago. And all of those need power. And with more features available we dont just use them to make and receive calls so usage is a lot higher which means more battery consumptionUnless you are able to put a micro nuclear reactor in a smart phone we will not be able to go back to the battery life of a phone from 20y ago. Batteries will evolve further but not at the pace to compensate for the additional demand,"3,727 followers",Sushang Agnihotri,1.6K,832,59.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-we-have-mobile-phones-with-longer-battery-life-it-looks-like-the-battery-technology-has-stopped-evolving

Just how is being ‘spiritually evolved’ supposed to help us put dinner on the table?Of your three options, the only one of any current practical benefit to human survival and welfare is technology.

3,"Would people be needing technology or religious tales if they were spiritually evolved enough?I’m not sure what ‘spiritually evolved’ means, but I’ll try to answer.I know people who have no need of technology — at least nothing beyond the occasional phone call, a bus trip, and some music. I don’t think they are any more or less spiritual than others I know — perhaps just more content with books, conversation, and a cup of tea.As for religious tales, who doesn’t benefit from a good story?

We rely on film, books, videos, theatre and others’ stories to guide us in our own lives. We need constantly to measure our behaviour against that of others.Religious tales are a special category, but perhaps not so special. Much of the bible relates mythological happenings, parables and moral fairy tales. Living in a western culture, it is surprising how much of the folklore of our ancestors, including those religious stories, gets incorporated into our daily dealings, whether we are religious or not.We can survive without all the available technology, but we still crave our stories.","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,544,6.8K,91.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-we-have-mobile-phones-with-longer-battery-life-it-looks-like-the-battery-technology-has-stopped-evolving
4,"I waited for a few others to answer this, because I hoped that someone else`s perspective would elucidate what you meant by “directly share memory.”If you mean what I originally thought when I read your question, then I’ll answer as if the question addresses direct mind-to-mind connection, a la “Vulcan Mind-meld.”(Minds AND universes melding: image from Google image search)In another question I answered, or maybe a comment I added,I waited for a few others to answer this, because I hoped that someone else`s perspective would elucidate what you meant by “directly share memory.”If you mean what I originally thought when I read your question, then I’ll answer as if the question addresses direct mind-to-mind connection, a la “Vulcan Mind-meld.”(Minds AND universes melding: image from Google image search)In another question I answered, or maybe a comment I added,If that’s the reality, as I suspect would be the case, then sharing mental “photographs” with another person would be impossible. Images experienced by one would be meaningless to anyone else, not because of emotional incongruities, but rather because of sensory incompatibilities.But if itThat said, there are two possible avenues for that connectivity to come about: evolutionary forces or scientific advancement. If mind-to-mind connections were the result of genetic evolutionary modification, induced or natural, then the possibilities for exchanging “pictures” through direct cerebral interaction are by the very nature of the staggering numbers of humans ambulating about the planet extremely limited. Such exchanges would suffice to satisfy familial and immediate social requirements, but would preclude widespread diffusion of single images to masses of humans.If, however, such connectivity came about as a result of technological prowess, it’s almost certain that the hardware method of achieving connectivity would include a recording capability. That being the case, it would then be possible to digitise and mass produce single images of artistic merit for mass consumption.The nature of such images would, I suspect, be of a nature that a picture considered artistically valid would have to be exceptionally masterful in its technique and/or visual uniqueness. Representations of banal, everyday occurrences would not be considered artistically interesting, but abstract, inventive or highly individualistic images would be prized.So in the final analysis, technique would become so technologically and universally accessible that only persons possessing highly individual perspectives would attain recognition as “mindcasters” of exceptional merit.Curation would inevitably become the defining determinant of photographic appreciation, with the individual “mindographer” being the most highly sought after commodity in image diffusion. This would probably lead to increasingly abstract interpretations, much like what happened to classical paint-on-canvas art. Extreme HDR and Photoshopped images are increasingly popular and recognised as an art form in their own right, but that doesn’t mean that technique therefore becomes irrelevant.Consider computer manipulation as an amalgam of possibilities “n.” As editing software increases both in kind and capability, that “n” grows exponentially. So a photographic artist has more and more possibilities at his disposal to alter and personalise images. Final results can easily be the product of many “layers” of filtration, and no two artists will choose the same type, degree, intensity or quantity of filtration to apply to an image.I too went “Photoshop Crazy” when I first accessed its powers, as this image demonstrates.(©Rik 2003 All Rights Reserved)Is it any good? Would anyone other than me like it? Is it “art?” I think only a curator could determine that.","47,567 followers",Mira Zaslove,1.4K,358,30.5M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-we-have-mobile-phones-with-longer-battery-life-it-looks-like-the-battery-technology-has-stopped-evolving
