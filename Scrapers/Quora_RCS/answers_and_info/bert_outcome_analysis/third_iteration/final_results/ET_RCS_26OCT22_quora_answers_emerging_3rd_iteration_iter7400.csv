0,"Cryptocurrency only has the value people give it. For example, the first things that was bought with Bitcoin from an actual company were two Pappa John's Pizzas on may 22nd 2010 for 10,000 bitcoins. Today, eleven and a half years later, that's almost 600 million dollars in Bitcoin. That's because people want it. There is no intrinsic value. If governments around the world made it illegal for trade, it would be worthless.To the next part of your question, mining Bitcoin is not easy these days. It takes a lot of power in both computing power and electric power. In fact, the amount of electricityCryptocurrency only has the value people give it.

Today, eleven and a half years later, that's almost 600 million dollars in Bitcoin. That's because people want it. There is no intrinsic value. If governments around the world made it illegal for trade, it would be worthless.To the next part of your question, mining Bitcoin is not easy these days. It takes a lot of power in both computing power and electric power. In fact, the amount of electricity used to mine crypto is more than many small countries use. You have to buy a really powerful rig and keep updating it to get a leg up on your competition or you will actually lose money. One of the clever things Bitcoin has built in is that as more coins are mined, the difficulty in mining them goes up. The number of bitcoins is capped at 21 million and as of August this year (2021) , 18.8 million have already been mined. That leaves only 2.2 million left to get. It's going to be so hard to get those last coins that it's going to take about another 18 or 19 years to do it. This keeps the interest up for mining.How crypto works it's basically everyone has a copy of all the transactions so everyone can agree on what was bought, how much was paid, and who (obfuscated) did what. These miners are doing the math to keep track of all that. They are getting paid in Bitcoin to do it. That's called mining. Time will tell however if anyone is going to be minding (mining?) After there are no free Bitcoin to be had anymore. I'm guessing that the creator (whoever he, she, or they may be) figured that big companies would be so invested that they had to keep processing. Maybe I'm wrong but I think people are just going to lose interest and the value will drop substantially. If it goes down too much even now… it won't be worth the electricity or the cost in hardware to mine anymore and it will be a horrible downward spiral and everyone holding the bag of Bitcoin is going to be burned.You can see now that people v are jumping from one type of crypto to another as they think it may be easier or more profitable to do so. If there are too many types of crypto, that would keep all the prices down also.So you see it's not free money exactly. It's an upfront investment and risky, you could lose everything if you aren't smart and know what to buy, where to do it (places with low electricity prices), and when to get out of the game. It's a lot like investing in the stock market.","3,398 followers",Raymond Scottman,1.1K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-cryptocurrencies-not-considered-free-money-if-it-costs-the-programmer-nothing-to-create-and-a-miner-could-mine-it-for-free-from-a-renewable-energy-source
1,"It can depend. Miners receive 6.25 Bitcoins as a reward for every block mined. As of writing this article, a single Bitcoin is worth US$47,392. This means that, for every block a miner adds to the blockchain, they currently earn US$296,200. The reward for authenticating transactions drops over time—it will be halvedHIt can depend.

To reduce the upfront costs, it is recommended that you join a mining pool. Mining pools allow miners to share resources and capabilities. Even still, the high volatility of Bitcoin can add uncertainty to the mining venture, and you must carefully consider that before you decide to hop on the crypto bandwagon.In this year, crypto is growing steadily with many projects in the market. According to latest reviews, HubCoin is one of the greatest choices for long-term holding. Since HubCoin is operated through the use of smart contracts, it eliminates the need for any middleman leading to gamers being fairly rewarded what they are due. It ensures that gamers are properly remunerated through its well defined and structured smart contracts and gamified systems.","3,398 followers",Raymond Scottman,1.1K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-cryptocurrencies-not-considered-free-money-if-it-costs-the-programmer-nothing-to-create-and-a-miner-could-mine-it-for-free-from-a-renewable-energy-source
2,"The Bitcoin algorithm is designed to make sure it always is. Bitcoin has a difficulty slider which the algorithm adjusts to target a mining rate of 1 block added to the blockchain every 10 minutes.If something happens to make mining unprofitable, such as an increase in energy prices, then a lot of miners will stop mining. The distributed Bitcoin algorithm detects that the mining rate is falling and starts to make mining easier. Mining will get easier until it is profitable again and enough miners start up to bring the rate back to 1 per 10 minutes.",27 followers,Benjamin Price,1.2K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-crypto-coin-mining-still-profitable
