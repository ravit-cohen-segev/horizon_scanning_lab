We are highlighting the top blockchain companies to work for today. We'll primarily concentrate on blockchain businesses based in the US and mention ideas like blockchain application development.Describe blockchain.Blockchain is described as ""...a distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network"" by Investopedia. Blockchain does not need a third party to ensure data security and reliability.Information is organized into groups called blocks by the blockchain. A block is closed and connected to a block that has already been filled with data when it is filled with data. A blockchain is a chain of data created by this process. Following the new block, additional data is gathered into another new block, which will eventually be filled and added to the chain.Since the information is immutable on the blockchain, it cannot be changed once it has been added to a block. Transactions are permanently recorded and are accessible to users for viewing (but not modification).Check out this article to learn more about blockchain.What Services Do Blockchain Development Firms Provide?Companies that specialize in blockchain development provide a range of services, such as:Top 3 Leading Blockchain Development Companies in the USHere is a list of some of the top US-based blockchain development companies to work for right now, in no particular order.1.

By slower, I guess you mean top speed. F1 cars are not designed specifically for top speed.Short version:Long version:Consider the lap times from the Top Gear Test Track. Hardly perfect, but this is the only direct comparison I can think of.Bugatti Veyron                         1:18.3You can check out the full list of times here to see how the F1 car blows away everything else, road legal or not.The longest track on the F1 Calendar is usually Spa-Francorchamps at 7 km (4.35 mi) and looks like this:Although you can see a few straights, to be quick here you also need a car that can take a corner at speed.The Bugatti Veyron set its top speed on this track:The difference in scale is obvious on Google maps. The straight here is 8.7 km (5.4 mi) long. Thats longer than the longest F1 track and although it is perfectly flat, the end is not visible from the start due to the curvature of the earth!The turns at each end are banked to allow the fastest possible entry speed.Obviously the F1 car's advantage in cornering means little here.What if you remove the downforce that gives an F1 car such remarkable cornering performance? In 2006 Honda took their F1 car to the Bonneville Salt Flats.Honda F1 sets land speed records at BonnevilleThey removed the downforce-generating rear wing, gave it gearing to reach higher speeds and managed a two-way flying mile average of 397 km/h, peaking just over 400 km/h. On a shake-down test they hit 413.205 km/h without the salt slowing them down, a little quicker than the stock Veyron but some way short of the Veyron Super Sport and Venom.Why is this?Formula One does not offer a blank sheet to race car designers. The regulations strictly limit everything about an F1 car. The tradition of an open-cockpit, open wheel car is maintained, greatly increasing the aerodynamic drag. The engines are limited in size and RPM, preventing the car from getting too powerful and fast. Recent decades have seen the engine size shrink from 3.5L V8/V10/V12's, through 3.0L V10's, 2.4L V8's and now 1.6L Turbo V6.Although the Venom and Veyron need to be road legal, their engines can be as large and powerful as is practical. A 7L twin-turbo 1200hp V8 powers the Venom GT. The Veyron is motivated by an 8L quad-turbo W16 (Edit: corrected from W12 thanks toIn conclusion, these cars are designed for two different types of Fast. On a long long straight, an F1 car will lose to these road cars but in their environment, nothing is quicker.To get some perspective, check out this video comparing the speed of various cars to Formula One cars. This was filmed at the famous Eau Rouge corner at the aforementioned Spa-Francorchamps track. Note that the vantage point is farther from the corner in the F1 side on the right, so they are covering more distance.Now thats what I call FAST!",UNKNOWN,N.

11,"I'm not a race car driver, but I have been a mechanic on more than one track car. So, this is my take.Because of risks and rewards. And, Newtonian physics. Once the object in motion starts moving outside of a straight line the stress of the outside force (the opposition of tires to the forward velocity) you start causing a lot of problems. Just going in a straight line that fast is extremely dangerous on tires.When the Bugatti Chiron did 304.77 miles per hour it did it at one of the only places on earth such a feat is possible-- at the Volkswagen Audi Group test track.

Just going in a straight line that fast is extremely dangerous on tires.When the Bugatti Chiron did 304.77 miles per hour it did it at one of the only places on earth such a feat is possible-- at the Volkswagen Audi Group test track. It is long, straight, and very precisely clean and flat.In order to achieve this, the car used a set of F Zero tires that were examined microscopically via X-ray to detect minor flaws. Land speed record attempts have ended catastrophically more than a few times due to the extreme centrifugal force causing tires to swell more than anticipated and rub on fairings. The Lamborghini Diablo had a rash of brake rotors that separated at extreme speeds causing the wheel to lock resulting in some pretty horrific [although surprisingly less fatal than you would suppose in many cases] wrecks. It doesn't hold a candle to the McLaren Senna or the Chiron. Most cars that have a design speed over 300mph have never actually done it because Volkswagen has the only track where a car with a long final gear can make it there. As far as I am aware, the Hennessy Venom only made it to the late 200s for this reason and most cars that claim faster like the Gumpert Apollo have not achieved the speeds capable with the gearing.As has been said, you can make a car wide enough and with enough grip to handle turns that will cause a driver to start hemorrhaging internally from the G forces or suffer spinal cord injuries but it's not very exciting to watch a race if by the end of the second lap all of the drivers die from exploding tires, internal bleeding, gravity induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC) and the resulting accidents. Racing is inherently dangerous, but people are not going to participate in races where they have a high probability of dying under ideal conditions. As long as a human driver is involved, your design constraints include the driver. Races at that speed would require straight flat courses that didn't cause suspension bounce responsible for the “death wobble"" in motorbike racing. Even a slight oscillation of the suspension can result in the car floating and a catastrophic loss of control.Auto racing is about pushing limits. It is not about killing drivers.",UNKNOWN,Anthony Perez,4.4K,8.5K,15.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-tech-blogs-to-follow
12,"Around a Formula 1 track, an F1 car would leave those cars in its dust. F1 cars are designed and geared to optimize lap times, not top speed on a four mile straightaway.People need to get over their horsepower fetish.

I would imagine if you allow ground effect design + powered-fan diffuser + no lower limit on the car's weight + no upper limit on engine + active-ride suspension and all the drivers' aids that F1 has banned in 1994, F1 can be much faster both on straights and on corners. The imaginary Red Bull X1 is close to this design. I wonder if this car would still be drivable.If you are interested in raw speed on straights, you can watch drag races. Why is Bugatti not as responsive as the imaginary ultimate F1? Because you can use a Bugatti everyday but an F1 engine/tyre/gearbox expires in a matter of 2~4 races (well types expire in a matter of minutes actually).",18 followers,Faraz Ahsan,563,388,1.5M,2014,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-tech-blogs-to-follow

15,"All of these answers miss the main point and that is that F1 cars are the quickest but not the fastest.  There is a difference between quick and fast.  Quickness is the ability to quickly change speed and direction.  F1 cars do that better than any other land based vehicle.  Having massive straight line speed may make you ""fast"" but it doesn't help you turn and stop quickly which is incredibly important for fast lap times on an F1 road course",6 followers,David Atwell,504,1.4K,13.9M,2014,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-books-about-technology-in-education
