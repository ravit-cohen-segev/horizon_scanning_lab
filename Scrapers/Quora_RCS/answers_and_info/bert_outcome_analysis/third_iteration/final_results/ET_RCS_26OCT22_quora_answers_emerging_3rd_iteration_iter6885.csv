Surgeons will always need nurses and technicians to assist them in verification of patient and surgical procedure, prepping and draping patients and creating a sterile field and monitoring that field. The surgeon's attention is on his work and he will always need assistance to avoid having to take his eye off the ball. The nurse provides an all-encompassing view of the procedure and the movement of patients through the system. Anesthetists provide for induction and monitoring the patients aNo. Robots are not autonomous. They are just another tool in a very large toolbox available to surgeons.

The surgeon's attention is on his work and he will always need assistance to avoid having to take his eye off the ball. The nurse provides an all-encompassing view of the procedure and the movement of patients through the system. Anesthetists provide for induction and monitoring the patients airway and vital signs. They, too, frequently require assistance from nurses and technicians, be it setting up scopes, assisting with intubation and many other things. Healthcare is one industry where no one in the operating room needs to worry about getting laid off unless they're a manager!","2,894 followers",Pulak Vatsya,2.1K,224,1.3M,2016,https://www.quora.com/In-the-developing-world-of-medicine-and-technology-will-robotics-and-computers-cut-the-demand-of-surgeons-and-first-assists-in-the-future
1,"I was into mainframe development for the first year of my career. I don't like it because it was an old technology only used by few organizations. After 6 months I started preparing for Java interview. I got job after 6 months. Now I am working on latest technologies on Java with reputed MNC. So from what I learned,1. Perfect time to switch is when you are not happy with your job.2. Don't listen to 2 year thing told by your Manager.3. Start preparing for interview NOW (dev,qa,supprt, etc.), Whatever interests you as a professional choice.4.

3,Yes.. You can mention 3 years if you could develop your expertise in Java that matches level of 3 years. It all depends on your skills that you acquire over 1 year period.I worked in mainframes production support for 5+ years and then took domain switch to Cognos TM1 and now I have overall 7 years experience. I’m still learning my new technology and trying to get depth knowledge.All d best :),"45,637 followers",David Seidman,576,3.6K,85.1M,2016,https://www.quora.com/I-am-working-as-a-software-developer-in-mainframe-After-completing-a-year-or-two-if-I-change-technology-will-I-have-2+-exp-when-I-change-company

5,"DICE has developed an engine were you can destroy a certain amount of things in an open world. It is called frostbite 3. It uses destruction 4.0 to make it look as realistic as possible.

7,"Yes it's possible.It's not easy, it requires an extraordinary amount of dedication, and most people who set out to do so never finish.The core of Minecraft being created by Notch Perrson is commonly cited as an example of it being possible.

But the game looks great at standard settings regardless!I sometimes like to play this game - I last played in April 2020. It came out in 2003. And there seems to be a bug in the game where the longer you play, the slower the game gets. I think it’s a combination of trains and the amount of cargo. Eventually, you just have to pause the game in order to do anything in the game. The bug happens regardless of how recent the computer is. I’ve tried various computers from the time it came out, to a modern day Ryzen 7 2700, and the Ryzen would be classed as a supercomputer 15 years ago!",UNKNOWN,Erwin,951,7.4K,52.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/I-am-working-as-a-software-developer-in-mainframe-After-completing-a-year-or-two-if-I-change-technology-will-I-have-2+-exp-when-I-change-company
