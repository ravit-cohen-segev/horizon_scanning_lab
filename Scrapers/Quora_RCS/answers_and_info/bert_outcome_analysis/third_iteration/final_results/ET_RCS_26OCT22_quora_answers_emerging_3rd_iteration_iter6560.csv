1,It is more interresting for old people to get into the trade very soon (like in 1–3 years) while there still lot of job in the trade and high demand than for kids to start learning it at 10 while 95% of them will never work in computer science and for the few percent that will try in a market that may have completely changed and may not require as many developers as before.,"44,321 followers",Kurt Guntheroth,17.7K,13.7K,167.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/As-technology-evolves-and-more-children-are-learning-how-to-program-at-a-young-age-is-it-worth-the-time-for-older-people-to-invest-in-programming

7,"I believe it had to a lot to do with the climate the people lived in. At the end of the last Ice Age, there were certain areas that dried up. When that happened, the people living there either had to move out, or if there was a water source nearby, they had to organize as a culture to irrigate the land. It shouldn’t be a mystery that the first three known civilizations all formed in dry areas near rivers: the Egyptians in the Nile Valley, the Sumerians in the Tigris/Euphrates Valley, and the people of the Indus Valley.Climate change and population growth enabled other civilizations to form elsI believe it had to a lot to do with the climate the people lived in.

9,"Evolution has no end, no limits, no potential, no rules. Relying on technology makes us evolve too but maybe not in ways most people like to think. So there s only 2 ways , one is to evolve and the other is to become extinct because of the evolution path we took of course.

The whole human race will continue to evolve together.However, we have largely superseded evolution with medicine.
