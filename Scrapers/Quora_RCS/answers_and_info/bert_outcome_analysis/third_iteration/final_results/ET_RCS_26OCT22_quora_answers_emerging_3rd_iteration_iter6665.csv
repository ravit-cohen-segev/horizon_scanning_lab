0,Nonexistent. the world would still be run by animals.We would never even form civilization or be anything other than particularly clever apes. or just die out outright,3 followers,Samuel Bateman,1.1K,102,56.4K,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-would-civilization-technology-look-like-today-if-humans-failed-to-evolve-with-thumbs-on-our-hands
1,"I am reminded of the great livestock war of 1379. The cows used their anti air missiles most effectively against the swarms of pig aviators.Oh wait, neither of them can build missiles or planes. Let alone fly them.Our technology is derived from our hands. In fact, it is because we are the only surviving primate to walk on two legs that we had a chance at dominance. This simple act frees our hands to carry, hold, and build. Everything else follows.No hands, no tech. No tech, no civilization. We would still be in the trees.","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,742,6.8K,91.6M,2014,https://www.quora.com/What-would-civilization-technology-look-like-today-if-humans-failed-to-evolve-with-thumbs-on-our-hands

3,"They didn’t, they evolvedWe don’t know exactly when we and our fellow apes diverged from other primates (including the various monkeys) to begin our own branch of the evolutionary tree but it may have been as long as 25–30 million years ago. That was when the common ancestor (of humans and monkeys, in your terms) lived. That figure is based on various evidence, including fossil evidence discovered in 2013.You have a very poor grasp of the theory of evolution which means that your question is based on an entirely false premise.","2,288 followers",Emmanuel Fabella,2.8K,434,3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-would-civilization-technology-look-like-today-if-humans-failed-to-evolve-with-thumbs-on-our-hands

6,"A friend of mine was in the Malaysian special forces (now retired), and he used to train US Navy Seals in jungle warfare. That was his specialty. But the Navy Seals, their specialty is very versatile. They can thrive anywhere, and that is the point. The same goes for many other special forces around the world.The role of special forces hasn't changed much, since ancient times until today. Their purpose is to play a role where conventional troops are unable to. So the classical tactics of assassination, sabotage, hostage rescue, even espionage still apply, no matter what era you're in.

Even space admirals would employ special forces for the same reasons. Keep in mind that training foreign troops and even fighting alongside them falls into the category of special forces, i.e. the US Green Berets.So to answer your question, the role of special forces won't change. That is the purpose of special forces. They're special, unique, and most importantly, special.

8,"Its a very interesting question. My answer is going to annoy racists.Let’s start with an accidental experiment, which started with a now-infamous drug called Thalidomide. When pregnant women took it for morning sickness, it often caused their children to have terrible birth deformities. Typically, malformed, shrunken limbs.These unfortunate children grew up, made lives for themselves. Some fell in love, married, had children. Often their partner was similarly afflicted. And then a second tragedy. Their second-generation children were often afflicted with similar birth deformities to their pareIts a very interesting question. My answer is going to annoy racists.Let’s start with an accidental experiment, which started with a now-infamous drug called Thalidomide. When pregnant women took it for morning sickness, it often caused their children to have terrible birth deformities. Typically, malformed, shrunken limbs.These unfortunate children grew up, made lives for themselves. Some fell in love, married, had children. Often their partner was similarly afflicted. And then a second tragedy. Their second-generation children were often afflicted with similar birth deformities to their parents.Why?There was no mechanism for this drug to have caused genetic damage. Some thought it might be an epigenetic phenomenon, almost Lamarckian, but this has now been ruled out.The key to the puzzle is that many women took this drug and didSo especially when two afflicted people got together, their bad genes reinforced each other, and the tragedy struck again. This time, with no drug needed to trigger the disaster.This was evolution of a negative sort modulated by technology. It’s had no permanent effect, because the drug was a mistake. But is it possible that there are similar things going on, driven by social pressures or non-medical technologies, and might some be beneficial?Another puzzle is the recent rise in the number of people being diagnosed as being on the Autistic spectrum. Some part of this is doubtless to do with increased awareness of the condition. Some would say, 100% of it.On the other hand, it’s clear that being on the spectrum short of a clear diagnosis of Asberger’s syndrome, can actually be highly beneficial to an individual so … afflicted? blessed? both?… in modern society. Such people are often very good at applying their entire intellect to a complex problem. In miniature, they often become the best computer programmers. But they may also be very good at running a technologically complex organisation.And again, who is a person with this sort of “geeky” mentality likely to fall in love with? Another similar mind? Reinforcement of whatever gene complex disposes people to be this way is very likely, and that could be part of the rise in cases of crippling Autism. While at the same time resulting in more children with the mild form, which is good for a modern, highly complex, technological society, and good for the individuals if they are not born too far along this spectrum.If — I repeat if — this is the case, then its accelerated evolution of the human race, modulated by technology, and in progress right now. This is speculative. we don’t yet know enough about the autistic spectrum to be sure about anything. (Although it’s fair to say that people withNow, I’m really going to annoy the racists amongst us.Let’s start with plant-breeding. Suppose you want a breed of flower, with larger, redder blooms? How do you go about getting that in a systematic way?You could just select the seeds arising from particularly large, red blooms each year, re-sow your plot with them, and after a few years of selecting seeds you would indeed find that your crop of plants had larger, redder blooms. But they’d also be smaller, weaker, disease-prone, plants. You’ve in-bred them too much.Plant breeders will do this simultaneously on two or more widely separated plots. They will then cross-breed the weak plants from one plot with the weak plants from another. And since the parent plants have different in-bred weaknesses but the same selected trait … you get an F1 hybrid. A plant generally without any weaknesses, but with the selected characteristic boosted further by being attached to a healthy plant! This process is called out-breeding, the opposite of in-breeding.What does this have to do with humans? Well, until recently most humans lived in villages and did not travel much or far. The village idiot was a well-known phenomenon. An unfortunate person created by excessive in-breeding, despite strong laws against actual incest. At the same time, humans consciously select our mates. Women try to choose men who are able to support them when they have children. Strong? Intelligent? Loyal? Add your own desirable traits.So, we have villages all over the world, each one a somewhat inbred, strongly self-selected gene pool. And then the industrial revolution happens, and people move to cities, and out-breeding occurs.There is some (weak and controversial) evidence that people really did undergo a step-change in intelligence at that time. The evidence for better physical condition is overwhelming, but is usually put down to better diet made available by better transport, and better hygiene. I’m not convinced that this is the whole story.I once met a classicist who argued that the rise of the Roman Empire could have been an earlier example of the same. The Roman army certainly moved people widely throughout Europe and beyond.Anyway, now we have industrialized developed countries all over the world, and aircraft, and mass tourism. Do I need to spell this out? Our future generations are going to be progressively more racially mixed. And if I’m right, very much the better for it. Out-breeding of the human race, stage two. Global, rather than regional.My answer to the question, if it’s not already clear: yes. Technology is evolving humans faster. (But silently, accidentally, not deliberately, and without us having control over where it takes us).","220,628 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,783M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-would-civilization-technology-look-like-today-if-humans-failed-to-evolve-with-thumbs-on-our-hands
9,The human species is the unit of evolution. Very few of the entire species are affected by technology. Beyond that it takes several thousand years for changes to affect the entire population. There is no evidence that humans are evolving faster.

10,"There is an aspect of evolution called punctuated equilibrium in which once a species appears in the fossil record it remains essentially the same during the majority of its’ existence. Then there is gradualism, whereby a species gradually changes over its’ existence.I suspect that Homo Sapiens, due to the faster and faster conditions being introduced by technology is evolving along lines promulgated by the various social and psychological pressures such technology is presenting.We now have younger and younger generations with knowledge and capabilities (plus physiological consequences) olderThere is an aspect of evolution called punctuated equilibrium in which once a species appears in the fossil record it remains essentially the same during the majority of its’ existence.

And we simply do not know where this rapid evolution is going to take us.I have never considered it wise for the youngest generation to be in charge of knowledge not available to the wiser more experienced oldest generations. For this is an entirely new process in evolutionary history. A direction with unpredictable consequences.Up until recently the foundation of all societies was built upon the wisdom of the oldest generations guiding the growth and direction of the youngest. Now this is completely reversed. In other words the immature leading the mature.What could be the making of a social aneurysm.And what was previously a technological and behavioral gap between individuals 20 years apart is now diminishing to 5–7 years.","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,742,6.8K,91.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-would-civilization-technology-look-like-today-if-humans-failed-to-evolve-with-thumbs-on-our-hands
