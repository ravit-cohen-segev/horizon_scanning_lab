4,Streaming has already taken over television. I have not watched a local broadcast or cable channel in over 15 years. I would say cable cutting is already picking up in popularity.I have enjoyed it a lot. I can watch things when and where I want to. I don’t have to wait for the news to find out what has happened. I can go on a long vacation and come back to the same point I saved a film and pick up where I left off.Or I can have my tv disconnected for a year and not think about it.,0 followers,Nor Reza,1.8K,8.6K,50.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-chances-that-technology-will-replace-the-human-touch-in-commerce
5,"TVs serve 2 purposes today:I believe both of these aspects can be eventually replaced with a sufficiently advanced virtual reality online experience.Think ‘Ready Player One’ the movie.It’s immersive and it’s social.You could watch a sporting event as if you were in the stadium with your friends.

Now, it’s the period of the most growing Connected TV and OTT popularity, which speeds the changes in the TV industry. The future innovations are:1. Freedom to ChooseIn contrast with Linear TV, CTV/OTT proposes an enormous number of different channels. If you have a cable TV you have to watch the list of the standard programs and you don’t have any possibilities to choose what you want. Moreover, you can watch programs only due to the schedule or you miss it. When you’re a happy CTV owner it’s really easy to find your preferable content and even download it. Additionally, CTV/OTT creates a list of proposals based on your preferences. More and more video content creators start their own Connected TV channels. If you’re already had it and want to share it with a larger audience,2. Commercials Become AntiquatedStreaming-service providers are proving that it's really possible to create and grow successful enterprises around a business model that includes little or no revenue from commercials. The trend is now changing to one based on a subscription model. It’s likely that even traditional cable providers will become subscription services.3. More InteractivityCompanies such as Facebook,﻿ Google, and Microsoft﻿ have all developed virtual reality technologies. Within the next ten years, traditional television screens are likely to make way, at least in part, for variations that pair with VR eye-wear and headsets. Evidence of this is already available in Google's development of Google Glass as well as Samsung's foray into wearable accessories that help turn phones into virtual reality machines.What's more, all televisions are likely to become smart TVs within the next ten years.Feel free to ask any additional questions.",356 followers,Gordon Miller,5.3K,10K,165.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-chances-that-technology-will-replace-the-human-touch-in-commerce

Every insane idea is of course interesting: how can one think like that?Largeness is no cause for anything to collapse: indeed, the less insane idea is that some things are too large to collapse: they cannot collapse because they are large.People can deal with large numbers.

8,BNBR prevents me from saying what I really think.I believe that you know nothing about currency and your idea that technology will replace currency is laughable at best because it neglects the real purposes of currency.I think you need to start getting your information from another source. Do some research on the real functions of currency because the idea that a.) there is too much of it or b.) it is going to collapse is just too unlikely to be true.,"3,072 followers",Marshall Gittler,2K,6.5K,9.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-chances-that-technology-will-replace-the-human-touch-in-commerce
9,"You say all of that as if it’s fact. people have been fathoming large numbers since the beginning of time. and the currency has been huge for centuries. It’s all relative. And most likely technology will eventually replace currency, it’s been doing it that for a hundred years at least. Currency accounts for <8% of all money now.

10,"I’all think you answered you own question. Currency is technology. Does too large mean collapse? Why do we have to fathom billions in currency to make them work? We have 40–70 trillion cells in our bodies—fathom them or not—they seem to be doing all right. Money’s been around for a long time, and it probably will for a long time.
