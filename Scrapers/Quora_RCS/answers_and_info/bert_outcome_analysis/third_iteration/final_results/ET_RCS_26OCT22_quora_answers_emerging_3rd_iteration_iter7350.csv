0,"Fidget Spinners.Yes. These things.You see, a few weeks ago, I was sitting in my eighth period class, and I noticed something I had only seen online before. One of my classmates was sitting at his computer, nonchalantly moving this white toy in his hand. On closer look, I saw it was spinning. Immediately I recognized it as the spinny-thing I had seen in a YouTube video, a fidget spinner.

I asked him to see it, and after taking a moment to figure out how to use it, I realized how fun it was. Not only was it oddly satisfying to just spin it on my hand or on the table, I found that if it's spinning on your thumb and index finger, and you twist your wrist side to side, you could feel the resistance in your wrist, because of the gyroscopic force of the spin.Anyways, after I realized how fun they were, I kind of forgot about it for a few days.Then I started seeing more.And more.And more.And now it seems that just about everyone has used one, and most people own one. I decided I was going to try and buy some to resell at school, and maybe I would make $50–100.Boy was I wrong.After I found them in wholesale quantities online, I realized just how cheap I could get them. These spinners were going for about $1.80, in quantities of 100 or more, and I needed to buy some.The next day at school I asked around about how much people were willing to pay for some, and heard that prices varied for $5 on amazon to $15 at the local 7-eleven.I decided to place an order for 100 of them. My total came out to just over $180, and I'm currently waiting on them to arrive.On Facebook, I found people willing to pay up to $15 for them, which isI'll update this once I start selling them.***To anyone saying that I am “ripping people off”, please understand the principle of supply and demand. Right now, where I am, these spinners are out of stock everywhere. The demand for them is extremely high, and stock is extremely low.This means I can charge what***UPDATE***THEY CAME IN!Today at around 5pm DHL showed up to my door with my box.here's all of them laid out!I've already sold 4, so hopefully this does turn into a good investment!

You can make money on the stock marketIf you use the $1,000 to open a brokerage account, park your money in their money market account that will pay you a better rate than your checking account and then dig through all of their free investor education training. There are also numerous sources online for free.Most people spend 10–12 hours researching a car, and about 10 minutes research a stock. If you aren’t willing to put the time and learn how to be an investor, do yourself a favor and put your money back in your pocket.If you are willing to put in the time, start a fantasy stock portfolio, learn all you can about investing (there are many book lists on Quora), and save your money until you have at least $10,000 saved and have successfully invested your paper portfolio for at least 2 years. Learning to invest with real money is the most expensive education you’ll ever have. From personal experience, my “investor education” cost more than my MBA.

Since inflation is almost 3%, your net is only 4% and that is less than $7,200 in extra buying power over 30 years, not good. One big project on some skill you learned for $20,000 over 30 years will return more than that.For those of you who prefer a more entrepreneurial bent, I would look for items on ALIBABA that you think would sell well in the US. Many items that you buy for $1-$2 each and can sell for $9.99 - $19.99 will have a minimum order of $1,000 units. You can use SHOPIFY or AMAZON and start selling your items and making money. If you buy items for $2 each and sell for $10 you make $8 and if you buy 1,000 units you have made $8,000. Use FameBit or other social media influencer solutions or social media advertising platforms to get it to crazy. With $10,000 you should be able to do 3–4 rounds of 1,000 units and make up to $30,000 in profit.","45,949 followers",Sahil Bhadviya,2K,232,18M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Ive-made-6000-this-year-actively-trading-stocks-but-now-I-have-a-lot-on-my-plate-What-is-the-best-way-to-passively-invest-60-000

As demand surged, so didMining with a CPU has its advantages and disadvantages. Let's examine these in order to understand better if and when it is appropriate to use your CPUs to mine Bitcoin. As you may recall in the beginning, everyone used a CPU to mine for bitcoins. Those days are long gone, but you can still mine on your CPU.Pros of miningCPU mining is very useful in the process of understanding mining. We strongly believe that's where every miner should start. You do not need any specialized hardware other than your computer. In the process of setting up the software, you will learn all the little tricks that are applicable to your hardware. You will also learn how the CPU will compare to more advanced hardware, such as GPUs and ASICs.To summarize, we encourage you to try CPU mining for the following reasons:Cons of miningCPU mining for Bitcoin is unfortunately no longer profitable. That is, it is highly unlikely that one could earn enough funds to cover the cost of electricity used up by the CPU .Best practices when mining with CPUsLet's look into the recommended things to do, when mining with CPUs. Although mining Bitcoin is no longer profitable with a CPU, mining other coins may bring in some profits. If you are going to use your CPU for mining, you might as well observe the practices that are going to make it easier and safer for you.First, make sure that your computer has adequate cooling and the CPU fan is working along with all the other fans in your computer. Make sure your computer has adequate airflow around it. There should not be anything directly around or on top of your computer. Basically, you need good airflow. The reason is that, while mining, your CPU's cores will be running at 100%, which will generate a good amount of heat. If that heat is not dissipated by the fans, it may cause damage to your hardware.Secondly, to get the most hashes out of your CPU, close all other programs running on your computer. If you are mining with a pool, have only the mining software open. If you are mining solo, you will also need to have your wallet open. Be aware that, if you are using your computer for any other purpose...Profitability of miningAs we have mentioned earlier, the Bitcoin network hash rate is really high now. Mining with a CPU is no longer guaranteed to bring in profits. This is due to the fact that, during the mining process, you are competing with other miners to try to solve a block. You will be at a disadvantage if those other miners are running faster hardware, as your hardware can only make a certain amount of guesses (hashes) in a given time frame.To compare the mining speed of a few CPU's, look at the follow the tableCPU don't hash fast.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,848,996,156.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Ive-made-6000-this-year-actively-trading-stocks-but-now-I-have-a-lot-on-my-plate-What-is-the-best-way-to-passively-invest-60-000
