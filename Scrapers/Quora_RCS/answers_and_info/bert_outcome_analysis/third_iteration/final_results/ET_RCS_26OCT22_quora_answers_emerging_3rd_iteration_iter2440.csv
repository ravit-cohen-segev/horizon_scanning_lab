The start point of modern technologyvwas to replace labour with machines powered by steam, petrol and electric engines. This replacement of labour was not sought in Ancient times when slaves were cheap and peopke had a lot of available time.","62,869 followers",Jay Bazzinotti,3.9K,22.2K,179.7M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Did-the-ancient-people-have-advanced-technology

Of course, digital cameras are computers, and the ESP32 includes a dual-core 32-bit processor, several MB of RAM, support for microSD mass storage, and other facilities that compete favorably with desktop PCs from 20–25 years ago and would have classed as a supercomputer in the 1980s. The camera also includes software that recognizes and identifies faces of individuals you tell it to learn, and that level of machine learning wasn’t a robust technology until the last couple of decades. It also includes wifi and Bluetooth wireless networking, and the basic principles of spread spectrum communication used by both are less than a century old. Even the little high-brightness white LED (the yellow circle in the lower right corner) is technology that simply didn’t exist until the last couple of decades.I know you’re thinking that’s all just about the electronics, and that is largely true. The last 100 years have been dominated by advances in electrical and computer engineering. However, even the tiny lens assembly is a marvel of precision manufacturing and the plastics used for the camera housing and connector shells, and the material used to make the circuit board, are things that didn’t exist a century ago.So, although the basic concept of a camera is millennia old, and lenses and photochemical processes are not particularly recent inventions, a device like the ESP32-CAM would have been nearly unimaginable science fiction a century ago. In fact, the ESP32-CAM isn’t normally used to take photographs, but as an intelligent controller that can make things happen based on what it sees….","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Did-the-ancient-people-have-advanced-technology
7,"A camera is a good example of what is actually, a very simple technological concept that has become increasingly advanced.A camera is, at is it’s simplest, a light-tight box. I have a friend who makes pinhole cameras. He using things like biscuit tins. I myself have made a couple of pinhole lenses.The bottom line is this. Yes, digital technology is very useful.

It was essentially a balloon bomb. They released it from Japan and it travelled all the way to America utilising high speed winds where it fell to earth and detonated. The Japanese hoped to use incendiary and biological bombs to cause havoc in America. The bombs caused a few civilian casualties. The Americans soon figured out where the bombs were being deployed from by analyzing the balloon’s sand ballast; they bombed and destroyed the facilities soon after.","246,826 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Did-the-ancient-people-have-advanced-technology

Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party. Because radiation from nuclear accidents is apparently scarier than way more people dying of regular pollution constantly and the total annihilation of all life on Earth as the oceans boil away.","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,631,1.5K,2.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-sort-of-advanced-technology-did-Atlantis-have
