Fortunately you are immortal, so you can take as long as you need.How long will it take you to make a cellphone?You already have the massive advantage of 1) knowing that cellphones are possible, 2) having a vague idea of the technologies involved.But consider that there are 118 known elements. (eg. Hydrogen, Helium, Lithium etc…) and the typical cell phone uses 75 of those elements.You have to figure out:Imagine you were sent back in time to the stone age.Unfortunately you are stuck there until you can make a cell phone to call for help.

(eg. Hydrogen, Helium, Lithium etc…) and the typical cell phone uses 75 of those elements.You have to figure out:Of all those, you probably only really know the last one. (#8)What else you know depends on your profession.If you are a Geologist, you might know what some elements look like in nature.If you are a Miner, you might know how to extract some of them from the earth.If you are a Refining Plant Manager you might know how to refine some of them.If you are a Materials Scientist or Metallurgist you might know how to combine some of them into polymers or alloys.If you are an Engineer you might know how to design parts of a cellphone, but probably only some of the parts.If you are a Mechanist or Factory Worker you might know how to build some of the parts.If you are a Software Engineer you might know how to program some of the electronics.What we are getting at is that there is no such thing as a “Cellphone Maker”.But it gets worse.While the professions listed above know aspects of how to make a cellphone, they also rely on other technology in order to do their jobs.For the Geologist, lets say he really knows his rocks and doesn’t need any fancy electronic testing equipment, which is a good thing, because such equipment is just as complex as a cellphone.But he needs the Miner to dig and get at rocks and oil underground before he can identify them. For this, theSo before we can start making a cell phone, we’re going to need to make an steel pickaxe.How to make an Steel Pickaxe:Oops. We don’t have a pickaxe yet, that’s what we’re trying to make. Now what? How else can we make a pickaxe?How to make a Stone Pickaxe:Oops. We don’t have any rope. Or leather cord. Or anything else to tie with.How to make a Leather Cord:Oops. We need leather first. Where are we going to get leather?How to make Leather:Oops. We don’t have any cows because they haven’t been domesticated yet. We’ll have to make our leather out of something else, such as a deer.How to kill a Deer:Really? A bow and arrow? How do we make that? Better just look for a dead deer lying around somewhere. Oh look there’s one over there. Perfect.How to make Leather From a Deer (Round 2):Just kidding. Don’t have a knife.How to make Leather From a Deer (Round 3):Where do we get salt? Ok the ocean has salt. Easy.How to get Salt from the Ocean:Oh no. How do we make a bucket?How to make a Leather Bucket:Nope. Don’t even start.How to make a Reed Bucket:Ok, we can do that. Finally, progress.How to get Salt from the Ocean (Round 2):That took awhile, but now we got the salt. Now back to the leather.How to make Leather From a Deer (Round 4):Lime? As in the fruit? Oh… you mean limestone. We can find some of that.How to make Lime:How to make Leather From a Deer (Round 4, continued):6. Boil the brain of the deer in water to create a tanning solution.Oh darn. Now we need a pot. And a fire.How to make a Fire:Ok great, we have a fire. Now we need a pot.How to make a Clay Pot:Great. We’re on a roll now. Back to that leather.How to make Leather From a Deer (Round 4, continued):6. Boil the brain of the deer in water to create a tanning solution.7. Soak the deer hide in the tanning solution.8. Hang the leather up to dry.Whew. Finally. Leather.How to make a Leather Cord (Round 2):How to make a Stone Pickaxe (Round 2):Alright. Got it.How to make an Steel Pickaxe (Round 2):A Forge? You mean we can’t use a regular fire? Ahh. Its not hot enough.How to build a Forge:Charcoal?How to make Charcoal:????…As you can see. Even the simplest tasks are not so simple. It seems like technology is progressing really fast today, but that is because of all the technology that literally took ages to figure out.How long would it take to figure out how to do any of the simple technologies above, simply by trial and error? It could take a really long time, for example, to figure out what Iron Ore looks like, and how to build a forge hot enough to melt it. Especially if you didn’t even have any idea that Iron even exists.I mean, come on. Everyone knows rocks don’t melt. If they did, how could we use them to build ovens. Right????So there are a lot of hurdles. But once a technology has been figured out, we can build on it to create the next step.These days, we’ve figured out enough things to do a lot. We’ve also figured out something called science, which is the art of figuring out new things.Tasks that were once really hard, become much easier.

1,"Lactose tolerance.Generically, infant humans can metabolise lactose, one of the major components of milk of all mammals. But once they have passed the age of breastfeeding, they generally stop producing lactaxe, the enzyme needed to metabolise lactose. It isn’t needed when you stop drinking milk from your mother.But, separately, two groups of humans took up keeping cattle, and collecting their milk for food. One in Northern Europe, and one in East Africa.And both groups evolved to keep generating lactase into adult life.",2 followers,John Nofsinger,1.9K,3.1K,14.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-has-technology-evolved-since-you-were-born
2,"Yes. Technology would include any tool that has been produced to support human activity. Tools have been produced from the stone age. A stone cutting or scrapping tool is technology and it is surprising how much work is involved to produce these tools. Consider a flint cutting tool. Humans needed to find a source of flint or obsidian, they need to learn how to knap flint to shape. Often they need to attach the stone tool to a handle (this often required other tools or components, such as resin and organic material like twine to keep the cutting tool in place).

We have been producing tools ever since and these have become more and more sophisticated with time.Technology according to the defination is the mechanical arts and application of science. Early people did not have any understanding of modern science, they do however show a sufficient understanding of the mechanical arts to make tools which are MOST definitely technology.","358,978 followers",Sean Kernan,986,5.6K,727M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-has-technology-evolved-since-you-were-born

Then came the PCI port, Then came PCI-X (with variations of form factor) - and M.2, and others.Similarilty the hard drive connectivity propagated through a large number of connects too. For example the IDE ribbon cable (which was sometimes on the motherboard, or optionally on an expansion card). After the IDE connector on hard drives came the SATA connector (which has to date been used on several variations of the controller logic board - with increasing bandwidths), aptly named SATA I through SATA IV.The same types of evolution to connectivity has occured with USB (where each iterative succession yielded more throughput), and with the Nic (Network Interface Controller), whose connector also has changed slightly since the advent of Cat6 and beyond - that is the cable type and bandwidth that it can support. The connector (RJ45), while retaining the same dimensions, a Cat6 connector can support higher bandwidths (beyond GB ranges), while the Ethernet we used decades ago, only in some cases (no pun intended) were limited to 10-100Mbps. It should be noted here, that the Nic can be on an optional board too, for example a modern 10GB Nic in a PCI-X expansion port, but usually is soldered directly on the motherboard.The memory controller (RAM) has also been down a series of changes, perhaps more than any other component in the PC. A quick look on Wiki, will show all of the various connectors used for the chips used for memory upgrades. DDR alone has changed 4 times - each time the notch on motherboard is shifted to prevent older chips from trying to be squeezed into incompatilbe memory busses. The myriad of memory chip combinations can be dazzling because they are coupled to the CPU, which again has variations in socket types, depending on the “family of processor” - in either the AMD or Int...","5,085 followers",Bobby Tatro,3.9K,2.2K,45.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-has-technology-evolved-since-you-were-born

Anyone can learn how to use and code basic arduino cards, which are very useful for basic products like a 3-D printer. Also, you can study on Artificial Intelligence technology by studying Matlab&Simulink software. My point is, while in college, engineers who have dreams about their own future and country, shall provide enough information and study hard enough the achieve their dreams for the future.Long term short, it depends on your career choice, the opportunities in your country and the dreams about your future. If you think about working as a manufacturing engineer in a complex or a factory, your mechanical skills are usefull enough to satisfy the needs of the factory.

There is lots for mechanical engineers to do besides cars.I did interview atNot all mechanical engineers who work on cars design the engine.In fact,I’m sure you’ve seen a car, but have you ever really looked at one? There’s a ton of stuff in it. There are seats and seat belts, airbags, a frame with a crumple zone to dissipate energy in the event of a crash, a mechanism to lift the trunk lid or hatch easily, a ventilation system, windshield wipers, shock absorbers, and much more. Somebody—in fact lots of somebodies—has to design, analyze, and test all that stuff.Somebody designed the plastic taillight cover so it could be molded economically, assembled rapidly and accurately to the car, and perhaps removed to replace a burnt out light. It was also designed to fit the desired shape for the back end of the car, and to direct the light in a certain way. Somebody also designed the molding machine to make the taillight cover and the assembly line and process to install hundreds or thousands of them in a shift.I don’t know what a typical parts count for an automobile is, but I’d guess it’s in the tens of thousands. Even as electronics take over certain functions, all the rest of those parts still need mechanical engineering attention, even the ones that don’t move.Some mechanical engineering doesn’t look like designing stuffThere are entire fields devoted to understanding, predicting, and controlling how heat moves around; how materials and geometries respond to forces; how materials slide, stick, and wear on one another (this one’s calledIn case you’re a student looking for career advice, I’ll leave you with this: the general skills you can learn (designing, analysis, manufacturing, controls, etc.) can be applied both to cars, if you end up working in an automotive-related field, and to many other lines of work if automotive work is not available in the region where you want to make a living.You might also read and follow the answers to",46 followers,Dan Ho,680,522,1.4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-has-technology-evolved-since-you-were-born
