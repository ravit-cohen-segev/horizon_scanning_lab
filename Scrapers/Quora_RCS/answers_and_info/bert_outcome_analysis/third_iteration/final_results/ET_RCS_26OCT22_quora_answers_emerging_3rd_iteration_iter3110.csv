8,"In 1945, pioneering science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke began circulating a manuscript calledIn 1945, pioneering science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke began circulating a manuscript calledClarke was not the first science-fiction author with uncanny technological predictions — and certainly not the last. Many works of science fiction involve technological speculation that bears remarkable resemblance to the pieces of technology woven into our lives today. This brings to mind an intriguing question of the role that speculative fiction (and especially science fiction) plays in driving technology by postulating future advancements — and sparking innovation.The following list of fictional works were technologically ahead of their time and stand testament to the immense creativity of science fiction authors.1.1888: Credit Cards, Edward Bellamy’s Looking BackwardIn the book: In this futuristic utopia, a card allows people to borrow money from a central bank on credit, eliminating the need for physical money. Sound familiar?“Are credit cards issued to the women just as to the men?”“Certainly.”“The credits of the women, I suppose, are for smaller sums, owing to the frequent suspension of their labor on account of family responsibilities.”In reality: The first popular credit card was introduced by the Diner’s Club in 1950. As of 2012, over two billion active credit cards were in use around the world, accounting for $1 trillion of debt. In fact, the average American household receives six credit card offers a month.2. 1911: Video calling, Hugo Gernsback’s Ralph 124C 41+In the book: The “telephot” is a video-telephone device used by the heroine, Alice 212B423, to call for help when she’s threatened by an avalanche. In a blinding feat of technological progress, she is able to place this call to Ralph… from over 4,000 miles away.After several vain efforts to restore it Ralph was about to give up in disgust and leave the Telephot when the instrument began to glow again. But instead of the face of his friend there appeared that of a vivacious beautiful girl. She was in evening dress and behind her on a table stood a lighted lamp.Startled at the face of an utter stranger, an unconscious Oh! escaped her lips, to which Ralph quickly replied:“I beg your pardon, but ‘Central’ seems to have made another mistake. I shall certainly have to make a com­plaint about the service.”In reality:3. 1931: Mood-Enhancing Pills, Aldous Huxley’s Brave New WorldIn the book: “Soma” is a hallucinogen distributed by the government, en masse, to control the population. Citizens are conditioned to love the “calming” effects of the drug, using it constantly to avoid feelings of discontent.“A gramme is better than a damn,” said Lenina mechanically from behind her hands. “I wish I had my soma!”In reality:4. 1939: Surveillance, George Orwell’s 1984In the book: The dystopian concept of Big Brother originated withIn reality:4. 1968: Tablets Arthur C. Clarke’s 2001: A Space OdysseyIn the book: Described as a “foolscap sized Newspad,” astronauts use tablet computers while conducting spaceships diagnostic checks, or when they need a line of communication to Earth.“Floyd sometimes wondered if the Newspad, and the fantastic technology behind it, was the last word in man’s quest for perfect communications. Here he was, far out in space, speeding away from Earth at thousands of miles an hour, yet in a few milliseconds he could see the headlines of any newspaper he pleased.”In reality:What’s more: NASA pilots can sometimes carry bags with over 40 pounds of hard-copy aviation documents. This has caused many NASA pilots to start a “tablet computer revolution in aviation.”5. 1969: Electric Cars, John Brunner’s Stand On ZanzibarIn the book: Brunner’s depiction of America in the year 2010 includes motor vehicles that are powered by rechargeable electric fuel cells.It’s supposed to be automatic, but actually you have to push this button.In reality:6.In the book: Pilot Steve Austin crashes in flight and loses his legs, left arm, and an eye. His legs and left arm are replaced by a team of doctors with bionic limbs — leaving him a “cyborg” (part man and part machine).To make everything clear, I don’t much give a shit for your operation. I’m willing to go as part of the great experiment. I just want you to understand that I don’t owe you a thing.In reality:Today, researchers are building man-made organs that contain living human cells. Advancements in bionic livers, kidneys, lungs, and hearts are poised to end live-organ transplants — a development which would likely come as a relief to the 121,000 Americans currently on a waiting list.7. 1984: The World Wide Web, William Gibson’s NeuromancerIn the book:A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding…In reality:To get into the ways that the internet and cyber-crimes affect our society today would require an article in itself. For now, you can take a peek at this (frightening) Internet Live Stats website for scale.What’s next?— In 2004, Geoff Ryman’s— Equally as forward-thinking, Ernest Cline’sAnd after that?Well, if we’re lucky, the events of H.G.

We are not simply born with an interest in photography or silk, at least I don’t think that’s how it happens.

If a targeted advert finds and tempts you, you can be pretty sure they are trying to overcharge you, so don't just click it, double check it.","9,700 followers",Avi Estrin,50K,185,11.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-aliens-in-movies-and-TV-shows-have-advanced-technology

27,"What does that mean, “Advanced technology”? What is “advanced technology”? The “ancients” had lots of incredible technology that we have a hard time replicating today. One of the most advanced was barrel making. Do you know anything about barrel making? It’s one of the most advanced technologies of all time. Coopers had to serve an apprenticeship for years. The Coopers who failed ended up making “dry barrels” that only held produce or things that wouldn’t spoil. There are very few people who know how to make a barrel today.

The “ancients” had lots of incredible technology that we have a hard time replicating today. One of the most advanced was barrel making. Do you know anything about barrel making? It’s one of the most advanced technologies of all time. Coopers had to serve an apprenticeship for years. The Coopers who failed ended up making “dry barrels” that only held produce or things that wouldn’t spoil. There are very few people who know how to make a barrel today. Even Jack Daniels, the biggest barrel maker in the world, uses an automated process now because making them by hand is too slow. The art of coopering is dying. There are very, very few people who know how to make a barrel left in the world and fewer every year, yet barrel making was an advanced technology that changed the entire world for literally thousands of years.Incidentally. the most prolific barrel in the world today is the ASB or American Standard Barrel that hold 53 gallons because America makes more barrels than anyone else in the world. Many used Jack Daniels barrels are re-used to make other kinds of liquor in other parts of the world.Do you know who the highest paid man in the community was in “ancient times”? It was the Wheelwright.Making a wheel from wood with an axle that attaches to a cart and doesn’t fall apart within a mile or two is one of the most “advanced technologies” of all time. Without it, most civilizations would have failed or failed to spread. Cart wheels are complex and the forces must play against each other continuously to hold the wheel together as it rolls. A Cartwright made as much then as a jet airline pilot back does today. In the 1880s when the average wage was $1.50 a day, the Wheelwright was making 90 dollars a week. On the Mayflower they brought one single cart over to America and it was the most valuable thing on the ship manifest, worth more than 10 times the next most valuable thing on the ship. Can you make a cartwheel? It’s an “advanced technology” that very, very few people can make today, even with machine tools.What is an “advanced technology”?","220,560 followers",Franklin Veaux,3K,47.3K,782.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-single-piece-of-advanced-technology-from-fiction-would-you-like-to-see-created

Plenty of the ideas that have been projected could be correct, it’s just hard to prove or disprove who has it right. That alone may qualify it for the “will never figure out” portion of your questions, since even if we’ve already figured it out, we can’t be sure if that’s actually how it was done. A US Naval Academy experiment, using midshipmen trained in complex rigging working alongside historians and archaeologists, couldn’t fully answer the question, so in my mind it feels like it qualifies for your question. It’s not quite a technology we’ll never figure out, it’s more a puzzle that archaeology can’t fully answer, so we are left to wonder how they did it.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-single-piece-of-advanced-technology-from-fiction-would-you-like-to-see-created
