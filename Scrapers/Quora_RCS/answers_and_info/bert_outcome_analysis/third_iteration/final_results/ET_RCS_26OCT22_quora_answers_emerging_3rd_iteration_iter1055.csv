That may come next. Effectively, protocols used on “the Internet” on Earth would not exactly work when round-trip times exceed a handful of seconds. Light, and hence data packets, can travel around the equator of the Earth about 7.5 times per second (1000ms) - this about 133 milliseconds per trip. In today's Internet, 50ms (or less) is a somewhat average/median round-trip latency for most connections between two endpoints, with being more than 150ms being uncommon (rarely fairly straight lines between two points, or staying on one network). Satellite is around 600ms, for context (newer low Earth orbit/LEO reduces this). Protocols now generally timeout at 3 seconds (3000ms), or less, but could be tuned and increased. Still… new protocols will be needed. Enough difference, maybe we call that something else, and keep the name Internet for intra-Earth communications?In any event, I do not see anything else coming in my lifetime… say the next 50 years.","66,687 followers",Dima Vorobiev,813,4.2K,139M,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-will-come-after-the-Internet

And they're not entirely wrong in that either. The Federation, and by extension Starfleet, was substantially larger and more powerful than the RSE. The Romulans had always known this, and so they developed cloaking technology to try and even the playing field. When that didn't prove sufficient, they sought an alliance with the Klingons, figuring that this would be enough to keep the Federation in check. They even shared the cloaking technology with them to further bolster their military potential.And that worked for a while. Right up until the Klingons decided to go and sign a treaty with the Federation and throw their carefully calculated deterrent completely out the window.Now, faced with an alliance between the Klingons and the Federation and the very real possibility that the last thing that made their ships remotely competitive, their stealth, was about to be shared willingly with the massive power at their borders with ambitions to extend themselves further still, the Romulans came to the conclusion that they were screwed. And with their backs to the wall, they started getting ready to fight the war that they were starting to think was inevitable before their situation deteriorated further.The only thing that kept open fighting from breaking out immediately was the Treaty of Algeron. In it, the Romulans agreed to honor the current borders and focus their own expansion in non neighboring areas. And the Federation agreed not to develop cloaking technology for their own starships, basically as a concession that this one edge was really all that was keeping the Romulan military competitive. Besides, their largest ally does have cloaking, so it's not like they can't get it if they really needed to.Of course the RSE then vanished for a few decades and came back with monster warships. At this point the Romulans aren't quite as concerned about being steamrolled, but they still don't like their odds in a straight up fight. And the Federation really doesn't like the thought of having to deal with a war with the Romulans again where they don't have an obvious edge of technical superiority.

Contrary to every geeks belief (mine included), people are not too stupid to interact with technology. Rather, most people see technology as a means to an end rather than something fun to tinker with.The single greatest bottleneck between people and technology is the user interface. The graphical user interface was a major leap allowing users to manipulate computers without needed to memorize command lines. Since the introduction of the GUI, we have made incremental improvements but that’s all they have been. Sure, Windows 11 or OSX are massive improvements over their earliest iterations but they are still iterative. You use a mouse or your finger to ‘click’ on something and that does something else.For years, the holy grail of computer interfacing has been voice to text. It has been around for a while and has steadily improved to the point where a person with reasonably good diction and a detailed knowledge of voice to text software can dictate faster than the vast majority of people can type. That’s pretty neat but still requires that knowledge of the software.A few minutes ago, I told Alexa to turn off the lights in the kitchen and the great room using natural language. I also told her to turn on the TV and tune to HBO Max. Nifty. But a geek (meaning me) had to set up all of the software to allow me to use those verbal commands. I can do all sorts of things using Alexa because I’m a geek and I like to tinker. I’ve assisted several otherwise highly competent people in similarly setting up their homes with Alexa and Google Home who have neither the time nor the geekiness to do so for themselves.The Internet of Things (IOT) is starting to change that paradigm. It’s going to happen the same way the internet happened. It may start with routers automatically incorporating Alexa, Google Home, or some other control software. You install a new lightbulb in your desk lamp, the router software recognizes this and that it is in your office, assigns it a name and several variations thereupon. You sit down at your desk and a sensor in your chair notices and automatically turns on the light, no setup required.Based upon the speed with which the internet developed, I suspect we are about a decade away from this but it could happen faster thanks to the competition between extremely deep pocketed companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, and Amazon. I can’t predict the end state but it’s going to be pretty cool.","127,777 followers",Oliver Emberton,979,113,19.1M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-will-come-after-the-Internet

The only kinds of developments we can really reliably predict are evolutions of what we have and know today. If someone had tried to predict what 2020 would look like from 1880, they might talk about fast steam locomotives with huge tenders that could travel all day on one load of coal and water, making a trip from New York to San Francisco in only three or four days. They could not foresee cheap air transportation that would make that a four or five hour trip. They might have predicted that there would be a telegraph station in every neighborhood, making sending a telegram as easy as walking down the street to the local telegraph station. They could not possibly have foreseen smart phones that would let you not only talk to someone on the other side of the country, but also see a live image of them.We are in the same situation today. We can extrapolate from what we have today and talk about cheap space travel or better medicine, but we will miss the developments that flow unexpectedly from disparate areas. We will miss the truly new.Even extrapolations from existing technology are likely to miss some of the most significant impacts. Take the automobile for example. In the beginning, autos were expensive toys for rich people. When they became cheap enough, people could imagine driving to the next town to see friends, or making a quick trip to the store. Eventually people realized that they didn’t have to live close to their work; they could live in a detached house with a nice yard and drive ten miles to work. People could see a lot of implications of the automobile, but did they see the real impact? Housing developments miles from work meant new roads. More development meant even more new roads. People migrated out of in-town housing to the suburbs. Masses of cars needed large areas of downtown for parking. Neighborhoods were demolished or split in two to accommodate roads for the automobile. Millions of cars brought air pollution and helped spur global warming. Who could predict all of that when they saw Karl Benz’s motorized wagon?I think most predictions of the shape of things to come are either obvious extrapolations of what we have today, or wildly missing the significant developments of the future.","135,528 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.6M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-will-come-after-the-Internet

These systems use either a radar or ultraviolet missile approach warning system to detect anti-tank guided missiles after launch far away from the tank.

He was rushed to hospital after he faded on field. He was stable for couple of days and later passed away due to a sudden cardiac arrest. Later they found out, it was an internal brain injury which went un detected. Had they must have detected it on field, this brave young lad could have lived and played for India.I tried to find out how deep and big is the problem of “traumatic brain injuries” TBI. I found out that almost 1 million people succumb to death due to TBIs in India alone. 60% are accidents where the TBI goes undetected.So here is the opportunity for the big invention “Non invasive point of care instrument to detect TBI”.Anybody interested to work on this can ping me. I have made a crude prototype when I heard Amit kesri incident.Amit Kesri, West Bengal Ranji Player ( 1994 - 2015)I have a habbit of discussing things with people of different professions whenever I get a chance to meet them. Many a times an idea of invention can come out of a small silly discussion. There are some inherent problems in our day to day life which we fail to realize. There are certain instances where I got some really good use cases to work on.A Cardiologist : I met a cardiologist long back. Our topic of discussion was pace maker device. For your information a pace maker powers heart to maintain the pumping capacity. I asked him a simple question“ Is fitting a pace maker device once in life time inside a patient’s body is a complete ...",89 followers,Anish Ambavat,3.7K,61,216K,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-will-come-after-the-Internet

A horse required higher quality food and its ability to pull heavy loads was slightly less than that of a oxen, but it could move about twice as fast.As you might imagine power output moves up considerably once we move into the inanimate realm. A properly built vertical windmill or an overshot waterwheel could have a useful output in excess of 5 horsepower. Of course they required skill and material to build, operate and could only function when there was a sufficiently strong flow of water or air.Something like a sawmill might have an output 30 to 50 times that of a human sawing by hand.Though I am not confident in the specifics I can suggest that the most powerful output in pre-industrial days was generated by sails. Sails with an area in excess of a field hockey pitch could propel huge ships with hundreds of crewmembers at speeds in excess of 12 knots if the wind were right. Again I can’t say exactly how one would translate that to horsepower but I think we should see them as engines in the hundreds of horsepower range.The industrial revolution introduced new powerplants that had considerably smaller footprints and a higher degree of reliability. In addition they could run on fuel that was burned. Steam engines in ships, locomotives and factories could generate thousands of horsepower.What made cars and aeroplanes feasible were engines that had higher outputs at smaller sizes and lighter weights.Early automobile and aircraft engines might only have 30 horsepower internal combustion engines but rather than being the size of a three story building like a windmill they were small enough to fit in a modern shopping cart. By the end of the Second World War some aircraft were fitted with V-12 engines that had outputs in excess of 1000 horsepower while remaining comparatively pocket sized.Even lighter and more powerful engines such as various forms of gas turbines pushed airplanes beyond the speed of sound while rockets got us into space.The ultimate limit of our species is the ability to generate power. We can certainly improve existing power plants, their fuel cost, output, size, weight and manner of power distribution. However I do think there are limits to these. We kind of figured out how they all work and as such we are really improving them by each iteration.What I suppose the humans of the future need more than anything is something radically new. Something which can generate power beyond what we can imagine is feasible, something which might as well be magic to us.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-will-come-after-the-Internet

But jet planes are gas guzzling beasts and produce immense amounts of CO2. Plus, it can take an entire day to fly around the globe; way too long for impatient businessmen.Here I would like to show you a stupendous way of transportation,The concept is simple, and is based on a question that little kids really like to ask: if there were a hole that goes straight through the center of Earth, all the way to the other side, what would happen if you jumped in? The nitpickers will say that you will definitely burn to ashes at the core, but let’s ignore such petty things for a moment. You will fall right through, accelerating all the while. Even though gravity is 0 at the center of Earth, you will not stop there, because at that time you already have an immensely large speed from all the falling. Having passed the center, you’d continue through, no longer “falling” but “rising”, until you reach the surface on the other side.How long would the whole trip take you? How fast will you be going? Can you survive such speeds? What happens if the hole doesn’t connect between two opposite spots on Earth, but between any two arbitrary points? To answer these questions, we will have to look at a bit of physics.We know that gravity pulls on you towards the center of the earth. How strong you are pulled depends on two things: the mass of what’s pulling you, and how far away you are from it. The equation looks like this:Where G is the universal gravity constant, m is your mass, M is Earth’s mass, and r is the distance between you and Earth’s center.But what happens if you moveAs you go deeper into the ground, there is still a lot of mass that pulls you in closer to the center, just like you were on the surface.Now that we know how the force changes according to how far away we are from the center, we can imagine the following high-tech transportation system:At least, that’s the plan. Let’s see if it works.After proceeding according to the Newton Laws and taking in account all the major forces we get a linear ordinary differential equation, which tells us of the relationship between the train’s position and its acceleration. Remarkably, it is exactly the same equation which describes how pendulums swing at small angles: the simple harmonic motion equation.In our case, A is half the direct distance between the two cities.seconds, the cosine will have completed one full period. In train terms, that means from London to Los Angeles and back.Lets see how long that is:That’s what physicists call “totally crazy”. 42 minutes from London to Los Angeles, another 42 minutes to get back. But the brilliant thing is, that ω doesn’t depend at all on the locations you wish to travel to. All it depends on is the density of Earth. So it doesn’t matter from where to where you are going: your trip will always take 42 minutes.The train doesn’t care how much mass it carries: there is no difference in going empty, and transporting a full load of people. This stems from the fact that the train doesn’t “use up” any energy at all. No fuel is required to move it. All the energy comes from potential gravitational energy which is turned to kinetic energy. We are just dropping things into holes. So in the theoretical ideal case, this transportation costs us no energy whatsoever. Hurray for global warming.This is not just an Idea, it’s already in development. I know there are many kinds of problems associated with it but in around 10 years you could see something like this.Cheers!Check",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,1K,996,156M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-will-come-after-the-Internet
