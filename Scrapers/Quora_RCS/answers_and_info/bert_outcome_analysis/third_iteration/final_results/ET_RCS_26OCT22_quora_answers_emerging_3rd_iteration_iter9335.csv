2,"There are several loaded questions here, so let’s break them down into two broad ones:How can an INFJ open up more, etc.?I would like to turn this one around on you - why should I? This question strikes me as one an extrovert would ask; assuming that INFJs are “closed books” and need to “open up more.” I’ve only heard that condescension my entire life, and it’s done nothing but bring me pain. I owe you nothing, and no one else has any right to my thoughts or deserves my attention.

I owe you nothing, and no one else has any right to my thoughts or deserves my attention.

And what makes you think my not telling you them is a problem?A closed book is an adventure waiting to happen. If you want to have one, take the time to read it.We need to be “fixed” by placing boundaries.While I do agree that establishing boundaries is key to survival as an INFJ, that’s not because we need to be fixed. We are not broken. The reality is the rest of humanity is not like us, and takes adavtange of our giving nature, so we need to draw clear lines to stop from having all our energy leeched away.For an INFJ boundaries are merely the trails we’ve carved to allow people into our lives. If you want to find us you’ll have to be clever enough to follow the tracks.",2 followers,Andrew Adams,501,85,2.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-avoid-ethical-issues-in-communicating-with-others

Because I understand why they do it, I don’t want to hurt them by calling them out and I truly hope they will stop until they do it so many times that I have to break it off and shut the door.I struggle to tell people why I don’t want to make it for that social gathering or that sports event, or the rock climbing get together. I find it hard to express that I’m personally not inclined to any of these things, in fact I vehemently hate them. But I hate seeing their face fall because they really want me to be there and it’s important to them.INFJs typically endure and keep enduring constantly due to this lack of boundaries. They give and keep giving without no end. Until they can take it no longer and finally for the first time in their life they draw the ultimate boundary. The INFJ doorslam. That’s a boundary no man can cross.The INFJ doorslam is the result of failing to draw appropriate boundaries repeatedly.",0 followers,Susan Joy,769,245,1.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-avoid-ethical-issues-in-communicating-with-others

They are also pretty forgiving if someone is genuinely sorry.What they will not tolerate though is boorish dominating toxic individuals who see these qualities as a weakness to exploit. INFJs can’t stand users and bullies.There are unfortunately people in the world who put on a good initial show and then they think they can treat people however they like after an initial upfront investment. Their true colours start to reveal themselves over time.The INFJ notices things they don’t like. An assertive INFJ will tell them they don’t like the behaviour and if there is a negative consequence they will throw that in. It is worth saying though that with adults, short of leaving people there actually aren’t always a whole lot of consequences to throw at people sometimes.It is also worth noting that with toxic people, they actually ultimately often don’t care if people leave them anyway as they get used to it because it happens all the time and they somehow don’t connect the dots that they’re the common denominator.Toxic people also tend to do mea culpas or hoovers which are time wasters in which both people leave and come back over and over again after each boundary issue. Many of whom I have observed get off on the drama and were obviously raised in a home where having on again off again fights was the norm.INFJs think this is nonsense and frustrating. INFJs think that you either stay to make it work because you both care about each other or you cut the ties.We tend to be all in or all out in our close relationships or we have acquaintances.INFJs don’t want on again off again relationships where there is lots of threatening to leave and coming back over and over again.If an INFJ leaves, it’s because they have weighed it up, feel they have got a true picture of the person and don’t want to return to them.The consequence of leaving them is always enforced because it hasn’t been done lightly or without due consideration.What often happens is that the INFJ tells the person their boundaries, the person ignores or makes the right noises but does bad things. Crucially these are usually different bad things not the same bad things.The issue can be that INFJs come from the perspective that they should not have to yell and scream to get you to listen to them. If the person chooses to ignore the INFJ or the INFJ has to fight to be heard on what is often a reasonable request, the INFJ realises that this person is not worth their time and energy.Then what happens is the INFJ detaches either through less contact or a door slam. A permanent door slam is usually reserved for unforgivable toxic acts though.Now let’s get back to boundaries because I have some interesting observations. People sometimes say INFJ aren’t vocal enough about their boundaries and then abruptly leave and my honest response to that is you don’t have to jump up and down about your boundaries with reasonable people.They listen and accept reasonable requests. They don’t test boundaries or violate them for control or seem to feed off other people’s reactions.The INFJ is often seen to be abruptly leaving by people that didn’t listen to what the INFJ was calmly telling them because they weren’t yelling or being aggressive to get their point across. Assertive people are ignored by domineering people who wish to get their own way at all times and think because the person isn’t yelling, they are cool with it all and will just put up with it. They lack in emotional IQ and wait until is someone is out the door to smooth things over.I’ve noted some of the people who complain about INFJs have relationships where they expect to have fights with people where each is yelling out their boundaries at each other. It is to an INFJ a very combatative style of relating.If the INFJ chose to do this more with this sort of person it is true that they may experience less boundary violations and avoid a door slam…BUT (and it’s a big but)Some people who are involved with people like this have much longer, protracted torturous relationships with these people. They spend years doing great boundary setting and these people are still violating boundaries but not doing it to their face or doing it in sneaky ways.The fact remains that the person is still a crappy person. They’re just a crappy person who is being reluctantly pulled into line and over time will eventually just get more and more difficult and unpleasant. They are pretend playing nice and it doesn’t last over time. Boundary setting with the wrong person is a waste of time. The wrong person is still in your space.If the person isn’t coming from a place of genuine care for you, it is shallow and a waste of time for the INFJ.When the INFJ detaches or does a door slam they feel they have seen the full picture of who the person is and that they are not compatible with them.They are done and have zero regrets. Usually the only regret is that they didn’t do it sooner rather than wasting their breath on someone who didn’t listen no matter what they said because at their core, they didn’t value the INFJ enough to care, took them for granted and thought they wouldn’t leave so they would see how far they could push it.An INFJ is not impressed if they have to threaten leaving every time they communicate a boundary and because they don’t get aggressive when they do, they are ignored.INFJs don’t threaten to leave unless they really will walk when they say they will nor do they have any patience for on again off again relationships which quite a lot of people who are said to have firmer boundaries than INFJs participate in.The upside for the INFJ is that compared to others who have dealt with the same toxic person and have adopted boundary setting that appears to be “firmer”, they have had a much shorter stint with them but the downside is that some people had even shorter stints due to not dealing with them whatsoever really due to cutting them off at the start and not engaging with them at all.The INFJ usually has no regrets about a door slam. The only regret is usually that it wasn’t done sooner. Some will ask why the INFJ didn’t do it sooner then? For a few reasons:The upshot is that the INFJ should cut some people off before engaging with them at all rather than hanging around to set boundaries with a pretender.As the INFJ matures, they realise more that stumbling across a rare gem is less likely than finding that if it quacks like a duck, it’s a duck. That’s the getting of wisdom for an INFJ.",0 followers,Caroline Kelley,4K,98,1.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-can-the-INFJ-learn-to-communicate-better-open-up-more-instead-of-being-a-closed-book-and-also-fix-many-of-their-issues-by-learning-how-to-place-appropriate-boundaries

I would even say divine. When it was bad, it was the worst. Neither of us knew what was going on. My INFJ wouldn't share feelings and I had no content so had to rely on my Judging auxiliary which is rubbish. So I made bad calls and worsened the situation. One main thing to remember is patience. INFJs value patience and space very much. Don't make them feel like you are forcing them to open or manipulating them to open or else it will backfire. Take time with them. Sometimes being silent with an INFJ is in actual fact, them opening up. Good luck and hope it works out.","246,875 followers",Dushka Zapata,5.6K,8.5K,232.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-can-the-INFJ-learn-to-communicate-better-open-up-more-instead-of-being-a-closed-book-and-also-fix-many-of-their-issues-by-learning-how-to-place-appropriate-boundaries

Of course liberal women can’t be trusted to manage their own reproductive health correctly and the USA needs to be more like Saudi Arabia, Yemen or the Sudan to put these women in their placeI may have got slightly emotional there, but in a nutshell I think that’s it in four paragraphs.There are good existing laws on abortion already and limits to it, but these OWM want to roll back time and put womens lives at risk, and to put feminism back in the box.",0 followers,Naman Chakraborty,6.9K,342,36.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-can-the-INFJ-learn-to-communicate-better-open-up-more-instead-of-being-a-closed-book-and-also-fix-many-of-their-issues-by-learning-how-to-place-appropriate-boundaries
