BI in short is all about deriving information and insights efficiently from data to enable decision making in order to improve Business. Data here refers to all sizes and types.

3,"I had been wanting to take a stab at this one since a few days, but it always looked like an enormous task, because this question has used too many words. In addition, this is a question on which a lot of people have their eyes, and a lot of others have already written elaborate answers.Let me first re-order all the important words:Imagine that you want to become a data scientist, and work in a big organization like Amazon, Intel, Google, FB, Apple and so on.How would that look like?I had been wanting to take a stab at this one since a few days, but it always looked like an enormous task, because this question has used too many words.

I only extracted a few sections out of it conveniently because I only wanted to add on the top of someone else’s knowledge, and put together these concepts like a story so as to inspire the people to think about this subject and begin their own journeys.Big data: The next frontier for innovation, competition, and productivityI will answer a few questions step by step, and wherever possible, I will give a few pictures, or plots to show you how things look like.McKinsey consultants! You are amazing, so if you read things written in this answer that were typed by you at some point in time, I give full credit to you.Let us now talk about analysis: This is big part of being a data scientist.Hope this somewhat elaborate write up gives you some inspiration to hold on to.","47,054 followers",Abhinav Sharma,3.5K,865,7.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/AI-big-data-machine-learning-data-analytics-data-mining-IoT-business-intelligence-etc-are-all-new-and-emerging-technologies-which-are-closely-related-Is-there-a-single-term-which-encompasses-all-of-them-in-a-business-context
4,"No. Because the whole field is in transition and nobody that calls themselves a ‘data scientist’ is over 40 years old, and it takes 20 years for an IT area to mature.Consider the market for object oriented programming languages. That’s been around a long enough time for you to say what’s what. What’s the winner? Easy, Java. What’s number 2, easy, C++.Now big data.

People already know Hadoop and Map/Reduce are primitive and should be deprecated, but still people are saying that’s synonymous with big data, etc. Just like with blockchain, everybody thinks they know something about ML and IOT.I’m saying all of these terms will change and evolve, and in the end we’re not going to call it ‘data science’.

5,"They are used interchangeably since all of them involve working with data to find actionable insights. But I like to differentiate them based on the type of the question you’re asking:What are my sales number for this quarter?What is the profit for this year to date?What are my sales number over the past 6 months?What did the sales look like same quarter last year?…All of these questions are used to report on facts and tools that help you build data models and reports can be classified as “Business Intelligence” tools.Why is my sales number higher for this quarter compared to last quaThey are used interchangeably since all of them involve working with data to find actionable insights. But I like to differentiate them based on the type of the question you’re asking:What are my sales number for this quarter?What is the profit for this year to date?What are my sales number over the past 6 months?What did the sales look like same quarter last year?…All of these questions are used to report on facts and tools that help you build data models and reports can be classified as “Business Intelligence” tools.Why is my sales number higher for this quarter compared to last quarter?Why are we seeing increase in sales over the past 6 months?Why are we seeing decrease in profit over the 6 months?Why does the profit this quarter less compared to same quarter last year?…All of these questions try to figure why something happened? A data analyst typically takes a stab at this. He might use existing Business Intelligence platform to pull data and/or also merge other data sets. He/she then applies data analysis techniques on the data to answer the “why” question and help business user get to the actionable insight.What will be my sales forecast for next year?What will be our profit next year for Scenario A, B & C?Which customers will cancel/churn next quarter?Which new customers will convert to a high-value customer?…All of these questions try to “predict” what will happen next (based on historical data/patterns). Sometimes, you don’t know the questions in the first place so there’s a lot of pro-active thinking going on and usually a “data scientist” are doing that. Sometimes you start with a high level business problem and form “hypothesis” to drive your analysis. All of these can be classified under “data science”.Now, as you can see as we progressed from What -> Why -> What’s next, the level of sophistication needed to do the analysis also increased. So you need a combination of people, process and technology platform in an organization to go from having a Business Intelligence maturity all the way to achieving data science capabilities.Here’s a related blog post that I wrote on this a while back:..And you can check out other stuff I write about here:","37,425 followers",Xavier Amatriain,1.2K,297,8.4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/AI-big-data-machine-learning-data-analytics-data-mining-IoT-business-intelligence-etc-are-all-new-and-emerging-technologies-which-are-closely-related-Is-there-a-single-term-which-encompasses-all-of-them-in-a-business-context

7,"Once upon a time…Somebody figured out how to make a material that is 200 times stronger than the strongest steel, transmits heat into electricity, and is extremely lightweight. Its discovery resulted in the Nobel Prize for Physics being given “for groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene.”Graphene is classified as two-dimensional: it is one atom thick (not pure two-dimensional but as close as we can come) and this form creates several fascinating properties.So why hasn’t this material exploded?
