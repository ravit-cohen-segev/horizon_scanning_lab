0,"Two main reasons.Firstly, there’s something called ‘Economies of scale’.Example.. I want to make a specially shaped piece of metal for a bike I am designing. the piece is unique to my bike.I expect to sell 10,000 of these bikes. The tooling for my special piece of metal costs £100,000 and it will be useless once all my pieces of metal have been made.The metal costs £10, the labour costs £10 and each piece of metal has £100,000 divided by 10,000, which is £10 worth of the £100,000 of tooling in it.So the metal shape costs £30 and I have to sell it for double that to pay for overheads and make eTwo main reasons.Firstly, there’s something called ‘Economies of scale’.Example..

The metal will be used in several models across several years of production.I expect to be making 1.000,000 of these cars in all variations in all markets over 5 years.The metal costs £10, the labour costs £10 and each piece has £100,000 divided by 1,000,000 which is 10p added to it.That makes its cost £20.10, so I can sell it at £40.20.Every part of a low volume device has a similar lack of that economy of scale built onto it.The second reason is the quality of components.Look at a car shock absorber…Cheap pressed steeland now a bike oneinstead of pressed steel we have machine turned light alloy parts, much more sophisticated valving and engineering, better bushings… All of it.…And pretty much everything on a dirt bike is lighter, stronger for its weight, and has significantly more engineering time spent on it.Frankly, most cars are made of cheap materials, and are cheaply made. Weight is not a factor.For most dirt bikes, weight is THE most critical part, and light but strong materials are ALWAYS more expensive.Colin Chapman of Lotus once said that the most expensive thing you can add to a car is lightness…..Ordinary cars are not more sophisticated, they simply have a lot of cheaply built systems…Cheap sensors, heavy low tensile strength metals, and loads of crappy ‘luxury’ features to make you think they are sophisticated….",3 followers,Steve Baker,6.5K,27.4K,163.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-vehicles-such-as-dirt-bikes-ATVs-and-UTVs-so-expensive-compared-to-cars-which-often-have-more-advanced-technology
1,"One single word:We build hideous-looking monstrosities or bland boxes because we perceive they are cheap to build and easy to demolish once they have outlived their usefulness.We do not build for centuries to last. Modern construction estimates a lifespan of 30 to 50 years, after which the building is to be demolished - many buildings in the Oriental cultural spheres are demolished after 10–15 years’ lifespan.There is no point to build beautiful, aesthetic and artistic any more. The era when architecture was a form of art is long gone.","2,430 followers",Travis Pumett,13.6K,6.1K,16.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-vehicles-such-as-dirt-bikes-ATVs-and-UTVs-so-expensive-compared-to-cars-which-often-have-more-advanced-technology
2,"Sure. There’s this popular meme going around that somehow the ancients had secret knowledge lost to humanity and were able to do things we can’t do today. It’s a very romantic view of the ancients, but it’s ultimately nonsense.We can build pyramids today. We don’t though because there’s really no good reason to build a giant fucking pyramid with a small room inside of it. Why would we? That’s right, we wouldn’t.Instead we build shit like this:Edit: By popular demand:Sure.

3,"We could. But no one is willing to pay for it.The Great Pyramid of Giza was built around 2,600 B.C. When Cleopatra, last queen of a free Egypt, died, the pyramid was already over two and a half millennia old. It would remain the tallest building in the world for around 3,800 years, being dethrones by the Lincoln Cathedral in 1311, though it dwarfs the Cathedral, and most modern buildings, in other respects.I mention all of this to give you a sense of perspective. For thousands of years people looked up at the pyramid, and wondered how it was built. Nothing like it was build before, or has beenWe could.

For thousands of years people looked up at the pyramid, and wondered how it was built. Nothing like it was build before, or has been built since. It was filled with indecipherable hieroglyphs, a product of some ancient and unknown culture. Possibly the very first in existence.Its construction has been attributed to giants, to angels, to aliens. All because of how mind mindbogglingly huge, yet pointless, the whole thing is. And for the longest time no one had any idea how it was built.But with the deciphering of the hieroglyphs, and with the advancement of archeology as a field of study, we now have a pretty good idea of how it was done. The pyramids were grand public monuments of a wealthy civilization with an abundance of excess labor.They cut stone blocks and floated them down the river. They arranged hundreds and thousands of workers and had the move the blocks around. They built them in a pyramid, because it was the simplest form the structure could take.There is nothing about the pyramids that is challenging on a technical level, except for organizing this many people towards a single purpose. These were built in honor of a living god. But they were built with simple tools and simple methods.If you could somehow organize that many people again, there’s nothing stopping you from building another pyramid. And if you had the money, you could just use modern equipment to build it 100 times faster.","46,103 followers",Steven Haddock,3.7K,25.6K,343.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-we-build-todays-buildings-with-advanced-technology
4,"The Parthenon was probably the height of world architecture when it was completed at great expense in 438 B.C.E.Within a generation, it was a ruin. It didn’t even last as long as the Athenian civilization that built it.These buildings were unimaginably expensive at the time and were largely built to impress people, even though the Parthenon was also built as a temple. The Parthenon still stands of course, but its frieze is in England and lost its paint millennia ago. Well intentioned attempts to re-built its columns actually caused more harm than good as it turned out the columns were each cusThe Parthenon was probably the height of world architecture when it was completed at great expense in 438 B.C.E.Within a generation, it was a ruin.

The Parthenon still stands of course, but its frieze is in England and lost its paint millennia ago. Well intentioned attempts to re-built its columns actually caused more harm than good as it turned out the columns were each custom made and non-interchangable. There was also the issue with using steel to reinforce it, which soon rusted in Athens’ salt air (The Greeks used lead instead).I live in a building that’s over a century old and 25% of our revenue goes to capital repair of the building, part of which is reinforcing parts of the building that are sagging under the load of modern things like bookcases and bedroom sets.",2 followers,Himanshu Chavhan,20.4K,71,659.6K,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-we-build-todays-buildings-with-advanced-technology

6,"All building is based on previous experience. The physics involved is complex, dealing with earth movement, soil types, weather, materials, usage, and other problems. Architects use computers and numerous figures and charts detailing material strength, planning, computing costs and other details. Bricks were a technological advance over blocks. Lasers and computers were advances over water levels and hand addition.

8,"So cruel compared to what?Compared to pretty much every other animal species on earth, among all the species cognitively sophisticated enough to even be cruel at all, humans are, by far, the least cruel on average to both each other and other species.Compared to an ideal of zero/minimal cruelty?The very fact that humans can imagine such an ideal, aspire to it, and criticize each other for failing to live up to it is one of the main reasons humans ARE the least cruel of all species on earth.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-we-build-todays-buildings-with-advanced-technology
