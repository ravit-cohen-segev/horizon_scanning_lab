A human is complex - considered to be the most complex construct in the known universe. Human reproduction is complex - resolves a lot of our complications.The genetic family can be said to be the progenitor of order and the self evident. Love is complex; law is complicated.Having said that however, with evolution - emergence can be observed in all pregnancies that occur in all life forms. As a results of this, it acts in providing for orderly change as opposed to the chaotic serendipity of natural selection. Emergence can be also observed as; the innate condition; the fact of emergence; conception; the intrinsic condition; the mechanisms of emergence; gestation; and the abstract condition.Here are two answers that are interconnected fundamentally:As a matter of fact, emergence refers to the existence or formation of collective behaviors, or what parts of a system do together that they would not do alone. The major problem occurs in the attempt to adapt inorganic compounds to the behavior of organic compounds. We have no technical knowledge or scientific methods known in the implementating of any Artificial Intelligence, nor do we have a pathway for any such strategy. AI is an idiom or metaphor and an oxymoron.Moreover, the above, the brain has two major neural networks. There is a whitematter network and a greymatter network. Consciousness is whitematter controlled as myelination provides high speed impulses for input and output to and from the unmyelinated greymatter. With that being said, however, a clear distinction to be made is that computer software is not technology; it is a figure that can be used to represent the value of something in a calculation, as tools for human beings. Humans are the most complex constructs in the known universe.Infact, I am willing to state that the nuanced intricacies of non-linear, interconnectedness are processes being used for the purpose of simpifying; complexity. The axiomatic presuppositions; are predicated on findings, which attempt to explain the important role in the genetic hereditary component of human evolotionary behavioural variation. Scientific observations have found the direct correlation with mental abilities to physical characteristics, and had been used as a catalyst for psychologists, biologists, and geneticists who have pursued academic research explorations: into the role of nature and nurture relations to human traits. In the past, some traits that are more somatically defined, such as morphological characteristics like height, were assumed to be more heritable than other traits, such as human behavior, for which the role of genetic influences have at times been fiercely contested by the use of forcibly aaggressive tactics.Now, in the last few decades - advancemencts made in technological enhancement with certain tools. And; more specifically computerised digitization have made faster qualitative observation with improved clarity. This proved conducive for the detail oriented objective scientific data collection.",36 followers,Adam Ambrozy,579,0,0,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-could-the-future-of-robots-look-like
1,"Our future is moving toward the state where the principle work we will need to be engaged with is that of building positive human connections. Robots will take care of everything else. In general, our world is gradually reaching the point where we all will shift into a new unified, spiritual consciousness, and robots will remain in the material matter. Afterward, they too will disappear.In principle, our world will gradually manifest itself as a world of energies, spirit and a web of forces, not physical mater. Matter does not really exist, which already becomes apparent in quantum physics.SoOur future is moving toward the state where the principle work we will need to be engaged with is that of building positive human connections.

On the contrary, we will strive to make sure that everything we do is transferred to robots and we will do what robots cannot: the spiritual work of building positive connections and expanding human consciousness to the next, spiritual level of existence.",0 followers,Lance Chambers,555,7.6K,24.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-could-the-future-of-robots-look-like
2,"Depends…your question is vague at best because you may or may not be indirectly actually asking “What do you think about AI in the future?” and so I will do you justice and answer both scenarios:Robots in the future: Well I think robotic advancements as well technology in general is cool and especially if it makes our lives better, safer, more productive, more fun, interesting and helps our environment instead of harming it so take for example the toaster oven….which is not even a futuristic concept - I love toasters…why? they provide convenient and quick, tasty food when I want that.

I Also like Bicycles….I cycle like 5–6 miles a day, I Also enjoy VR video gaming.What I do not agree with is the advancement of AI technologies when it is used in conjunction with weaponry….you see this is where I would rather support a law banning worldwide advancement of military AI smart tech because just like in Terminator 2 “Skynet” may just take over one day and fuc* up all of us…….I Think the more intelligent person will draw a line when it comes to AI advancement so much so that you give life to a machine that may or may not be able to destroy you…why leave that chance open just because you can? unless you are stupid?Robots in the present times: I generally support robotic advancements, new inventions, gadgets and such these days like I said long as we do not reach the “Skynet” stage and stay far behind it but things like the Tesla car (Which I have driven) and or flying camera drone technologies and or how they automate food factories I support all of that sort of stuff I think its ok to advance that kind of tech and its very interesting stuff.","135,500 followers",Hector Quintanilla,3.1K,1.2K,88.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-could-the-future-of-robots-look-like
3,"For most people it would look exactly how things looks now.Hollywood loves to depict future robotic society as humanoid robots walking among us..The computer equivalent would be that all of todays rooms would be half filled with a wall sized array of blinking lights.Obviously that didn't happen. Chances are your room currently has more computers in it right now than existed some 50+ years ago.But you don't see them because they're built into your clocks, TV's, music players, phone, etc. You might actually have a desktop PC or laptop but those are becoming rarer as people use their smart phonesFor most people it would look exactly how things looks now.Hollywood loves to depict future robotic society as humanoid robots walking among us..The computer equivalent would be that all of todays rooms would be half filled with a wall sized array of blinking lights.Obviously that didn't happen.

Contrary to popular belief the (bipedal) human(oid) form factor isn’t optimum for most tasks. It’s much more likely that robots will be specialized for specific tasks, most (if not all) of which will not require a bipedal humanoid form factor. (IOW: think R2D2; not C3PO.)Take the next decade for example: I expect it to be the decade of the driverless vehicle. By 2030 most cars will be autonomous… but you won’t see any bipedal humanoid robots driving cars in place of a human driver. Instead the cameras, computers and motors used to control the cars will all be built into the cars directly. By then most probably won’t even have steering wheels.Self driving cars won't look like this:They'll more likely look like this:Sorry Jetsons… no Rosie…","16,642 followers",Lee Thé,944,10.1K,80.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-could-the-future-of-robots-look-like

Scrolling through these answers I see a lot of wit and a lot of honest discussion of the role that caffeine and sugar play in most of our lives. Nonetheless, I feel one observation ought to be made.You guys definitely haven’t tried heroin.That’s good. I strongly recommend that you keep sugar and caffeine as your greatest addictions because there are some that can chew you up and spit you out before you even realize the hold they have on you.Another thing that I feel is worth mentioning is that different people can have a wide spectrum of reactions to drugs. Anybody who can tell you what drug is the most addictive because they read about it in a study have never gone through the awful experience of getting clean after a serious addiction.At some point in my past, I have done pretty much every drug that the average person can name. I have been extraordinarily blessed in that I have managed much better than many others who have walked similar paths and somehow always seemed resistant to the real soul-wrenching addiction that people I knew battled with. I quit cigarettes with virtually no effort. Crack, supposedly one of the most addictive drugs on Earth gave me little trouble when I decided I’d done enough. Meth, I barely got into in the first place.But heroin… that shit kicks you right in the balls.To be clear, I still had it easy. There was no Trainspotting-esque horror sequence with a baby on a ceiling. Just a whole lot of sweating, shitting, and desperately wanting a hit. Part of my advantage came from the fact that I never injected, which meant that I never dove quite all the way into the deep end. I was a dragon-chaser, and told myself that as long as I didn’t start injecting, I wasn’t really an addict. My body, in the end, was happy to tell me otherwise.The thing about heroin is that it is actually difficult to describe to someone who has never done it just how amazing it makes you feel. Everyone is desperate to find a way to feel good. People go to great lengths, spend enormous amounts of money, and fly all over the world just to feel 20% as awesome as someone who’s high on skag. It’s incredible and beautiful and it feels as though everything is going to be okay. Then it fades and you start to feel shitty again. Then you take another hit and become king of the world a little bit longer.Heroin was the only drug that ever really raked me over the coals. Fortunately, I was well prepared for the final push, and had a job and a life waiting for me on the other side. Looking back on my rather extensive substance abuse, I can say that skag was the only monster that ever really made me feel afraid.I’d be lying if I said that I didn’t still get cravings on occasion, but having walked that lonesome valley for myself, I know better than to put my body through it again. I feel bad talking about getting clean because for whatever reason I appear to have won a genetic lottery that allows me to give up highly addictive substances with relative ease. I have also helped friends get clean and I have seen how devastating a process it can be. There were times when I thought they might die from it, though I am glad to say that those who did it with me all made it out the other side in the end.If there are any young people reading who are thinking of trying out drug use, allow me to share with you a sliver of advice that comes from experience. Drugs are incredibly fun and anyone who tells you otherwise is lying. At the same time, they demand a price of you that you might not fully understand going in. I’m not going to tell anyone else what to put in their body, but I can assure you that full-fledged addiction is no fun at all. It isn’t a cool party.It’s going to a cool party and passing out in the middle of the floor while pissing yourself.In conclusion, don’t do heroin. At best it will become a difficult and occasionally shameful memory.And to those of you who are not struggling with addiction, take a moment to be grateful for the wonderful freedom that you enjoy. There’s an exquisite world out there to see, so keep on reaping the harvest of your days.","1,731 followers",Heath Weaver,2.6K,471,4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-could-the-future-of-robots-look-like
