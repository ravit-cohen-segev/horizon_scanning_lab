1,"There have some very interesting advances in human hibernation over the past few years. This is a technology that has an immediate benefit: if you can get someone to deeply hibernate, it lowers the metabolism enough to give you more time to surgically intervene in tissues that are very sensitive to oxygen or nutrient deprivation. Hypothermia is used routinely in some times of surgery, but that’s just the beginning. Because the benefit is immediate and obvious, it’s reasonable to expect continued and aggressive progress on this.Immorality involves the ability to manipulate, repair, and replaceThere have some very interesting advances in human hibernation over the past few years.

Hypothermia is used routinely in some times of surgery, but that’s just the beginning. Because the benefit is immediate and obvious, it’s reasonable to expect continued and aggressive progress on this.Immorality involves the ability to manipulate, repair, and replace essentially all metabolic systems. Thus, it’s harder than human hibernation and should be expected to take a lot longer. Possibly longer than anyone now alive, though I’m dying to be proven wrong. Still, there are some very interesting things being done and some of those tech Billionaires are just as reluctant to miss their chance at an in-person tour of the Solar System as I am and boring big buck$ into research, so who knows?So, that leaves the space craft. How big? The itty bitty ones that Hawking and his Russian billionaire pal are proposing are much easier to make go super fast. A couple of problems, though. One is that you have to buy and operate a whole bunch of lasers, but then turn ’em off and let them rot. Not an enticing investment. Second, people do what excites them. And what excites people is people. So, slinging a bunch of electronic poker ships across the galactic neighborhood doesn’t make for good show business.On the other hand, slinging a bunch of people into a dangerous expedition, well, that’s got legs, babe! So, I think your 5% of the speed of light might launch a probe, but it really seems more likely that will have to wait until we can get people out there. And that, probably requires immortality or extended human hibernation.

28,"We have, or can imagine, the technology but have not found answers for many of the physiological difficulties the human body faces living with substantially more or less than 1 G gravity (anything inside 1G +/- 30% seems sustainable but outside that is known to cause serious problems). We have yet to find a consistent and ample supply of water, oxygen, food and fuel and can not possibly take enough with us. We do not yet have the technology to terraform even a small area of the Moon or Mars and have not found actual quantities necessary for prolonged habitation,",136 followers,Sakshi Mohapatra,6.1K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-technology-is-more-likely-to-be-introduced-in-the-next-100-years-human-hibernation-immortality-or-5-light-speed-spacecraft
29,"I have to disagree with the other answers here, though it might be a matter of definitions as much as anything else. We won’t be able to colonize “space” for a very, very long time. I’m using the term “colony” to refer to a self-sustaining settlement that can continue to thrive without large-scale support from nations that established it. We’ve got a lot of problems to solve before we can do that.What we can do is set up permanently-staffed outposts. We could probably set those up on the Moon or Mars within 20 years, but only if we were willing to expend a lot of resources to do it.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,17K,996,156M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-technology-is-more-likely-to-be-introduced-in-the-next-100-years-human-hibernation-immortality-or-5-light-speed-spacecraft
30,"Thanks for the A2AThis is guesswork, but if by ‘colonize’, you mean set up a very small outpost that has some independence for day-to-day essentials (such as food, water, fuel, air), but will rely totally on Earth to provide technology, replacement parts, and pretty much everything else, then I think the answer might just be ‘yes’, technically. However, I think it would be politically impossible to devote the vast resources necessary. Much of the required engineering must be largely untried in the ‘field’ - to commit the lives of even a small outpost to it has to be highly dangerous if attemptThanks for the A2AThis is guesswork, but if by ‘colonize’, you mean set up a very small outpost that has some independence for day-to-day essentials (such as food, water, fuel, air), but will rely totally on Earth to provide technology, replacement parts, and pretty much everything else, then I think the answer might just be ‘yes’, technically. However, I think it would be politically impossible to devote the vast resources necessary. Much of the required engineering must be largely untried in the ‘field’ - to commit the lives of even a small outpost to it has to be highly dangerous if attempted in just 20 years.So - for a direct answer - perhaps technically yes, just, for a tiny, dependent outpost. But in practice, no-way!To set up a truly self-sustaining colony that can expand and grow without relying on support from Earth - not for centuries. Perhaps not even then - how would one justify the investment in time, effort and resources for a project that won’t solve any problems that we have. Where in the solar system would we want to go in preference to where we are now? But small outposts - probably in time - all over the solar system!Unless of course we discover some new fundamental physics that lets us travel to nearby stars in realistic timescales for human travel without crazy time dilation. But that is in fantasy land - might happen but probably won’t!",0 followers,Priyan Bopitiya,4.7K,269,7.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-technology-is-more-likely-to-be-introduced-in-the-next-100-years-human-hibernation-immortality-or-5-light-speed-spacecraft
31,"Well, since we can’t stop fighting each other for long enough to fund such missions and cooperate on them…never mind the time it takes to design and build a spacecraft big enough to allow for colonization, and train the people who would be the first wave of colonists…and the fact that we’re so busy destroying the one we’ve already got…and of course the fact that we don’t yet fully know the long term effects on the human body and psyche of prolonged interplanetary travel, varying temperatures and levels of gravity, atmospheric differences etc….Yeah, I think 20 years would be awfully optimistic.Well, since we can’t stop fighting each other for long enough to fund such missions and cooperate on them…never mind the time it takes to design and build a spacecraft big enough to allow for colonization, and train the people who would be the first wave of colonists…and the fact that we’re so busy destroying the one we’ve already got…and of course the fact that we don’t yet fully know the long term effects on the human body and psyche of prolonged interplanetary travel, varying temperatures and levels of gravity, atmospheric differences etc….Yeah, I think 20 years would be awfully optimistic.
