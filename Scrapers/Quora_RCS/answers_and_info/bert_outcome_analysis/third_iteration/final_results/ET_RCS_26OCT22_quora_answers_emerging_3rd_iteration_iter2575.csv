Push your limits and go for it.Now as a generalised question, I should answer in a flowchart manner which I explains my friends. Answer a few questions and you will get answer.MoneySurgical branches give good amount of money. But surgical specialities are too hectic to payback. Still orthopedics gives best. Dermatology fatches money in huge amount because of long benign course of diseases. Ophthalmology is branch where you can easily earn easy money. Gynecology and pediatrics are altime good. Radiology is a good option too.Peaceful lifeAmong clinical branches, Dermatology, Radiology, Psychiatry, Ophthalmology, ENT have relatively less emergencies to handle. Endocrinology, Neurology, Nephrology also have less rushing.FameGeneral surgery, ophthalmology, Oncology, OBGY, pediatrics can make you famous more than others. Anaesthesia gives nothing. Neurology, Neurosurgery, Dermatology, Rheumatology have minimal cure rate - so very less fame.ChallengeI believe most challenging are Neurosurgery, Cardiology, Oncology, oncosurgery and pediatrics, psychiatry.Social servicesBest is community medicine. But with any branch, you can serve society.TeachingNon-clinicals are best. But if you want to form good doctors for future, choose either general surgery/Medicine and join as a professor.Easy workSome work are relatively easy as you get most of generalized case. You can transfer the cases you find hard to treat. (You can still find chalanging if you want!) Dermatology (not much difference in Rx), Pulmonary, ENT, ophthalmology, OBGY, Radiology (In peripheral centre where till no MRI-CT has came, work is relatively easy). Non clinicals are always easier!Surgical branch - more hard work, more challenge, more money, hectic life, more physical stamina.Medical - more on the table-chair work, lesser emergencies (except Cardiology/Emergency Medicine).NonLaboratory branches :Community Medicine :Orthopedics :Dermatology :Radiology :Psychiatry :Pediatrics :General Medicine / Surgery :Medical specialities :Surgical specialities :Few Rare specialities are there, but for that, go only if you have deep interest.

3,"This is one of the many questions about medical specialties that we find in Quora. A sample of the others:This answer is an attempt to find a common thread in all these questions.In the mind of the non-medical person there are prestigious andThis is one of the many questions about medical specialties that we find in Quora. A sample of the others:This answer is an attempt to find a common thread in all these questions.In the mind of the non-medical person there are prestigious and non-prestigious diseases. The club man at the bridge table is apt at the slightest provocation to rub the left side of his chest and announce that he has had a triple bypass surgery. He flaunts this experience like a badge of honour. His partner who had recently completed a course of injections for syphilis is unlikely to mention that to anyone. Does it imply that a cardiac surgeon commands greater respect than a venereologist? The most highly venerated doctors in the General Hospital, Madras when we were students in the early 50s were Dr. Rajam and Dr. Rangiah, both professors of the venereology department.Doctors do not differentiate specialties as prestigious and non- prestigious, hard or easy, or those that lead to riches and those that do not. At some point during the college course or during internship the young doctor develops a liking for a specialty. One student, a couple of years my senior, decided that he would be a microbiologist even when he was a fourth-year medical student doing his undergraduate study in that subject. After internship he joined government medical service and opted for microbiology. He acquired the necessary qualification and was a popular assistant professor in the college. But for his tragic death he would have risen to eminence in that field.Many times, the doctor is inspired by his professor. A classmate of mine chose leprology. He was a recipient of many national and other awards for his work among leprosy patients in Mumbai. During one of our batch reunions I asked him what made him choose leprosy. ‘I attended a few clinical demonstrations by Prof. Ramanajum in the Leprosarium in Tirumani near Madras,’ he said, ‘and I was bitten.’ Incidentally in the eye of the public there can be no medical specialty lower in prestige than leprology, but that specialty never lacks for doctors. Leprosy is a fascinating disease. My classmate is by no means the only doctor to be so bitten.Many women doctors in India choose obstetrics and gynaecology as their first-choice specialty. The demand for women doctors in ob/gyn is so great that they join out of necessity. Men are generally not welcome for cultural reasons. That is sad for men, for obstetrics is a specialty like none other. It is the only specialty in which hospitalisation is a joyous event for the patient. There are a few men in that field in India and they do well. Maybe if more join the cultural shackles may be broken.Even as early as during their rotating internship doctors decide whether it is a medical specialty or surgical specialty they prefer. Those that have decided on medicine may wish to forgo the hands-on experience for surgery that is part of the training. During my days as a surgeon I used to insist that these doctors have a taste of handling the scalpel. When in the future they refer cases for surgery they must be in position to reassure their patients from a position of experience.No specialty is harder than the other, but none is a cake walk. The first and second year in the medical college are the hardest for that is when anatomy and physiology must be mastered. Whatever happens later cannot compare to that. Can preventive medicine compare with cardiac surgery? It can as was clearly demonstrated when Covid-19 raised its demonic head. Those who did not take heed to the advice of epidemiologists paid a heavy price. These epidemiologists did not produce their advice out of thin air. It was the result of years of study. Epidemiology does not have glamour in the public eye but if the number of lives saved is the yardstick it leaves all other specialties far behind.Cardiac surgery and neurosurgery are currently holding the attention of the public. Doctors training for these two specialties know the anatomy, physiology, and pathology of the organs they are dealing, and their diseases and the treatment from their undergraduate years. During training as general surgeons they know a lot more. With this background the preparation to be cardiac and neurosurgeons is just one more step forward. This goes for all specialties.In a doctor’s life there are moments of great frustration when a patient one expects to improve does not. As an internee to Dr Ramamurthy, the neurosurgeon, I remember his giving vent to his frustration as he came out of a patient’s room. That patient had cerebrospinal fluid leak from his nostrils which just would not stop. After an effort the previous day, the surgeon was making rounds in that room to find no change in the patient. The patient was deeply depressed, and the body language of his relatives was distinctly anti-Ramamurthy.‘I wish I had chosen a non-emergency, no night calls specialty,’ he said.‘If you are thinking of dermatology you might be wrong,’ said his assistant. ‘My uncle who was a skin specialist spoke the same words when he could not stop sever itching in a patient after 2 week’s treatment.’Doctors do not make distinctions between specialties. As for the patient, the specialist who is caring for his disease is king. The opinion of the rest matters little.",UNKNOWN,Pallab Roy Chowdhury (GENERAL non Ews),837,357,20.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-medical-specialty-uses-the-most-advanced-technology

Not since the Mongols perfected archery on horseback, or Europe got ahold of Chinese gunpowder.The problem we’re running into is this: Rate of Change has been increasing, as the complexity and power of our technology has been increasing. You’ve probably noticed. Atomic bombs. Petro-economics, politics and climate change.

I am going to share what has led to my misanthropic nihilism and negativity concerning the current “state of affairs.”Even with our greater technology, I-Phones, computers, medical advances, and other luxuries, these problems lessen us every day, and not enough people care to do a damn thing about it. Obsessive greed is one of the things we most need to tackle, from big corporations to medicine and higher education. Money is important but we have allowed that obsession to get in the way of the higher interest of caring for all our citizens. Making all their needs more affordable and obtainable is a good start. I am thankful I do not have kids. I would grieve incessantly now to think of the world I have brought them into. I only hope that younger people are observing this disaster and that they will take the reigns and make some needed changes. It may be too late.* To the few folks (including a lady who was so rude I deleted her comment) who think we should love the country as it is or “get out,” I say this. Such reactions are naive and juvenile. I love my country and I wish to see it become better. Civilizations do not progress through complacency. They advance when folks sound alarms and encourage change. That is why women and minority groups now have rights they would never have enjoyed had they just “loved it or got out.”",4 followers,Matthew Bates,997,9.8K,293.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-can-the-most-advanced-technology-today-ML-AI-Adv-Computing-be-used-to-combat-racism-and-supremacist-ideology
