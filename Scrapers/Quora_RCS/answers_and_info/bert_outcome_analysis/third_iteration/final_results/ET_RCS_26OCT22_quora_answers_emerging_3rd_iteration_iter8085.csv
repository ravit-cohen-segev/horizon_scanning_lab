ItIf you run a supercomputer on Windows you had better budget a lot of money for Windows Server licenses, client licenses, etc. Oh, but let’s imagine Microsoft donates Windows (maybe so they can brag about Windows running your supercomputer). Now your problem is that few or none of your peers have that deal so they are still running Linux, so if you want to run something that your peers are running you need to port it. (And suppose next year you want to double the size of your supercomputer… better hope Microsoft is still donating Windows.)Now imagine you hit a bug in the supercomputer. In Linux, if you identify the bug, odds are good someone will fix it for you; but you might have an expert on your staff who can fix it for you, and in the worst case you can hire an expert and have him/her fix it. With Windows, you would have to ask Microsoft to look into the issue, and hope that they will fix it in a reasonable time. Your emergency isn’t their emergency, and you don’t have the option to just hire someone to fix it.I once attended a presentation given by a guy from Oracle, and he told us about the “Oracle Unbreakable” promise: if you buy the “Unbreakable” level of support and you have a problem, an Oracle guySo Linux is battle-tested, open, and free.

Essentially, a superpower like the US cannot falls too hard for fears of collateral damage to the international community. We might be avoiding a planatary size recession in this case. Most of the damage should be localized to the US and those heavily dependant on it.On China’s side, they are on the rise. These tarrifs, bans, sanctions etc, are required for them to go through. It allows for a learning process and to ractify their weaknesses and dependancy issues. I’m quite sure China as a whole can withstand this and come out stronger than the US is currently in a few years. From here onwards, regardless of whether ZTE survives this, China will be looking into processes to close the loop on where they are lacking. And the chinese seldom repeats their mistakes.On another point, it’s not that the Chinese cannot retaliate to such bans effectively, they can. If the chinese really wants to retaliate in kind, they can just ban the sale of rare earth to the US or to the major chips manufacturer in the US. After all, they produce 90% of the world’s supply.Would the US have the ability to produce their own supply or find a cost effective subsititute if it comes to that? Sure they can, but just like how ZTE is affected, it will take quite awhile to have sufficient infrastructure and scale to do that. I estimate it to be about 5–7 years.

Because of the depreciation of CNY, those providers have been taking a huge hit. They have to refrain from fuming the real estate bubble in China.With some CNY depreciation, China was able to mitigate the stress on its export sector while at the same time get rid of its CNY debt. When Yuan depreciate, China exchanged USD to CNY to pay off all the CNY debt. The deleveraging process is almost completed by now. When the Yuan appreciate for a few month (the war was on hold at the time), China was able to exchange some CNY to USD and pay off some USD debt.US’s new visa policy also makes sure more talents are moving back to China. It is much easier for China to attract talented scientists and engineers.

It has become a kind of quadrennial tradition ever since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) debate took centre stage in the 1992 election.Trump: “Our trading partners are cheating us, bilateral trade deficits are hurting the U.S. economy, U.S. negotiators have done a bad job with trade deals, and higher tariffs would help the U.S. economy.” Politicians often get criticized for flip-flopping, as they change their policy positions over time in an attempt to please voters or interest groups. On tariffs, Donald Trump has not flipped or flopped at all. As president, he is implementing the exact same policies he has talked about for years. Unfortunately, they are bad policies, based on a misreading of history and a misunderstanding of economics.In the 1800s, governments used tariffs as a primary source of revenue. Administratively, it was easiest to collect taxes on products as they entered a country, so for most countries tariffs were a main source of government funding. However, over the years governments found other alternatives, and tariffs as revenue became less important. Tariffs were also used to protect domestic industries. Other groups were hurt by this: U.S. consumers, who paid higher prices; and U.S. exporters, who were hit with retaliatory tariffs imposed by our trading partners. The infamous Smoot-Hawley tariffs just after the start of the Great Depression disaster led Congress to delegate some of its power over trade to the president, so as to avoid constantly caving in to special interests. Giving the president more power over trade was successful for a while. However, there was a flaw: It only worked if the president supported trade liberalization. Most presidents did, at least to some degree, but now we have a president who genuinely believes it is good policy to give special interests what they want. Steel and aluminium producers get protection from competition; and farmers get subsidies to make up for the harms they suffer in the tariff war. All the while, consumers and taxpayers pay the price.Now we have testimony from farmers who are suffering from the retaliatory tariffs imposed by Mexico, Canada, the EU, China and others; manufacturers facing higher steel prices due to the Trump administration’s steel tariffs; and lower- and middle-class consumers who will soon notice price rises in their basic necessities as the administration’s tariffs on Chinese products increase. Tariffs encourage the deflection of trade to inefficient producers and the smuggling of goods to evade those tariffs; such distortions reduce welfare. Furthermore, consumers lose more from tariffs than producers gain, so there is deadweight loss. The redistributions associated with tariffs tend to create vested interests, so harms tend to persist. Broad-based protectionism can also provoke retaliation, which adds further costs in other markets. While the imposition of a tariff can reduce the flow of imports, it is unlikely to change the trade balance unless it fundamentally alters the balance of saving and investment. Tariff increases lead to declines of output and productivity in the medium term as well as increases in unemployment and inequality.In his writings, Navarro makes five distinctThe impossible-competition argumentIn ‘Death by China’, Navarro and Autry wrote that “China has stolen millions of American manufacturing jobs” and that “if we had held onto those jobs, America’s unemployment would be well below 5%.” In writing this they confounded macroeconomic factors and trade issues. In May 2016, five years after their book was published, the U.S. unemployment rate was 4.7%, and it has continued declining ever since. This is really scapegoating China. And during the same period, real U.S. income (real GDP) increased by 26%. All this occurred despite the worst recession since the Great Depression! The value of the goods imported from China is also often exaggerated. According to research done at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the proportion of American consumer expenditures that go to China, including the value of the Chinese inputs incorporated into what’s produced in America, is 1.9%. This is because Chinese goods occupy a big share only in relatively small categories of consumer expenditures (such as clothing and shoes, or furniture and household equipment), and because two-thirds of what Americans consume is composed of domestic services—such things as health care, education, and housing.Navarro’s “externality” argument is remarkably shoddy. Outcompeting producers is not technically an “externality,” but the normal result of a free and flexible economy where “creative destruction” occurs. If the result of competition is considered an externality, everything in economic life is an externality and the concept becomes useless. In the Schumpeterian world of Chinese commerce, it is death by competition for literally hundreds of start-ups within the country.The fairness argument: “Unfair” trade is not free trade and is destroying the American economy.Perhaps what people resent is competition based on allegedly unfair advantages that create a “non-level playing field.” This fairness argument may be the foundation of all other protectionist arguments, in the general public and among politicians. It’s an important argument that needs to be addressed. Intellectual property theft can be dealt with, through the WTO and ordinary courts, even Chinese courts. “American IP owners have in recent years enjoyed increased success in enforcing their rights in Chinese courts,” Stanford law professor Paul Goldstein has observed. Even the USA didn’t give a hoot about patents in its early years and up until 1989 when it decided to adhere to the 1886 Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works. From mid-2005 to late July 2018, the yuan increased in value 18% against the dollar, even counting the 8% drop since April 2018 when American protectionism started battering the Chinese currency. A national state cannot undervalue its currency for very long because doing so requires an increasing money supply, which generates domestic inflation and exerts an opposite effect on the currency.As for the lack of labor and environmental regulations in China, why should that be an issue? There were no such regulations in America and other Western countries when they started growing during the Industrial Revolution. Are rich Western producers (including trade unions) now going to dictate such regulations in developing countries? This sort of fairness looks rather self-serving and unfair.In general, low wages in poor countries are not “unfair.” It is because of their low wages that they have a comparative advantage in some economic sectors. Advanced countries have a comparative advantage in sectors more intensive in capital—including the human capital of specialized workers. This is a conclusion of the theory of comparative advantage that Navarro ignores. If the Chinese government is more mercantilist than the U.S. government, for whom is this unfair? Certainly not American consumers, who obtain cheaper goods thanks to the hapless Chinese taxpayers who pay the subsidies. It is not unfair for American consumers to get bargains on goods from China or other developing countries. It is not unfair to let private firms, wherever they are, compete to satisfy consumers. What is clearly unfair is to use the power of government to protect a small number of American producers, like the 2,400 American workers (at most) occupied in manufacturing washing machines, plus the shareholders (not all American) of the few domestic washer manufacturers, to the detriment of 97 million American households.The trade deficit argument: The U.S. trade deficit is a serious problem that reduces gross domestic product and indicates unfair trade.The trade deficit is a false problem originating from a faulty economic analysis, a statistical confusion, and a sort of logical prank. The economic error is to assume that a trade deficit is bad in itself. The United States had a regular trade deficit—or, more precisely, a merchandise deficit—until the Civil War, and a surplus during the Great Depression and the two world wars. There is nothing intrinsically bad about a global trade deficit, which implies that net foreign investment is coming into the country. Also, there is nothing intrinsically good in a trade surplus, which implies that net capital is leaving the country. A trade deficit, however, may be bad when as is currently the case in the United States, it is due mainly to high federal budget deficits that attract foreign purchases of Treasury bonds, but this cannot be attributed to the fault of foreign investors. The logical prank comes from begging the question, what is the problem with a trade deficit? It reveals unfair trade practices, answer protectionists. But how does a protectionist determine that trade is unfair? By observing that it results in a trade deficit! What sort of baloney is that?The retaliation argument: Retaliatory protectionist measures are justified against protectionist countries; such retaliators are the real free-traders.The retaliation argument claims that protectionism and retaliation against a mercantilist country actually promote “real” free trade. Some people go so far as to say that the protectionists in the Trump administration are free-traders at heart. Such beliefs are contradicted by their own actions as I illustrated in my answerSo we are now actually watching the effects of tariffs on domestic consumers, absolutely self-detrimental. Any trade is beneficial to all trading partners; otherwise, one party would walk away from the exchange. Individuals and private bodies should be left free to make their own bargains. The goal should not be to stop China from growing but, on the contrary, to not interfere with its people as they become richer and freer, just as Americans simultaneously do. Tariffs are short-term gains for politicians in exchange for economic pain, possibly long-term, for nearly everyone else, a standard result of government interventionism.The national security argument: Protectionism is required for reasons of national security.The national security argument is really just a protectionist excuse. If steel and aluminium are security issues, so are food and clothing – soldiers don’t fight naked and go hungry. It is trivially true that any foreign country that becomes richer could represent a more serious military threat because its government can extract or requisition more resources for war purposes. But it is no less true that wealthier people are likely to be less willing to go to war because they have more to lose economically. Thus trade can help prevent war. Making pariahs of the Chinese will harm, not improve, national security.But isn’t Chinese industrial policy a great threat? No. It is an error to believe, contra economic theory and history, that the controlled enterprises in a country dominated by a communist government can constitute a grave danger for efficient capitalist enterprises. The threat to the U.S. economy posed by the Japanese turned out to be greatly exaggerated. If China isn’t backsliding and its producers make advances in freedom and economic efficiency, then that is good for all of mankind.“Protecting” U.S. manufacturing is probably as outdated from a national security viewpoint as it is from a narrower economic viewpoint. Remember that in America as in other advanced countries, two-thirds of consumer expenditures are devoted to services. Another reason why the proportion of employment in the manufacturing sector has beenNavarro and his like-minded coterie are motivated by military fears and nationalist emotions. His arguments are not based on economic analysis. The trade deficit is caused by federal profligacy, in which case the solution is to solve the root cause of the problem. To obtain better results, one ought to apply a two-pronged approach: file complaints against China at the WTO under the various provisions that apply here (China is under greater obligations than most countries, as per the terms of its accession), and negotiate new rules in a multilateral agreement with China. An important part of the negotiation is that the United States and its allies have to be willing to give something. A one-sided deal is difficult for any country to accept, and this is certainly the case for China, given its history with unequal trade treaties with Western countries. For example, in exchange for China lowering its tariffs, the United States and its allies could agree to abandon the special, more onerous, calculation method used for China and a few other countries when setting anti-dumping duties. And recognising China as a market economy as promised. United States should also be negotiating trade liberalization directly with these same trading partners. The preferential trading arrangements that result would put China at a disadvantage and put pressure on it to liberalize. Unilateral tariffs have led to Chinese tariffs in response, but tariff liberalization could put pressure on China to pursue its own liberalization so as not to be at a disadvantage. That would have been a better strategy.It is possible to push China in the continued direction of reform. Think about the progress it has made since 1978. But reform in China will not happen with a trade policy that slaps tariffs on all U.S. trading partners and turns allies into foes.Thanks for A2A.",0 followers,Paul Sutton,3.1K,19.3K,15M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Have-any-scientists-been-successful-in-simulating-a-universe-with-intelligent-life

Apple first of all makes $350 gross profit, and multitude of other suppliers make the rest.The accounting here is that ChinaBut wait - this might end up cost more moneyThe exact same thing applies to Cisco. And IBM. And so on.MoveIn fact, you can reduce the trade deficit between US and China by 50–70% just be accounting for it differently (correctly). Problem solved.RubberTextilesSo no, the US cannot win a trade war with China because the US is the main beneficiary of the current global hegemony. The more they win the war, the more they lose the war.This is a contest of basically who can punch themselves in the face the hardest - how can you “win” a war like that?<<- - ————————————————— - ->>Next.If it’s a face-punching contest you want, then it’s about which citizens can take more pain.In the US, when gas prices rise, people get very unhappy. Gas is less than 5% of total monthly expenditures for most people, and when it goes up 50%, people tend to drive less, and in the end a 50% increase in gas prices probably hits the pocketbooks by about 2% at most.And yet…Granted, there are many other factors involved in the above, but do remember the graph in the article happens to be an economic boom time.Now we’re talking about increasing prices of every day goods by 15 - 25%How about China?One party system, where most people still remember starvation, have over 50% savings rate, very little personal debt, and where most people own their homes.Oh yah, they remember the Opium Wars, they remember Nanking, they remember being partially colonized by 8 different nations while their weak-handed government did nothing. 100 years of humiliation.Their national anthem literally says they will pave the way to tomorrow with their own blood and their own flesh.It’s a face-punching competition, the Chinese know what it means to lose one - and Americans don’t even know that’s what the competition is about. The ones that do are alreadyThe US cannot win - by financial definition and won’t be allowed to punch its own face too hard before the populace revolts.","15,145 followers",Baba Vickram Aditya Bedi,543,1.8K,45.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Have-any-scientists-been-successful-in-simulating-a-universe-with-intelligent-life

His people will take a little pain, but unlike the US, China has huge cash reserves which they can unleash in order to keep the economy humming. Moreover Xi can be sure his people will support a patriotic effort to resist The Big Bully who is trying to block China from taking its rightful place as a world leader.Moreover what Trump is doing is in violation of WTO rules (which is why he wants to abandon the WTO). China will bring a case against the US, and win. Trump will ignore the decision, but it will nonetheless confirm the fact that he is in the wrong.And speaking of the world, Trump should have targeted specific Chinese industries, and lined up allies to join him. Instead he slapped tariffs on those allies (steel, maybe cars and dairy), meaning that when it comes time to choose sides, they will choose China.Not on everything, but on this.Xi is much, much smarter and much, much shrewder than Trump. Whereas Trump goes for big numbers, Xi goes for products made in places where Trump’s support is the strongest. His handling of the soybean war was masterful. Trump had to shell out $12 billion in subsidies in order to buy votes. What happens when other affected industries demand the same bribe? What happens next year? It will soon become apparent that Trump has destroyed customer relationships built up over years of effort, all because he doesn’t understand that trade deficits DON’T mean we’re losing money.A moderately intelligent president would have played his hand completely differently.

So, Beijing was not ready for the U-turn style of policy shift from Washington.(Picture from Internet)To say yes, it means, for China, it has to get ready and actually, domestic public opinion is generally showing a support for counter strikes. Though from state leaders to top government officials to the general public, we all know we will suffer big losses in the trade war, but we are also confident the loss won’t cripple the nation.Since the people are united in thoughts and actions, then we can say “yes, China is ready for the trade war with the US.”There have been numerous analysis on almost every aspect of the US-China trade war, by experts, media outlets, or netizens across the globe. There have also been lots of discussions here on Quora.Most of the analysis and discussions are from statistical, or economical, or technical, or strategical perspectives. Yet, we should not neglect another important element: People.Actually, since the trade war between USA and China is inevitable, personally, I hope it would last a bit longer, since generally Chinese are far better united and have much stronger endurance than Americans, and we Chinese have a spirit of “eating bitterness.”The longer the trade war lasts, the more pain both sides will feel, and more hurts both people will get, no matter we like it or not. For most Chinese, we would still support our government as long as it is protecting the nation’s interest, even if we got to suffer somehow. But how about the US side -- the already divided people -- will they give their full support to the Trump administration, if they have to suffer big losses and endure longtime hardships? They might turn their back and cast for some else in the mid-term, or next general election.So, to certain extent, in the trade war, Chinese government needs only to focus on dealing with the trade war itself -- how to avoid losses as possible while fighting back, but Washington needs to wage the trade war one hand, which is seen even by many Americans as crazy, and at the same time, need to pacify or even coax the voters.I want to cite Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying's remarks at the Regular Press Conference on July 11, 2018:Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying's Regular Press Conference on July 11, 2018“Regarding the trade issues between China and the US, our position is quite clear. Though a trade war is the last thing we want, we are in no way afraid of fighting one. The Chinese side will take resolute and forceful measures in a timely manner to safeguard its own legitimate and legal rights and interests and uphold the multilateral trading system and rules.”",347 followers,Anthony Pun,671,646,1.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-does-your-desk-look-as-a-programmer

It was designed by Shoji Kawamori, a qualified aerospace engineer and a modern doyenne of mecha anime. Is the VF-1 a jet fighter ? But of course !In form it is a smaller, single seat F-14 Tomcat, featuring thrust vectoring instead of rear flight surfaces - very avant-garde in 1982 !Delightfully, it too is a carrier-launched fighter, and the ‘hero’ fighter as flown by two of the main characters also features the famous skull-and-crossbones imagery of the US Navy fighter squadrons that have used this - VF-17, VF-61, VF-84 (who flew the F-14 at the time) and lately VFA-103 - The Jolly Rogers. In Macross they are known as ‘Skull Squadron’, a very suitable alternative label.Its also a fighting robot suit (and thus a Variable Fighter) and the reasons for this become apparent during the series - it is a military one….of course, this is not required for a space-borne jet fighter, but for a theoretical exercise, its a really well fleshed out one….Despite having gas turbine engines, they operate in space rather well. As Major Roy Fokker states to Hikaru Ichijo ‘With thermonuclear engines we can fly anywhere !’There is one fundamental permitting the Valkyrie in space, as an example of the concept : It literally has a thermonuclear fusion drive of very high specific output. In terms of propellant, such an engine can use anything as reaction mass - sea water, beer, Chanel No. 5, jet fuel, hydrogen - basically whatever is at hand. In Macross, the ship apparently snares some chunks of the rings of Saturn to use as its own reaction mass….This is the obstacle to making such a thing possible - we have literally no clue whatsoever on how to miniaturise this type of technology sufficiently to permit this kind of flight envelope.The Valkyrie itself is a fairly lyrical fantasy of fighter, in terms of its capacities - many of which we would need to solve - and cannot, as yet !* Made of a material called ‘hyper carbon’ provided by what turns out to be space alien technology gleaned from the ASS-1 (aka the Macross itself), its aircraft-thin skins apparently have the strength of main battle tank front armour !This is vital to the overall performance envelope of the craft, for combat - and transformation !They are also tapped for the computer controlled vernier thrusters in space which give the VF-1 the ability to be super manuverable in space combat - the beast can literally fly in the manner of an atmospheric fighter in space by these means.Where Star Wars fighters appear to do so ‘by magic’ which is not really acceptable to an enthusiast, the VF-1 at least has a solid reasoning behind its performance envelope.However, thanks to the American Space Shuttle program, a lot of the problems of ‘an aircraft in space’ have actually been solved !1. Aircraft tyres suitable for use in space have been developed and proved - this would be a significant consideration if it had not been solved.",0 followers,Tyler Monson,1K,488,5.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-nearly-all-supercomputers-run-Linux

Here lies a serious issue: If you delay getting out of the seat too long, you and the seat slow down from wind resistance and both start descending in the same arc. This is a very bad thing because the seat usually slows faster and therefore will likely be above you. When the chute pops open the seat will come crashing down and either hit the pilot or foul the chute … or both. A bad ending will likely occur! This is why it is very important to get out of the seat - ASAP!The seat belt and harness are fastened to the seat and securing you to the seat and vice versa. Both you, the seat and the harness are ejected “as a package.” Because the pilot might be stunned or disorientated immediately after ejecting, the harness is automatically released by a small explosive charge about two seconds after ejecting. At this point, you are still moving forward at a good rate of speed. As soon as the harness is free, air drag will separate you from the seat. You and the seat then begin to fall in DIFFERENT trajectories. This is good!Back to my Instructor: One of the first thing he taught me, if I ever had to eject, as quickly as possible after ejecting, grab for the seat belt buckle and unbuckle it. If the proper ejection sequence occurred, the seat belt will not be there. If the seat belt is there, unbuckle it and kick the seat free.In my ejection, the seat belt WAS there. I did what my instructor told me: I unbuckled the belt and kicked the seat free. Only a few seconds later my chute opened, with no problem.Added: Every three years, we were scheduled to take a Physiological Refresher Course. This included Altitude Chamber training, along with ejection and survival training. In one class, the Instructor was describing the ejection sequence. He made the statement that in every case of ejection at 500 ft., or below, when the seat belt failed to automatically release, the fatality rate was 100%.I raised my hand and said, “Excuse me, Sir …”","35,161 followers",C Stuart Hardwick,6.2K,12.3K,143M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Have-any-scientists-been-successful-in-simulating-a-universe-with-intelligent-life

They also lacked targeting pods and precision guided munitions capable of achieving parity in terms of reliability compared to their western counterparts.An Su-27 Flanker:An F-16 Fighting Falcon :F-16 shooting down a moving drone with its Sidewinder missile:Edit: 1 k upvotes!

Including data of actual engagements, whenever these warplanes have seen use, which they often have, via 3rd party country stand offs.
