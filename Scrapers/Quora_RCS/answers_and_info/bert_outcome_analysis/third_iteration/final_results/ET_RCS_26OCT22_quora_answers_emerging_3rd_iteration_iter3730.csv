0,"Probably. IBM and Intel have both done a lot of work with the US government in the past, a lot of it classified. However, I suspect that the differences are less a question of speed and architecture (well, the NSA probably loves overclocked chips and has likely put more effort into quantum computing than literally anyone else on the planet), and more with concerns in mind like extreme reliability and radiation hardening.

4,"According to the World Health Organization, the #1 cause of death is coronary artery disease at 12.6%. The next one down is cerebrovascular disease, i.e. strokes, at 9.7%. This is effectively another disease of the circulatory system, so over 20% of all human deaths are attributable to this one cause.From this I conclude that the single technological breakthrough that would provide the biggest benefit to humanity is a treatment that safely dissolves and removes arterial plaque.

7,"When I was a kid, I had this terrifying nightmare of being buried alive in a glass coffin. I could see people walking above me and I screamed out for help but people did not hear me.

InWhen I was a kid, I had this terrifying nightmare of being buried alive in a glass coffin. I could see people walking above me and I screamed out for help but people did not hear me.

I was astounded when I recently learned that there are people who are trapped in exactly this state, figuratively speaking: a super locked-in state where the person isPatients who are unable to express consciousness present a major challenge to neuroscience. In intensive care units all over the world, half of the deaths result from a clinical decision to withdraw life support.There are several levels of neurological disorders of consciousness whose symptoms aren’t always clear cut and easy to diagnose accurately. Coma occurs within minutes to hours following severe damage to the brain such as a stroke, physical injury, anoxia (loss of oxygen supply) and poisoning. It is defined clinically as a prolonged loss of the capacity to be roused. The patient can’t be awakened and show no signs of awareness. The body continues to exhibit some unconscious reactions, reflexes such as pupil contraction in response to bright light are intact. The brain’s unconscious component deep in the brain stem is still functional.Brain death is a different, irreversible state characterized by a total absence of brain stem reflexes, breathing and a flat EEG signal. Cortical metabolism and the perfusion of blood to the brain disappear, leading to rapid degeneration and death of neurons.The majority of comatose patients recover within days or weeks. The first sign is the return of the sleep-wake cycle. They then regain consciousness, communication and intentional behaviour.However, sometimes recovery stops in a strange state ofIf they display intermittent limited responses that suggest comprehension and volition, they are in the “minimally conscious state” (MCS). Some form of communication can be established.The last state is the ‘locked-in syndrome’, often caused by the disconnection between the cortex and the spinal cord, which leaves consciousness intact. The patient finds himself imprisoned in a paralysed body, unable to move or talk. Only small eye movements and blinks, controlled by separate neuronal pathways, are spared and allow them to communicate with the world. These patients can still lead a productive, fulfilling life with their conscious capacity.In 2006, the British neuroscientist Adrian Owen made a stunning discovery in a patient who showed all the clinical signs of a vegetative state but whose brain activity suggested a considerable degree of consciousness. His work (The patient was a young woman who had had a car crash and suffered from damage to the frontal lobes. Five months later, despite a preserved sleep-wake cycle, she remained fully unresponsive, the hallmark of the vegetative state. No signs of residual awareness, communication or voluntary control was detected.But when they scanned her brain in an fMRI machine as part of a research protocol for monitoring the state of the cortex in vegetative patients, they found something astonishing.Owen ran an ingenious test in which spoken sentences were played to convey complex instructions such as “imagine playing tennis”, “imagine visiting the rooms in your home” and “just relax” at precise times. In healthy people, when you imagine such activities, the brain lights up as if youHer brain activity closely tracked the spoken instructions.Some critics objected that maybe merely the words “tennis” and “navigate” were enough to trigger her brain activity without her actually understanding the instructions and being conscious. But an elegant control experiment put this criticism to rest. When Owen scanned normal volunteers while they listened to the words “tennis” and “navigation” without any instruction, the activations evoked by the two words were similar. This finding implied that when activating her brain areas in a task-relevant manner, Owen’s patient did much more than reacting unconsciously to them, she seemed to be thinking about the task.In another experiment described in this Guardian articleThanks to fMRI technologies, researchers have made extraordinary breakthroughs in understanding the mental life of people trapped in the locked-in state. From thousands of fMRI scans since that first study,Owen received nearly twenty million dollars of funding to develop new techniques including less expensive methods such as EEG to help hundreds of thousands of patients in vegetative states worldwide. So far he avoids the most controversial question to ask these patients “do you still want to live?”, perhaps because the legal framework for such a difficult situation is unclear.The ethical conundrum resulting from Owen’s findings is that the outcome can influence a family’s or clinician’s decision to end a life. If a patient demonstrates some form of consciousness, s/he moves from the ‘possibly allowed to die’ category to the ‘not generally allowed to die’ category. It is illegal to withdraw treatment to such patients even if they make it clear that is what they wanted. Families might spend years living in false hope of recovery and burdened by the prospect of keeping them alive.These new technologies are significantly and directly impacting the assessment and clinical treatment of critically brain-injured patients and the prediction of recovery. They also bring fascinating insights into the nature of consciousness from the patients trapped in the gray zone between life and death.The Life Scientific - Adrian Owen on scanning for awareness in the injured brain - BBC SoundsBBC One - Panorama, The Mind Reader: Unlocking My VoiceThe Search for ConsciousnessConfronting the grey zone after severe brain injuryNeuroscience: The mind reader","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-most-recent-technological-breakthrough-and-advancement-in-the-world-today
