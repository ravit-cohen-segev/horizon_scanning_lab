And we could definitely do better than the traditional quilted gambison for shock absorption. Foam padding and various high tech fabrics could lighten it and make it more breathable. You could add cooling systems too. I think if with a fully articulated suit you could actually restrict the movement of limbs to make it harder for them to be bent the wrong way and injured. One of the bigger advances would be strong transparent material for that could cover the face rather than relying on slits and bars to protect the eyes.Swords and other weapons might not benefit as much. You could make it lighter and stronger but I can't see any huge improvements over wootz steel which was basically nano engineered material centuries before the term was invented.

1,"Let's assume that there were some sort of religious prohibition against projectile weapons.  This would include not only guns but artillery or IED's.  The religion could be a war in which people considered guns the same way that modern armies consider IED's (i.e. fighting dirty).I'd imagine that swords would evolve into cavalry weapons only instead of horses you'd have motorcycles or four wheel ATM's.

It would serve a different purpose than current ballistic resistant armor as it would have to protect its wearer from edged and pointed objects that would be propelled at far lower velocities such as spears and arrows.

3,"They fared so well that people eventually had to develop special weapons and tactics just to deal with armor.When fighting a man in armor, be it plate or mail, one of your options is to half-sword, or use your sword as a short spear. The goal here would be to get through any gaps in his plate, and if you encounter mail, force your tip through it.Various polearms were also devised that made it easier to kill a man in armor.But if you were to just bash away at a mail clad man with a sword, he would laugh and stab you in the face.If you were to bash away with an axe, he’d be a bit more annoyed, aThey fared so well that people eventually had to develop special weapons and tactics just to deal with armor.When fighting a man in armor, be it plate or mail, one of your options is to half-sword, or use your sword as a short spear.

You trade a bit of weakness against percussive action for flexibility, but the loss is not that great. You are certainly not going to see people cutting through mail with an axe or sword.Maybe, maybe, force the tip through a bit, but hewing will just dull your edge.Bottom line, people wore armor because itOriginal question-",1 follower,Eric Lowe,3.2K,4.1K,37.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-swords-and-plate-mail-were-still-the-norm-how-would-they-have-evolved-with-modern-technology

These behaviors are implemented via biochemical pathways, since only multi-cellular organisms have a nervous system.Worms have a very primitive brain.Figure: Worm nervous systemInsects have nervous systems but also only barely have a brain. What they have instead are numerous bulges throughout their nervous system called ""ganglia"" that are information processing hubs serving the basic survival needs of the animal. Insects have a complex network of ganglia in their head, since this is where most of the sensory organs are located (eyes, antennae for smell, feelers, mouth), and this ganglia complex is something of a proto-brain.Figure: Insect nervous systemFish have very basic brains in their head. Brains get steadily larger and more complex as evolution proceeds through reptiles, birds, and mammals.The brains of birds have been studied extensively because the song-learning process is believed to parallel language learning in humans. The general architecture of the ""avian brain"" (neuroscientists avoid the somewhat insulting term ""bird brain"") is almost unrecognizable compared to a human brain, and yet the evolution of various components into those of the human brain has been traced and ""homologous mappings"" have been worked out.Figure: Brain of song bird (avian brain).Figure: Human BrainThe brain of each species is optimized for the unique needs of that species. Mice have a special brain area for spatial mapping using their whiskers (the ""barrel cortex""); bats have a specialized brain area for echolocation (vision using sound echoes); and birds have several specialized regions for song-learning. In humans, up to 2/3 of the brain is involved in vision in some way, whereas certain rodents that live permanently underground have practically no visual brain region at all. Dogs have an unusually large olfactory brain area to help with their keen sense of smell, while cats which need to hunt have the most advanced visual brain network second only to primates.Unfortunately, scientists don'tRelated:",17 followers,Kruti Naik,1K,361,5.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-is-cryptocurrency-and-blockchain-technology-going-to-evolve-the-world-s-economy
