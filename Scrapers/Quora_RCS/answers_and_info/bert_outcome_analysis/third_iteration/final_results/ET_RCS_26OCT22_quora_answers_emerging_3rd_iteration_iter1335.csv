Introduction of automobiles were an ‘innovative’ technology no doubt, but not a ‘disruptive’ one since, in those early days, automobiles remained as an interesting luxury ‘toy’ in the hands of a few, horse drawn carriages were still the norm. But introduction of mass-produced automobile like the ‘Model T’ from Ford virtually replaced horse drawn carriages and is considered ‘disruptive’.Social perspective“The plan is like this, we first take the night train to Madurai, reaching there in the morning”.“Ummm….”“Then we take a car and straight go to Kodaikanal, we reach by noon”“Ummm….”“You know where I have booked up this time?

A part of the stomachs was removed with cutting off the vagus nerve (which triggers off the gastric acid secretion) a technique called ‘gastrectomy’ and’ vagotomy’. Faster the surgeon more was his status. By 1980 Prof James black discovered a novel kind of drug that blocked the receptors in the stomach that resulted in profound reduction of acid secretion. It was a new concept, acting like a wrong key in the lock. The receptor, like the lock got essentially jammed by the drug, making the real key useless and the lock failed to work.

With this revolutionary technology, humans have successfully colonized the entire Solar System, allowing them to travel from Earth to Mars, to back again with relative ease. What once would have taken years to travel to, can now be achieved in a matter of seconds.Sounds easy-peasy right?Well there is a catch, of course!YouIf you are conscious while Jaunting, you will go insane, your consciousness doomed to an eternity of oblivion.Imagine being left to only your thoughts, in an endless field of white, for what would feel like billions of years, your sanity slowly disintegrating and mind starting to auto-cannibalize itself.“How long in there, in terms of years? 0.000000000067 seconds for the body to Jaunt, but how long for the unparticulated consciousness? A hundred years? A thousand? A million? A billion? How long alone with your thoughts in an endless field of white? And then, when a billion eternities have passed, the crashing return of light and form and body. Who wouldn't go insane?”For this reason, every person who goes under the Jaunt must be asleep and unconscious. The solution to this is to put everyone under general anesthesia before take-off.But what happens to the poor unfortunate souls who don’t go to sleep? Here is what happened to little Ricky, who held his breath while the attendants administered the anesthesia.The thing that had been his son bounced and writhed on its Jaunt couch, a twelve-year old boy with a snow-white fall of hair and eyes which were incredibly ancient, the corneas gone a sickly yellow. Here was a creature older than time masquerading as a boy; and yet it bounced and writhed with a kind of horrid, obscene glee, and at its choked, lunatic cackles the Jaunt attendants drew back in terror. Some of them fled, although they had been trained to cope with just such an unthinkable eventuality. The old-young legs twitched and quivered. Claw hands beat and twisted and danced on the air; abruptly they descended and the thing that had been his son began to claw at its face. ""Longer than you think, Dad!"" it cackled. ""Longer than you think! Held my breath when they gave me the gas! Wanted to see! I saw! I saw! Longer than you think!"" Cackling and screeching, the thing on the Jaunt couch suddenly clawed its own eyes out. Blood gouted. The recovery room was an aviary of screaming voices now. ""Longer than you think, Dad! I saw! I saw! Long Jaunt! Longer than you think-""It said other things before the Jaunt attendants were finally able to bear it away, rolling its couch swiftly away as it screamed and clawed at the eyes that had seen the unseeable forever and ever; it said other things, and then it began to scream, but Mark Oates didn't hear it because by then he was screaming himself.So remember kids, always go to sleep, so you don’t turn into a creep.In all seriousness, this is probably one of the creepiest technologies available because it combines my 2 biggest fears:It just seems so tempting too. It’s like the elephant game. Tell someone not to think of an elephant. Then they probably automatically think of elephants! Same theory goes with Jaunting, I am sure after being told not to be awake during Jaunting only helped to increase Ricky’s curiosity. And I can relate to that.Also, the Jaunt technology opens up all sorts of sinister possibilities. The Jaunt is purported to have been used by tinpot dictators to get rid of political dissidents, and imagine if someone with connections kicked you awake into a Jaunt portal, while closing up the other exit, leaving you screaming in limbo for eternity….Anyways, I got a flight to catch, see you on the other side of Io, loser.The Jaunt - Stephen King (large text for mobile).pdf",1 follower,James Marshall,2.2K,664,5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-s-the-next-or-newest-big-breakthrough-in-technology-that-once-seemed-impossible-or-the-stuff-of-science-fiction

New quickly grown biological body, augmented with latest hardware, then your is mind restored in it from your last backup.Lacking self-discipline? Modify your own personality or a complete temporary rewrite. Like, say, every at 7 o’clock, poof I “seem” to fall unconscious for a second and instantly “wake back” around 9 o‘clock, while in fact my brain got overtook by an app that goes outside, does 1 hour of strenuous exercise in the local gym (that I never want to do normally), takes a shower, and returns control of my own brain to me. Don’t want to do you taxes? Same thing: poof you just feel like you lost a couple waking hours while your mind got “took over” by a taxes-filling-app personality that has incredible work focus and access to your memories, perfectly filling those taxes in no time. And so on.Ultimately that gets to a point were relationships become quite fuzzy as you never know of you’re talking to your “real” significant other, or to an “temporary overlaid” personality tweak. some people will start having TONS of different personalities and almost never use the “base” one.Need better teamwork? Temporarily merge with say the 3 other coworkers in your work team, to create some kind of gestalt mind that is you-yet-not-you, and is more intelligent, and is able to “see” and “think” and “do” through all of your 4 willing bodies and minds.The concept of individuality starts to erode away, as you can theoretically exist in identical copies in more than one place at a time, and then ‘merge back” the copies memories later, and there is zero difference between a person and its copies. Bodies start being seen as mere support for what the individual is, just like some paper is merely the support for a unique poem.Later on it gets even more insane.Personalities not modified by tons of personality modification programs, are seen as both inflexible (like a stone can’t avoid anything thrown at it), and signs of a “mentally disabled” person.Gestalt-minds become the norm in society. Multi-multitasking is seen as routine and “you” constantly control multiple bodies all at the same time and that is casual. Most of those bodies aren’t even biological or even look remotely human. Those that can’t do it are seen like we seem illiterate people today.You can store your entire life as data, and you can relatively quickly live the lives of others, or think or see things from their perspective.Personality changing is extremely routine, as needs arises, and occurs almost every minute of your life. You stop being who you are, but start being what you have instead. Literally, since most of the objects you own can think and are extensions of yourself.Clones become popular and the line between individual and corporation ceases to be.Aliens living among us, but we are the ones who created them!Eventually, the inevitable conclusion:All of humanity fully joined and connected together in one big huge mind. Biological human bodies make up only an incredibly tiny fraction of that “godly” entity. Humanity looks upon us as we are now, much like current-we look at monkeys. The merge is complete and the line between what is an artificial intelligence and what is a human mind is fully gone.Not humanity’s extinction, per see. More like an evolution into something else.Hopefully it will take a millennia for this process to complete.As for the big “why don’t we see any alien civilizations?”, the answer is simple;The higher our tech, the more it becomes a question of doing more with less. Energy and computing speed become at a premium. This means living closer and closer gives real benefits: better bandwidth, etc. Fewer and fewer people want to live in the boondocks of “meatspace” where things are so slow and boring. Just like humanity went from an agrarian society to living in cities, at some point humanity abandons it’s numerous outerspace colonies (except by automated drones) and “concentrates” back in a very compact area (maybe Earth maybe some big processing cube in space). Smaller is better!So, we don’t see aliens because while their civilization is HUGE in terms of number of minds, they are TINY in terms of their actual “footprint”. Light speed can’t be beaten so the only way to process (aka: to “think”) faster is to reduce the distance between stuff!","135,529 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-s-the-next-or-newest-big-breakthrough-in-technology-that-once-seemed-impossible-or-the-stuff-of-science-fiction
