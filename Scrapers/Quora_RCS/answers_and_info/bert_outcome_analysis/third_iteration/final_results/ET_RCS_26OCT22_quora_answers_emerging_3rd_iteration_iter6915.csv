In China officials are 80% more likely to be corrupt. For any crime you are 11x more likely to be sentenced to execution over the USA. If I am married to you and rape you, no crime is committed in China.6: You have disposable income.7: The government of China has a person credit system. Where if you insult someone or are basically an as*hole of a person but never commit any crimes, then you might be denied bank loans, plane tickets, hotel rooms, or possibly being denied the ability to leave the nation. In the USA you can talk however you like.8: In the US I can have more than 2 kids while in China I could be forced to put my 3rd child up for adoption.9: You have a lot more personal freedoms such as the ability to free speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, ability to vote high up people, and the ability to change governments while in China, if you attempt to change the governments main party, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), they will use the military to defend themselves. Technically the People’s Republic of China doesn’t have a military, the People’s Liberation Army is just the armed wing of the CCP.10: Because it’s the United States of America, and America isn’t perfect but we are better than most. The United States is based on an experiment. No country at the time had the same rights as America, and the US is the only nation since its inception in 1776 to not undergo a significant government change or constitution change. Shouldn’t that say something? The fact that it’s been 242 years and we haven’t had a change to government. Our constitution states “in order to form a more perfect union.” The US, as said before, is not perfect, but no country is. America strives to be a better nation. America isn’t a people; it’s an idea. The idea that everyone is created equal, and that we all deserve life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It should say something about what America truly is. We strive to be timeless, and better in every way...","23,886 followers",Robin Daverman,2.9K,2.3K,40.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-China-anticipated-to-pass-the-United-States-in-artificial-intelligence-If-so-when

So she’s been going around cooking up iPhones, trains, pots and pans, and bridges for other people, and, well, making a tidy sum out of it, and feeding her own family with cents on the dollar (‘cause she makes the stuff herself, so no restaurant mark-up).So what happened next, was that Mr. Obama calling China “a free rider for thirty years”, because she doesn’t do anything for “global security”. But I think Mr. Obama failed to appreciate the fact that a cook can not look like a bouncer and going around cracking other people’s heads - who in the world will order dinner from a cook that looks like a bouncer? Basically if you want to be the cook for the world, you have to be (or at least appear to be) AMIABLE to everybody! China is friendly with both the US and Russia, both Iran and Saudi, both Israel and Palestine, all four different governments in Yemen, etc.But if you are a bouncer, well, you’ve got to take sides (“Good vs. Evil”), show your muscle, and beat up somebody occasionally. And you need enemies, otherwise, how do you get customers coming to you looking for protection? Right? But if you are going to fight for the Saudis, the Iranians are probably not going to be buying iPhones and automobiles from you.

4,"AI is a broad topic. Many scientists do not like the term because they saw lay people and marketing opportunists use the term extremely loose to frame describe their ware. Often, term is invoked to simply describe a set of algorithms. Also, on both sides the advanced work at labs are close guarded secrets and informations that are available are quite a few years old, and in computer science that is equivalent to decades. So, we can only observe implementations to answer who is more advanced and in what aspect. Perhaps, that is the best way, because what good or differences will it make if someAI is a broad topic.

The US is still mired in issues of privacy and trust between the people and government. There are countless examples of oppositions to “smart city” proposals in the US even though there were no elements of tracking of the individual. A more immediate example is some people’s objection to electronic tolls, because potentially the transponder can give the government the ability to track movement. So, these objectors rather sit in traffic to pay with cash or avoid tolled bridges and roads altogether.","284,853 followers",James Altucher,992,878,91.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-China-anticipated-to-pass-the-United-States-in-artificial-intelligence-If-so-when

It maintained consistency with a high rate of writes over many geographically distributed datacenters, and had extremely little downtime.The real accomplishments don't actually have as much to do with memcache or mysql as you might think - over time these will probably be replaced with newer ""technologies"", but the real technology is all the things you have to do to get this massive number of machines to work together in a way that's fast and reliable. This is not what people usually mean when they ask ""what technology do you use?"" but it's where the interesting innovation happens. This ranges from algorithmic things like schemes for sharding, partitioning, and caching data, and keeping distributed data consistent, to mundane sounding things like deployment and monitoring, which are not mundane at all at this scale.Here are a few of the specific challenges we overcame:Consistency across datacentersNetwork flowThe network problems get even worse when there are failures. The way most software deals with not getting a reply from another server is to send another packet. Unfortunately a common reason for not getting a reply is that the other server is overloaded. So when a server gets too overloaded to reply in time, all of the sudden the traffic to it doubles because of the retries. We spent a lot of time on algorithms that would seamlessly deal with small failures where retries work, but not spiral out of control during large failures, when retries just make things worse.Cache LayoutHandling FailuresDeployment and Monitoring -Improving Memcache and MySqlIn MySql it's all about getting the data laid out on disk in a reasonable way, and getting it to cache the most useful stuff in memory.

The US political powerThe US election is the most concerned political event in the world. Any American president who takes office will influence the direction of the world.For example, Trump, an “incredible“man who could not be found for hundreds of years, became the president of the United States. If he is in other fields, it may not have any influence. But he is now the president of the United States.But it is not that he is terrible, but that the global leadership of the United States is terrible!If he is the leader of a very underdeveloped country, I don't think most newspapers will even report it.B. The strength of the US economyThe strength of the US economy can be seen all over the world. The United States has not only influence but control over the global economy!C. The US science and technologyThe US stands at the forefront of science and technology in the world. Most of the high technology in the world is in the hands of Americans or American laboratories. For example, today's China is developing its aerospace industry, which is an achievement that attracts worldwide attention. However, we all know that compared with the United States, we are inferior to the United States and the former Soviet Union at the beginning of the Cold War.But I think Leonard's genius is that a nerd can have a girlfriend like Penny.D. The US militaryThe US military ranks first in the world, and I believe no one will refute me.The largest conventional aircraft carrier in the world is the Kitty Hawk of the US Navy. This aircraft carrier has participated in many foreign operations of the US military.The United States Marine Corps, the firm executor of the national will of the United States, can basically defeat other countries with only one US Marine Corps.I don't think any country in the world would be stupid enough to challenge the United States militarily.5 steps to reshape the US military: Glean, Engage, Focus, Incentivize, and Share.The Kitty Hawk of the US NavyE. The US cultureAmerican culture is an important manifestation of American soft power. Almost everyone on earth knows Hollywood, and even some people may not know where the capital of the United States is, but they must have heard of Titanic and Rambo, an American hero who can beat hundreds of people by himself. Most written works in the world are written and recorded in English. American music is basically the trend. The American brand is basically the guarantee of quality. It can be said that where there are people, there will be American cultural influence, except for newborns in hospitals.TitanicRamboII. What are the advantages of China?China's greatest advantage is the people.From the military point of view, the PLA under the leadership of the Communist Party of China has no advantage in weapons and equipment. But the People's Liberation Army has accomplished every military operation task brilliantly. Because Chairman Mao said: ""The decisive factor in war is people, not weapons and equipment."" Is it true that China respects the US military because the US military has the most powerful weapons and equipment? No, it is because the extraordinary courage displayed by the US military on the battlefield deserves China's respect.Let me show you a couple of the examples that the power of people:A. What has the Communist Party of China done in the history of being regarded as a communist devil by the West?The first National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held secretly in this boat, Shanghai on July 23, 1921.

Today, China has 90 million Party members.Under the military attack of the Kuomintang, the army led by the Communist Party was forced to move. The journey is more than 20,000 miles, also known as the 25,000-mile Long March. During the journey, it has traveled 25,000 miles through 11 provinces, 18 mountains, 24 rivers, deserted grassland, and rolling snow-capped mountains.After the Long March, there were only 30,000 Communist troops.In 1932, he was commissioned by the CPC Central Committee to organize the Anti-Japanese Coalition Forces in Northeast China and served as the commander and political commissar of the Anti-Japanese Coalition Forces. He led the soldiers and civilians to fight bloody battles with the Japanese aggressors in the northeast. In the extremely cold environment, under the emergency of running out of ammunition, he finally fought alone with a large number of Japanese aggressors for a few days and nights and died heroically. When the Japanese army caught him, they cut open his stomach and found that there were only bark and cotton in his stomach. He kept fighting by eating these. At that time, the Japanese army stood up and saluted, because Yang Jingyu was a very respectable fighting hero of Communist Party members.The Liberation War was a war waged by the Chinese People's Liberation Army under the leadership of the Communist Party of China from June 1946 to September 1949 to overthrow the Kuomintang rule and liberate the whole of China. It is a decisive battle concerning China's future and destiny. On October 1, 1949, the People's Republic of China was proclaimed in Beijing on the way of PLA marching to the whole country. In 1951, the PLA completed the task of liberating the mainland and offshore islands and the Communist Party of China unified the Chinese mainland.The Communist Party of China has done a lot of things. She made China independent, and at the same time, she led the Chinese people to work hard to build the motherland.Many overseas Chinese are constantly discrediting the Communist Party. It doesn't matter. More than one billion Chinese people now support the Communist Party of China. Is this party good or bad? If the Communist Party is really an extremely evil party, how can it monitor and control 1.4 billion Chinese people?Is it because China is really sinful that it keeps smearing China? Or something else?B. What are the strange characteristics of the Chinese people?Chinese people's character comes from Chinese culture. It is not deep to get in touch with the Chinese without understanding the Chinese character.China's college entrance examination is the exam with the largest number of participants in the world. The history of examinations in China has exceeded 1400 years.Every year in the college entrance examination in June, all cars in China will not whistle, so it is necessary to create a quiet environment for the candidatesParents waiting anxiously outside the examination roomExamination in ancient China. In the highest examinations in ancient China, the invigilator was the emperor. At the same time, any candidate who tries to cheat will be decapitated immediately once he is found.2. Chinese people especially like farmingChina's geographical environment determines that the people here will make a living by farming. Until today, as long as Chinese people see a good piece of land, they will not plant flowers, but grow vegetables.The picture above shows Chinese people growing vegetables in the Antarctic scientific research stations, deserts, university campuses, and space.3. Chinese people love saving money and grainWhen Americans were suffering from pneumonia in COVID-19, many people took to the streets. In fact, it is not necessarily opposed to wearing masks, but Americans do not have the habit of saving money. If the United States does not resume its economic activities, the American people will be unable to live because they have no jobs. But at the request of the Communist Party of China, 1.4 billion people stayed at home. Chinese people can stay at home for two months without going to the streets. It is because Chinese people have the habit of saving money. A country that has been poor for hundreds of years will not spend all its money once it has earned it.4. An incomparable yearning for peaceA unified and centralized country, a country with peasants as its main people, needs a peaceful environment most. Because it is impossible to fight there, I still farm here. Chinese people have always hoped to have a peaceful environment for them to cultivate their land, save some money, and then let their children receive a good education.5. Chinese people's deep love for their families and countriesChina attaches great importance to education. Therefore, Chinese culture can be preserved from generation to generation after thousands of years. In education, loyalty and justice are emphasized. This is why Chinese people have a very strong concept of territory and nationality. Every generation of Chinese will tell their children that you are a Chinese, that you are a Chinese who eat with chopsticks, and that you are a Chinese who write Chinese characters.A very famous story in China, Yue Fei, a famous general in Chinese history, had his mother tattooed his back before joining the army. There are four Chinese characters on it,Every Chinese has been fed with chopsticks in this way, which is calledEvery Chinese child will be taught to use chopsticks by his parents.When eating in China, only the elders say they can eat, and the rest can eat. This is called a6. Once oppressed too much, peaceful farmers will become fearless fightersIn Chinese history, all those who rebelled were peasants. As long as farmers have food to eat, they will not rebel. Once they are starving, Chinese farmers will rise to revolt. Therefore, Chinese people are not afraid of power in their genes. Indeed, many emperors in Chinese history were rebellious peasants. The earliest peasant uprising in Chinese history was the uprising of Chen Sheng and Wu Guang in 209 BC. At that time, the west was still the Roman Republic.What I want to say is that these characteristics of Chinese people come from China's poverty and backwardness, and also from its own understanding. Chinese people may be bullied, but it is impossible to kill all Chinese people.The US is powerful, and the American people are a symbol of freedom and independence. China cannot compete with the United States in any form.III. In the endThe US is the most developed country in the world. The US is ahead of China in every respect. China has been actively learning from the United States. Americans are Chinese teachers.But China does have its advantage, that is, its people.The national anthem of China today was created at the most dangerous time in Chinese history. Her lyrics are like this:起来！不愿做奴隶的人们！把我们的血肉，筑成我们新的长城！中华民族到了最危险的时候，每个人被迫着发出最后的吼声。起来！起来！！起来！！！我们万众一心，冒着敌人的炮火，前进！冒着敌人的炮火，前进！前进！前进进！Get up!People who do not want to be slaves!Build our flesh and blood into our new Great Wall!When the Chinese nation is at its most dangerous time,Everyone was forced to make the final roar.Get up!Get up! !Get up! ! !We are United as one, braved the enemy's fire,Forward! Braving enemy fire,Forward!Forward!Go ahead, and forward!Well, this is what I share with you as a communist devil.

It may be not much of a problem from the perspective of an average people. However, when we are talking about 500 kV to 1000 kV electricity, there is nothing too small.2, Laser technology.China is in the leading position of this field. The US spent 7 years to break through the export ban of KBBF (some kind of crystal). By the time the US has made their own KBBF, China already had better ones.This is one of the result of KBBF, laser weapon on type 99 tank. Within 5 km, it has 100% chance to blind opponent. Not just their observation equipment, but human eyes too. (Edit, if you had to stay behind the optical observation devices long enough, then yes. But the weapon itself targets only at vehicles.)3, Limb replantation.There was a case in China, which a person’s hand got shredded into more than 20 pieces. Chinese doctor didn’t just re-assembled the hand from pieces, and even kept most of its function.4, 12306.It’s the name of the booking website of China Railways. In 2018, it had a peak of 150 BILLION visits per day.Considering that it must be maintained 6 hours per day, from 11 pm to 6 am, in average it must be able to deal with 2,314,815 times of visit per second. If we also include the people’s schedules which most of us would purchase tickets within certain time period, the visit pressure would be even higher.All American IT giants turned down the request of China Railways of establishing a ticket system.This is the railway map of China. The main difficulty of building a ticket system for it is actually not the visiting times per day or second. That can be solved by deploying more servers. The real problem is that with 1 ticket being sold, all related routes must correspond with it.In online shopping systems, 1 item is called a SKU. If one purchase an item from Ebay, then the system counts 1 SKU less. However, take the G71 from Beijing to Shenzhen as an example: There are 17 stations and 3 different seat classes, and 408 SKU. If someone purchased a ticket for the full length, then the system would remove 136 SKU from the pool. However, if a tickets between any middle stations is sold, the calculation would get complicated. And this must happens within a very short period of time, since there are over 2 millions visit per day, any of them could be a request to purchase a ticket along this route.Plus, this change must be corresponded among all core hubs, and all terminal machines, including the ticket window, auto selling machine, agents, website, and cellphone APP to make sure not too many over booking.Last but not least, in reality, the situation could only be a million times more complicated than I described. 12306 is now selling 3 billion tickets a year, and is the largest online ticket system. Behind it, there are many Chinese companies.

When there is no monopoly ecology in the market, and technology, innovation and application become the decisive factors, other companies have the possibility to break the ceiling. Today, emerging application areas such as artificial intelligence, 5G, and edge computing require various types of processors to be integrated and work together efficiently. In these application fields, on the one hand, there is a strong demand for new processor architectures; on the other hand, application scenarios such as the Internet of Things, unmanned driving, and machine vision have not yet emerged as monopolists. Everyone is equal in front of the opportunity. These major technological innovations have brought great opportunities to the domestic chip industry, and it is possible to successfully create a new ecology of domestic chips.As far as chip design is concerned, a completely autonomous ecosystem is expected to emerge in China.

The thing is we have to take a look at the innards of a country to really know whether or not you are truly developed. That Chinese are so obsessed with portraying the facade that they are technologically advanced and ahead is actually an indication that they have not fully developed yet. Because fully developed countries have no need to show off things like that. Everyone knows they are developed.For example, here is San Francisco:Look, not many skyscrapers right? And look at those old cable cars going around! That must mean they are undeveloped right? Nope. Everyone knows San Francisco is a developed city. That’s why it has no need to show off with luxury skyscrapers and such things.Or how about Florence, Italy?Again, no skyscrapers here. But everyone knows it’s a developed city and Italy is a developed country.My point is, you have got to look at the people and the innards of a country to truly know if they are developed.This is the true face of China:You have got to look at the average person. Does the average Chinese have good access to healthcare (which is ranked near the bottom in WHO rankings btw)? Can they drink tap water safely? Do they have access to quality food? Do all have access to electricity or paved roads or a quality education? The answer is: probably, yes, if you are living in the rich east coast provinces of Jiangsu or Zhejiang or Guangdong- but not if you are living in say - Xinjiang or Gansu or Tibet. China’s wealth is not spread equally, neither is it developed equally. Even though the CCP has developed China quite fast - there is still a lot of work to be done making sure *every Chinese* have equal access to everything.And then you got to look at the attitude of the people. When I was in China I found that you really got to look out for who you trust, because there is a lot of scams going on all the time. You never know what is real, what is fake, what is real price of anything. Why do these scams exist? Because people have to be desperate to make money that’s why.Why are people desperate to make money? Probably because they are not making enough to survive, which is an indication that the country is still developing. You’ll notice that in general, the more developed a country is, the less likely there will be scams. In Korea/Japan/Taiwan, you will not find very many scams. In China and Eastern Europe it’s likely.Another aside I want to note is that Chinese bathrooms don’t contain any toilet paper. Do you know the reason why? It’s because people steal it. Now, in what developed country does this happen? I can’t think of any. Only in a developing country would you need to bring your own toilet paper to the bathroom because there isn’t any there due to fear of people stealing it.I find GDP/capita to be generally a pretty good indicator of how developed a country is. The average GDP/capita (PPP) of China is still around $8k/person. While that is higher than most Asian countries - it’s still below the 4 East Asian tigers + Japan and far from the $62k/person that the USA has.The true measure of a developed society is to observe the people that live in the country and not the appearance of the country itself. Chinese “face” culture is the same. You can just obviously see that China has developed really really fast, and mentality wise people are still harping about luxury products and consumerism - this is where Americans were back in the 50s, 60s and 70s, not now.The biggest consumers of luxury products are Chinese people, not Americans or Europeans. The more developed you are, the less need you have to validate your self worth with materialism. The less desire you have to spend thousands of dollars on your children's schooling just to send them to be educated abroad. The less need to travel to countries like Canada or USA for giving birth so that your child becomes a US or Canadian citizen, or to launder your money by buying up real estate in other countries. Developed countries do not need to do things like that.Thats why you should always pay attention to the old adage -Edit:Of course, Chinese commenters love to bring up the USA. Yes, USA has lots of impoverished areas too; every country has developed areas and undeveloped areas, however my point is that for China there is significantly more undeveloped areas at a higher % compared to the USA. The poverty rate for China is 16% as of 2019 and for USA it is 1.5% as of 2019.

Rogers, was the author's first book and a powerful attack on racism and the ignorance that fuels it. Born Joel Augustus Rogers in Jamaica around 1880, Rogers emigrated to the United States in 1906 and eventually settled in Harlem, New York during the exciting artistic and cultural time of the Harlem Renaissance.In ""From Superman to Man"", a black Pullman porter and a white racist Southern politician on his way to California debate racial stereotypes and the arguments used to bolster claims of white superiority. Rogers based the novel on his own experiences working as a Pullman porter and his exhaustive research into biology, anthropology, and history.A novel far ahead of its time in its understanding of biology, race, and the history of oppression, Rogers makes many compelling arguments against white supremacy that he would continue to expound upon throughout his career. While written over a hundred years ago, ""From Superman to Man"" remains a compelling and thought-provoking book on the irrationality of racism and the important and forgotten contributions of black people to human history.How many times Africans ask questions about the least and most developed countries in Europe ?Actually, how many of Africans know that there are developing countries in Europe ?There are leastI still wonder why little is known or shown outside Europe about these countries.

He calculated two round trips to be 2 years to Jupiter and back and 3 years for Saturn. Interestingly they believed Jupiter being the more difficult mission trying to land on one of its moons, because the huge planet having a much greater gravity effect, whereby Saturn being smaller offering and easier task in landing on Enceladus. You are talking about the next 100 years, and we were planning these kinds of trips 60 years ago, with a technology capable of doing it.Project Orion never flewOne should realize, these Orion scientists were dead serious and had large manned crews on board their 4,000 ton spaceship. They just could not get NASA interested, NASA wanted to go to the Moon with their Saturn V rocket. Times change, today NASA is looking at a Nuclear Thermal Rocket (NRT) to get deeper into space.Better technology existed even further back in timeBefore 1958, in September 1957, we fourteen U.S. Air Force personnel experienced a radar target performing feats no conventional craft could ever done, events which resided outside of science then and still today and literally outside any common sense. These events happened on two consecutive nights at a USAF AC&W radar site on the Cambria, CA coastline.

Scientists highly suspect that there’s liquid water under its thick icy crust. And with such vast quantities of such a precious liquid held in such a precarious temperature, there might very well beNow that I’ve gotten you excited, lets pick our collective jaws up off of the floor and figure out the math for how to get there, and how long it might take.The way that the solar system is lined up in classroom pictures is a little bit misleading. Mind you, the planets in our system aren’t exactly all scrunched up close together: if they were, they’d certainly be quite a bit more visible in the night sky than how they presently appear.As it is, the distance between planets actually tends to grow in a fairly uniform and exponential manner. The closest distance between Saturn and Jupiter, for example, is more than twice the closest distance between Jupiter and Mars. And this principle holds fairly well between each of the distances between subsequent planets.(Just as a side note, I highly recommendSo. If we managed to get a ship large enough to launch a crew off in the general direction of Jupiter, and we’re assuming a transfer burn that’s as clean and efficient as possible, just how long would it take us? For this, we turn back to Kepler’s third law, which provides elapsed time for an orbital period:2This might be a lot to take in. Basically, Kepler’s third law tells us that 2Wow. That’s a long wait. By comparison, a one way trip to Mars would take just about 9 months. In fact, the energy required to make our transfer burn looks like a downright trivial problem compared to this long wait time.At a point like this, we have three possible solutions:If somehow, we managed to create a method of launching massive payloads into space at a cheap cost, (and SpaceX’sSince the closest distance between Earth and Jupiter is 628,971,977,000 meters, and the speed of light is 299,792,458 meters per second in a vacuum, this would mean that, hypothetically, the shortest possible trip between Earth and Europa would be 2098 seconds, or just about 35 minutes. This is comparable to the length of time that my family would spend in the car on our way to visit my grandparents on Sunday.However, lightspeed travel is wrought with all sorts of horrible side effects, including time dilation, space contraction, and the relativistic energy released upon slamming into motes of dust and stray hydrogen atoms that happen to stand in your way. If losing your loved ones to irreversible time travel, being pressed into a space narrower than I could describe with words, or being turned into the finest block of space-grade Swiss cheese isn’t your thing, you might want to overlook this one for now.Yes, this solution sounds insanely stupid when so much as uttered out loud. But short of physically dragging the entire mass of Jupiter (and all it’s interesting moons with it) to a closer orbit to Earth’s, there exists other methods of shortening the travel time.Everybody’s heard of the classic example of wormholes. Much like bending a sheet of paper so that opposite sides touch, we might very well find another method of bending space-time so that we can reach through to a different location in an instant: much faster than the speed of light could ever manage to keep up with.Another, slightly lesser known possibility is utilizing the warping of space time as a means of propulsion. TheAs it stands, there’s really no good reason to say that we cWhen you put it like that, perhaps one hundred years is giving us too much leeway.
