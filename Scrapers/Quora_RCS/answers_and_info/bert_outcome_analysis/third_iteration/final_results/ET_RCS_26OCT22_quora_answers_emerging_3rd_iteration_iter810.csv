1,"The biggest trend is here already, it will just expand exponentially. All your machines will communicate with each other, and back to their home offices, reporting everything from diagnostic status to usage profiles.This has nothing to do with “Big Brother” and a surveillance state, and everything to do with supply chain management and the profits to be made by squeezing out every middle step.In 30 years, there won’t be a thing called a “warehouse”, there will only be factory-direct-to-consumer “distribution centers”.The infrastructure for this is being built today, 30 years from now it will bThe biggest trend is here already, it will just expand exponentially.

What if that’s the case?Autonomous vehicles, machines, etc..You will agree with me that 300 years from now is more than enough to perfect Artificial Intelligence.Oh…are you hoping I will tell you about IoTThe World’s First Artificial Intelligence robot citizen “Sophia” may be a kind of ‘Adam’ for the robot generation.Also, with the advancement in technology, comes with a lot of negative effects as well. If I should guess what 300 years from now will be, I’m sorry, but all I can picture isArtificial Intelligence will be perfected by 300 years from now, with robots being able to detect that humans are killing their planet (Maybe). I should also mention that AI perfection will be the greatest technological achievement. That is where AI can not only think for itself, but also able to execute those thoughts. And they will also become autonomous to even write codes to create other robots.Humanity might become extinctI’ve watched movies about how robots turned on humans. But now I feel these movies are trying to pass a message.Watch the moviesIn conclusion, If you ask about technology in 5 to 30 years from now, I might mention some gadgets and stuff… but 300 years from now, this is what you get.","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,631,1.5K,2.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-technological-advances-do-you-hope-to-see-in-the-next-30-years

9,"Transfer learning in ML models.Humans are really good at generalizing. We only have to see a few dogs before we can recognize a dog when we see one.Machines are not. ML models require millions of examples before forming a reliable classifier, and that classifier is very specific to the data on which it was trained. If your training data doesn't include dogs with three legs, the model won't recognize them. A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one.

A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one. It's hypothesized that the reason humans learn so quickly is that we are fitting new examples into our existing knowledge rather than forming entirely new categories. If we could teach machines to do the same, they would learn exponentially faster and apply that learning more effectively.Transfer learning is a very hot topic in AI research right now, so I expect major breakthroughs in the next few years. I think this may be sufficient to achieve artificial general intelligence, but even if not, it will dramatically extend the range of tasks that machines can accomplish.","135,507 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-technological-advances-do-you-hope-to-see-in-the-next-30-years

Even if not, this is still a major step forward towards generating organs to order, without fear of rejection. Even if the heart is rejected and the donor dies, what we learn from the process will enable us to succeed the next time. I reckon this will become the mainstream way we get spare parts by the end of the decade in an optimistic scenario, by the end of the next decade in the pessimistic one.Either way, the moment is as groundbreaking as December 3rd, 1967, when the first human heart ever was transplanted, ushering the era of organ transplants of today. That patient died after 18 days, I hope this guy does better.","29,929 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,5.9K,7.7K,249.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-technological-advances-do-you-hope-to-see-in-the-next-30-years

13,"Will the human life span be increased by improved technology in the next 1-2 decades or not?The average can be increased by reducing risk, by finding ways folks can make acute problems chronic, by using new therapies to cure chronic ailments, and so forth. That’s certainly likely over the next few decades, at least in the developed world.Then there’s the question of actually arresting or slowing aging — antigeria. That’s doable, but it involves deeper knowledge of genetic mechanisms than we have today, and of course initial trials will involve a great deal of risk. I don’t expect that so soon.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-technological-advances-do-you-hope-to-see-in-the-next-30-years
