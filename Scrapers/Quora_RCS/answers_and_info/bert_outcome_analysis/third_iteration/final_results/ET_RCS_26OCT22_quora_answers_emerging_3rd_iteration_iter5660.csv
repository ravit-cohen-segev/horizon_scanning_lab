0,"YES. It’s already happening in Europe, but experience has shown it’s best not to shout about it. The concept of a universal basic income is a direct response to the long term unsustainability of a post-industrial West.With it comes the socialist idea of a stakeholding - we can produce enough, efficiently enough, for us all to have a share in the caputal, comfort and welfare this brings. If you work productively you still get a salary on top of that.This is different from communism, where everyone who can is expected to work the same amount and in theory everyone gets the same reward.As far asYES.

5,"In the recent past (last 20 years or so), genetic engineering has been the biggest technological innovation allowing crops all kinds of advantages such as increased drought resistance, higher yield, increased pest resistance, salt resistance and more effective options for use with various pesticides and herbicides.

The US has led in this area due to it’s technology and favrouable regulatory environment.In the last 5–10 years there has been an dramatic increase in the number of crops, especially delicate ones which are served raw such as lettuce, which are grown using hydroponics, often inside LED lit racks in buildings. Japan has particularly shown interest in this technology as demand for high quality raw ingredients is strong and the cost of traditional farm labor is high.However the technologies currently emerging relate to robotics in tandem with AI. These technologies allow the automatic tending of plants at the individual plant level (individual administration of water, fertilizer and pesticides and also the harvesting of fruits which could previously only be picked by hand. AI can also be used to select the ideal crop for environmental and market conditions. This should cut waste and unnecessary chemical use dramatically and reduce the need for back breaking labor considerably as well. This is one area where Japan has a significant stake due to it’s deficit of farm workers, and expertise in robotics.","17,169 followers",Pascal Morimacil,538,4.3K,34.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-emerging-unwritten-rules-of-technology-reporting-in-New-Media
