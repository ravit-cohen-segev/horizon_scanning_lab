The word 'revolutionary' appears in the question, and if anything is revolutionary, by the gods this is it. The invention on which I am about to write has just been revealed. However, it is a rather complicated piece of kit, and I would imagine that it must surely have taken longer than the months of this year already elapsed in order to have been brought the thing to fruition. In the circumstances therefore, perhaps we can overlook the '2018' stipulation in the query and cut to the chase.The device is Orion wireless technology and has been developed by surgeons from Baylor Medical College in Texas and the University of California. It is almost miraculous in that it can give totally blind people back their sight. So, folks who have gone blind through, infections, trauma, autoimmune diseases, nerve problems, glaucoma and so on, will be able to see again. It is at the time of writing, unclear, if individuals actually been born blind, will benefit from the invention. The reason for the foregoing being, that the brain - or rather the visual cortex - will never have learned how to process images in the first instance.The revolutionary aspect of the device is, that the patient's eyes have no role whatsoever to play in the seeing process. They are in fact completely bypassed. It works like this. Electrode chips are planted in the visual cortex at the back of the skull. The patient then dons a pair of glasses mounted with a tiny video camera, which in turn, relays images to the electrode chips, thereby enabling the subject to see again.To conclude, one of the neurosurgeons involved in implanting the Orion system is professor Daniel Yoshor of Baylor, and the company manufacturing the kit is a small American Firm called 'Second Sight'. It should be remembered that these are very early days in the experiments. Nevertheless, they provide the hope of a fantastic future, for tens, if not hundreds of millions of blind people throughout world.","6,473 followers",Michael Soareverix,28.3K,373,6.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-most-revolutionary-piece-of-technology-in-2018-so-far

The only bit that is “for real” is the magic eyeball section at the front (ie: not the blue part). This functions exactly like a real missile would, allowing the missile to talk to the aircraft’s weapon system and lock onto targets the same way a real weapon would. From the pilot’s point of view the engagement goes exactly the same: same HUD symbology, same growl. Except nothing jumps off the rail in a roar of smoke and fury when he presses the button.CATMs get carried a lot, as the Sidewinder is often used as a defensive missile so will get brought along for all sorts of training flights. Jet pilots are obsessed with training for a “bounce” and will build unexpected attacks into all sorts of flights.What you might also see at airshows are smoke generators that mount on the same rails as missiles, and are designed to be aerodynamically identical to them:This is basically just a missile-shaped tank full of oil or diesel and an electric element to burn it.

Well who doesn’t love a bit of smoke during a beat up?","3,713 followers",Andy Duffell,2.9K,6.2K,26.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-most-revolutionary-piece-of-technology-in-2018-so-far

I apologise in advance!You asked forYou mention fighters in your question, so I’m assuming you’re only talking about air-to-air missiles and we’ll gloss over all the others.But let’s introduce the main players in our story:Our CastWow, big topic. Hence; big post. I apologise in advance!You asked forYou mention fighters in your question, so I’m assuming you’re only talking about air-to-air missiles and we’ll gloss over all the others.But let’s introduce the main players in our story:Our Cast of Characters (in order of appearance)The MissileMissiles are actually built from individual subassemblies, a bit like a homicidal Lego kit.Generally these are:The ArmourersIf the pilot is Santa Claus delivering the toys on the big day, these guys are the elves working tirelessly in the toy factory year round.Here they are, doing what armourers do best:They assemble the missile and bring it to the flight line where we meet:The launcherSome aircraft types contain specialised mounting points for specific missiles, but most often a generic aircraft pylon (or “hard point”) is used. As long as it has the right wiring for the weapon the launcher can be loaded onto any pylon.The launcher’s job is to provide a rail to hang the missile from, plugs the missile into the aircraft’s systems, and often contains some life support gubbins for the missile, such as big bottles of compressed gas for cooling IR seeker heads. The missile has hangers on the top that mate into the rail along the bottom of the launcher.The AircraftWell, maybe not this one.Ok, this seems obvious, the missiles needs to get where the bad guys are. But the aircraft and the missile are also part of a tightly integrated system.The PilotOk, so things have gone pear-shaped and the pilot feels the need to send a missile in someone’s direction. After selecting Master Arm (which enables the aircraft’s weapons they’ll generally “uncage” a missile. This tells the missile to get itself ready to party. In the case of IR missiles it will begin cooling its sensor (remember it only has a limited amount of coolant) and there may be dome covers that will be punched off. Many missiles have a limited amount of time after being uncaged before they die on the rail, for example due to running out of coolant and going blind.Aircraft: “Hey, missile on #2. Look over that way, see that guy?”Missile: “What, over there? Ok, I see him.”Although some fancy new missiles can do things like:Aircraft: “Yo, #2. See that guy over there?”Missile: “No way dude, too far off-boresight for me”Aircraft: “Well, I can see him. Here’s the location, go get him”Missile: “Got it, let me go and I’ll do my best”This means pilots can do things like use a helmet-mounted sight to punch off dogfighting missiles at bad guys that aren’t even lined up in front. That’s a very cool unfair advantage to have in a fight.So the pilot presses the button.And a lot of stuff happens very quickly. Details vary, but the general outline is a bit like this:The rocket motor ignites and quickly generates a stupid amount of thrust. At this point the launcher is still holding tightly to the missile, but once the thrust builds up enough for the missile to fly properly it overrides the locks on the rail and we’re off. As the missile moves along the rail it shears off any umbilicals and that’s often the missile’s last chance to get any updated info from the NAS. Modern long-range missiles do tend to have data links for post-launch updates.Once it’s free from the launcher the missile is working hard, trying to gain as much speed as possible. It’ll also be initialising the rest of its systems, such as firing the gas grain generators that power the actuators for it’s control fins, thermal batteries, etc. Really depends on the missile. Once it’s burned hard for a short way and is confident it’s separated from the launch aircraft the missile may begin manoeuvring. This may be a pre-programmed manoeuvre, such as an enthusiastic climb for altitude from a long range missile, or it might be immediately chasing the target if it’s a short range dogfighting missile.Guidance, control, kaboom.The easy stuff is done now, the missile is in free flight with all its systems up and it’s accelerating hard. The tricky bit is picking out the tiny dot in all that blue sky and getting up close and snuggly with it. Guidance is a topic worthy of a fat book, but generally speaking the problem isn’t flying to where the other aircraft is, it’s flying to a point in the sky where it will be when you arrive. This is a tricky shot, especially because the target often keeps moving the goalposts.The launch aircraft sometimes tries to help out. Older RF missiles had the launch aircraft “paint” the target with their radar, modern missiles have to do this all themselves. Usually the missile will wait as long as possible before turning its own radar on, relying instead on flying itself to a pre-determined point, or possibly by getting mid-course updates from the launch aircraft (or even a different aircraft entirely) over a data link. I’m having to be pretty vague here, as there are so many different ways of doing this, and it’s extremely complex. Lots of hard maths. Luckily computers like the little one in the guidance section are great at doings lots of tricky sums very quickly, because if they weren’t none of this would be worth doing.Meanwhile, the target might be trying to spoil things by using electronic countermeasures to interfere with all this. Our poor missile has to work hard to get the job done, and (spoiler alert!) I sure hope it isn’t expecting any reward at the end.IR missiles are more straightforward, they just stare at the infrared energy coming off the target (due to engine heat or friction along the leading edges of wings/intakes, etc). The target can try to confuse them with flares, and some of the really early missiles were dumb enough to get distracted by the sun (dur!). They also weren’t sensitive enough to attack from head-on, they really needed to chase the target’s hot tailpipe to succeed. Nowadays, no problem.So assuming everything has gone swimmingly and the missile has avoided all these distractions, has enough energy to reach the target, and it’s managed to close the range and get itself close to the bad guy, what happens?Remember the target detector? Whenever anything gets within a few meters of the missile this widget gets really excited. A variety of sensors are used to detect the enemy, lasers staring out from the sides of the missile are popular. As the missile passes the target they (hopefully) spot it and quickly tell the warhead, which by this time has been armed. The warhead promptly explodes, at which point the missile’s story is almost over.Ignoring all the really daft stuff like nuclear air-to-air missiles (yes, really) the most common warhead type is probably the expanding rod. This packs rods around the central charge, which are accelerated outwards when it goes boom. The rods are connected at their ends, so until it reaches maximum size and breaks apart you’ve basically got a big steel ring flying through the sky. Remember the missile already has a LOT of forward velocity, so this ring of steel that is going very fast and expanding as it goes. Anything that’s inside the cone of fun this describes is going to get shredded. The idea is that the steel rods slice through the relatively soft aluminium of an aircraft, causing major structural unhappiness.Blast is very much a secondary effect, you’d really have to get a direct hit (very unlikely against a small fast manoeuvring target) to get much blast effect, but if you’re shooting helicopters or 747s then I guess it could happen.So, an unpleasant business and there’s a good chance that someone dies at the end of the story, but there’s a phenomenal amount of science and technology that goes into it.

Wozniak is a an incredible tech genius…but like many tech geniuses, he was hopeless at business and marketing.When Steve Jobs saw how home-computer enthusiasts (who mostly built their own computers because you couldn’t really buy one) loved the Apple I. Jobs saw that these people would want to buy a ready-made computer with a proper screen and keyboard - if only it existed. The potential market seemed good to him.Jobs was able to propel the Apple II to market - and from there, step by step and through many VERY ground-breaking products - become the head of a gigantic mega-company.He was not, in any way, a technical genius. He was just able to see what people wanted (or would want if they only knew it) - and get the actual tech guys to make it for him.He was lucky enough to be a friend of a tech genius - and born with some kind of innate grasp of what people want and how to convince them of that before they even know they want it.ELON MUSK: FIXER OF GLOBAL WARMING (hopefully) AND FOUNDER OF EARTH 2.0 ON MARS (doubtfully):Elon Musk was lucky enough to have parents who were reasonably well off - and who could afford to give him a very good education. I’d argue that anyone could do that without the help of rich parents - because you can get into a good college based on your ability (albeit with a chokingly large student loan!).Where Elon was lucky was in his choice of which work to do.His first project out of college was a slightly obscure piece of software to create an online “city guide” for newspapers and such. His company (shared with his brother) was called “ZIP2” and these days, it would have sunk without a trace with the decline of news print.But ZIP2 happened right at the perfect time in the “tech bubble” where every online business skyrocketed. ZIP2 was bought out by Compaq for $300 million(!!) - for reasons that are hard to explain! Elon walked away with $22 million.I put this down to 80% luck, 20% skill…if he’d tried to do this 3 years earlier or 2 years later - he’d have gone bankrupt - his competitor was beating him - but somehow Compaq didn’t care.This gave him enough money to start another company: “X . com” which was the progenitor of PayPal.PayPal wasn’t much use to start with - it wasn’t something people needed - or would have trusted.But when eBay needed a way for people to pay for goods at their online auction - they needed PRECISELY what PayPal was…a frictionless way to move money between individuals who weren’t commercial companies with access to credit card machines.As eBay skyrocketed - PayPal rose in importance alongside it. PayPal became THE way to deal with online transactions of all kinds.So what made PayPal successful wasn’t REALLY Elon Musk’s skills - it was eBay’s insane popularity. So I rate this more like 50% luck, 50% skill.When eBay finally bought PayPal for an ungodly amount of money, Elon was able to start SpaceX and bankroll the (then) tiny Tesla car company.But from this point onwards - I’d argue that very little of what happened was luck - although Elon is fond of pointing out that the first SpaceX rocket that made it to orbit was launched after SpaceX ran out of money - using whatever spare parts they could scrape together. If it had failed, SpaceX would be dead - but it worked, won a NASA contract and the rest is history.Elon is a FANTASTICALLY talented engineer - he writes software, designs electronics and mechanical stuff. He learns things extremely quickly and has a rare combination of engineering skills and the ability to see how to make mass production work.CONCLUSION:These two people are mirror-images of each other:I don’t believe there is a simple recipe…and I don’t think there is any way you can guarantee success because luck ALWAYS plays a huge part in it.But:So - no easy solutions here - which shouldn’t be surprising.",22 followers,Dolly Singh,19.7K,96,5.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-most-revolutionary-piece-of-technology-in-2018-so-far
