0,"Let me put it this way: I know quite a few people that do not use Facebook or any of their associated products (Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus etc.).However, I don’t know a single person that does not use a Google product regularly, whether that be search, Android, Gmail, etc. Literally everyone I know uses at least one of them.Based on that alone, I’d say Google has more relevance. Honestly, I could easily do without Facebook or any of their attendant services. However, if Google went away one day, I’d be in serious trouble… and I don’t think I’m the only one.","1,872 followers",Robert Johnson,2.1K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-startup-technology-or-upcoming-technology-has-potential-to-replace-Facebook-and-Google
1,"I don’t see anyone on my circle quitting Facebook.And for Google trying to beat Facebook, NOT in this life time. It tried it with Google+ and it failed, or at least they lost interest.","2,602 followers",Michaël Figuière,4.9K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-startup-technology-or-upcoming-technology-has-potential-to-replace-Facebook-and-Google
2,"The ""Off"" button.  Seriously, I'm in my 50's and grew up in an era without instant communication.  It wasn't all bad.  In fact, there was a lot less stress.  There are still times and places in everyone's life when it would be preferable and more beneficial to go off the grid for a few hours and experience life in the moment.",UNKNOWN,Inna Vishik,9.6K,1K,9.8M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Which-startup-technology-or-upcoming-technology-has-potential-to-replace-Facebook-and-Google
