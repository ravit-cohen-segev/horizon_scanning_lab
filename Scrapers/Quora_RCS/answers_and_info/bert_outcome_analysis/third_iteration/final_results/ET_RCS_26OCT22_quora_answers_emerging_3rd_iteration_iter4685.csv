1,Peace and quiet whenever you were away from your landline phone. A cellphone is like a very long leash. If you are in business your clients expect to be able to reach you at any time and can get very annoyed if they can’t.

2,Not ignoring people we interact with.. I’ve seen a few people go through a line and at the check stand talking away and ignoring the checkers. Sitting in a waiting room and everyone’s got there head down looking on their phones. Still driving and texting and talking on the phone.

4,"Many of the answers here are just plain wrong. When the Allies intentions became clear Grand Admiral Karl Doenitz instructed every possible U-boat to attack the invasion fleet at whatever cost. They were to sacrifice themselves in the attempt to stop the invasion. There were not many U-boats capable of making the target zone in a reasonable time frame but many boats did attempt to make the attack and some were successful. However, the water in the area was not deep enough to hide effectively and the British in particular made an all out effort to thwart the subs using ASDIC and depth charges aMany of the answers here are just plain wrong. When the Allies intentions became clear Grand Admiral Karl Doenitz instructed every possible U-boat to attack the invasion fleet at whatever cost. They were to sacrifice themselves in the attempt to stop the invasion. There were not many U-boats capable of making the target zone in a reasonable time frame but many boats did attempt to make the attack and some were successful. However, the water in the area was not deep enough to hide effectively and the British in particular made an all out effort to thwart the subs using ASDIC and depth charges and were largely successful. The U-boats stood no real chance of making an effective attack on the invasion.At the same time, German Admiral Petersen ordered the E-boat fleet under his command to make attacks on the invasion fleet as well. They were able to sink about 60,000 tons of Allied shipping. Between the U-boats and the E-boats about 100,000 tons of Allied shipping was sunk, including one troop ship, some freighters and a number of landing craft. This was in addition to the American disaster during the Battle of Lyme Bay at the hands of the same boats. But it was insufficient.Meanwhile, almost all German aircraft had been pulled back to Germany in the operation called “Defense of the Reich”. Fifty percent of all German aircraft were stationed in areas where Americans and British were bombing German factories, and this included the best German fighters such as the FW-190. Only a handful of planes were available to contest the beach landings as a result. Had even a single squadron been available, casualties would have been much, much worse. This situation represents a total failure of German leadership since the Germans knew an attack was coming, just not exactly when.Admiral Karl Doenitz later accused Admiral Petersen of being “shy” and not doing all he could. He held the view that Petersen was a coward for the rest of his life. For his part, Petersen maintained control of the E-boats and never sacrificed them in suicide missions. The E-boats remained active and successful until the very last week of the war.The German U-boat force of about 1250 boats lost 996 ships and 30,000 men out of a cadre of 40,000. U-boats risked a 75 - 90 percent chance of being sunk on every patrol. The E-boat force lost about 7,000 men but this was a far smaller percentage of their force and many E-boats survived the war and were purchased by other navies. In one case the English used them against the Soviets, even with the same German crews, after the war to land spies.",0 followers,Rich C,502,3.6K,3.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-miss-the-most-about-the-time-before-cell-phones-technology-took-over-1
5,"They tried. IIRC every U-boat in the French Atlantic ports was ordered to sea on 6th June 1944, to attack the invasion fleet. They failed to make much impact, & suffered heavy losses.It was no secret that the invasion was imminent, because it was far too big to hide, but the Germans did not know the exact date or where the invaders would land, & there was a huge deception operation to keep them guessing. Even when the invasion was underway, the German high command was not immediately sure that it was not a feint (albeit a big one) & that the main force might be waiting to attack elsewhere.TheThey tried.

6,"The Germans certainly tried to send their U-boats to defeat the massive flotilla, but technology, tactics, and geography were stacked against them.In mid-1943, the Germans stopped having a more effective weapon than the counter-force, and started to, in net terms, lose resources on the U-boat war (and even going 1-for-1 would have been losing, given that the US could out-build all of Germany 3–1 while still fighting Japan).

Allied ASDIC (sonar) and radar advances meant that the U-boats were untenable on the surface (airborne radar could pick them up from distance, even if just the snorkel was above the surface) and at great risk underwater when the enemy was alerted to their presence. Their few successes came from placing themselves ahead of Allied shipping, submerging, and attacking when the shipping came by them. However, roving anti-submarine patrols were making open U-boat packs of roving hunting bands impossible, as the subs would be found, forced under the surface, and attacked until they either sank or surfaced and surrendered.In order for them to be effective against the D-day landings, they would have needed to be in place before the Allies shipping lanes were established (the path from Great Britain to Normandy was only 90 miles) and defended. The Allies could not maintain ships there before D-day for fear of alerting the Germans to the D-day target. The Germans could not maintain a fleet of U-boats in the English channel before the landing, as they were extremely vulnerable every time they surfaced to get fresh air. Thus, they had to spot the flotilla, sortie from base, get in front of the landing fleet, surface, and wait for their time to attack, in order to be effective. Given that the Germans didn’t spot the fleet until it was off the Normandy coast, this was not possible.So, their only attack plan was to try to get as close as possible on the surface, submerge, and on battery power, get into position to make an attack. The Allies knew this would be their plan and were waiting for it. None of the Germans were able to get into position to attack in this manner.The U-boats were a defeated force by June of 1944, with the knowledge that every patrol was nearly a suicide mission. Morale was appropriate for this situation, and motivation was lacking. While the commanders pushed hard to get them to achieve this mission, the boat captains were not as excited about dying. The Germans, while being very capable and tough, were not like the Japanese, who thought it was their duty to die in the war.However, the S-Boats were an effective coastal force. They could never have won the war, but they were the best patrol torpedo boats of the war (longer range, faster, and better torpedoes than the Allied variants). They punched well above their weight class, with 4 attacking the D-day flotilla and sank a Norwegian destroyer without losing any of their own vessels.But, all the Allied naval losses were insignificant in the overall operation.","4,774 followers",Fergus Mason,543,6.6K,28M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-was-it-possible-that-the-invasion-flotilla-during-landing-in-Normandy-was-not-destroyed-by-German-U-boats
