Likewise, I wasn’t sure if mating GAN inputs against a fitness goal would have the evolutionary properties to drive a fake image of a human to a target. I was pretty sure it would based on past experience, I’ve been doing this for awhileAfter trying it, sure enough, you get almost uncanny genetic behaviors in GANs just like you do in real-life. Here are two fake people (post genetic optimizations) and you can see me mating them digitally and producing offspring. See how the offspring appear related, but unique? That is thanks to genetic crossoverThese are too wild, check out this offspring example if we replace a parent:Are you NOT entertained?!?It is also important to point out how “good” the offspring are, they aren’t stillborns like this:Most of the outputs coming out of GANS are terrible. Don’t be fooled by Nvidia marketing, the examples they have been using were cherry picked and refined. Genetic GANs fix that. If I had just blended them I would have produced this:I read your mind, I knew you were curious.

I had discussed my idea with my advisor and he had essentially saidIt looks silly and nonsensical, but it was a big enough deal my advisor forced the school to agree to not publish my thesis for a full year.

AI is set to transform business like never before, creating new opportunities for entrepreneurs, business leaders and workers in every industry.AI is quickly finding its way into our everyday lives. It may even soon be difficult to tell where it stops and humanity begins. What are the AI trends in 2022, and what do the most recent advancements in AI mean for the years to come?This article will look at some of the AI trends and discuss the implications of these technologies on businesses and their digital transformation efforts.Large Language ModelsThe language model is the ""brain"" of language understanding. These AI models rely on machine learning to determine how phrases, sentences or paragraphs are related. It learns and understands the language by ingesting a large amount of text and building a statistical model that understands the probability of phrases, sentences or paragraphs related to each other.Language models areAnother benefit of these large language models is that it requires just a few training examples to fine-tune the model on a new problem. Previously, AI solutions would require a lot of human-labeled data, which is difficult and expensive to create. With larger AI models, we can now achieve the same or better results with just one or a few training examples. This will reduce the cost of artificial intelligence, and we should expect many business processes to be automated.Natural Language ProcessingNatural language processing (NLP) is ""the ability for a computer toGenerative Artificial IntelligenceGenerative AI is an AI branch that focuses on generating content like writing text, generating images, text to image generation and making music. According to Gartner, Generative AI is aGenerative language models are a fascinating application. They allow for the generation of natural-sounding text, grammatically correct and appropriate for a particular topic or style. They can also create more general intelligence, solve problems and adapt to different situations.Reinforcement LearningThis is a branch of machine learning where data scientists focus on decision-making and reward-based training.Reinforcement learning isMultimodal LearningMultimodal learningMultimodal learning is important because it helps machines learn how to understand the world better. By using multiple forms of input, they can get a complete understanding of objects and events. This will help us build better AI models and achieve better results.Bias Removal In Machine LearningAs AI algorithms become more prevalent in business, they have come under greater scrutiny.Business and data scientists must remove bias during AI development to combat these problems. Companies can reduce bias in AI by checking the inputs and adjusting them where possible. For example, if a system is trained on photos of people but has no images of older women, it may have trouble recognizing them when provided with their photographs.ConclusionIn my experience, many technology leaders are still trying to understand how AI works and how they can use it in their field. To begin to incorporate AI, it's important to have a clear goal in mind for what you want the AI system to do. Understanding the data you have and what you need the AI system to do is essential.Pay special attention to the development of large language models as these models have made great strides in recent years and could be revolutionizing the industry. The ability to understand and respond to language is a key component for intelligent applications and will open up new business opportunities.The AI adoption willIt unlocks new possibilities like the ability for technology to understand any data and make business processes more efficient. It also holds new challenges like removing bias from machine learning. These trends will impact daily lives and businesses worldwide in new and exciting ways.",269 followers,Karthik Reddy L,16K,0,0,2013,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-impressive-recent-technological-breakthroughs-in-AI

Researchers now leverage the power of the many cores inside that same GPU to parallelly accelerate computing and to increase the predictive accuracy of their neural nets. The most interesting breakthrough was in the Imagenet competition in 2010, when Alex Krizhevsky and team from U of Toronto came up with their idea to train their convolutional neural network with multiple GPUs [ https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/imagenet_classification_with_deep_convolutional.pdf ]. I guess I should point out that in the timescales of machine learning algorithms, this is ancient. Nevertheless, there have been many recent breakthroughs stemming from this development and is therefore noteworthy.* Deep Reinforcement Learning - This one’s my favourite, so I kept it for last. Neural reinforcement learning has always been around since the 80s or so, but they had failed to make much of an impact. This was until Deepmind with David Silver and others came along with their deep reinforcement learning framework in 2015, that blasted every other algorithm out of the picture.

I was astounded when I recently learned that there are people who are trapped in exactly this state, figuratively speaking: a super locked-in state where the person isPatients who are unable to express consciousness present a major challenge to neuroscience. In intensive care units all over the world, half of the deaths result from a clinical decision to withdraw life support.There are several levels of neurological disorders of consciousness whose symptoms aren’t always clear cut and easy to diagnose accurately. Coma occurs within minutes to hours following severe damage to the brain such as a stroke, physical injury, anoxia (loss of oxygen supply) and poisoning. It is defined clinically as a prolonged loss of the capacity to be roused. The patient can’t be awakened and show no signs of awareness. The body continues to exhibit some unconscious reactions, reflexes such as pupil contraction in response to bright light are intact. The brain’s unconscious component deep in the brain stem is still functional.Brain death is a different, irreversible state characterized by a total absence of brain stem reflexes, breathing and a flat EEG signal. Cortical metabolism and the perfusion of blood to the brain disappear, leading to rapid degeneration and death of neurons.The majority of comatose patients recover within days or weeks. The first sign is the return of the sleep-wake cycle. They then regain consciousness, communication and intentional behaviour.However, sometimes recovery stops in a strange state ofIf they display intermittent limited responses that suggest comprehension and volition, they are in the “minimally conscious state” (MCS). Some form of communication can be established.The last state is the ‘locked-in syndrome’, often caused by the disconnection between the cortex and the spinal cord, which leaves consciousness intact. The patient finds himself imprisoned in a paralysed body, unable to move or talk. Only small eye movements and blinks, controlled by separate neuronal pathways, are spared and allow them to communicate with the world. These patients can still lead a productive, fulfilling life with their conscious capacity.In 2006, the British neuroscientist Adrian Owen made a stunning discovery in a patient who showed all the clinical signs of a vegetative state but whose brain activity suggested a considerable degree of consciousness. His work (The patient was a young woman who had had a car crash and suffered from damage to the frontal lobes. Five months later, despite a preserved sleep-wake cycle, she remained fully unresponsive, the hallmark of the vegetative state. No signs of residual awareness, communication or voluntary control was detected.But when they scanned her brain in an fMRI machine as part of a research protocol for monitoring the state of the cortex in vegetative patients, they found something astonishing.Owen ran an ingenious test in which spoken sentences were played to convey complex instructions such as “imagine playing tennis”, “imagine visiting the rooms in your home” and “just relax” at precise times. In healthy people, when you imagine such activities, the brain lights up as if youHer brain activity closely tracked the spoken instructions.Some critics objected that maybe merely the words “tennis” and “navigate” were enough to trigger her brain activity without her actually understanding the instructions and being conscious. But an elegant control experiment put this criticism to rest. When Owen scanned normal volunteers while they listened to the words “tennis” and “navigation” without any instruction, the activations evoked by the two words were similar. This finding implied that when activating her brain areas in a task-relevant manner, Owen’s patient did much more than reacting unconsciously to them, she seemed to be thinking about the task.In another experiment described in this Guardian articleThanks to fMRI technologies, researchers have made extraordinary breakthroughs in understanding the mental life of people trapped in the locked-in state. From thousands of fMRI scans since that first study,Owen received nearly twenty million dollars of funding to develop new techniques including less expensive methods such as EEG to help hundreds of thousands of patients in vegetative states worldwide. So far he avoids the most controversial question to ask these patients “do you still want to live?”, perhaps because the legal framework for such a difficult situation is unclear.The ethical conundrum resulting from Owen’s findings is that the outcome can influence a family’s or clinician’s decision to end a life. If a patient demonstrates some form of consciousness, s/he moves from the ‘possibly allowed to die’ category to the ‘not generally allowed to die’ category. It is illegal to withdraw treatment to such patients even if they make it clear that is what they wanted. Families might spend years living in false hope of recovery and burdened by the prospect of keeping them alive.These new technologies are significantly and directly impacting the assessment and clinical treatment of critically brain-injured patients and the prediction of recovery. They also bring fascinating insights into the nature of consciousness from the patients trapped in the gray zone between life and death.The Life Scientific - Adrian Owen on scanning for awareness in the injured brain - BBC SoundsBBC One - Panorama, The Mind Reader: Unlocking My VoiceThe Search for ConsciousnessConfronting the grey zone after severe brain injuryNeuroscience: The mind reader","5,361 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-impressive-recent-technological-breakthroughs-in-AI

The roads though are maybe a bit rougher than in Europe and Japan, but they are not falling apart or crumbling apart, with the exception of abandoned highways.Cars go 60, 70, even 85 mph on them all the time without popping a tire. Construction happens often.It does vary a lot from state to state and county to county. Idaho hasIn Washington (state) you can tell the difference as soon as you cross into King County. In Pierce County the roads are smooth, but then all the sudden as you get closer to Seattle you feel bumping.This though is a far cry from “falling apart”.You really cannot tell the roads in the US apart from the roads in Canada except for the street signs. Yes, Ontario, B.C., and Alberta have better roads than most of the US, but the ones in Quebec are as bad as the ones in the Great Lakes.As for firetrucks…Your typical American firetruck looks like that. They used to look like this:This one is probably from the 1980s:So yes… our firetrucks have been upgraded.When I am overseas I often see that the police cars are not very good. That surprises me a bit.In the US our police used old 90s cars right up until about 2008–2009, and then they started upgrading to Dodge Chargers:In Japan the police drive like… theseI have noticed lots of changes to the busses in my area even in my lifetime.When I was a kid the buses were like this:and the insides were a lot like this:Now they are like this:and the insides like this:No more metallic windows… softer seats… less spiky hair",0 followers,Maddy Kang,1.1K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-impressive-recent-technological-breakthroughs-in-AI

(Needless to say, the deficit increased.)The result was that our highways turned into giant parking lots.To make matters worse, Republicans continued the policy of pushing for lower taxes, mostly for the rich. This was called the ""starve the beast"" philosophy: the idea was that if tax revenues were reduced, the Democrats would be forced to agree to cuts in social programs.And to make matters even worse, the tax cuts proved a powerful political weapon against Democrats. Democrats had to agree not to raise taxes or lose at the polls.So government stopped spending on infrastructure, and it started to deteriorate. Just as bad, government stopped investing in badly-needed new infrastructure, like high speed trains -- or even a desperately-needed second train tunnel under the Hudson River (thank you, Chris Christie). Although you do have to consider that railroads can't work for travel here the way they do in Europe and other countries because the country is too spread out.Meanwhile, cities and sates were saddled with the cost of caring for the poor since the Republicans wouldn't let the Federal Government help out as it used to. This meant that they couldn't spend on locally-maintained infrastructure like subways and commuter railroads.That's the essence of it.I'd disagree thought that things like home appliances are less developed. For one thing, our home appliances are mostly made these days in China, and are the same as appliances sold worldwide. For another, appliances sold here are made to meet different needs than those sold in Europe. Often the difference is that energy is more expensive in Europe, water scarcer. You can buy a fancy European-style washer and drier or dishwasher but they will cost you a lot more than the American-style equivalents and serve no special purpose here.American houses are less energy efficient because energy is so much cheaper here, partly because the US is still a major energy producer and partly because the Republicans won't let us raise energy taxes as in Europe.American Internet access was way ahead of Europe's and now it's behind, because the cable and telephone monopolies were allowed to become Internet service providers and established a duopoly. Want cheap fiber? Good luck. Our government is now in the hands of the corporations and even the Democrats are reluctant to regulate and enforce the antitrust laws -- or if they do as in the suit against Microsoft, the Republicans drop the action as soon as they're elected.European trucks and cars aren't more advanced, either. You'll see more diesel cars but that's because fuel is expensive in Europe and pollution regulations aren't as strict. Electronics certainly aren't more advanced, they're basically the same. And the US still leads the world in technology, although consumer appliances are now almost all made overseas, often with American designs (e.g., the iPhone). And of course microprocessors, code, etc. -- we still dominate in high tech, though China will at some point inherit that mantle as it's inherited most of our manufacturing.",611 followers,Ryan Borek,511,173,2.1M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-impressive-recent-technological-breakthroughs-in-AI
