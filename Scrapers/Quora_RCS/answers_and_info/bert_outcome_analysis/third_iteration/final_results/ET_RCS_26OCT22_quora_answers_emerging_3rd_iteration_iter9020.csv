0,"Thanks for the A2A. The Internet of Things is really just slapping a WiFi or Bluetooth antennae on something to make it network-capable. Thus, IMO, finding a general network security book will work just as well as a IoT-specific book.The thing to remember is, unless you're making the device yourself, you're at the mercy of the manufacturer, and most manufacturers don't think of or care about security in their devices.For example, smart TVs from several vendors have been found to ""leak"" data back to the vendor in plain text. Depending on the TV's capabilities, that can include your viewing datThanks for the A2A.

Depending on the TV's capabilities, that can include your viewing data as well as account passwords and other personal information.Unless an IoT device has security built-in, your best option for security is ensuring your router is locked down with a good firewall, configured for only whitelist devices (much harder as more things are Internet-capable), and you periodically look at the data flow to see what your devices are sending out. That last step is probably too much for most people so making sure your router is configured correctly is the biggest point.Another option is to simply not allow IoT devices to connect to your home network. Do you really need to know what wash cycle your laundry is on? How about monitoring your thermostat? While convenient, IoT devices aren't necessary and open up a huge security risk for your network. If someone can break into an IoT device, they're past your firewall and inside your network.",152 followers,Alex Mann,2K,2K,102.8M,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-book-recommendation-on-Internet-of-Things-security
1,A lot has been covered by other 5 responses below but let me try to add a very important perspective of security considerations for the IoT applications. Let me first describe the layer or building blocks of IoT and then for each layer there is consideration to be made for security. You can read books listed below but you need to visualize like a user about how to handle secured IoT applications and communicate it to your end users.A lot has been covered by other 5 responses below but let me try to add a very important perspective of security considerations for the IoT applications.

4,"The Internet of Things ( IoT) also offers lots of advantages and risks as any other emerging technology. On the one side, IoT technology advocates and manufacturers encourage the Internet of Things in order to boost the everyday lives through billions of 'intelligent' IoT apps, such as smart cameras, Smart TVs, smart refrigerators, smart air conditioners, Smart Ovens, smart cash washers, smart running shoes, smart doorbells, smart police monitoring & traffic systems. On the other hand, because of user privacy issues on IoT computers, IT security professionals think that it is dangerous.In 2017The Internet of Things ( IoT) also offers lots of advantages and risks as any other emerging technology. On the one side, IoT technology advocates and manufacturers encourage the Internet of Things in order to boost the everyday lives through billions of 'intelligent' IoT apps, such as smart cameras, Smart TVs, smart refrigerators, smart air conditioners, Smart Ovens, smart cash washers, smart running shoes, smart doorbells, smart police monitoring & traffic systems. On the other hand, because of user privacy issues on IoT computers, IT security professionals think that it is dangerous.In 2017 nearly half of all U.S. businesses using IoT apps were affected by a security breach, according to findings from the recently concluded Altman Vilandrie & Company Survey of 397 IT executives across 19 industries. And the expense of these breaches was between hundreds of thousands and tens of millions of dollars.Whether it's the huge array of documents and files released in mark 2017 by Wikileaks that reveal CIA Hacking Tools, which shows the agency's ability to spy out IoT security challenges with an unflattering headline, on smartphones, computer operating systems, message applications and Internet connected television.Here are The 10 Best IoT Security Solutions for IoT Security Issues :1- IoT network securityThe network of IoT-based devices linked to backend networks on the Internet is protected and managed by the introduction of the standard endpoint security functions such as anti-virus, firewalls and firewalls.2- IoT Device AuthenticationLet users authenticate IoT devices with several operating functions for the individual IoT device and with robust authentication mechanisms such as double-factor authentication, digital certifications and biometrics.3- IoT Data EncryptionSecure the user privacy and avoid IoT-data loss, by using standard cryptographic algorithms and completely encrypted, lifecycle management processes to improve general protection of user data and privacy, encrypt data at rest and during transit between IoT devices and back-end systems.4 – Security methods for IoT PKIUsing IoT public key authentication methods such as digital Certificate X.509, cryptographical key and life-cycle capabilities including public / private key creation, delivery, management and revocation in order to ensure a safe link between an iOT system & app.5 – IoT Security AnalyticsUsing IoT security analytics tools which can detect attacks and intrusions unique to IoT that can not be detected by conventional network protection tools such as firewalls.6-Using IoT API Protection methods not only to protect the data integrity movement across IoT devices, back-end systems, and application systems using a recorded REST-based API, but also to ensure that APIs are only shared by approved devices, developers and applications, and that potentially threatened and attacked by unique APIs are detected.7- IoT Hardware TestingTo ensure the safety of IoT hardware, establish a robust test framework. This involves a comprehensive test of the range, capability and latency of the IoT system. The IoT device chip producers must also strengthen the processors to increase safety and power consumption without making it too costly for buyers.8- Secured IoT Apps DevelopmentGiven the immaturity of the current IoT technology, IoT applications developers will emphasize their IoT applications' safety aspect strictly through the implementation of all of the IoT protection technologies. Before IT applications are developed.9- Avoid Rushing The Launching of IoT systemsThe makers of IoT devices are always in a rush to sell their goods at the lowest cost, to remain ahead of the competition. And they don't pay adequate attention to delivering security updates and fixes when doing so. It poses a serious long-term threat to the health of your IoT apps.10 – Concern for Threats and Breaches of IoT SecurityDevice makers and software developers must be cautious about the current IoT security threats and infringements to guarantee the protection of IoT apps and applications. Since IoT is still a new technology, its safety breaches are expected to occur. Therefore, in the event of safety attack or data infringement, both IoT product companies and IoT app developer must be prepared for security infringement with an adequate escape strategy in order to ensure maximum data. Finally, IoT creators and IoT application developers alike need to take an initiative to notify their workers and users of the most up-to - date IoT risks, violations and security solutions.",169 followers,Rohit Shinde,582,307,2.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-book-recommendation-on-Internet-of-Things-security

He’s able to explain why people follow Big Brother and how the party manipulates history and news to ensure conformity to the party line. Orwell even dives into how language can be manipulated to protect authoritarianism.2 points resonated with me the most1984 explains Hitler, Stalin, Mao, and Castro. It exposes why and how authoritarian happens and convoys not only the importance of privacy but of information, language, and history.Above all EVERYONE can understand it. I love Dostoevsky and Nietzsche more than most but I will openly admit not everyone can penetrate these dense works. 1984 manages to entertain and also conveys its message in a way that everyone can understand. You can hand it to a 5th grader or a Doctoral Poli-sci student and both will understand and appreciate it.Honorable mentions",2 followers,Ashwin Sharma,3.2K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-book-recommendation-on-Internet-of-Things-security

Drive the IoTNow you can drive the IoT. Electric car-maker Tesla’s software automatically downloads service updates and if necessary, autonomously schedules a driver to pick the vehicle up and bring it to a Tesla facility. Say goodbye to waiting in repair garages and haggling over the price of a component.2. Wear the IoTRalph Lauren’s new Polo Tech Shirt streams athletic performance biometrics like heart rate, movement intensity and energy output to the cloud. Integrate with other wearables like FitBit, to receive a unified experience of your athletic performance.3. Become tomorrow’s Roger FedererFrench tennis company Babolat has added sensors and connectivity into some of its rackets. The Play Pure Drive system allows players to analyze ball speed, spin and impact location to improve their game.4. Making light of the IoTPhilips hue LED bulbs allow consumers to control lighting with their tablet or smartphone. Users can program the bulbs to dim at night, or blink if they detect an intruder.5. Making farming more friendlyThe John Deere Field Connect system monitors moisture levels and sends the data to farmers. The environmental sensors also measure “air and soil temperature, wind speed, humidity, solar radiation, rainfall and leaf wetness.”6. Flying highVirgin Airlines Boeing 787 aircraft are totally connected—from the engines, to the flaps, to the landing gear. Speaking to Computerworld UK, their CIO said, “We can get upwards of half a terabyte of data from a single flight from the different devices which are internet connected.”7. Looking after the elderlySpecialized sensors are equipping living spaces to monitor the health and general well-being of senior citizens, while also ensuring that proper treatment is being administered and assisting people regain lost mobility via therapy.8. Looking after your propertyBosch has developed an IP-enabled security camera that will allow you to connect with your security system when you’re not there. Accessing the Bosch iPhone app gives you a real-time view wherever you are.9. Never be late again…possiblyIn many cities, driverless cars that signal street sensors will give city officials the appropriate data to improve traffic patterns.10. Smart citiesThere are many examples of this. In in Singapore, city authorities are testing smart systems for managing parking and waste disposal to adjust to daily and weekly patterns.Make no mistake, the IoT is happening now. And if you want to land and expand your IoT strategy, you need business automation. This enables you to automate all the IT processes associated with the IoT—provision, deploy and process.
