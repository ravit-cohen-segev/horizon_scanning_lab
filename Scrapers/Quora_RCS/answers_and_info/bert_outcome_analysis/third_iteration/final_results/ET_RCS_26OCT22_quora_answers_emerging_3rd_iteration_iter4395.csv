5,"Yes there are famous local brands. But since not many are sold overseas as compared to the Japanese or European cars, they are not known outside of China. For example, Geely which owns Volvo, is famous in China but little known outside of China, while Volvo is known all over the world. The famous car brands in China are: SAIC, Chang An, BYD, Geely, Great Wall, BAIC, Dong Feng, amongst others.

Before the fuxing came online, the cutting edge trains were running at 300+kmh, whereas their mature siblings were running at 200-250kmh.When China decided to get into high speed rail in a big way in the late 2000s, it decided to invite tenders for the earliest lines. The unprecedented contract size meant China drew competitive offers, which included technology transfer and localized adaptations.However, China discovered companies were unwilling to sell and transfer their cutting edge 300+kmh train technology, which also came at a high premium. Besides, China found that the foreign offerings were optimized for a narrow range of latitudes, whereas China is continent size and experience climates from deserts to tropical rain.Fundamentally, China couldn't buy what it needed. That's why they pursued a centralized model of development for the fuxing, building on technologies acquired from the foreigners.As for cars, China could buy the best ICE cars, because the foreigners were willing to sell to the Chinese. There were many domestic JVs set up to serve the world's largest passenger car market, but production of the premier models remained offshore, such as the Mercedes s class and lexus.

Electric vehicles directly abandoned the gearbox and engine, and everything started from zero.China's advantages in manufacturing are reflected in a large number of power battery and auto parts manufacturers.The subsequent introduction of Tesla in China (like the introduction of Apple) further stimulated the speed of construction of the electric vehicle supply chain.

Go read the articles about how good the technology this car provides.NIO started their business with only Premium SUV (3 models) for the last 2–3 years (almost went bankrupt) and this year they are launching 2 new premium Sedans ET7 (going on sale in 1/22/2022 and ET5 (taking pre-orders, launching Sept 2022). So how is their sales? Well Elon Musk congratulated NIO for delivering their 100k car last year. NIO is on pace for 100% growing in 2022 and they are opening NEO park, which will make them theFor 2022But why stop here, NIO offers battery swap for their cars, as an option to the normal EV charging.Battery swapping only takes 3 minutes. Takes your depleted battery and replaces it with a fully charged battery.Just watch the video’sDont be confused, NIO still can be charged like any regulare EV car, but they provide you options.BTW, did I mention NIO signed deals with Sinopac China gas stations and Shell gas stations in Europe to provide NIO power stations, even gas stations need to evolve….So, let’s get back to the international countries.NIO launched in Norway 2022 with only their SUV edition. Within the first 2 months, they sold 190 units. With 95% of the buyers adopting a battery subscription.What is the battery subscription? It’s basically not buying the battery and choosing to lease it. The benefit is the followingDon’t believe me, listen to this guy from Norway, who is car review for many EV cars. Bjorn does many reviews and he does them in-depth. I highly encourage you to look at his review of NIO premium SUVFinally Norway will have their first battery swap station 1/19/2022. You will start seeing reviews of NIO ability outside of China.Updated 4/29/2022 - Norway has over 500 NIO cars in 3.5 months of sales with 1 store.(updated 1/20/2022) Norway NIO battery Swap official opened on 1/19/2022They are entering Germany, Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark in 2022So what is about NIO that is so good and different than other Chinese brands.Let’s put it this way, many foreigners who drive a NIO, they think it’s a car made from Germany.Dont’ believe it, watch reviews from other NIO car reviews.There are many more.I know..I know Chinese cars are not safe…Well I got an answer to that too.5 star rating from Euro’s….By 2025, you all will hearing about NIO. If not today, then tomorrow.If not, you may be driving a future NIO sub brand that will be priced at $30k with battery swap technology….I don’t mention the other Chinese brands because unfortunately, when people drive other Chinese brands, they still think it’s a Chinese car but with NIO…nope it’s a foreign brand, that’s NIO secret sauce to conquering global market.NIO wants to Brand itself as a global brand.I also didn’t touch about the many other avenues that NIO offers. NIO house, NIO lifestyle, etc etc…I encourage you all to explore about this brand because very soon, you may be driving one (I know, I will be, ET7)updated new video on Norway 1st Battery swap (1/20/2022)Updated video from BBC on Norway Battery swap (4/29/2022) 5 minutes swap.Updated 6/13/2022 Fully Charged review (On ET7 by EU company)updated 6/17/2022.
