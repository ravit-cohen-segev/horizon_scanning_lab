The applications run on its platform operate via its own cryptographic token. That makes this crypto sought after by developers looking to improve and run apps within this network.Ethereum also happens to be one of the few cryptos that can be used on exchanges to buy other cryptocurrencies. While its market cap pales in comparison with Bitcoin’s, it has slowly been making headway.

To help simplify this tedious process, we made a breakdown of some of the most promising cryptocurrency tokens/coins that are most likely to birth highly attractive profits for both traders and investors in 2019.As wild bull-runs on the cryptocurrencies markets ebb, an increasing number of investors are now keen to place their money on Bitcoin, Ethereum and their likes.Reports indicate that Russia’s online payments giant, Qiwi intends to launch Bitrouble, its own cryptocurrency that may have Kremlin’s blessings.Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) have become very popular among cryptocurrency aficionados. In fact, more investors are pouring money on procuring cryptocurrencies during ICOs than in the secondary or tertiary markets,Best Cryptocurrencies to InvestGiven these facts, there are 10 best cryptocurrencies that you can consider as attractive investment options in 2018-2019.1. Bitcoin (BTC)Undoubtedly, Bitcoin is the king of all cryptocurrencies. Over 2018, Bitcoin rates have remained fairly stable. It’s the best cryptocurrency to invest today.Further, Bitcoin displays an amazing capability to recover from any downturns caused by global or regional upheavals including ban on trading or crackdown on cryptocurrency exchanges and trade enforced occasionally by some countries.Most governments around the world are considering Bitcoin as benchmark for bringing some sort of regulation into the entire gamut of cryptocurrency trade. It is likely that Bitcoin will receive some degree of legal acceptance in coming years.Technological issues including delays in Bitcoin transactions are becoming extinct: advances in the blockchain technology now ensures that ledgers (blocks) and mining Bitcoin is faster.Added to these is the growing acceptance of Bitcoin in Business-To- Business (B2B) and Business-To-Consumer (B2C) transactions. More business establishments around the world and online stores now accept Bitcoin payments.Another factor that goes in favor of Bitcoin is the possibility to pay in fractions or Satoshi. Lured by the opportunity of making fast money with cryptocurrency, you can pay Satoshi or one-millionth part of Bitcoin as tips and fees for availing minor services.2. Bitcoin Cash (BCH)This latest variant of Bitcoin is something every investor should consider for their cryptocurrency portfolio. Cryptocurrency experts aver, BCH displays a much faster capability to recover from wild swings in the market.Bitcoin cash has inherent capabilities to overcome cryptocurrency markets volatility when compared over its parent BTC.Additionally, Bitcoin Cash transactions are much faster. BCH is said to possess a higher block size limit that makes it faster to track and mine on the blockchain.The higher number of ledgers possible with BCH are seeing its popularity surge among cryptocurrency investors as well as organizations that accept Bitcoin Cash for payments.3. Binance Coin (BNB)Binance Coin rates have more than doubled since beginning of 2018, if cryptocurrency reviews are to be believed.Binance Coin or BNB comes from Binance, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges of the world. Primarily, BNB emerged as intermediary or tender for trading different cryptocurrencies.However, it has now become one of the most traded cryptocurrencies worldwide.Should you be eyeing a portfolio that consists of diverse cryptocurrencies, BNB is something you must include. It is one of the most flexible cryptocurrencies and accepted immediately in lieu of Bitcoin and its counterparts.Should you hold Bitcoin, Ethereum or other cryptocurrencies, Binance Coin is another best cryptocurrency to invest in 2019.",UNKNOWN,Lawrence C.,2.3K,90,247.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-cryptocurrency-for-a-sustainable-investment

Bitcoin is just too slow to innovate. They have hundreds of developers and every change needs to get signed off by the community. This paralyses innovation.

They have no other choice. The Federal Reserve Scam is failing. Inflation is about to burst.

6,"Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are certainly not just a financial phenomenon.

However, the cryptography is intended to provide reliability and trust, which holds value in and of itself. It is as if the creators of cryptocurrencies are declaring that human nature and all of its “baggage” has no access to this territory.The modern financial system cannot boast such a feature. Instead, its money is produced by banks and is a factor of the political and economic influences of specific countries and organizations. In other words, the “old” money serves very specific interests.On the other hand, before our very eyes emerges a new, extra-governmental, extra-historical currency, claiming to become a universal, absolute equivalent, even to a point of driving gold out of its immovable position.Why did Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies ultimately come about?The birth of cryptocurrency comes as a result of a new need for it ripening in today’s increasingly globalized society. Although many people criticize globalization, it is nonetheless a natural phenomenon that reflects humanity’s current state. We have become one technological and economic whole, but we still reject our state of oneness psychologically.That is why we still do not know how to use and integrate cryptocurrencies systematically into the mainstream. Yet it still does not change its essence: that the global world is demanding a global monetary equivalent independent of local, subjective “circumstances” and interests.The overblown human ego on a global scale is gradually building respective global systems for itself in a way that makes no artificial ideological attachments. There is no “good” or “evil” here, but only business in its purest form. Also, what difference does it make if the reciprocal trust of the parties is provided by virtual computer computations? On the contrary, it makes it even better; there will be fewer errors in the calculations. It turns out that we are talking about global trends and, for the most part, it makes no sense to resist them.In the future, we will develop more universal parameters, but of a social nature. The day will come when, by virtue of a new quality of interconnection between us, a new “currency” will emerge—social rating—expressed by a clear equivalent that anyone can understand.People will be able to accumulate it as well, but not sell or buy it. It is more likely to have a comparative nature while having completely real value. It is because society, especially a global one, cannot be based on just bare egoism alone. Of course, it is rational in its own way, but when left to its own devices, it leads to a dead end. Our social aspect must take the upper hand over self-focus so that the whole will not fall apart into pieces. These are the paradigms of a new time, whose essence is not a single currency, but new relationships between people in a united, modern world.",0 followers,Glen Boston,655,71,1.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-will-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-change-the-world-in-ten-years

Same will happen with the motor part, connected with its medium. Thousands of billionaries instead of 5 companies owning the market like today.So… my bet is that a lot next gen of billionaries will be intermediates/managers/creator into this new proccess. And that Elon Musk is betting on this also (Solar + Hyperloop & Boring + Tesla)","135,555 followers",Hector Quintanilla,4.8K,1.2K,88.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-industry-or-idea-will-produce-the-next-generation-of-billionaires
