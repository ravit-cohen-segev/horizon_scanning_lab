0,"Android technology can be replaced overnight too (not literally). Did you ever think that something like a smartphone will come into market. Lets not talk about smartphone, did you even think that a PHONE which has a capability to connect distant people will come and rule the market…….technological advancements happen every second. So Android is not a big deal. If someone is able to design an OS or a “smart hardware” which attracts people it wont take long for Google Inc. to buy it or change Android significantly. Hope you get my point and donate an upvote for the answer.",0 followers,Ravi Ranjan,2.5K,81,356.8K,2017,https://www.quora.com/Can-Android-OS-be-replaced-with-any-new-technology-in-the-future

2,"LED’s will probably persist for several decades as the most efficient lighting. Lithium will probably be displaced within a decade by newer battery chemistries. But for the time lithium batteries power EVs they will probably save more CO2 than LEDs in the same time period. Converting outdoor lighting to LEDs has made a huge change in night sky glow and dramatically improved the “light pollution” of the night sky. If all lighting were converted to LEDs the lack of PV generation at night would become less of an issue, as nigh-time loads decreased. Both technologies should be praised and encouragLED’s will probably persist for several decades as the most efficient lighting.

4,"L.E.D.s have had a far greater impact. Their huge advantage in durability and efficiency has really impacted the usage of traditional lights, crt/tv screens. Made all new technologies like smartphones and data pads. May soon be a major factor in replacing outdoor farming with indoor “vertical farming”.","246,860 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-new-technology-has-had-the-greatest-impact-on-the-world-today-as-far-as-replacing-its-predecessor-and-the-largest-leap-lithium-battery-technology-or-L-E-D-technology
5,"Let me ask a corollary to this question.Did India have zero scientific knowledge before the largesse of the West brought in ‘modern’ education?How many of today’s commenters on all things ancient in India have actually read the Vedas?There is nothing to be gained by not doing enough research, and if there is a knowledge base to be tapped into, there is every incentive to research that and claim ownership - a habit Indians have never got into. How else would the so called ‘developed countries’ claim ownership over Basmati rice and sell land on the moon?What kind of pseudoscience led to witch buLet me ask a corollary to this question.Did India have zero scientific knowledge before the largesse of the West brought in ‘modern’ education?How many of today’s commenters on all things ancient in India have actually read the Vedas?There is nothing to be gained by not doing enough research, and if there is a knowledge base to be tapped into, there is every incentive to research that and claim ownership - a habit Indians have never got into.

Pseudocommerce?Those that talk of dumb Indians, and blindly question the intent behind AYUSH, never seem to wonder how chemo is recommended all the time as a cure, with less than 5% success rate, and almost guaranteed to bring death, but never even bother to wonder how someone like Amit Vaidya might have saved his life.The Mind, a Cow, and the Challenges of CancerEver wonder how the FDA stands by a stupid viewpoint that a drug alone can cure, while we know fully well foods can cure?And how about the wonders of modern ‘science’ that loses all humanity whenTruth is - without enough research, we do not know. We do not know how much the ancient civilisations knew. There are many wonders from those eras that we still do not have answers for.India has produced brilliant minds, and if you are going to measure today’s inclusive India that does not shy from including research on both the modern and the ancient by stupid things dumb politicians say, then why not measure the West too by its worst?Shall we legalise slavery, just to follow the USA? Maybe if we beat up our slaves for decades and then set them free, we will become a modern superpower?Or shall we stop with Trump saying he doesn’t believe in climate change, whileVedic knowledge did not cause climate change. But we’re doing our bit now. Maybe we will do much more if we dug deep into areas we have shied away from for a long time.Why the heck is the world going nuts on Moringa?",UNKNOWN,Raziman T.V.,1.8K,2.6K,24M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Can-Android-OS-be-replaced-with-any-new-technology-in-the-future
