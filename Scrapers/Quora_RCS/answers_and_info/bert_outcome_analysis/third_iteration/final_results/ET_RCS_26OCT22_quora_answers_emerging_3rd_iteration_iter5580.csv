And If you think you can make the needle in your home.Now let me explainMechanical engineering is the discipline that includes/ involves/ combines/ overlapsmore than 30 disciplines.Future of Mechanical engineeringElectric VehiclesReplacement of the traditional internal combustion engine with cleaner, battery-powered systems brings new challenges regarding torque and energy loss, and the design of mechatronics to support new electrical system.Furthermore, as vehicle manufacturing becomes more automated, mechanical engineers will be front and centre in the design of robotics andNanoengineeringNanotechnology refers to the manipulation of materials at the smallest level. This rapidly growing field is one that offers abundant opportunities for mechanical engineers.In the years ahead, mechanical engineers are expected to be integral in using nanotechnology to:BiomechatronicsThe role of mechanical engineers in robotics is taken a step even further with the rapid growth of biomechatronics. This field, which seeks to merge body and machine, involves the design and testing of complex and intricate device architectures that mimic the body’s musculoskeletal design.Mechanical engineers will be primarily involved in the design of mechanical sensors, controllers, and actuators for biomedical devicesManufacturingManufacturing is an ever-evolving field. Mounting pressures to increase production efficiency while minimizing operating costs have fueled demand for new and innovative technologies.Automation and roboticsNon-of the engineering is dead end...Edit:1.0For people in the comment section asking the reason for high unemployment for Mechanical Engineers. To answer the questionThe Problem of unemployment is not only with Mechanical Engineers, but with the whole Industrial Sector.A lot of Electrical Engineers and Electronics Engineers are working in IT Services like TCS, Infosys, Wipro, CTS, IBM etc.Many Civil and Mechanical Engineers are either working in Banking Services or pursuing Teaching in Coaching Classes.Some are selling Credit CardsFortunate Ones are going to US, Germany, Netherland to pursue M.S.The reason for this is, after Independence Indian economy has shifted gradually from Agriculture Sector to Service Sector (be it formal or Informal) leavingAccordingly the Share of Workforce in the Industrial Sector also remained Stagnant.However, Total no of Engineering graduates each year has risen drastically leaving many graduates unemployed.As per National Employability report engineers annual report 2019, Approximately 80 percent of Indian engineering graduates are not employable in the current knowledge-driven economy. This signify the pathetic condition of engineering education in India. Some major initiative in the direction of quality of education, is the need of the hour.What are Future Prospects of Industrial SectorIt has already been perceived our Government that Industrial & Manufacturing growth is the best route for overall economic development.Make In India, Skill Development, Start-up India, Stand-up India, Entrepreneurship Skill Development Program are some of the examples.Under Make in India thrust sectors have been identified to provide a push to manufacturing and Start-up India to strengthen the start-up ecosystem.The Ease of Doing Business initiative aims to create a conducive environment by streamlining existing regulations and processes and eliminating unnecessary requirements and procedures.Foreign Direct Investment policy and procedures have been simplified and liberalised progressively.Hope Future Industrial Sector is Bright, Everyone will be Employed !.Thank you Ayana Vini for pointing this out..Edit-2.0For people contending that the rate of innovation in Computer Science and Electronics is much higher and there is very less innovation in Mechanical engineering.I agree that the rate of innovation in computer science and electronics is far than the mechanical engineering.I totally agree.However, There is a world beyond the computer too. We can not eat data, we can not wear motherboard and we can not brush our teeth with a transistor & we can not drive a mouse.What i mean to say that for the innovations in computer science and electronics to use practically we always have to have a base. Where will we use those innovations ?? We will use these innovation in electronics over a car, or robot, or drone or rocket or spaceship or aeroplane , helicopter, fighter plane or any other equipment which must have a chance of using Mechanical engineering and we can witness the innovations in these technologies, can’t we?The rate of innovations in computer science and electronics is higher because these are new for the humanity. Both came into existence in the later 20th century and innovation has just picked up in the last decade. Hence, everything is new for us and we are able to perceive the little changes in it. Like after every 6 months we see a new smart phone with some new technology. There are millions of Applications releasing everyday. It looks quite fascinating to us, isn’t it ?However, we have been unable to see the innovations in materials. We don’t know about carbon fiber. We have ignored these innovations in Biomechanics.AWe have no idea about innovation in the field of Fluid dynamics because we can not feel it.There are innovations in mechanical Engineering too.The world is dreaming about a flying car, an smart robot, smart machines, and smart materials.There are huge innovation in nanotechnology, robotics, biomechanics going on.And i hope that in the NEXT EPIDEMIC like CORONA virus our worriers will be smart robots equipped with artificial intelligence ( off course credit goes to computer science), who will be carrying the infected to the hospitals and operating them.And in the coming time biotechnology is going to take over both Computer Science and Electronics Engineering as world has started witnessing biological warfare.Where as Mechanical Engineering will keep growing with the slow pace like a tortoise!Regards,ReferenceImage Source -phone gallery & GoogleMechanical engineering - Wikipedia4 Things to Expect for the Future of Mechanical Engineeringhttps://www.gedcouncil.org/sites/default/files/Engineering+Education+in+India+Dec1608-1.pdfDATA STORY | 80% of Indian engineering graduates not employable, says surveyIndia struggles but Bangladesh's GDP rides high on manufacturing, export boomKey Initiatives for Industrial Development Post GST and Demonetisation",240 followers,Sean Carron,1K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-field-would-you-suggest-for-a-mechanical-engineering-student-for-studying-a-graduate-degree-keeping-in-mind-the-emerging-technologies-and-future-scope

And it still is - sometimes.When sailors wanted to know how fast they were going, they would throw over the stern a log tied to a bit of string with regularly spaced knots in it. By counting the number of knots that went out in a fixed time, they would know their speed - in knots, of course.A navigator would want to have a regular record of this speed, so that he could calculate how fast the ship was travelling then thus roughly where he was. So the speed was written down, initially on a slate but later in a book, which, since it recorded the log measurements, was called the log book, which was later shortened to just the log. (Log book is still current terminology.)Then they started putting other useful navigational information - distances and bearings of landmarks, for example, would be ""logged"": combined with the speeds, that would give you a better idea of where you were.Then, of course, they started adding other information that they considered interesting: ships passed, on board events. So a log became an ordered record of events. Which it remains in things like Error Logs.And one place that such logs were used was recording arrivals and departures. People at, say, a secure establishment had to sign in when they arrived and sign out when they departed. And what they signed was a log. So the process of signing in and out became known as logging in and out.Then came multi-user computers, which required users to say who they were before starting works, and usually give a password. And to sign off when they freed their terminal. Although there was no visible log, and may not have been one at all, you logged in and out.Then along comes the WWW, and you need to do the same process of announcing yourself and verifying your bona fides to at least some web sites. Which, of course, means logging in.And finally, some people use logging in to a website to just mean opening it in your browser. When what they are actually asking you to do is throw a lump of wood over your shoulder.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-field-would-you-suggest-for-a-mechanical-engineering-student-for-studying-a-graduate-degree-keeping-in-mind-the-emerging-technologies-and-future-scope

Finally you have a super competitive and mature market in almost every niche, where your product has to work perfectly the first time.The end result is that most graduates are useless in industry, and will be nobodies for a very long time. Not only this, a company only needs so many designers, so if you didn’t start off on a good footing, you can end up fewer career options with a hard time building a product of your own. Lastly, the implication most students are unaware of is that EE graduates have much less bargaining power due to the above.Currently EE may be enjoying 50% less pay than their CS counterpart engineers, since EE has not had a boom for 20 years. There is no ‘build fast and break things’ or ‘disrupt’ kind of investment in hardware. Hardware companies are also extremely cost conscious whereas software companies have their main cost in people, which they value the highest.If you love EE and can make it to the top of your field, there is opportunity like any other.
