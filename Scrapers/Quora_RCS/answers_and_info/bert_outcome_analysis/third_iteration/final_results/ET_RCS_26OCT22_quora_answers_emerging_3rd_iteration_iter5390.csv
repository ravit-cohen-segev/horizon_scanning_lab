1,"In 1995, during my final year at IIT Kanpur, TCS and Infosys gave job offers to more than 60% of my class. Even the guys who really struggled (the ‘5 point someone’ variety) and had no other job options, easily got software jobs. And it did not matter whether you studied civil engineering or chemical engineering. So what was the point of studying computer science?Soon enough, IT majors like TCS and Infosys started hiring lakhs from across all campuses across India, and I became even more convinced that software engineering was now a commodity. It was a ticket to a safe but mediocre career.ButIn 1995, during my final year at IIT Kanpur, TCS and Infosys gave job offers to more than 60% of my class.

So what was the point of studying computer science?Soon enough, IT majors like TCS and Infosys started hiring lakhs from across all campuses across India, and I became even more convinced that software engineering was now a commodity. It was a ticket to a safe but mediocre career.But I was wrongSaying that you are a software engineer is like saying you are a writer. One could be JK Rowling or one could be an author of a blog, which nobody reads. Both are technically ‘writers’ but they are a world apart.So yes, we have an army of software engineers doing low skilled jobs at IT companies, which are surviving on the salary level differences between India and the US. But if that is all that was there to software engineering, why would Google and Facebook employ hordes of super-expensive software engineers in California?India has millions of software engineers, but where is all the innovation coming from? Has any major software language like Python, Ruby, Perl, or C been created by Indians? What about web frameworks like Rails or Django? What about libraries like Numpy or Pandas? I could go on and on.Even the US companies outsourcing work to our IT firms often get the critical work done locally by high-skilled programmers in the US. A lot of what gets outsourced is low-skill grunt work. I am obviously generalizing, but this is true for the most part.The story of software engineering in India is sadly much like our story in most other fields, be it sports, technology or business. At low and mid level skillset, we have an army of people. But at the high end of skillset, we are missing. Our best talent is sucked up by world’s top engineering schools and corporations.Back in India, many of our young graduates starting off as software engineers are only focused on constantly switching jobs to get that ‘30% pay hike’, rather than becoming really good at what they do. I have seen people from other countries make fun of how poor quality the code written by Indian engineers is, which should make us very sad.It is not that Indians are not competent. We have the same DNA as everybody else. My guess is that Indians probably constitute about 20% of the MS/PhD student population at many top US engineering schools. But back home excellence is not our priority - we settle for a low level equilibrium.It may sound harsh. But hiding from reality will not make it go away. It is hurtful, but we need to feel that pain and do something about it.What does the future hold for computer science?To foresee the future, let us look at the past. What has changed our lives the most in last 100 or 500 years? We still paint or draw or cook just as well or badly. For example, one could argue that the nawabs of Awadh ate better food than we do today.What has changed is technology. Everything we do is running on technology - from how we talk to people, how we travel, how we consume entertainment, to how we receive medical care from our doctors. And among all the areas of technology, software is the king.Software runs our lives 24x7, and it will do so more and more. The rockets launched by NASA or ISRO run on a ton of software. Our planes are sophisticated flying computers. When you fall ill, your blood testing is done by some fancy equipment, which is nothing but a computer at its core. Without software, your cars will not get manufactured, hospitals won’t run, and even your next-door restaurant won’t be able to bill you for food.The biggest companies in the world are de-facto software companies - Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Google… The industrial giants of yesterday are not in the same league anymore.The next 100 years will also belong to software. From data science to machine learning, from medicine to biotechnology - software will rule. And to win, you have to be at the cutting edge.The real game is not at the low end. It never was. The world is not very kind to the foot soldiers. Unfortunately, we live in a ‘If you are at the cutting edge of computer science, you will be the envy of the world. But if we keep switching jobs for that 30% salary hike, sooner or later we will get wiped out by someone with greater hunger for learning and passion for excellence. Make no mistake.Note: I have HUGE respect for people who build technology. My goal is not to hurt anybody’s sentiments, but to make us ask hard questions.",78 followers,Rajan Singh,11.6K,360,25.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-new-technology-in-electrical-engineering

In the Tintri VMstore, for example, the Tintri OS uses inline deduplication, compression, and other tricks to turn one part MLC flash and 10 parts SATA disk into something akin to an all-flash array for virtual machines. Lightning-fast flash delivers the IO, while disk provides the capacity.Sponsored by ōLand by Overline",7 followers,Rohit Virmani,1.9K,2.3K,86.6M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-present-day-technology-in-computer-sciences

Think about the witch hunts (Technology itself is not scary. Technology is merely a convenient scapegoat for a much bigger problem in society. The pitchforks are out and the people are out for blood and they don’t much care who they are pointed at, provided they can attack something or someone.Instead of being scared of technology, we need to look beyond that and challenge the dogma of the past couple of generations that have made all-powerful corporations and political institutions dominant in our societies. What scares me the most is that we seem to be ignoring the real elephants in the room, corporations and vested interests and how they are able to game society into blaming other things that are not the real problem.","6,479 followers",Michael Soareverix,28.3K,373,6.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-new-technology-in-electrical-engineering

7,"Machine learning scares me. It will change the world in ways we can not even predict now. I don’t think it will happen as fast as they are predicting, it will take decades or even a century, but it will happen.A machine that can learn by itself is like a brain.

12,"6 Technologies That Could Prevent Medical Emergencies Before They Happen1. Remote Patient ObservationThe use of IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) devices remotely keeps track of critical patient information — like heart rate, blood pressure, blood oxidation, or any information that clinicians may need to keep a patient as stable and healthy as possible.These remote observation systems can provide doctors with immediate patient updates, ensuring the quickest possible response to emergencies. They can even prevent them before they happen with predictive analytics that can pick up on subtle patte6 Technologies That Could Prevent Medical Emergencies Before They Happen1. Remote Patient ObservationThe use of IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) devices remotely keeps track of critical patient information — like heart rate, blood pressure, blood oxidation, or any information that clinicians may need to keep a patient as stable and healthy as possible.These remote observation systems can provide doctors with immediate patient updates, ensuring the quickest possible response to emergencies. They can even prevent them before they happen with predictive analytics that can pick up on subtle patterns of inpatient health information and predict if or when major medical issues may arise.An IoMT setup can, for example, use a wearable health device — similar to a smartwatch or fitness tracker — to keep doctors updated on a patient's heart rate variability (HRV). These wearables can detect patterns in HRV that may indicate risk to heart health, allowing doctors to notify patients and bring them in for a quick follow-up before a medical emergency occurs.Some advanced applications of IoMT tech are even better at providing health data and can be less intrusive. One experimental project being developed at MIT uses a combination of the Wi-Fi in a patient's home and AI analysis to observe a patient as they move. It keeps an eye on their heart rate, breathing, and movements for signs of potential health issues.2. Telemedicine And TelehealthImpaired access to healthcare can have significant negative impacts on patient health outcomes. Barriers between a patient and proper facilities have been shown to increase the risk of worse health outcomes and potentially lower quality of life.New technology may help lower some of these barriers. Telemedicine, powered by improved internet infrastructure and new network technology like 5G, uses wireless connections to bring doctors to patients who can't visit them in person.Telemedicine initiatives can provide patients with access to remote specialists or standard medical care. This can be especially valuable for patients in rural areas, or for people with limited mobility, both of which can have difficulty accessing any kind of regular medical care.3. Flame Resistant ClothingThe best possible safety equipment is essential in ensuring that minor accidents — especially in industrial settings — don't become medical emergencies.Flame-resistant clothing, along with other safety equipment like high-voltage gloves, can limit the dangers posedan limit the dangers posed to workers in environments with high currents and dangerous voltage levels.Fires caused by explosions or arc faults can pose a significant danger to workers. With the right equipment, the damage caused by these accidents can be minimized, ensuring the best possible health outcomes.4. AI Radiology AnalysisNew radiology tech uses AI analysis to look for signs of disease or illness — like breast cancer — in medical imaging, like mammograms. In one study, these AI tools were found to be even better than radiologists at spotting the warning signs of breast cancer.AI tools are already becoming commonplace in medical devices that scan for certain conditions. These tools are being used in CT scanners to reduce the amount of visual noise on a scan, providing a clearer image for doctors to analyze. Soon, these devices may integrate AI analytics as a tool that can help doctors spot serious diseases, like cancer, sooner than ever before.5. Surgical Sponge DetectionSurgical equipment being left behind in patients is a surprisingly common patient safety event that can lead to serious complications.New technology lowers the risk of this kind of event by taking advantage of RF tags embedded in surgical sponges and towels. Combined with RF detection, it's possible to quickly scan a patient for foreign bodies that may have been left behind during surgery.The technology isn't just limited to sponges — RF tagging and detection can be used for just about any surgical equipment or tool that may be left behind by accident.6. New Flu VaccinesDespite advances, the flu continues to pose serious health risks, especially for the young, elderly, and immuno-compromised.New flu vaccines recently approved by the FDA use high doses or special compounds, called adjuvants, which boost the human immune system. This helps it respond to threats like the flu and improves the vaccine's efficacy.Medical researchers are also pioneering new development strategies that use cutting-edge technology to discover new, potentially more effective vaccines. For example, one team in Australia used an AI researcher to develop a vaccine that employs a never-before-used adjuvant. It was found by the team to be more effective than even some of those adjuvant-boosted inoculations currently in use.Better adjuvants could easily make flu vaccines much more effective at protecting the vulnerable from influenza's worst effects.","5,361 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-present-day-technology-in-computer-sciences
