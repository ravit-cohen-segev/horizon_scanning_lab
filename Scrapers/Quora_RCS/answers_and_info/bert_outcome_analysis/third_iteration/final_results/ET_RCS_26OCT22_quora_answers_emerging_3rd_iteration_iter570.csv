We also know the British Z Division had agents in place to extract high-ranking German officials.Now when Artur Axmann, leader of the Hitler Jugend got arrested in Lübeck by the British, he was interrogated a first time by the Army. Here he states that Bormann disappeared in the Friedrichstrasse. Borman was advancing towards the north end of this street behind a Panther tank. The north end was blocked by a Soviet anti-tank gun position. They opened fire, the Panther got hit, and Bormann vanished. The Friedrichstrasse would later be in the Soviet Sector of Berlin.During the second round of interrogation, this time by British Intelligence, Axman chances his story, and now claims he saw the dead bodies of Doctor Ludwig Stumpfegger and Martin Bormann near the Lehrter Bahnhof, which would place it in the British Sector.This is the version Axmann gave at the Nürnberg Trials. Even at this stage, the Americans, French, and Soviets didn’t believe him and tried Bormann in absentia.What the British didn't know was that there was a second witness. This was Lieutenant General Hans Baur, Hitler's private pilot. In Soviet captivity, he gave the exact same account of events Axmann had given during his first interrogation.Now Reinhard Gehlen, head of the German BND believed Bormann lived out his life in the Crimea.This still doesn’t account for the fact his body was found near the Lehrter Bahnhof in the British Sector.A Britsh Liberator C.VII cargo aircraft picked up cargo and German VIPs ‘from an airfield near Berlin’ in the night of 4–5 May 1945.In June 1946, Hitler’s private bank accounts in Switzerland, which could be accessed by Bormann, are cleared out.There are sources that place Bormann in Britain, and later in Argentina and finally Paraguay. According to these sources he died of pancreatic cancer and his doctor was none other than Joseph Mengele.Finally, when Bormann’s body was found in Berlin, forensic analysis proved it was indeed Bormann, but they also found traces of red clay only native to Paraguay.It this point we think the British made him a better deal than the Soviets, and that he defected to the British. Once he died, his body was reburied in Berlin and ‘found’ by accident.Problem is finding ironclad proof, this might take a while.","66,669 followers",Dima Vorobiev,1K,4.2K,139M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Did-the-USSRs-KGB-spies-ever-try-to-steal-Americas-advanced-technology-and-abduct-US-top-scientists

At the same time, Russian(Kutuzov) and English forces captured Hanover and attacked Italy. They had twice as many men, horses and cannons as Napoleon and had Napoleon surrounded from all sides-Land and sea.How does Napoleon deal with it?1.Napoleon at once saw a fatal flaw in the allied plan. The allied forces were widely dispersed across the continent. Communications and co-operation between multilingual army would be almost impossible. This actually proved to be correct. The Russians were following Julian calendar, in which, dates were twelve days later than the Gregorian calendar. The rest of Europe followed Gregorian calendar.2. From his coastal encampment devising the invasion of England, he turns east and moves quickly. Unbelievably in complete secrecy, he seals borders and shuts down the press. Instead, he publishes bulletins saying how good life is at the coast. He leaves behind a few soldiers to give the impression he’s still there. In 40 days, his army reaches Ulm. But instead of going through Black Forest, where Mack was expecting him, he goes through Rhine river. Mack is now informed of 70,000 French troops arriving at him, whereas there are 210,000.3.During the second week of October several battles took place in which large numbers of Austrian troops were dispersed or captured as the net around Ulm drew tighter. Napoleon forced the main Austrian body to retire into the city of Ulm on the 15th. Any illusion that Napoleon might surrender was shattered as soon as he ordered his artillery to fire at the city walls the next day. Meanwhile General Mack is convinced Russians will be coming to his aid anytime now. In fact, the Russians were 200 miles away. Four days after the bombardment began, General Mack finally surrendered. 27,000 men and 67 cannons were captured by Napoleon. Half of the invading Austrian army was lost. What became a popular saying was Napoleon’s army could defeat enemies just with their legs, and without the use of arms.Just by marching, just by swinging wide around Mack, they were able to cause Mack’s defeat and this was unprecedented. For this disaster at Ulm, Mack was known as “the unfortunate general Mack”. He was, in fact, court martialled and sentenced to death. Napoleon’s path to Vienna lay clear. This would be followed by his finest military achievement ever, the battle of Austerlitz.Source -","2,444 followers",Pete Feigal,2.5K,401,9.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Did-the-USSRs-KGB-spies-ever-try-to-steal-Americas-advanced-technology-and-abduct-US-top-scientists

However, it goes without saying the Mongolian war machine was drastically superior to almost every adversary on the Steppes and in neighbouring regions.So, now to Julius Caesar, the wealthy politician with a penchant for kicking around Gallic tribes and sleeping with an Egyptian Queen to secure her excessive agricultural surplus.Gaius Julius Caesar, 100BC-44BC, while Caesar has earned a place on this list, I do believe he is somewhat overrated by the Roman fanboys.> Alright, put down those sandals, seriously, who goes straight to throwing their footwear, this escalated quickly. There are some Roman fanboys taking up carpentry in the comment section, and I'm pretty sure crucifixion is against BNBR.Look, Caesar took eight bloody years to conquer Gaul, 8 long years! When a General of the most powerful empire of his age, takes that long to conquer what is effectively a small backwater tribal region, it doesn't exactly impress me.Caesar then attempted to invade Britain and got slapped around and embarrassed, being unable to even forage for food without his soldiers being butchered. Caesar retreated, and to save face he returned a few years later with a much bigger force and achieved almost nothing, leaving a token contingent on the coast for propaganda.Caesar’s greatest military achievement was defeating a retired Roman general who had a far less experienced army of border guards.Julius Caesar made many mistakes across his career and learned from them, this enabled him to improve over time, he also displayed a far-sighted grasp of strategy and unrivalled use of propaganda to secure his long-term goals.Caesar gets 8/10. Bonus points for his logistical ability, and having to deal with the shockingly inept Roman political systemNow we get to Alexander the Great, possibly the most epic human to have ever lived.Alexander the Great, 356BC-323BC. The easiest way to describe Alexander the G, is to say that he is the yardstick by which all other great generals measure themselves.The 20-year-old prince who inherited the throne of a small Greek kingdom from his father Phill, his old man also happened to leave him one of the most well-disciplined and capable fighting forces on the planet, and Alex wasted no time putting it to good use.He spanked the Greeks into line by sacking Thebes and shaking his stick at the other cities, built a massive army of the finest Greek soldiers, and set out to defeat the largest empire on earth at the time.While I mocked Caesar of Rome for his lack of credible adversary, the same cannot be said of young Alexander, who hurled his tiny kingdom into war with the vast Persian Empire and won.By won, I'm slightly understating what Alexander pulled off. He invaded the Persian Empire and then set about annihilating every mega army sent to stop him, winning battles against extreme odds, being drastically outnumbered in nearly all his battles, and yet winning using some of the most innovative and game-changing tactics.When Alexander had finally defeated the Persian Empire he had barely gotten warmed up, he then went on to engage and defeat practically every military power between Greece and the Indian Subcontinent. Perhaps no other military leader has equalled Alexander's ability to inspire and lead men against such mind-boggling odds, across wildly differing terrain, and do all this fighting practically every type of enemy in everything from sieges, ambushes, to large-scale pitched battles, he fought against Elephants, and he never lost, not once, not even nearly.While Caesar took 8 years to conquer tribal Gaul, Alexander conquered many vastly more powerful regions and built one of the largest empires in history in just 11 years.Had Alexander not died when he was just 32 years old, it is likely he would have added vast swathes of Arabia and Europe to his empire, heck Alexander would likely have wanted to test himself against the Romans and trashed them.Alexander gets 9/10. Honestly, it feels wrong not giving him 10/10, he remains the measure by which all military leaders judge themselves. His tactics have been studied by everyone from Wellington, Hannibal, to Napoleon, and Caesar, and they continue to be studied to this day.Alexander gets bonus points for his creative genius, underappreciated logistical organisation, and inspirational leadership to the point that his veteran soldiers literally followed him to the ends of the known world and fought giant monsters.Finally, we reach Hannibal Barca, 247BC-181BC.> Ok, I should admit that I'm biased, Hannibal is my favourite General, his genius and ability is staggering. I actually tried to convince my misses to name our first son Hannibal.Hannibal Barca has arguably the most stacked battle record of all, he didn't build his legacy fighting weak tribes or petty kingdoms, he marched across Gaul and the Alpes to invade the fracking Roman Empire and then set about embarrassing every army the Romans sent to stop him, inflicting horrific loses on the Romans.> Roman fanboys chime in all aloofly - ‘Actually, it wasn't the Roman Empire at this point, it was the Roman Republic.’No one cares.When Hannibal crossed the Alps, marching into Italy full of swagger with his war elephants, the Romans unsurprisingly freaked out and raised staggering forces to stop him. People generally tend to focus on Hannibal’s three greatest victories as he rampaged across Italy spanking the Romans for 15 years, with his final genius curb-stomping of the Romans at the legendary Battle of Cannae, being the most celebrated.The Battle of Cannae is truly jaw-dropping, even to this day it remains one of the bloodiest battles in history, the Romans suffered roughly 67,000 casualties, while Han lost just 5,700 men.But there is a small often forgotten battle right at the start of the Second Punic War which is often ignored, and I personally believe it holds the key to both Hannibal’s success and the final fate of Carthage and this iconic legendary General.Battle of Ticinus, November 218 BC.When Hannibal first crossed the mountains with his war elephants and entered Northern Italy he fought a little known battle against a certain chap named Scipio.Anyway, Scipio was all confident and decided to goad Hannibal into a scrap and he got what he wanted, the ...",5 followers,Pat Sullivan,1.1K,4.9K,12M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Did-the-USSRs-KGB-spies-ever-try-to-steal-Americas-advanced-technology-and-abduct-US-top-scientists

21,"It actually makes a lot of sense if you remember that Google and Apple want to be global companies and not American ones.You really have to ask why Google should work for the US military rather than the Russian or Chinese military.

Baidu would not have been nearly as powerful if Googke had agreed to comply with Chinese censorship regulations. As it is without a western competitor, you have space for a local company that works far more closely with the Chinese government than Google ever would.I actually think that all the paranoia about Chinese espionage is going tp have a similar effect. If the US cuts China off from US tech, then China is going to develop local substitutes for which the US has no influence.The other problem is that the US is broke, and most of Silicon Valley is funded with Chinese and Russian money. If you start doing projects for the Pentagon, then those investors might want to look elsewhere.","103,823 followers",Ashish Kedia,3.2K,1.1K,35.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Did-the-USSRs-KGB-spies-ever-try-to-steal-Americas-advanced-technology-and-abduct-US-top-scientists
22,"My personal opinion aside, your question is drawing a false dichotomy.Google (along with every company on the plantet) wants access to the fastest growing (and soon perhaps the largest) economy in the world. That means working with the Chinese government to comply with their regulations governing surveillance and censorship.

Why is it suddenly bad they are doing something similar in China?The issue of working directly for the Pentagon on programs that likely include weapons programs is a completely separate question. If Google were working in a similar fashion with the Chinese Military or just about any other foreign military (perhaps with the exception of the Brites, Canadians, Australians, and a very few others), not only would the government shut down that activity, but Google would face extreme sanctions and a few executives would probably face lengthy prison sentences for violating a slew of national security and technology export laws.A few posters have stated that Google is a “multi-national”, this is not actually correct. They may have offices around the world, but Alphabet, Google and it's subsidiaries are incorporated in the United States, and are subject to US law.",UNKNOWN,Edgar A.
