Alstom, the French company fell to US prey in a similar way, was among the victims.Alstom's former executive Frederic Pierucci said in an interview with CGTN.""I didn't have the chance to have my company's support like she had, and I didn't have a chance to have my country's support like she had. What I have seen in the Huawei case is that the whole company was behind her from beginning to the end. And also diplomatically, China probably did a lot of things to come to this kind of agreement.
