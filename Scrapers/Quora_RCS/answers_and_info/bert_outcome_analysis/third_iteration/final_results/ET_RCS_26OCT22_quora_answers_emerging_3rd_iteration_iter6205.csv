1,"Thanks for A2A..Nowadays ""Big Data"" got big boom in IT sectors worldwide. As we all aware of, analytic's jobs pays a lot. Huge amount of data we generate day by day that to be managed for this purpose BIG DATA comes into the picture.Since there is description attached with this question so couldn't get more details about your knowledge or which field you are from? what job you do? these question matters a lot.  I'll consider you as fresher and try to give answers to your question.Big data is not a subject or language so you can learn by studying it. Actually It's combination of bunch of subjeThanks for A2A..Nowadays ""Big Data"" got big boom in IT sectors worldwide. As we all aware of, analytic's jobs pays a lot. Huge amount of data we generate day by day that to be managed for this purpose BIG DATA comes into the picture.Since there is description attached with this question so couldn't get more details about your knowledge or which field you are from? what job you do? these question matters a lot.  I'll consider you as fresher and try to give answers to your question.Big data is not a subject or language so you can learn by studying it. Actually It's combination of bunch of subjects,technologies etc.Let's consider this equation,Big Data = Programming skills +Data Structure & Algorithms+ Analytical skills + Database Skills + Mathematics + Machine Learning + NLP+OS+Cryptography + Parallel Programming.Yes! I'm not kidding here, you really need to have knowledge of these subjects.But don't worry, you can prepare it from scratch. There are huge resources available on internet that will help you out to master of all the skills.1] Before you get started:I've come across the beautiful introductory course of Stanford university. If you totally newbie to Computer Science field then please complete CS101 course.Here is the link to register for CS101:Computer Science 1012] Programming Skills:As I mentioned above, programming skills are mandatory to start with Big Data.    You need to learn following programming languages.Python is considered easiest programming language of the world because of It's simple syntax. You can learn python quickly.Learn Python here:If you are looking for ""Big Data Developer Job"" then I'd suggest you to learn Java.Here is Best resources available on internet to prepare JAVA:MIT is also providing open source course on Java, Here is the link:[Note: Any OOP language is mandatory to learn Big Data]3] Data Structure & Algorithms:Yes! You should have the DS & Algorithm skills. You can take MIT course to masters them:Learn about fundamental data types (stack, queues, and bags), sorting algorithms (quicksort, mergesort, heapsort), and data structures (binary search trees, red-black trees, hash tables), Big O.4] Analytical Skills:Analytical thinking will make you PRO in Big Data. I suggest you to try to solve puzzles from internet or start playing the chess. Doing these things will widen your analytical thinking.5]  Database Skills:As you are going play with lots of data so my recommendation is to learn SQL. You can learn SQL Here:6] Mathematics:If your math background is up to multivariable calculus and linear algebra, you'll have enough background to understand almost all of the probability / statistics / machine learning for the job.7] Machine Learning:Yet another important subject that everyone should learn is ""Machine Learning"". You need to have math knowledge to learn ML. Here is the world's best tutorial on ML:8] NLP:Here are some resources which will help you out in NLP:Book:Speech and Language Processing (2nd Edition): Daniel Jurafsky, James H. Martin: 9780131873216: Amazon.com: BooksWeb Tutorials:Artificial Intelligence Natural Language ProcessingHere is best reference,9] Operating System:Develop strong knowledge of OS from following resources.Online Resources:10] Cryptography:Here is the link to masters in cryptography:11] Parallel Programming:Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell: Techniques for Multicore and Multithreaded ProgrammingThe Last Step:Above 11 step procedure is really important if you want make great career in Big Data technologies. After the completion of above step, I'd like to insist you to visit  following link and start learning about Big Data:Big Data University | Data Science Courses**** Project Work ****Here are some real-world examples of Big Data in action:Tip:Big Big Luck For Your Big Data Career.[Note: If you need any help please feel free to drop me a message.]","47,054 followers",Abhinav Sharma,3.5K,865,7.1M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-are-Yahoo-employees-opinions-about-Adam-Cahan-being-promoted-to-Senior-Vice-President-of-Emerging-Products-and-Technology-How-is-he-planning-on-changing-Flickr-and-Yahoos-mobile-products

4,"For the start, let's first define Big data and opportunities in it.Big data are extremely large data sets. These are 'just data' collected via multiple channels from social media, mass and media to even capturing real time effects of tv ads on consumers. (I can take up how are these data collected and sources later).So its not about fields other than Big data, but opportunities and fields leveraging Big data:For the start, let's first define Big data and opportunities in it.Big data are extremely large data sets.

Its us. Every product we buy on Amazon, every Google search, every photo we like on Instagram, every information we share on Facebook. It is being used by every company and they get back to us. Data data everywhere.These are few to mention in the world where things are moving towards interdisciplinary perspective, where we learn from one field and apply to other. It's interesting how things are changing.Other than these using Big data, i feel other emerging fields are:Feel free to comment and suggest.Thanks for reading. Let me know if your thoughts.
