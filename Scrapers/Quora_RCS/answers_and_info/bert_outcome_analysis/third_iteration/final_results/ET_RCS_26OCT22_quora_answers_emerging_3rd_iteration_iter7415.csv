0,"Sure. That’s why people do it.That having been said, this is for the most part no longer an amateur undertaking. Mining for the large and more profitable coins has largely been professionalized with specialty mining rigs or high-end GPUs at sites with free or low-cost electricity and easy cooling for equipment.If you happen to live in a location with low-cost electricity, or you have extra solar generating capacity on your home, or you heat with electricity in the winter anyways so you might as well heat with a mining rig, then it is still possible to make money if you know what you’re doing,Sure.

2,"Tesla will 'most likely' resume accepting bitcoin as a form of payment once the mining rate for the cryptocurrency reaches 50% renewables, CEO Elon Musk said Wednesday at a virtual panel discussion hosted by the Crypto Council for Innovation, remarks that are in line with statements he made last month on Twitter. Nano (NANO) Nano is free, fast, and uses considerably less energy than Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies. It has been around since the end of 2015 and has a relatively small carbon footprint even now. It is also scalable and lightweight as it doesn't rely on mining.","19,202 followers",Jim Cantrell,4.2K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Can-money-really-be-made-by-mining-cryptocurrencies-with-a-positive-profit-gain
3,"He did with Tesla Energy which provides battery backup for both individual users and the grid. Grid scale battery packs can eliminate the need for natural gas powered peak plants and make Solar or Wind more viable as solutions.The Gigafactory in Nevada was supposed to use some geothermal, which is available in its area.I suspect The Boring Company might eventually lead to an interest by Elon in hot dry geothermal both on earth and on Mars.",0 followers,Bongani Mthembu,6.9K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Can-money-really-be-made-by-mining-cryptocurrencies-with-a-positive-profit-gain
4,"I worked with Elon for 2 years, spent a lot of time with him and helped him start SpaceX. It's hard to know for sure but by comparing Elon with most other bright people that I have worked with, I would put his IQ at 160-165. He is very smart but he is also very determined and hard working. Together with his intelligence and vision, hard work is what makes him so successful. Did I mention that he works very very hard? Yeah.","135,559 followers",Hector Quintanilla,27.8K,1.2K,88.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Will-Elon-Musk-ever-think-about-other-options-in-green-energy-solutions-other-than-solar

9,"The trick with energy is that the more you spend, the more you get back.The difference in highly successful individuals is that their work has meaning, passion, a reason to service and excel. They will not just work to fill in their time or earn a living, which is what most people do.That is why they seem to have much more energy. They achieve goal after goal, setting the bar higher and higher.

Because it can build it’s rockets with 320 times less money than NASA!! OMG!! Amazing!!Yeah well…kinda.Altough this is an amazing achievment it’s not really revolutionizing space travels by means of engineering, there’s no huge improvement in motors or technology really…you know why??Because SpaceX doesn’t take care of R&D, they just use NASA’s patents, that why they can build cheaper spacecraft’s, all the costy work is done.If you read carefully through is biography you can see that Elon is focused,determined, good willed ( but he can be the biggest jackass in the face of the planet), and smart, but he’s not even close to a genius, he’s more of a businessman than engineer.He uses the same materials everyone does, he just get’s them cheaper, he doesn’t bring any technical advancements to the table, he get’s really smart people to do the hard brainy work, so he doesn’t have to.So yeah, the guy’s smart, but most of it is just what the media wants to portray, and some people just eat it up.",22 followers,Dolly Singh,15.6K,96,5.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Will-Elon-Musk-ever-think-about-other-options-in-green-energy-solutions-other-than-solar
11,Yes - the total energy from completely covering your car with solar panels would make almost no difference to how far it would drive…solar panels simply aren’t productive enough to help much.The likely increase in weight and worsening of aerodynamics would doubtless make them counter-productive - and if there is weight and space to spare - I’d rather have a few more batteries please!You’re MUCH better off putting the panels on your house where you can store their output to charge your car later.,"5,929 followers",Alex Lightman,1.1K,752,6.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Will-Elon-Musk-ever-think-about-other-options-in-green-energy-solutions-other-than-solar
