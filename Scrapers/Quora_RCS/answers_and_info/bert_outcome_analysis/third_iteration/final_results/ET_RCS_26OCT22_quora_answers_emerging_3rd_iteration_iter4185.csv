There is heavy funding on innovation and scientists and engineers are paid well and get many offers from government. At the time of war there is full utilization of human potential of development and innovation>.So if you didn’t have any war from the starting of Humanity we would have a community fighting with spears and stones. Even some improvement in communications and media were because of war. If you want more development then just start a full scale war with allies. Humans would have been a technologically deficient race. Why would we need better technology if we don’t have any competition and live in peace?",166 followers,Booker Wilde,1.2K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-war-necessary-for-innovation-going-by-the-fact-that-most-of-the-innovative-and-revolutionary-technologies-we-see-today-were-developed-during-times-of-war

Germanys Stuka Dive Bombers were notorious for the terrifying shriek they made as they fell on their targets, the RAF's midnight carpet bombing of Axis cities caused untold civilian casualties, and it was the decimation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by U.S. dropped nuclear bombs that helped to finally end the war.As with any new technology, people were eager to see what aerial bombing could do. One of those people was Barnes Wallis.Wallis was British, a very clever engineer, and a ruthless strategist. When he saw the potential aerial bombing could have on German infrastructure, he set his sights on a target lots of people thought of as invulnerable: dams.Not only did dams provide water and hydroelectric for thousands of Germans, if the British could take them out the resulting deluge would cause massive amounts of damage far exceeding that of any bombs at the time.There was one problem though. The Germans knew what a tantalizing target their dams made, and so reinforced all major dams with heavy stockades of anti-torpedo netting.Remember, this was still in the early stages of ariel bombing, guided missiles were a thing of the future, and the current tech was not near accurate enough to hit the side of a dam without using a torpedo dropped way out in front of it.But Wallis had a plan. If he couldn't send the bomb plunging downEverything needed to go perfectly for this thing to work, and so the British Government hired a Civil engineering firm to find out exactly how big a bomb has to be in order to take down a dam. Turns out that 2 tons of Compact RDX and TNT will do the job as long as it explodes right up against the dam.So how do you get something that big to skip? Wallis designed a cylindrical bomb that would get twisted into a backspin before being released low and fast. The bomb would use the Magnus effect, which is the lift created by rapidly spinning objects, to keep momentum even after the first skip. The backspin would also keep it stable enough to skip straight down the line and the velocity of spin and approach could be adjusted to an accurate range.Of course, precision was key if the bombing was going to be successful. And because you can’t really use the trial and error method during a raid, the pilots needed a way to tell exactly when and where to release the payload.The testing began over Chesil beach in England. With a constant speed of spin (500rpm) on the bomb, the problem of determining the altitude of release had to be worked out. This was solved, like so many problems are, using good old geometric triangles ∆ Two searchlights were mounted on the belly of the bomber at such angles that their beams converged on the water below only when at the right altitude of release. This was as simple as it was practical as the raid was planned to take place under the cover of darkness.(Anonymous art showing searchlight method)The second problem of determining the range of release used a similar concept. By this time the target dams had already been chosen. They were Möhne, Edersee, and Sorpe, three vitally important dams in the northern Rhineland of Germany that had been scouted and photographed by Allied reconnaissance aircraft. Using these images, Walis designed custom bombsights that, when at the correct range, would line up with unique features of each dam (likely the flak towers) and in doing so signal the time of release.Finally, after months of testing on reservoirs throughout England, and the training of an elite mission force, it was time to see if the thing actually worked.(Walis and others watch a testing run in Kent)On the night of May 16, 1943, 3 waves of 19 total Avro Lancaster heavy bombers, each fit with a Skipping Dambuster, took off from RAF Scampton in England.(Art by Pat Speirs)It was a long and treacherous flight, especially in the dark. The first casualties were taken down by flak over the Northern coast of the Netherlands, two more planes crashed into powerlines, and one plane had its bomb ripped off by a rogue swell while skimming over the north sea, with that, the entire first wave of bombers was destroyed.The second wave fared better, but, when the first bomb was sent spinning towards Möhne dam, it blew up prematurely and did little or no damage. The second bomb was either dropped to late or, too fast, and went skipping clear over the dam where it absolutely annihilated an unsuspecting powerhouse on the far side.Finally, after the third bomb was sent spinning hopelessly off course, the fourth one skipped, sunk, and blew up right against the dam. The hit weakened the dam and, invigorated by this success, the next bomber, piloted by David Maltby, dropped low, released his payload, and climbed as the bomb skipped, sunk, and blew apart Möhne dam.(Art by Robert Taylor)(Actual destruction of Möhne dam)The aircraft then continued to Edersee dam, which took three bombs before finally breaching.(Edersee Dam before)(Edersee Dam after)The remaining aircraft then took runs over Sorpe dam. But the approach turned out to be difficult and dangerous, and when the surviving bombers finally turned for home, Sorpe stood solid.When the raid was done, only 11 of the original 19 Lancasters made it back to base, and 56 men were lost.Nevertheless, the mission was seen as an undeniable success for the Allied powers. The resulting floods from the collapse of Möhne and Eder, damaged or destroyed literally dozens of German bridges, factories, and mines. Acres and acres of farmland along with an estimated 1500 people were drowned. Production and transportation for the war effort were crippled, and huge amounts of German workers and resources had to be diverted as the dams were frantically rebuilt over the next 5 months.This answer has definitely gone on long enough, but if you want to learn more go watch:Edit: Thanks to the commenters who added info or pointed out mistakes :)∆∆∆","14,230 followers",Saran Udayakumar,2.3K,1K,29.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-war-necessary-for-innovation-going-by-the-fact-that-most-of-the-innovative-and-revolutionary-technologies-we-see-today-were-developed-during-times-of-war

Rather, they are being driven by many technologies. Advances in surface-to-surface missiles, surface-to-air missiles, lasers and various different kinds of radars are threatening to make fighter jets obsolete. For the past 50 years, fighter-bombers have been some of the most powerful and versatile weapons systems on the battlefield. They were largely responsible for the US’s stunning victories in the Gulf War and elsewhere, serving as the backbone of US defense strategy. Nevertheless, a number of technologies are coming online that are spelling the end of the era of fighter dominance.Over the past decade, countries like Russia, China and Iran have fielded a number of precision-guided cruise and ballistic missiles that are specifically designed to take out US and allied fighters at their bases. Fighter jets spend most of their time at fixed, known bases. This makes them easy targets for modern, precision-guided, stand-off munitions.Similarly, Modern air defense systems equipped with high speed surface-to-air missiles are becoming extremely difficult for planes to evade. During earlier conflicts, pilots could outmaneuver or jam enemy air defenses. However, modern air defenses are increasingly difficult to jam, because they can be equipped with frequency hopping radars. Additionally, the performance of missiles has significantly increased over the past couple decades, making it extremely difficult to outrun and outmaneuver modern SAMs.In the coming years, a number of laser technologies will come online that will make it even more difficult for aircraft to stay aloft in contested skies.

The two circles in the “face” of it are cheap glass spheres - which act as “retro-reflectors” so as you’re driving along at night, they reflect the light from your headlamps back at you - and they appear to glow. They can be colored to produce red or green reflections - but are mostly white.So you get a double row of glowing “lights” down the middle of the road - which really helps when you’re driving in crappy weather at night.Now - by itself - this doesn’t seem especially clever…but when you look into the design it’s absolutely AMAZING.Firstly, they are glued into a square hole that’s cut into the road surface by a machine - so they can be installed in a matter of seconds - and with modern equipment, pretty much automatically in most cases.You’d think that those retroreflectors would shatter every time someone drove over one - but the center part is made of a rubbery material that is squashed down into the hole beneath whenever something drives over it.You’d also think that they’d get covered in dirt and oil over time - but they’re even cleverer than THAT - whenever someone drives over them - the act of squashing the rubber causes it to gradually rotate the spherical lenses in their mounts and thereby wipe them clean.There are two lenses - so if one does break - the other continues to work (which doubles the life of the device).Even better, there is a small reservoir inside the rubber molding that captures rainwater which is used in the wiper mechanism so the lenses are WASHED and then wiped by the rubber as they slowly rotate!The shape of that reservoir is really well thought out so that it allows trapped oil to float off of the surface (oil and water don’t mix and the oil floats on top) and the muddy dirt that sinks to the bottom to be forced out sideways as it compresses so they don’t get clogged up with mud.The degree of cleverness packed into one piece of cheap, weirdly-shaped rubber is AMAZING!They also last for a VERY long time - there are still plenty of 80 year old cats eyes still embedded in older roads and still working perfectly.The number of lives saved by this contraption is hard to estimate - but it’s got to be HUGE.These things were invented in 1934 - and were installed in VAST numbers into British streets in World War II when car headlamps had to be fitted with thin slots to aim the light downwards to avoid alerting enemy bombers where the main roads were. With poor headlamps - and without streetlights - these things were the only thing making it possible to drive safely at night thoughout the time when German midnight bombing raids were happening almost daily.These contraptions are made in their MILLIONS every year.So “Genius Invention”…definitely.DOES IT DESERVE MORE CREDIT?They were invented by Percy Shaw in 1934 - Shaw was born in 1890, and had worked his entire life in very humble jobs - eventually starting his own one-man business as a road contractor in 1929. He was no genius inventor, not an engineer, had ZERO training in design or whatever.This was the only thing he ever invented.In 2006 (30 years after Shaw died), there was a vote for the top ten “design icons” in the UK…the winners included the Concorde airplane, the “Mini” car, the red phone booths, the World Wide web and the classic British double-decker busses were all on the list…along with the humble cat’s eyes.In 2005 he was listed as one of the 50 greatest Yorkshire people.Did the genius inventor get credit during his life?He must have been fairly rich - getting money from every one of these things that were made…but he never moved out of his family home where he lived his entire life - he didn’t have carpets or curtains - his only furniture was a row of chairs going around all four walls of his living room - plus one single bed.He never married or had girlfriends - he invited all of his friends to his home every Friday and served free beer and potato chips.He did buy four TV’s so his guests could see all three British TV channels without arguments about which to watch - but all with the sound turned down because he preferred conversation. Three of the TV’s were black-and-white - only the fourth was in color.HisIt’s not known for sure - but he seems that he must have mostly given away the money he earned - because when he died, his estate was only worth a little more than the value of the house and car that he owned.The only recognition he got for his invention during his lifetime was an OBE (“Order of the British Empire”) which he accepted by mail rather than in person by the Queen..and there was a TV documentary made about him.Since his death - there has been a pub that was named after him…and there is a small blue plaque mounted on his former home.CONCLUSION:Doubtless there will be other answers here with other inventions and other inventors…but this one seems to me to be the most extreme example of an INCREDIBLY useful invention that’s saved a ton of lives and which has never been improved upon even after almost 90 years of use…and an inventor who was almost unknown for most of his life.",109 followers,Hayden Miller,11.6K,0,0,2022,https://www.quora.com/Is-war-necessary-for-innovation-going-by-the-fact-that-most-of-the-innovative-and-revolutionary-technologies-we-see-today-were-developed-during-times-of-war

One thing I immediately noticed from your question is thinking only of men as geniuses (asexual or womanizing). Women are as likely as men to have a genius IQ. Geniuses do not fit into stereotyped categories. There are military officers who are geniuses and female homemakers who have genius level intelligence.

If you are really sharp you will notice that the DSLR did not automatically hide the chromatic aberration in the above picture. That is something usually done in post processing on the computer.Now, I just rotated my zoom lens to a longer focal length and took another picture.You still think that a cellphone image matches up to a DSLR?Look at this building in the cell phone.It’s pretty unrecognizable and the phone went basically to black and white.Here is the DSLR.

Some enormous advances in warfare were made during their tenure, all the way from practical armour plating to protect against projectile weapons to radar-controlled fuses for anti-aircraft shells.But I doubt that, for all of the sophistication seen in the great fighting machines of the last hundred and seventy years, any of it comes close to being as revolutionary as one simple-looking piece of wood:The atlatl.This simple device cleverly uses the principle of the lever, one of the basic engineering principles which underpin the development of human technology and civilisation, to throw a dart.Spears and darts are truly ancient weapons which make a hunter (or warrior) more powerful and deadly than bare hand or a simple held rock would permit. One could easily argue that the spear itself is among the most revolutionary of weapons, granting startling capacity to inflict wounds while allowing the warrior to stand off at a distance from his target. But the atlatl does something which the thrown rock, spear or dart could not on their own; it actuallyHeld overarm, with a flexible dart placed in line and against the end of the atlatl, the user then swings the atlatl down over his arm in an elegant sweeping motion. The dart is released during the swing and the atlatl, acting as a lever, imparts more energy into the dart than if the thrower had just used his arm alone. The dart flexes, briefly storing up the energy imparted to it, before flexing back in the opposite direction and springing away from the still-moving tip of the atlatl, flying a considerable distance with quite significant force.The atlatl thus allowed the hunter or warrior to stand off at a good distance from the target and strike a powerful and deadly blow with a remarkable degree of accuracy. Wikipedia states that the practical range was about twenty metres, which doesn’t sound like a lot, but standing twenty metres away from a mammoth or someone with a spear places you in a position of relative safety; if you can strike them dead from that distance, you own the battlefield.This weaponWhoever conceived the idea for a device to throw a spear further and harder was, without question, brilliant. Surely it is the most revolutionary weapon of all time?Spear-thrower - Wikipedia",UNKNOWN,DurgaPrasad (దుర్గా ప్రసాద్),546,183,3.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-war-necessary-for-innovation-going-by-the-fact-that-most-of-the-innovative-and-revolutionary-technologies-we-see-today-were-developed-during-times-of-war

These are some of the top picks that I would like to share with the readers:Top 10 Inventions that Changed the WorldA history of ingenuityCredit: igor.stevanovic /Humans are an ingenious species. Though we've been on the planet for a relatively short amount of time (Earth is 4.5 billion years old), modern Homo sapiens have dreamed up and created some amazing, sometimes far-out, things. From the moment someone bashed a rock on the ground to make the first sharp-edged tool, to the debut of the wheel to the development of Mars rovers and the Internet, several key advancements stand out as particularly revolutionary. Here are our top picks for the most importantLive Science's Jeanna Bryner contributed to this countdown, which was originally published on March 6, 2012.The wheelWheels were invented circa 3,500 B.C., and rapidly spread across the Eastern Hemisphere.Before the invention of the wheel in 3500 B.C., humans were severely limited in how much stuff we could transport over land, and how far. Apparently the wheel itself wasn't the most difficult part of ""inventing the wheel."" When it came time to connect a non-moving platform to that rolling cylinder, things got tricky, according to David Anthony, a professor of anthropology at Hartwick College.""The stroke of brilliance was the wheel-and-axle concept,""The hard work paid off, big time. Wheeled carts facilitated agriculture and commerce by enabling the transportation of goods to and from markets, as well as easing the burdens of people traveling great distances. Now, wheels are vital to our way of life, found in everything from clocks to vehicles to turbines. [Next: The nailThe nailWithout nails, civilization would surely crumble. This key invention dates back more than 2,000 years to the Ancient Roman period, and became possible only after humans developed the ability to cast and shape metal. Previously, wood structures had to be built by interlocking adjacent boards geometrically a much more arduous construction process.Until the 1790s and early 1800s, hand-wrought nails were the norm, with a blacksmith heating a square iron rod and then hammering it on four sides to create a point,Meanwhile, the screw a stronger but harder-to-insert fastener is thought to have been invented by the Greek scholar Archimedes in the third century B.C.Next: The compassThe compassModel of a Han Dynasty (206 B.C.Ancient mariners navigated by the stars, but that method didn't work during the day or on cloudy nights, and so it was unsafe to voyage far from land.The Chinese invented the first compass sometime between the 9th and 11th century; it was made of lodestone, a naturally-magnetized iron ore, the attractive properties of which they had been studying for centuries. (Pictured is a model of an ancient Chinese compass from the Han Dynasty; it is a south-indicating ladle, or sinan, made of polished lodestone.) Soon after, the technology passed to Europeans and Arabs through nautical contact. The compass enabled mariners to navigate safely far from land, increasing sea trade and contributing to the Age of Discovery.Next: Printing PressThe printing pressA printing press from 1811, now in the Deutsches Museum in Munich, Germany. Two printers worked at each press; one moved pages on and off while the other inked the text blocks. Together they could print 3,600 pages per day.Credit: MatthiasKabelThe German Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press around 1440. Key to its development was the hand mold, a new molding technique that enabled the rapid creation of large quantities of metal movable type. Though others before him — including inventors in China and Korea — had developed movable type made from metal, Gutenberg was the first to create a mechanized process that transferred the ink (which he made from linseed oil and soot) from the movable type to paper.With this movable type process, printing presses exponentially increased the speed with which book copies could be made, and thus they led to the rapid and widespread dissemination of knowledge for the first time in history. Twenty million volumes had been printed in Western Europe by 1500.Among other things, the printing press permitted wider access to the Bible, which in turn led to alternative interpretations, including that of Martin Luther, whose ""95 Theses"" a document printed by the hundred-thousand sparked the Protestant Reformation. [Next: The internal combustion engineThe internal combustion engineA four-stroke internal combustion engine. 1) Intake stroke - air and vaporised fuel are drawn in. 2) Compression stroke - fuel vapor and air are compressed and ignited. 3) Power stroke - fuel combusts and piston is pushed downwards. 4) Exhaust stroke - exhaust is driven out.Credit: ZephyrisIn these engines, the combustion of a fuel releases a high-temperature gas, which, as it expands, applies a force to a piston, moving it. Thus, combustion engines convert chemical energy into mechanical work. Decades of engineering by many scientists went in to designing the internal combustion engine, which took its (essentially) modern form in the latter half of the 19th century. The engine ushered in the Industrial Age, as well as enabling the invention of a huge variety of machines, including modern cars and aircraft.Pictured are the operating steps of a four-stroke internal combustion engine. The strokes are as follows: 1) Intake stroke - air and vaporised fuel are drawn in. 2) Compression stroke - fuel vapor and air are compressed and ignited. 3) Power stroke - fuel combusts and piston is pushed downwards, powering the machine. 4) Exhaust stroke - exhaust is driven out.Next: The telephoneThe telephoneAlexander Graham Bell's Telephone patent drawing, from 1876.

In 1928, the Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming noticed a bacteria-filled Petri dish in his laboratory with its lid accidentally ajar. The sample had become contaminated with a mold, and everywhere the mold was, the bacteria was dead. That antibiotic mold turned out to be the fungus Penicillium, and over the next two decades, chemists purified it and developed the drug Penicillin, which fights a huge number of bacterial infections in humans without harming the humans themselves.Penicillin was being mass produced and advertised by 1944. This poster attached to a curbside mailbox advised World War II servicemen to take the drug to rid themselves of venereal disease.About 1 in 10 people haveNext: ContraceptivesContraceptivesOrtho Tri-Cyclen oral contraceptives.Credit: Public domainNot only have birth control pills, condoms and other forms of contraception sparked a sexual revolution in the developed world by allowing men and women to have sex for leisure rather than procreation, they have also drastically reduced the average number of offspring per woman in countries where they are used. With fewer mouths to feed, modern families have achieved higher standards of living and can provide better for each child. Meanwhile, on the global scale, contraceptives are helping the human population gradually level off; our number will probably stabilize by the end of the century. Certain contraceptives, such as condoms, also curb the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.Natural and herbal contraception has been used for millennia. Condoms came into use in the 18th century, while the earliest oral contraceptive ""the pill"" was invented in the late 1930s by a chemist named Russell Marker.Scientists are continuing to make advancements in birth control, with some labs even pursuingNext: The InternetThe InternetPartial map of the Internet based on the January 15, 2005 data found onCredit: Creative CommonsIt really needs no introduction: The global system of interconnected computer networks known as the Internet is used by billions of people worldwide.

In the 1960s, a team of computer scientists working for the U.S. Defense Department's ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) built a communications network to connect the computers in the agency, called ARPANET. It used a method of data transmission called ""packet switching"" which Roberts, a member of the team, developed based on prior work of other computer scientists. ARPANET was the predecessor of the Internet.Source:","58,988 followers",Michael Wolfe,504,2K,17.3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-if-a-genius-woman-will-invent-the-most-revolutionary-technologies-including-gadgets-Will-boys-men-idolize-her
