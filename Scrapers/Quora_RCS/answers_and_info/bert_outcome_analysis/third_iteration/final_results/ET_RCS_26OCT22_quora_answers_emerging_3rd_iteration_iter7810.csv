From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that thereI used to work on fusion simulation codes (particle in cell) with the US National Labs when I was at NVIDIA, and I was very interested in seeing if we could solve the problems with fusion and picked the scientist and engineers' brains endlessly. My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

As there are thermodynamic losses in turbines and other ancillary processes in a fusion power plant, the Q-value should be sufficiently high, in ITER’s case, the objective is 10. Another objective is to maintain the fusion pulse for up to 8 minutes. Still not good enough for commercial power production, but that’s a target that would allow us to be on our way for commercial viability. Other objectives are developing all the technologies and processes for a commercially functioning fusion reactor, ITER will provide us the context for what needs to be done and what needs to be prepared for operating a commercial fusion reactor, including refueling, service maintenance and safety protocols put in place. All good stuff.But ITER will not be commercially producing power. It will just be a demonstration fusion reactor that will pave the way for a commercially viable design. ITER’s goal is to achieve plasma ignition before the end of the decade and has a planned timeline of D-T fusion tests by 2035. That’s still a long ways away. Not to mention, the first commercially producing fusion plants are still in the early conceptional stages and won’t even begin construction until 2040 at the earliest. The proposed EU DEMO plant has a proposed Q-value of 25, with a gross thermal output of 2GW. That sounds like a lot, but the average Generation III nuclear fission reactor are between 3GW and 4GW of thermal output per reactor. Meaning even the large DEMO fusion reactor, which in itself is supposed to be 15% larger in linear dimensions than ITER and will probably cost quite a bit more than ITER as it will actually have turbines to produce electricity from the heat generated from the reactor, is going to put out less power than nuclear fission reactors that we’ve been constructing for decades.That, and another huge consideration is the amount of tritium stockpiles available to fuel a fusion reactor. Tritium has a relatively short half life of 12.3 years and there’s only about 25kg of tritium stockpiles at the moment around the world. The world’s only commercial source of tritium are from the handful of CANDU nuclear reactors out there of which, half are expected to retire this decade. The DEMO reactor is expected to require about 300 grams of tritium a day to produce 2GW of thermal power, or about 800MW. 300 grams a day…that’s over 100kg a year for a single fusion reactor…not to mention, it requires around 10kg of tritium just to start a fusion ignition for the fusion reactor, tritium availability might kill the fusion reactor before it can even start up. To counter that, fusion reactors are being designed to breed tritium by lining the inner walls of the tokamak with lithium based breeding blankets, but due to budget costs, even on ITER, the breeder concept will only line 4m² of the 600m² tokamak’s inner surface.Some private efforts to design a fusion reactor are forgoing tritium altogether. Those reactors will require operating temperatures much hotter than D-T fusion, which requires 150,000,000° C, vs 200,000,000° C for D-³He fusion and 1,000,000,000° C for p–11B fusion. Neither of which are easy obstacles to overcome. Another solution is ironically just building more nuclear fission plants for the purpose of producing more tritium. There is still work to be done to figure out how to ensure the tritium isn’t lost through any tiny gaps in the reactor as it is a difficult gas to contain and known for permeating metal walls of reactors.Fusion is possible. The physics behind it is known. But fusion power generation with continuous uptime is still some time away for commercial viability. How much we should spend on it is hard to say. We’ve spent over $150 billion on the ISS up until 2010 and we can argue endlessly whether that investment translated into any tangible improvement in the human condition or human knowledge. It’s the same for the James Webb Space Telescope, the Large Hadron Collider, and it will be the same for ITER and commercial fusion. If we want any possibility of establishing human presence outside of our own planet, it is probably a good idea to fully master power generation using nuclear fusion. As we try to decarbonize our electricity supply, alternatives such as nuclear fusion is worthy of consideration.Personally, I would rather we spend the money and investment on improving nuclear fission reactors further while the rest of our engineering and technology matures to bring the cost of pursuing research on fusion more, but I’m not the one making those sort of decisions. The worst case outcome, commercial fusion won’t be viable in our lifetime, the timeline will just extend further out into the future, but it will eventually be viable. Best case outcome, we’ll have the first commercial fusion reactors in our lifetime, it will be expensive, but it will show humanity what’s possible with human engineering and ingenuity and hopefully we can find a pathway forward to reduce costs.","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-nuclear-fusion-power-plants-still-not-possible

Useful nuclear fusion that consistently puts out more energy than it consumes in operation has turned out to be hard.Right now there is no utility-scale electricity produced by fusion power other than renewables that are ultimately powered by the big fusion reaction in the sky. Those renewables keep getting cheaper and more reliable, making competitively-priced electricity from terrestrial fusion less likely to be competitive in future.When people ask about the prospects for nuclear fusion power, the answer has traditionally been “25 to 50 years away” from when ever you ask. In the 1960’s nuclear fusion power was 25 to 50 years away, in the 1990’s nuclear fusion power was 25 to 50 years away. Today? Park that thought.Where are we today? I’d say much closer. We have a much better understanding (thanks to the many experimental fusion reactors already built) of what it will take to make a useful nuclear fusion reactor. The technology and engineering are coming together, but slowly.It seems to me thatHowever, when I imagine something larger and more complex than ITER, I don’t see cheap electricity. I see something that looks a lot like an existing nuclear fission power plant except maybe more complicated and with larger internal losses. Given that nuclear fission power plants are struggling to compete right now, I just don’t see something that is more expensive again and has a lower output will be able to produce the sorts of profit that would be required for widespread uptake.There is a possibility that one of the many other fusion experiments might actually achieve the result before ITER, but that seems unlikely to me. For example, when Lockheed Martin announced theirIn conclusion, I’m optimistic that humanity will eventually achieve “useful” nuclear fusion power, maybe even in my lifetime (but probably not). But I am pessimistic that this will ever result in a commercially competitive (or viable) way of producing utility-scale electricity.Q: To what extent could nuclear fusion power stations be the answer to all our power needs? Could it be cheap and constantly available?
