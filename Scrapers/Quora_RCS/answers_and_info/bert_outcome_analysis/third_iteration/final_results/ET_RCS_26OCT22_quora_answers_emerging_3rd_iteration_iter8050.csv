In fact I think I asked it myself when I was an undergrad in the 1990s at Caltech. I believe you may be a mathematician or an undergrad level physicist who just learned basic quantum mechanics. A fully trained more senior physicist would know that such an effort serves no purpose, as the Schroedinger Equation cannot be used in that way and was never meant to be used in that way. First the mechanics of how your approach (the idea that you take equation XYZ and work out some fancy advanced thing from it) fails at this specific moment and then philosophy as to why that way of thinking always fails within physics (but works within pure math).First of all, the inner shell electrons for almost any atom other than a Hydrogen or Helium atom are relativistic, meaning nonrelativistic QM like the Schroedinger equation doesn’t apply. Next, in order to do QFT calculations, the math is effectively intractable unless you switch over to Feynman diagrams and diagrammatica techniques. Even then the number of loops and other factors that you include makes the problem intractable, so you need to do normalization tricks. None of the above are compatible with rigorous mathematics and is the core difference between how a mathematicians and a physicists brains work.At some point in time in a classroom you can start telling people with math brains apart from physics brains around relativistic quantum field theory (aka QFT). QFT is unfortunately only reached by very advanced undergrads at top schools or theory students in most grad schools, so all the years prior to that point become wasted education when the student realizes they can’t handle this way of thinking unless they switch to another topic or go into experiment instead of theory or switch to pure math and just don’t work on physics anymore.A physicist writes equations to describe the phenomena in the real universe (of which some might be undiscovered and therefore impossible to write equations for, and by the way cannot be discovered by expanding on existing physics laws either for complex reasons beyond this short answer, but the laws of physics themselves instead get rewritten from scratch using new paradigms).A mathematician writes expressions, theorems, generalizations, and other such constructs based on assumed axioms. The physicist guesses out of thin air the correct equations using genius (Seriously…math is something you build up afterwards retroactively as a double check and a way to describe your theory to other people….Feynman describes this in one of his recorded video clips as physicists just guessing the answers and throwing out guesses that don’t match measured data). Also the physicist through genius and wild guesses knows what accepted and “known to be true” equations are actually junk, retroactively working backwards and throwing out the now junk axioms that everyone else accepted as obviously true that they were based on. (Like Einstein throwing out absolute space and time coordinates).Now notably physicists intentionally still use those junk axioms and equations as “true” even through they are “untrue”, knowingly and being fully right to do so. This is because the old equations are not actually wrong, or right, they are just applicable at lower energies for example like Newton’s laws. You don’t avoid using Newton’s laws just because Einstein discovered relativity. That would be a typical engineers misconception that physicists just do fancier more detailed engineering calculations. You still use Newton at low energies. The newer more advanced theory works at yet higher energies and must mathematically reduce to the older equations at lower energies. You would be totally stupid to use relativity to solve how a basketball bounces off asphalt if there were no ultra high energies involved. Other things like air vortices and patterns of dirt on the rubber and asphalt would dominate. Interestingly it is not just a “hey just do a super powerful computer simulation with the fanciest equations” situation either, as the “real” laws of physics are not known and possibly not knowable if they are a holographic projection of laws of physics in a super space projected into our subspace for example. Those themselves could also be projections from beyond that superspace.There is no theoretical way to know if there isn’t yet another set of more advanced equations that goes to even higher energy. This concept is called UNIVERSALITY (apologies for the bold but it’s that important). But this is such an obscure high level concept that you may not find anything about it when you google search even though I just told you about it.

Many of those statements have stood as conjectures for a while, until someone found a counterexample.Some of the following counterexamples are profound, some mundane. Some are easy to verify, some aren’t. Some are in Number Theory, some in the Theory of Computation, some in Logic and some in Topology (and maybe a few other fields, we’ll see).ClaimThis was a genuine conjecture made by Pierre de Fermat, who verified thatThe counterexample comes precisely at the next number,In fact, Fermat was about as wrong about this as can be: as far as we can tell, pastClaim (Tait’s Conjecture)This was proposed in 1884 by P. G. Tait as a way to prove the famous 4-Color Theorem: Tait showed (quite easily) that the 4-color theorem follows from this statement. It took more than 60 years for Bill Tutte to find this counterexample:This graph is obviously planar, it is obviously cubic (every vertex has exactly three neighbors), it is slightly less obviously 3-connected (it cannot be separated by removing one or two vertices), and it’s not Hamiltonian (there’s no way to visit all the vertices in one continuous path with no loops). This last part isn’t at all obvious but it’s also not super difficult to prove, either. It’sClaimThis conjecture was made by none other than Leonhard Euler, as a certain extension of Fermat’s Last Theorem.Euler observed that it’s easy to add up two squares to get a square, as inThis isn’t true, but it took almost 200 years to find a counterexample.The first counterexample was found in 1966 by Lander and Parkin, using a computer search. They discovered that27You can find their original paperThis shows that Euler was wrong whenThat took considerably more ingenuity than a mere computer search. In 1986, 20-year-old2682440Finally, forWe aren’t quite done with Euler, though.ClaimLook at the following array of cards.A♠ K♥ Q♦ J♣See how clever this is: every row contains each rank (J, Q, K, A) exactly once, as does each column. Also, every row contains each suit (♠,♥,♦,♣) exactly once, as does each column. But moreover, the two arrangements of rank and suits are so mixed up that no card appears twice in the entire array: the Jack of Hearts appears just once, as does the Queen of Spades, and so on for all possible combinations.Without this last “orthogonality” condition, what you’d have here is just two superimposed Sudoku puzzles of order 4. But the requirement to have none of the pairs appear twice makes it a very hard puzzle, hard enough to interest the great Euler. He used latin and greek letters to build those arrays, earning them then name Graeco-Latin square. Here’s such an array of order 3.Euler was able to construct such arrays for every odd order and for every order divisible by 4. It’s easy to see that there’s no such array for order 2 (exercise!), and Euler was unable to build one of order 6, so he proposed that the orders 2, 6, 10, 14, … are impossible. Those are the even numbers that aren’t divisible by 4.Euler was wrong about that, too, and once again it took more than 150 years for this conjecture to be refuted (at this point I should probably mention that Euler was one of the most profound and creative mathematicians of all time, and those conjectural snafus were quite uncharacteristic of him.)Euler was right about order 6, though it was only in 1901 that this was proven. But in 1959,Here’s an orthogonal array of order 10: every 2-digit combination appears exactly once, and every row and every column contain every digit in both the first and second places.ClaimThe theory of Turing degrees is a truly beautiful idea. It studies the computational aspects of sets of numbers, and reveals an amazingly intricate structure from a few simple definitions. Here are the minimum basics we need.A set of natural numbers is calledNot every set of natural numbers is computable, because there are far too many sets and far too few possible computer programs to detect them. As a concrete example of a non-computable set, consider the set of numbers which encode (in some way) computer programs which halt. No computer program can correctly determine if a number is or isn’t in the set .Now, suppose you are given a magical gadget whichEmil PostBut they do. Richard Friedberg and Albert Muchnik, independently, developed the idea known as the Priority Method and constructed such peculiar sets. This opened a whole new field of study, exploring the rich structure of Turing degrees and their partial order.ClaimGeorg Cantor, the creator of the Theory of Sets, wondered if there’s an uncountable set of real numbers which cannot be put in correspondence with the real numbers. In other words, is there any cardinality betweenThis very famous conjecture became known as the Continuum Hypothesis (CH). In 1938, Kurt Gödel proved that this hypothesis is consistent with ZFC, which is the same thing as saying that there’s a model of ZFC – A “universe of sets” – in which CH is true. Some people believed this was an indication that CH is, indeed, true, which means that there are no models of ZFC in which CH is false.In fact, people generally had no idea how to build models of ZFC other than the “natural” ones likePeople don’t usually think of a model of ZFC+ClaimIt’s very easy to construct uncountable groups: the circle, the torus, the group ofIt’s possible, but very far from easy.

One of the biggest issues that I’ve noticed in my classmates and students that struggle with math is this: They view math as memorizing a bunch of formulas and applying them. This is often how they were taught, and it’s horrible! To show the difference, let me give an example of the two ways that a simple concept can be taught:Way 1:The teacher states area formulas for the following: equilateral triangles, squares, rectangles, right triangles, regular hexagons. These are all pretty basic shapes, but their area formulas are decently different at first glance.Way 2:The teacher shows visually why a rectangle’s area is equal to its width times its height, by showing a diagram like thisThe students can clearly see that there are 15 squares, which is the area. By doing a couple more examples, students will realize that the area can be found by multiplying the side lengths.From here, the teacher can have students come up with the formula for a square based on the rectangle area formula, since squares are just special rectangles.At this point, the students are also capable of finding the area formula for right triangles; by noticing that two of the same right triangle put together make a rectangle. Thus the area of the triangle is one half the area of the rectangle. That is, Area(right triangle)=(1/2)base*height.Next, let’s memorize one formula (the teacher could go more into depth explaining how to obtain this, but for now it may be easier to memorize).The area of an equilateral triangle (a triangle with all side lengths the same) isFrom here, the students can construct the area formula for regular hexagons (a 6 sided shape with every side the same length and angle the same), as a regular hexagon with side lengthThus the area of the regular hexagon is six times the area of each equilateral triangle, i.e.The difference between these lessons is that, in the first lesson, students are given 5 seemingly different equations to memorize. If they forget one of the equations, they will have NO way of doing related problems! This can be extremely frustrating, especially for younger students. Students who are taught like this get bored with math because there doesn’t seem to be any point to what they’re learning- each fact seems isolated and uninteresting.Students who learn from lessons like the second one, however, are learning to THINK not memorize. Students in the second lesson only have to memorize one formula! Any of the other formulas, they can recreate themselves during a test or on homework. They will also be able to come up with formulas for other shapes, such as octagons or parallelograms. Students in lessons like these will build connections between the seemingly different branches of math and learn to see some of the cool intricacies within math.Of course, it also helps if teachers connect math to the real world; simply learning the area formulas for different shapes may seem pointless to some students. But if the teacher explains how this could be used, it might stick in a kid’s head better! For example, students could consider what the perimeter (side lengths) of different shapes were with the same area (ie, if a square and a circle have the same area, what are the perimeters of each?). The teacher could then explain how this comes up in nature sometimes; for example, bubbles take on a sphere shape because it minimizes the surface area (analogous to perimeter) per volume (analogous to area). The teacher could bring in bubbles and a variety of tools (like hangers folded into different shapes) to show that, no matter what shape the bubble wand is, the bubbles always snap back into a sphere. This relates to what they’re learning in class because they’ll see that circles (the 2d versions of spheres) also minimize perimeters.Edit: In response to some of the comments, I wanted to point out that this method of teaching can work for non-visual problems as well. The point isn't to show pictures (though visualizing math is great!), but rather to explain the process used to obtain the formulas. This is something that can be done even for very algebraic problems!Edit 2: Thanks to whoever suggested the edits for the formulas! I didn’t know that Quora had a way to write formulas nicely. This looks so much better!Edit 3: Wow, 1.5K upvotes! Would never have expected my answer to reach such a wide audience! Also, thank you all for the kind comments; I am glad to hear that my teaching methods resonate with so many of you!","2,223 followers",Trevor Cheung,660,1.3K,4.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-largest-computer
