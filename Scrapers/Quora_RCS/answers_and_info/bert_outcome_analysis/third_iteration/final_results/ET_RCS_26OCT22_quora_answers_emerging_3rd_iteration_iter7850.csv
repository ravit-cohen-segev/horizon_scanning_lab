1,"Well, it really depends on what the energy source is useful for. Theoretically, if the energy could be harnessed into fuel, electricity, etc. then we may be able to stop global warming for starters. This would only happen if, the new energy didn’t cause pollution. The effects on Earth would be meaningless! Because, we can now colonize everywhere. With infinite energy we can travel to anywhere, if we could use the energy correctly. These effects would be universally impactful, and not so much worldly impactful. The effects would be unimaginable.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advanced-futuristic-technological-possibilities-with-a-consistent-and-infinite-power-source-of-energy

They wound up with 10 percent of 1 WORKING fission plant for 750 million, plus all the current and future expenses connected with their share. In the early Obama administration Georgia and South Carolina utilities bit on a guarantee to build a total of 4 nuclear units. They were supposed to cost 6 billion (milliard) dollars each. They are now far overdue, more than 2 billion (milliard) each over budget, the general contractor has bankrupted.There have been articles in Scientific American estimating the cost of fusion plants at more than 25 billion (milliard) dollars each. Just paying for their construction, if they did not cost a dime afterward, would be crippling to an economy which depends on reasonable and competitive prices for industrial electricity.There is no free lunch or magic source of energy.

Then Helium-3 is also out of reach and not a feasible option.But breakthroughs have been made using other methods and even materials.Obviously I'm not gonna get too much into details. It's enough if I simply give you the cover and not really the content.One method is based on Nuclear Thermal Power Generation. The method is similar but different. The initial idea was to use fission to achieve fusion. The new method uses a transuranic element, created by exposing a Uranium isotope (233 to 236) to hydrogen+helium at near absolute zero temperatures. Plus intense but specific magnetic fields.This “new” material although still in its testing phase, as revealed great potential to obtain a form of fusion. Where it can produce a form of plasma that it's extremely potent, energetic wise, but not requiring to achieve the extreme temperatures normally required for Fusion.Another method, that has also shown some potential, is the use of a hydrogen superfluid. Where tests have shown that maybe it might be perfect to be used with Electromagnetic Confinement. To achieve controlled nuclear fusion. The best data so far is the scale of the reactor itself and power requirements to start and maintain fusion.Fusion wise that's it. These two are the ones that I see, as the best possible closest solutions, to nuclear Fusion.I know that Lockheed Martin, Compact Fusion reactor, has been on almost every front page of this topic. But seriously. All the data they have shown, points to a working reactor, by around 2050 or 2070. Maybe! Seeing that there's no actual way to verify the data they share. Which is almost none.While the other private sector projects, that I mentioned above, may show results by 2025 to 2030, tops.So I'd say that nuclear fusion, may be closer, than most people believe it to be.But until something is actually made available, we won't know for sure.Although it's good to know that others are working on the problems.

One suThe Near Future of Nuclear Fusion –Practical fusion will always be 50+ years ago (not 50 years away)Mankind came into possession of a practical way of generating energy from fusion over 50 years ago with the Ivy-Mike nuclear test that produced fusion energy from pure Deuterium via DD fusion. Practical fusion will always be 50+ years ago (not 50 years away). Today, there are smaller pure fusion devices designed to make clean energy (not blast effects) from pure DD fusion of Deuterium separated from sea water. One such design is called mini-Mike, which produces a small predictable controlled energy yield of 250 GJ.Note: Deuterium separated from sea water is totally non-radioactive and fusion of this fuel produces only totally non-radioactive nuclear waste (helium).The energy needed to ignite an inertially confined thermonuclear fusion reaction in liquid (or solid) deuterium-tritium (DT) is not that large; it is on the order of not more than 20 MJ or about the same amount ofThe problem is that this energy must be compressed in space (focused down to an area less than a 2 mm) and in time (to less than 3 nanoseconds).While it is common to consider D-T fusion when making comparisons in fission versus fusion arguments, in a long term perspective it is probably better to use D-D fusion to represent the fusion case.D-D fusion is cheaper and more long term sustainable than D-T fusion (there is at present only enough worldwide supply of Tritium to keep a 1 GWe D-T fusion power plant fueled and running for 2 months while there is enough Deuterium in the world’s oceans, 4.6 x 10^13 metric tons, to supply all of the earth’s need for power at a 17 TW level for 29 billion years).D-D fusion is also more energetic by weight of fuel than D-T fusion when all fusion reactions including side-chains go to completion. Of all nuclear reactions (fission or fusion) – D-D fusion of pure Deuterium separated from sea water produces the highest energy yield per kilogram of fuel consumed.It is to be regretted that D-D fusion is slightly more complex than D-T fusion and produces energy through four reactions instead of one reaction like D-T. The additional complexity of four versus one reaction may tend to put off science writers and commentators – so DT fusion routinely gets more coverage in the popular press. In a longer term perspective, it is probable that D-D and p-B11 fusion will be of greater overall historical significance and will in the future produce a large portion of future energy required to power our world.The four D-D fusion reactions (and the net effect reaction):D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeVThe net effect of these four fusion reactions taken together is:The energy output that results from all four D-D fusion reactions is 3.439248 x 10^8 MJ/kg.

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but it really isn’t. Even in the core of the sun, fusion generates only a small amount of net heat. A cubic metre of the sun’s fusing core only generates around 275 watts. That’s less energy output than we give off as body heat for an equivalent volume. The reason why the sun is so hot is because there are hundreds of thousands of miles of insulation (in the form of hot gas contained by gravity) around this heating centre.There’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), and then we have to extract sensible energy without causing the whole reaction to stall and still end up with enough energy to outweigh the inevitable energy losses.I hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be.
