Religion is not for the individuals but for the society. It is the mortar which binds the individual bricks into a solid structure. Remove the religion, and all you have is a heap of individual, atomized bricks.Religion is the foundation of the society. It creates the value basis, the ethical concepts, the trust upon which the society is built. You cannot build a society without religion and concepts of metaphysics. And this is the reason why USSR considered anti-religious work in the Western world on primary importance; it would undermine and collapse their societies.It doesn’t matter if the religion is bull$hit or not. What matters is its value basis, its sets of ethics, itsNote also thatThere are no such things as “universal human ethics”, “common human values” or “objective human rights”. The concept of natural law or natural justice is bull$hit. They are always religion and culturally dependent. And the one with hegemony can press them upon others. We have the concept of human rights solely because Christian culture is the one with hegemony. Should Christianity lose that hegemony,Why those things are so important? Why is religion the foundation of civilization? BecauseAll the ancient cultures were based on slavery and slave owning society. Warfare was ubiquitous and the only energy available was muscle power of slaves and animals.It required a religion to make difference.It is true both Greeks and Romans developed sophisticated technology and were on the verge of technological revolution. It never come into anything. The technology remained merely as interesting toys and neat gadgets. Slaves did the work, not machines. It was slaves who built the Roman temples, buildings, insulae, walls, amphitheatres.A slave-owning society will never develop a middle class with purchasing power. A slave-owning society will always remain as a despotism with bazaar economy. Its philosophy will always remain as the upper class pastime. And all slave owning societies are bound to remain in dirt poverty with a filthy rich upper class. Moreover, slavery will lead to Dutch Disease to the society.There wereBuddhism was embraced in China. So why didn’t China rise as the dominant state?The reason is twofold.Christianity got Western world rid of slavery. It meantChristianity also enforced MonogamyOkay. It is the 11th century. The Barbarian incursions are over, the Vikings have been pacified and Christianized, the Magyars have been pacified and Christianized, and the endemic wars of the petty nobles have been ended. All ingredients of rise are there.Mind youDumb, lazy and slovenlyThe trade meant cultures were aware of each other, new ideas spred quickly, and it meant competition. Nobody wanted to get conquered nor colonized nor impoverished. New technologies were adopted real quick.It’s the 11th century. There are five candidates for the dominant culture for future: Western, Eastern Roman (Byzantine), Islamic, Indian and Chinese. Why did the Western prevail?The Eastern Roman sphere was under continuous attacks and warfare. It simply was threatened everywhere. The very location of Constantinople, which was excellent for the trade and defence, made the Empire also precarious and prone to attacks. Moreover, Orthodox Christianity is aThe Islamic cultural sphere flourished for a time, went bankrupt and collapsed into a slovenly slave-owning culture with Dark Ages mindset. It was like a soufflé; expanded and then collapsed. Islam as religion creates a horribly stagnant society with the mindset of fatalism and slovenliness (insallah mentality). It also condones slavery and polygamy and treats women as cattle. You cannot build any kind of social or societal trust upon such values. Each time a Islamic sultan died, the society collapsed in a civil war with the various princes from different mothers killing each other and last remaining becoming the sultan. Islamic societies’ upper class was wealthy - filthy rich - butInterestingly, the direction of international migrations indicate which cultures are good and which are bad. The international migration direct form bad cultures to good. Many fellahs migrated to Kingdom of Jerusalem - because it was Feudal state. In Feudalism every human being has his place, his rights and his responsibilities codified in the law - not just religious law and whim of the despot. Feudalism was far more developed societal model than Despotism.Why not India? Same reason why not the Eastern Roman. It was threatened and needed to fight. Moreover, Hinduism never also distinguished between philosophy and mysticism. While Indians have always been brilliant mathematicians, they never combined mathematics with physics and engineering. While Indians did not practise slavery, the caste system proved a hurdle for any societal development and social justice.Why not China? Because of the pleasant climate, the introversion and the religion. The Chinese neither never distinguished between philosophy and mysticism. While the Chinese were excellent engineers, they did not develop the scientific method.While Europe was in the 11th century the poorest of the five, it had the best ingredients to become dominant.Cue the Crusades. The Ferengi conquer Outremer and become lords there. It did not take a long time to notice the Arabs had learned the Roman knowledge and civilization, and that they had something the Franks could learn. So all knowledgeable Franks learned eagerly Arabic and studied stuff like astronomy, medicine and mathematics. Soon the Franks had absorbed everything the Arabs could offer.Conversely, few Arabs bothered to learn Latin and study law and society. They had no need to study Roman law and justice, because they had sharia and sultan’s whim. They saw no need to study Feudalism and Proto-Capitalism, because they had Despotism. And they had no need to build windmills and other follies because they had enough slaves to grind the quernstones.The new knowledge permeates Europe and is combined with a new cheap writing medium, paper. The result is immediate spread of literacy everywhere. And the rise of Scholasticism in the Church. The philosophers see no contradiction with religion and science. They see there is no contradiction with Christian religion and Aristotelian philosophy either. They invent the scientific method. Cistercian monks begin to develop technology on basis of that knowledge. Soon some unnamed cleric discovers mathematics is the mother tongue of God, and combines mathematics with science and engineering.Cue new technology, mathematics and philosophy. The Italian city states are very much involved in trade, and they invent joint-stock corporation, company travels, insurance, stock market, cheque and derivatives.Renaissance comes. The old writings, art, philosophical works and other stuff of antiquity are rediscovered. They are quickly merged in the existing philosophy and lifestyle with the nastier aspects, like hedonism and sexual lechery, being discarded. The life is no more merely prelude for the afterlife nor slavish obedience to sharia or halakha, but something to be lived to the fullest.Cue the 15th century and climate change. Everything turns cold. Europe becomes even nastier than ever. There is need to find new land lest there would be need to take things with force and wage wars. TheWithin two centuries, Europeans travel around the world and map the whole world. While the Chinese certainly had seaworthy ships and they could have made it, it was the horrible etatism and the clam-like introvertness which prevented them to take the initiative. Two whole new continents - North and South Americas - are found and colonized.Cue the Reformation. After one century of Christians killing each other for minuscule and stupid reasons, everyone thinks it is a bad idea.Reformation leads to Protestantism and Protestant ethics. Including the famous Protestant Work Ethics.This all has a positive feedback on everything - development develops development. Capitalism grinds more capitals, which are invested and not frittered away. Justice state prevents those possessing the violence potential and weapons from simply robbing the capitals away from those who own them. Which enables more studies and learning things. Christianity encourages curiosity and research of the existing universe and nature. Scientific method leads to new discoveries which lead into new inventions. New technology is developed. Thomas Newcomen inventsThe rest is history. This is the short story why it is the Europe and Western culture so advanced, so developed and so dominant. Other cultures have flourished only by adopting and adapting to the Western values, the Western mindset and the Western philosophy - those who have refused, have remained as undeveloped jerkwaters. It is not technology nor science, but the underlying set of values.EDIT: Note that I am an INTJ and as such, immune to appeal on emotions.

Image from WikipediaNow you can see in the map above how this coherent group of languages known as Bantu came to spread in vast areas of the Central, Eastern and Southern Africa which they occupied in a long and dramatic process of migration and settlement epic between 1000 BCE to the first centuries CE with farming, political and cultural organization and robust metallurgy industry being their main advantage on the peoples they encountered, subjugated or mixed with.Now there is much confusion between the Bantu and Niger—Congo in terminology as Bantu is often erroneously used as a synonym for Niger-Congo but as stated above THIS IS NOT THE CASE. So I will assume that the real question is: “Is Niger—Congo Africa overall more advanced…?”So coming to “Pygmy Africa” …well it does not exist ANY nation where the so called ”Pygmy Peoples” form the majority of the population. Historically they were centered mainly in the Congo River Basin, but when the Bantu Migration came to that region they became gradually isolated and pushed in increasingly inaccessible forests and or mixed with the Bantu Peoples…many now speak some of the various Bantu languages of their neighbors…to summarize as they have been overtaken by the expanding Bantu populations, there is no “Pygmy Africa” to compare to others…African Pygmies in the Congo Basin.

The Hadza of Eastern Africa (Tanzania) are in the same situation, so all these countries are inhabited mainly by (Niger-Congo) Bantu native speakers.

They are a major branch of the Afroasiatic Family of Languages concentrated in the historical very important Horn of Africa and Nile Valley regionsCushitic Languages (dark brown) within other Afroasiatic Languages (light brown)So Cushitic languages are the ones centered in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Somalia and part of Sudan and marginally northern Kenya. These are areas of Africa where some of the most illustrious civilizations and empires arose. We can take Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, Djibouti as Cushitic Africa even if portion of other neighboring countries (notably Egypt, Sudan and Kenya) have substantial minorities inside their borders. They historically gave birth to well known ancient civilizations like Nubia (Kush, Kerma and Macuria among others) and Axum for example which are considered very well even beyond African continent.So considering actual development statistic there is no doubt that the most developed countries in Africa are Niger-Congo majority countries like Gabon, Ghana, Botswana, South Africa, Eswatini, Nigeria, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Senegal among others along with less populated and tiny states like Seychelles, Sao Tome and Principe and Cape Verde.So the short answer is yes, Niger-Congo Africa is overall a developed area even if it contains also very underdeveloped countries, only Mediterranean Africa has countries who can withstand the development of several Niger-Congo ones.",0 followers,Claire Jordan,562,45.6K,295.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-and-when-will-advanced-technology-benefit-the-poorest-people-of-our-planet
17,"Yes and No, yes because most Bantu people live in Southern Africa which happens to be more developed than most other parts of Africa.But then No because all this development and being advanced was not truly brought by us we happened to be colonised by the brits and germans so we developed because they wanted to have stable colonise etc. Since it was not work of our own doing it cannot be said that Bantu Africa is more developed than any other group.","6,159 followers",Anthony M Anderson,5.7K,2.9K,18.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-and-when-will-advanced-technology-benefit-the-poorest-people-of-our-planet
18,"First of all, all those Africas don't exist and you should add Wakanda to the list. They are pre colonial groupings. All those communities are part of one or more modern African nations, today.Their environments were very different. Nilots were great fishermen that settled along rivers and lakes. Bantus were exceptional farmers, like Hobbits but much taller. Cushites were raiders that roamed semi-arid Africa. Khoi-San is a group of desert folk that adopted to the harsh environment quite impressively.They all deserve acknowledgement for being them.","115,111 followers",Daveed Phoenix,3.3K,9.9K,160.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-and-when-will-advanced-technology-benefit-the-poorest-people-of-our-planet

20,"If you are referring to IT communications then Africa does utilise the latest gadgets and software.With regards to agriculture I'm glad we are not extensively experimenting with GMO's and animal hormones like first world countries.Regarding energy, thankfully we are backwards and we have not embraced nuclear power. Slowly most of the energy will be green.There is still a long way to go with recycling, however, most countries are embracing it and doing away with plastic so we don't end up with our own ’Pacific Garbage Patch’.",80 followers,Lunga Ngcobo,700,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-and-when-will-advanced-technology-benefit-the-poorest-people-of-our-planet
