The beach was added there decades ago by terraforming machines. There was quite a fight as to how to distribute land on Mars between countries, but in the end, it was figured out, though not everybody was happy about it.

There was quite a fight as to how to distribute land on Mars between countries, but in the end, it was figured out, though not everybody was happy about it. You see the world through contacts that enhance your eyesight to the point where you can see stars through the day.You were one of the first to settle in Mars. NASA (now called ESEO, the Earth Space Exploration Organization) put the first person on mars in 2031, and an experimental settlement was put on Mars in 2040. You came in 2050, when you were 20. By then thousands had started to settle on Mars. Now Mars has millions of people living on it.It’s been terraformed be livable. Scientist tactically nuked the poles of Mars to make the environment more favorable to humans. Now humanity has better techniques and finetuned the initial problems with the nukes.You go inside to eat lunch. You fire up the ole’ 3-D printer and make some food. You Ingest some greenish bread. Well, it’s not really bread. It’s actually is packed 100% full of nutrients you need for your day, packed into a flavor. That flavor’s called Leaf, though you’ve eaten leaves and you can verify this taste nothing like leaves. You’re informed that the bread has provided 25% of the estimated nutrition needed for your day.Sensors placed in your body have informed you of this. 3-D printing has made manufacturing capabilities much higher, and everyone can print the things they need. This led to big copyright problems, as nearly anybody could copy a design. Now complex codes are sold to you that are set to be automatically erased after you’ve printed what you were sent. However, people still pirate goods like this. There’s also been significantly increased technological progress in nearly every field, as people can set algorithms to print and test different variations of things to determine effectiveness.Unfortunately, you’re too old to have been in the era of genetic engineering, at 99 years old. Genetic engineering has mostly gotten rid of genetic diseases and improved humanity. In addition, they’ve made some specific improvements that make it easier to live on Mars. The environment isn’t perfect, but they’ve made it so the air is breathable. However, genetic engineering did have its defects. Some took to it too quickly, and their children had problems that were extremely difficult or impossible to fix. Really, more testing needed to have been done. Genetic engineering for purposes other than removing diseases became truly safe and effective around 2060.People are constantly testing new genetic things to make things easier. However, they’ve found for the most part, the human body is not too far from its limits. Attempting to make people ‘superhuman’ isn’t possible. Many people wanted to make their child highly athletic or smart, but technology that can add those abilities after birth (such as a cybernetic addition to your brain, and an exoskeleton) have made those abilities of genetic engineering mostly unused.You remember going to school and having to memorize things. By now, that’s unheard of. Research now over a century old had already shown in theory how to add or subtract memories. Once people realized the potential of this, massive amounts of funds were poured Through this, memories could be subtracted or implanted into people. This had massive ethical considerations that humanity is still going through. However, it has also made school oriented towards skills and non-implantable things such as creativity.You decide to your work. You work as a technical overseer for the food systems on Mars. Food is now grown in stations that orbit around planets. It was open space that also grew food better, and that, combined with genetic engineering, has made food so cheap it’s now provided by the government for a small fee. It wasn’t on purpose; food was just so inexpensive to make that anything sold on food was nearly 100% profit. This meant that price wars drove down the cost of food so low that everyone got out of the business.AI and automation do most of the growing and adjusting. You’re just there to make sure nothing goes wrong.You remember in your youth about how people thought AI might take over. However, AI are now just another weapon of war, and along with many other weapons, have made nuclear bombs an insignificant and useless form of combat. Though some AI did combat humans, we figured out that through a combination of increasing the intelligence capacity of the human brain via brain implants and using your own AI to fight the AI, the fight was manageable. Humanity’s creativity also seemed to always keep it a step ahead of AI.You hop in a pod powered by an antimatter engine. You remember the days when they used nuclear fusion generators, and all the hype about how they were the future. It took longer than expected, but Anti-Matter Engines eventually became viable. However, while nuclear fusion was a clear step up in power level, antimatter is even more powerful. You get to work very quickly, within seconds.Food doesn’t quite look the same anymore. It’s grown nearly as much for taste and familiarity as anything else. While you can 3-D print food that has all the nutrition you need and taste decent, there’s still something about natural (or semi-natural, as all these plants have been genetically engineered) food.You pop on a helmet. It further enhances your vision, however it’s mostly for show. It is a pretty awesome-looking helmet. From here, you ‘keep an eye on’ what’s going on while analyzing what’s going on in the world. Memories have been implanted in you showing the days news, decided through an algorithm determining what your interest are. It’s a running joke that no matter how advanced the algorithms become, they’ll never be able to figure out your interests effectively.Your employer (the government of New Italy) could look at your eye movement to determine whether you’re paying attention to work, but it’s generally understood that this job doesn’t need very much attention. As long as something doesn’t go wrong (which, due to AI improvements, it nearly never does), you’ll be fine. But you still wear the helmet, just in case.You pass time on the internet. Of all the things in the world since your birth, the internet has changed the least. You still watch videos (though they’re much more immersive, and can even factor in smell and touch) and play videogames (which are again, more immersive). Trends seem to flip between an interest in very old times and the future.E-Sports are now the predominant sport, with all other sports now being populated by robots that are controlled by humans. Videogames are also now a form of education, as researchers have figured out how to maximize the educational benefits of videogames.No alien life has been found, even with probes sent to nearby solar systems and plans to settle in Alpha Centauri. People are starting to believe it just doesn’t exist, though many still hold to belief alien life is out there.The Solar System has now been mostly settled. There’s even life over on Pluto, though no amount of terraforming or technology can stop it from being a somewhat unpleasant place to live. Mostly researchers and explorers live there.You consider eating dinner on Jupiter, above the great storm. It’s now a solar park, and many tourist attractions have been set up around it. However, you decide to go home and eat instead. You watch a really retro movie (Star Wars XXII: The Phantom Strikes Back) and then get into your sleep chamber that is specifically designed to help you sleep, though sometimes it still seems ineffective. And you go to sleep, considering just how boring and uneventful your day has been.",0 followers,Brian Molinari,1.2K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-do-we-expect-will-happen-in-one-hundred-years
2,"It’s 8:30 A.M. and the nano-alarm connected to my nervous system wakes me up. Time to go to work.

Anyway, it’s not like there is much light to let in; the city where I live is overpopulated and my apartment is part of a building among hundreds of buildings in this area.I take a hyper-fast shower (the bathroom system scans me to adapt the flow of water to my body shape), and then I go down to the kitchen. With a food printer, I prepare a molecular shake. Its flavor is horrible and its appearance is tasteless, but it contains the exact amount of proteins, carbohydrates and minerals that I need for the day.I’m planning to buy a food teleporter, to receive food instantly over long distances using quantum teleportation. However, the device is expensive and my jobs don’t allow me many luxuries. I already spent the credits of this month by paying for my nephews’ space travel, but I’m sure the teleporter will be mine next month.Two minutes to 9 A.M. and I’m already on my way to my first job on the day. To do this, I travel aboard a sonic pod. It’s similar to what you know as Hyperloop, a passenger capsule that moves inside a tube at high speeds. I could travel faster in an Oober-ship (flying car), but sonic pods are cheaper.Coincidentally, I work at a sonic pods company, specifically controlling the technical aspects of such transportation. For example, I monitor the boarding and destination of passengers, the speed of the capsules, and of course, that no capsule collides with another. All my tasks are strongly backed by an artificial intelligence, so the job is quite boring. But hey, at least I have free lunch at the break.My workday at this job ends at 3 P.M., and I immediately get on another sonic pod to go to my second job. There, I work as a programmer and update the software of delivery robots and drones. Today’s tasks have been quite simple, except for a robot that lacks some important code lines I can’t rewrite. So I guess I’ll turn it off and wait to find the solution at home.At 7 P.M. I finish working and return to my building through the same blessed tube. While I’m arriving at my apartment I see that on the same block another new edifice is being built. That wasn’t there this morning, but it’s understandable. All buildings, including skyscrapers, are 3D printed on-site nowadays. “Once at home, I take another shower to get rid of the air contaminants existing in my workplace. While eating condensed spaghetti with Martian spices (courtesy of my good old food printer), I spend some time watching the news in my update center.The huge holographic screen on the wall is showing CNNN (Cosmic News Node-Network). Among the news, an experiment to achieve immortality went wrong and a lethal virus escaped, an old mine in Ceres reopens tomorrow, and spaceships with antimatter engines reached a new speed record. Oh, and Thursday marks 50 years sinceSince we’re talking about SpaceBook, I decide to connect to the virtual world. By this epoch, everyone has a cybernetic interface connected to their nervous system, which allows access to a “second world” online. On the one hand, you can play any game or watch any movie and feel thatOn the other hand, SpaceBook is a virtual universe where you can physically meet anyone, anywhere in the world – at least that’s how it feels. The developers are planning to expand SpaceBook, so that people living on the Moon and Mars will also be able to connect in the near future.After being connected for about three hours and catching up with my contacts, I leave the “pocket life,” as I like to call it. There are people who spend much more time inside it, but I don’t care that much. Now that I have prepared my clothes and tools for tomorrow, I accessThere are some other activities that I perform in my daily routine, but I hope this gives you an idea of the lifestyle in my times.

3,"I once wrote about this for my English class. Not exactly 100 years, just sometime in the future.I imagined, with people's obsession over equality these days and advanced technology, it will turned into a dystopian kind of world.People were heavily controlled and monitored by the government.

Upon graduation, they will be assigned to a specific job decided by the government. Where you would be relocted, how much you would be pay, what is your position, everything was up to the government. Tax would be reduced from your wage automatically.*The talent test would determine what type of intelligence they have, maybe out of those 8.To avoid jealousy, which is the most primitive emotion of human, when a teenager reached adulthood, they would go under the knife to fix their faces. There were 10 types of faces they could choose from. Thus, there would be 10 types of beauty only. Your choice was permanent.For marriage, when and with who would be chosen by the government (or super computer) as well. To balance it, they would take your life background into consideration and they would match you to your 'soulmate’. Mating would be artificial, and you would have the 'freedom' to choose your child's gender (male/female). Obviously, your choice need to be approved by the government.You could apply for paid vacation twice a year as a reward of your 'diligence’. The government would gave you options for your destination, all of those place were developed and managed by the government.The good thing is, the citizen didn't have to pay for basic needs like housing, tuition and transportation. But that's probably all. Even food and clothes were controlled by the government.I forgot to mention that, the people working in the government were chosen by the super computer. Additionally, they've had tackled issues such as air pollution, water pollution etc, and there were groups of people who would be assigned for planting trees, gardening, farming etc. There were still natural resources, but only the government had access to mine and process them. Animals would be cared and protected by the government, live stock too.Some people said it's scary to have no freedom at all, but other people told me that they would rather have everything decided and life without worry.I think this kind of future is indeed terrifying. It's not unrealistic, as we already able to manipulate our bodies (plastic surgery, insemination, sex selection for your baby etc). And you've probably heard of communism, right? However, I can also see why some people would welcome this kind of future.I might one day turn this story into a novel, when I have the chance.

How else can you just say “computer” at any time and get a response, if it’s not always listening to you?It’s the same with public security cameras and face recognition technology. It’s only a matter of time, if not already possible, that just walking down the street could allow the cops to see every single picture you’ve ever been in online, just by doing a face match-up. That includes “private” photos you sent to someone. It’s naive for someone who sends “private” photos to think they are truly private.Everything you send gets stored somewhere for some amount of time. People who want to, and know how to, can access those things if they wanted to. Period.They’re already trying to write laws that will allow the police to access records from devices like Amazon Echo. In the near future, whenever a crime is committed, there’s a good chance that there’s a recording—either audio or video—of it, if you just look hard enough for it.A loss of privacy and anonymity will be an accepted fact of life, like pollution and taxes.

This is going to change during the next five years.”To keep pace with consumer interest and leverage the opportunities of immersive technologies, organizations must address three main challenges in AR and VR hardware and technology.Challenge No. 1: 3D design interfaceThe biggest barrier to wide adoption of immersive technologies is the lack of good user experience design. 3D interface design is difficult and expensive, and there are few people with the necessary design skills to overcome these issues.The main goal of user experience design is to get users to just don their HMD and go to work. However, this is not solely a design challenge. Challenges such as eye strain and sound disorientation need to be overcome. Nobody wants to buy a device or an experience that gives you a headache.Challenge No. 2: VR is missing two key technology elements for mass adoptionAlthough VR is already available to consumers through devices such as HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, Sony PlayStation VR or Samsung Gear VR, it has still not moved beyond a niche market. To enter the mainstream, VR hardware needs to incorporate two important features: convenience and control.Convenience means both availability and access. Availability means there must be a lot of choices, while accessibility is tied to cost and functionality, meaning the hardware and underlying technology must be easy to use and available at an affordable price point. We expect that smartphone and mobile VR will offer an adequate experience at an affordable price that will complement the more high-end HMDs.Control means agency. At the moment, not all VR devices offer the immersive experience the user expects. There are still many challenges with gesture and movement control.Challenge No. 3: Smartphone competitionDespite user-experience limitations, smartphone convenience and developer familiarity means that smartphone AR will establish an early strong foothold in the market. The hardware is already widespread and has a strong developer base.A handheld smartphone AR can deliver good experiences today, but will prove inconvenient moving forward. Users do not want to locate their phone and then hold it at eye height for extended periods of time. A hands-free AR HMD experience will make the experience much more comfortable, and experts predict that AR HMDs will come to market in significant volumes only after 2020.As vendors refine HMD technology, consumers will be their target, but that won’t happen until they refine and advance their designsAR in the enterprise, however, will see some early successes and gain traction more quickly than general consumer AR. These solutions will be purpose-built to address a business need such as the ability to draw on a screen or moving image during a remote meeting or presentation, architectural walkthroughs, or be used in controlled environments where devices need industrial certification or device resilience.These use-specific HMDs will be band-aid solutions that will service limited purposes, or will be limited to niche circumstances. As vendors refine HMD technology, consumers will be their target, but that won’t happen until they refine and advance their designs at the enterprise level first.","6,473 followers",Michael Soareverix,28.3K,373,6.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-do-we-expect-will-happen-in-one-hundred-years
19,"When do you think the smartphone era will end, and why?Clearly, they have so many advantages that we won’t willingly give them up unless they’re replaced with something even more useful.It won’t be very long before they start embedding chips that we can control with our thoughts. I guess that when that happens, smart phones will start to look kind of old.",UNKNOWN,Ernest W. Adams,12.5K,44.2K,248.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-do-we-expect-will-happen-in-one-hundred-years
20,"It is a futuristic question, but let me try to answer it -A) Wave 1 (2017–2018) - The first wave of transformation is already happening. Augumented Reality (AR) will soon become a central aspect of smartphone applications (apps make the phone ""smart""). For example - Navigation and tracking would be transformed through AR as opposed to the traditional ways of using the maps applications.B) Wave 2 (2018–2020) - The form factor of smartphones would change. With foldable screens already available - it is a matter of time when foldable phones would be available in the market - making it easy for coIt is a futuristic question, but let me try to answer it -A) Wave 1 (2017–2018) - The first wave of transformation is already happening.

With foldable screens already available - it is a matter of time when foldable phones would be available in the market - making it easy for consumers.Edit on 24/3/2019 - Foldable smartphones have been announced in 2019 as predicted. See link for more details -C) Wave 3 (2020–2025) - Multiple form factors will become available and would eventually replace the way we know the phone today. A smartphone would no longer look like a phone. Wearable glasses, watches, and even Virtual Reality (VR) devices would become ubiquitous. It will be difficult to completely replace the ""phone"" due to our conditioning - but slowly the usage of the phone would get replaced by wearables.D) Wave-4 (2025–2035) - The phone will eventually shrink and become an accessory (dumb phone) to our primary wearable devices. It will be used mostly to project the screen on surfaces (holograms and AR). The primary use case would be to consume content and to use the phone for using business applications. For example, the holograms would project themselves such as screens to play videos, or as a projected laptop screen and logical keyboard for typing, or even as a large screen to give presentations. Other use cases would be to use the phone as a digital wallet for initiating Point of Sale (PoS) payments.E) Wave-5 (2035–2050): The ""phone"" will become "" super smart"". By this time, the wearable devices would have replaced the phone completely and will be equipped with Artifical General Intelligence (AGI) and not just normal AI. The processing needed for AGI will be partially subsumed in chipsets of the wearables, while the rest of the processing will be in the cloud. The phone would no longer be just a communications device which provides us with apps. It will embibe our persona, and would become an alter-ego - helping us to perform daily tasks, and even talk to people on our behalf, and acting as our personal assistant.Just my two cents. Technology always surprises us, and it remains to be seen what happens in the future.","220,598 followers",Franklin Veaux,587,47.3K,782.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-do-we-expect-will-happen-in-one-hundred-years

But they were the most numerous and vocal activists in favor of them, much inspired by Martin Luther King and Gandhi. 1965 to 1975 was the critical period, and as I said, they achieved most of their aims. If you can live with your partner without being married, or wear a T-shirt and jeans to work, thank the hippies.Judging by the snide tone of many other answers to this question, a lot of Quora readers have only learned about the free love, drugs, and other social experiments the hippies tried. Most of these were abandoned as they got older because they weren't really compatible with raising a family.","58,988 followers",Michael Wolfe,504,2K,17.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-do-we-expect-will-happen-in-one-hundred-years
