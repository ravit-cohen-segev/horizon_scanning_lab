The thing is we have to take a look at the innards of a country to really know whether or not you are truly developed. That Chinese are so obsessed with portraying the facade that they are technologically advanced and ahead is actually an indication that they have not fully developed yet. Because fully developed countries have no need to show off things like that. Everyone knows they are developed.For example, here is San Francisco:Look, not many skyscrapers right? And look at those old cable cars going around! That must mean they are undeveloped right? Nope. Everyone knows San Francisco is a developed city. That’s why it has no need to show off with luxury skyscrapers and such things.Or how about Florence, Italy?Again, no skyscrapers here. But everyone knows it’s a developed city and Italy is a developed country.My point is, you have got to look at the people and the innards of a country to truly know if they are developed.This is the true face of China:You have got to look at the average person. Does the average Chinese have good access to healthcare (which is ranked near the bottom in WHO rankings btw)? Can they drink tap water safely? Do they have access to quality food? Do all have access to electricity or paved roads or a quality education? The answer is: probably, yes, if you are living in the rich east coast provinces of Jiangsu or Zhejiang or Guangdong- but not if you are living in say - Xinjiang or Gansu or Tibet. China’s wealth is not spread equally, neither is it developed equally. Even though the CCP has developed China quite fast - there is still a lot of work to be done making sure *every Chinese* have equal access to everything.And then you got to look at the attitude of the people. When I was in China I found that you really got to look out for who you trust, because there is a lot of scams going on all the time. You never know what is real, what is fake, what is real price of anything. Why do these scams exist? Because people have to be desperate to make money that’s why.Why are people desperate to make money? Probably because they are not making enough to survive, which is an indication that the country is still developing. You’ll notice that in general, the more developed a country is, the less likely there will be scams. In Korea/Japan/Taiwan, you will not find very many scams. In China and Eastern Europe it’s likely.Another aside I want to note is that Chinese bathrooms don’t contain any toilet paper. Do you know the reason why? It’s because people steal it. Now, in what developed country does this happen? I can’t think of any. Only in a developing country would you need to bring your own toilet paper to the bathroom because there isn’t any there due to fear of people stealing it.I find GDP/capita to be generally a pretty good indicator of how developed a country is. The average GDP/capita (PPP) of China is still around $8k/person. While that is higher than most Asian countries - it’s still below the 4 East Asian tigers + Japan and far from the $62k/person that the USA has.The true measure of a developed society is to observe the people that live in the country and not the appearance of the country itself. Chinese “face” culture is the same. You can just obviously see that China has developed really really fast, and mentality wise people are still harping about luxury products and consumerism - this is where Americans were back in the 50s, 60s and 70s, not now.The biggest consumers of luxury products are Chinese people, not Americans or Europeans. The more developed you are, the less need you have to validate your self worth with materialism. The less desire you have to spend thousands of dollars on your children's schooling just to send them to be educated abroad. The less need to travel to countries like Canada or USA for giving birth so that your child becomes a US or Canadian citizen, or to launder your money by buying up real estate in other countries. Developed countries do not need to do things like that.Thats why you should always pay attention to the old adage -Edit:Of course, Chinese commenters love to bring up the USA. Yes, USA has lots of impoverished areas too; every country has developed areas and undeveloped areas, however my point is that for China there is significantly more undeveloped areas at a higher % compared to the USA. The poverty rate for China is 16% as of 2019 and for USA it is 1.5% as of 2019.

For example, countries currently developing are deploying cell towers and fiber optics rather than copper lines.Also, building new infrastructure in “old” countries is more costly, reflecting the higher cost of removing and renovating existing infrastructure, as well as acquiring private property in gentrified neighborhoods near construction projects.There are political issues as well. In “old” countries, individual property rights tend to have a higher societal value. It is far easier for the political powers in an underdeveloped country to acquire private land for public purposes underThere is also a cost-benefit consideration. If we assume the direct construction-only cost of a six lane freeway (excluding the above considerations) built according to modern standards is about the same regardless of country, and if it is replacing a dirt road, the benefit is a thousand times greater than if it is replacing a substandard 6-lane highway. That makes for a better cost-benefit ratio, so is easier to justify.Let's not forget about labor costs. Well-developed countries tend to demand higher wages for skilled labor than developing countries. This makes it (in spite of how I began the previous paragraph)As for the people themselves, in well developed countries, technology has often been adopted at a slower rate because of incrementalism. Changes come small and slow, so people see little benefit in adopting the latest and greatest whizbang gadget. In the developing country, they get to skip a lot of increments, so go straight from horsecarts to Teslas. Because a single change is so great, the benefit is obvious. They don't have nostalgia for a 5-speed manual transmission, an engine with a manual choke, or 100,000 km engine rebuilds.EDIT:For example, South Korea has a population of 49,039,986 (2014 estimate) in a land area of 96,920 square kilometers, for a density of about 506 people/km^2Large cities like Los Angeles, New York, and Houston have well-developed infrastructure. There are no six-lane highways, international airports, or commuter rail lines in Harney County — but the transportation infrastructure could still be considered excellent for the needs of the local population. The main roads aren’t primitive.Even so, many rural areas in the United States still lack high-speed Internet access. Installing a fiber infrastructure in places where customers may be a hundred kilometers apart becomes very expensive for those customers and unattractive for providers because it is difficult to recoup the cost of construction through the sale of service under a pure free-market system.It’s somewhat frustrating for me, because I live only 20 miles away from Portland, Oregon, I live within sneezing distance of several neighbors, and I can’t get Internet access faster than 6.5 Mbps DSL. My cousin who lives in the middle of the North Dakota prairie, 50 miles from the nearest city and a mile from the nearest neighbor, has gigabit fiber optic Internet service.That’s kind of a result of developed vs. underdeveloped areas, as I discussed before. The DSL where I live had been available for a couple of decades. Where my cousin lives, there was no Internet access at all until a couple of years ago; since the utilities didn’t have to support a legacy system, they could deploy the latest technology. Because of Federal (central government) programs to bring services to “underserved and unserved” areas, the taxpayers of the entire United States subsidized the construction of infrastructure for areas such as the Dakota prairie. Since I can get something that qualifies as “high speed Internet access,” my area doesn’t qualify for those same programs.It’s the same sort of program that brought electricity to rural areas in the 1940s, and telephone service in the 1960s. Because it didn’t make good financial sense for private industry to install the infrastructure without government help (as would be the case in a true, free-market capitalist economy), government funded programs subsidized that infrastructure construction.",1 follower,Dawei Chen,712,141,2.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Will-developed-countries-have-to-upgrade-their-infrastructures-for-future-technologies

This is also about power.The power to control and analyse what people do online. They can see what everyone is doing online.Everyone - Everything - OnlineBut here’s one problem for America. The best 5G technology available is with a Chinese company called Huawei. You must have heard of them getting banned by the USA on the accounts of privacy issues.(Chinese companies are not trustworthy in terms of consumer privacy and if Huwaei becomes a leading provider of 5G technology then they can spy on everyone.—Allegations against Huawei not by me. But what about Facebook and others who are resisting data localisation in India?!)Anyway, America is developing its own 5G but China’s 5G is so far ahead. And Many news articles came out claiming that America has already lost the 5G battle.What the US did then, banned Huawei which of course caused a Domino effect for other Chinese companies.On the other hand, AT&T just updated iPhones with the “Fake 5G E icon” by replacing the 4G LTE icon.Now, this is considered a “What China is doing now?
