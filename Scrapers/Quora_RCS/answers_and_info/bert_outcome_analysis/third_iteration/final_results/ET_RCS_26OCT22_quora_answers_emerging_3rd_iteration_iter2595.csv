For example, Orwell did it withWakanda is supposed to be an African nation that has maintained a Zulu warlike ethos, but has profited from the discovery of its resources instead of them being stolen by white colonists, as much of colonial Africa has. It allows us to see a noble black race that has done well.They have miraculously capitalized without access to capital. They have become a modern developed country without trade. It does not make sense. But there it is. They have not had to compromise nor have they sold their special vibranium, which is both a power source and a raw material. Again, it is magic hokum. As is their fighting squads of kickboxing martial artists with super weapons that they havent sold to make money.It allows us to see a proud and accomplished black people, noble and admirable, peaceful yet extremely fierce in battle. Their special power comes from a raw material, and from a technical prowess that is imagined but not explained. How did they get that without investment? Without universities? And how did they do it without industry? Trade? Where did this come from,So, the Zulu ethos is superimposed on a success story. It's the best of all worlds for blacks. What they might have become if we had not colonized.Its fantasy and it is never explained. As opposed to America, where we want blacks to succeed and thrive along with us, we see a black monoculture as successful as white America, and it works for his social commentary that blacks are as smart and, given different circumtances, perhaps better than white America.In an age of Obama, it served a political purpose for Hollywood to do it, just as",93 followers,Juan Paolo Tarroja,1.7K,562,919.7K,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Wakanda-have-some-primitive-weapons-and-military-tactics-when-they-have-very-advanced-technology
