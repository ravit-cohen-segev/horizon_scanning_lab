Mangalyaan is a very cost effective and aged wine unlike people presume. Most rockets don't have the power for the lift, rather slowly and steadily orbiting satellites following the earth's gravitational and magnetic feild. As most satellites are steadily progressing towards their target, it very difficult to allow any scope of mistake. Each and every incremental orbit is used with minimum force and fuel. Every single movement is monitored to have enough time to make corrections in the orbit it has to move.These have ensured high accuracy and low failure rates. With costs this low and ISRO making profits on its launches on commercial platform. It's quite a ordeal.Every single part of Mangalyaan is made in India and sourced at lowest possible price.

5,"Who can forget that classic scene in 2001? Dave Bowman finds himself in a pod without his helmet, or gloves and has to blow the hatch, to launch himself, from the pod to the Discovery, where he is able to close the airlock, to save himself and deactivate HAL. This scene was filmed before humans walked on the moon.There are a lot of things the movie gets right: There isWho can forget that classic scene in 2001? Dave Bowman finds himself in a pod without his helmet, or gloves and has to blow the hatch, to launch himself, from the pod to the Discovery, where he is able to close the airlock, to save himself and deactivate HAL. This scene was filmed before humans walked on the moon.There are a lot of things the movie gets right: There is no sound in the vacuum. Bowman propels himself towards the very short distance to the Discovery and bounces around a little inside the airlock. More likely this might be less energetic given the small volume of air in the pod. The gas from the pod dissipates rapidly, as it would quickly turn to ice crystals and sublime away.It’s been pointed out that one should exhale before entering space, to prevent ones lungs exploding due to the vacuum. However it’s not clear that Bowman holds his breath. He can be seen tensing before the hatch blows. We also have to imagine his sinuses are already clear. So I will give him the benefit of the doubt that he had the knowledge to do the right thing as a veteran astronaut, just as a scuba diver or submariner would.Could he survive? I would go with yes he could and he could escape unharmed too. Highly unethical experiments by NASA and USAF, in 1965 and 1967, showed that chimpanzees could survive up to 3.5 minutes in near-vacuum conditions, with no apparent cognitive defects, as measured by complex tasks months later. One chimp that was exposed for three minutes, however, showed lasting behavioral changes. Another died shortly after exposure (although it had health problems already), likely due to cardiac arrest. Given that it’s unlikely they remembered to breathe out I would say even if Bowman did not exhale, he could still survive this brief exposure.HAL remains eerily calm throughout, whilst Bowman becomes equally unemotional. In the scene, Bowman’s exposure to vacuum was under 20 seconds, he operated the control to close the hatch, to repressurise in around 10 seconds. One has to imagine that he can’t see, as his eyes are squeezed shut and his eardrums might have popped.

Diamond argues that the gaps in power and technology between human societies originate primarily in environmental differences, which are amplified by various positive feedback loops. When cultural or genetic differences have favored Eurasians (for example, written language or the development among Eurasians of resistance to endemic diseases), he asserts that these advantages occurred because of the influence of geography on societies and cultures (for example, by facilitating commerce and trade between different cultures) and were not inherent in the Eurasian genomes.The crux of the explanation is geography.The geography of Europe strongly encouraged development of boatbuilding & ship building, it had lots of useful deposits of minerals not far from good natural ports. This encouraged trade & shipbuilding and navigation skills. The mountainous terrain of Europe combined with good ports & rivers made small city-states practical which encourages smaller nations that competed in technology more.",27 followers,Ben Reynolds,2.8K,3.8K,8.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-have-countries-that-have-more-advanced-technology-than-India-failed-on-the-Mars-Mission-Is-it-purely-based-on-ISRO-scientists-intelligence

That's not a lot of interaction with other folks with more advanced technology. Contrast that with the Europeans, who were bumping into more advanced neighbors all the time, trading for and co-opting better technology.So, that's more or less the difference.

He woke up one morning with a sore throat and his doctor over bled him. Native people have been using actual medicine for thousands of years.When the Europeans unintentionally brought malaria-laden mosquitos over to South America in the holds of their ships, the Aboriginal people immediately developed a cure for malaria. They used quinine, which is still in use today. Quinine alone saved millions upon millions of lives worldwide.Most medicines today have their roots in Native American medicine. One of the most famous is aspirin. First Nations people taught Europeans how to cure and prevent scurvy. Europeans were taught medicine by the Aboriginal people and wrote it down, and thus ‘discovered’ it.Hunting, camouflage and animal calls, animals scents to draw in the preyRubber, and amalgamized rubberForest management especially sustainable burning for the protection of communitiesCotton clothing, advanced colorsPetroleum jelly3000 varieties of potatoes, and almost as many varieties of corn, (squash, beans, peppers) causing a population boom in Europe as they gained access to the higher nutrient value; this even caused a change in the balance of world powers, a shift from the Mediterranean countries, to Great Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union, the rise of these countries would not have been possible without the New World nutrition and technology‘Modern’ grid pattern for cities and towns. Roman and ancient Greek cities used the grid pattern, but European cities and towns didn’t use it, though there were notable exceptions. When the Europeans settled in America, they used the grid pattern the Native Americans used, as they settled on the townships and cities of the ‘ousted’ Native people. It became the new standard in this ‘new’ land. The common European design layout of cities and towns were rarer in America.The following were used about 1000 years before Europeans, and about 600 years before the Mediterranean countries: ‘zero’, advanced mathematics, astronomy, ‘farmers almanac’, anesthesia for surgery.Some of my other answers are more detailed, but I’m trying to not let my answers get too long and boring. I’m guilty of writing a little too much, sometimes!Update: I can’t believe I put ‘astrology’ instead of ‘astronomy’, lol, it was late by the time I got everyone to bed and I was already exhausted so I didn’t notice, but I fixed it! Ancient South Americans mapped the stars to an incredible level that it took a very long time for the European and Mediterranean countries to catch up to!The potatoes were cultivated more than 4,000 years ago on the Andes mountains. Archeologists found hundreds upon hundreds of little plots of land all over the mountain range. These plots of land were arranged in such a way that they were used to develop crops of potatoes at different heights, different needs for sun, different needs for water, different soils, etc. The Andes mountains contain tropical zones, dry zones, and wet zones. The ancient South American Native people used all the factors you can think of to develop different types of potatoes. Today they grow over 3,800 different types of potatoes, while the US only grows 250 different varieties today.When the Europeans came over, they chose the kinds of potatoes that would grow best in their home countries; Ireland, for example, became most notable for their potatoes, and potatoes enabled people to survive the threat of starvation during the World Wars. My adopted Dutch ‘Opa’ told us stories of the war, and I remember the great respect he had for the humble potato. He tried to teach us how to peel a potato so thin that when you took the peel and bent it between your fingers it wouldn’t ‘snap’. I’m sure many of you who had family in Europe during the war have similar family stories.Corn was developed in like fashion. There was corn that would grow best in desert-like conditions; these were developed to have a much shorter stalk, than corn that is grown in better water and soil conditions. The ancient South American people valued variety. Potatoes and corn came in many different colors, some were developed for fodder, but most were for human consumption. Perhaps this development of the potato and corn enabled and sustained those huge ancient empires we learn about in our history books!Long strand cotton grew in the Americas. In Europe, only short strand cotton was accessible, from India and the Near East, and was only good to be used as padding for chain mail. Long strand cotton from the Americas grew as much as 2 1/2 inches long and could be woven into cloth. After having everything, even your underwear spun from wool it must have been a nice change! Of course, if you were a rich noble, your clothing was woven of silk or linen.There I go again, rambling on and on when I said I wouldn’t, lol, but ancient American history and Native history is so exciting, and undervalued, and quite frankly, not accurately taught. We really aren’t motivated to learn the truth. As European descendants ( I am half First Nations and half European so I owe a debt to each), we are so much more comfortable believing that we came to the Americas, and ‘civilized’ them! I’ve even seen such ridiculous comments as ‘they are lucky we came along to save the Native people from each other. They would have killed each other off’. There’s a lot of denial regarding murderous European history; the millions upon millions murdered by the Germans and the Japanese during the ‘Wars’, or the million of Irish poor starved to death by their own Nobility, when they could have rerouted food to their own people.

Yes that subjective, but what’s not subjective is the Knapp saw Lazar’s diploma from MIT. He was the first, or one of the few, to mention a stable form of element 115. We’ve since created unstable isotopes of that element but it’s likely a stable isotope will be created of it because of where it exists in the periodic table. It’s also interesting that his story has not changed in 30 years. People who fabricate tales will often later add details. He hasn’t.This is of course my personal opinion and there are subjective elements to it. But I encourage you to watch Joe Rogan’s recent interview with him on his podcast which you can find on YouTube. He comes across as very credible. I have a good amount of knowledge of physics and he comes across to me at least as a physicist, or a person who was at one time.He has never tried to make money off his story. George Knapp and others sometimes have had to spend years persuading him to do an interview. He doesn’t like to do interviews. Does that fit the profile of a hoaxter? Why would the government go to such trouble to erase his school and employment records - but miss one small detail such as his name being in the Los Alamos phone directory? Each person has to make his mind up but the things he talks about, like the antigravity propulsion system, matches what Dr. Paul LaViolette describes in his book on antigravity propulsion, written twenty years later.

It's an old latin term which translates to english as “Who Benefits?”For the people that feel Bob Lazar is a greedy, envious, fame whore, who made this unbelievable story up, maybe you should delve further into yourMarital issues, lack of income, frequent visits by “alphabet employees,” going into hiding, all sound like the life of which an introverted man wanted to lead. Not to mention, having his government attempt to erase his past.Unfortunately for them, other people were there. Classmates, who went to school with him, coworkers who performed their job along side him, and government employees who witnessed what he speaks about.It's a multifaceted issue when it comes to Bob Lazar's story. First, the government doesn't like to just dole out information. They let it simmer, and figure out the best way to use it to their advantage. It's usually through fear, which they love to instill in their citizens.The second issue, with such outlandish claims, is the limited minds of most humans. Most can't begin to comprehend anything outside of “this world's” laws of physics, or “earth"" scientific proof. They can't seem to comprehend that when you look through a telescope, you're not absorbing the lens which your body is making contact with. You're getting a glimpse into the infinite. A snapshot of how much we DON'T KNOW ABOUT.I think I have a decent analogy to help our ceilinged thinkers. I'll be sticking with a “only here on earth, where we are the smartest things in existence,” theme. What do you think the response would be, if you handed your cellphone to a person from 1900's New York, and said, “I'm gonna Facetime you from California.”??? Maybe burned at the stake like a witch? No strings, lines, or cables attached. Your “live"" talking face, on a device, engaging through thin air like magic.Think about some of these points before you come to any kind of conclusion. Oh, and before anyone bashes the questioner for misspelling “Lazar,” I sent them an edit notice. As an open minded human, who also makes mistakes, it's what I would've wanted…",0 followers,Jackson Brownlee,9.3K,181,12.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-weren-t-Native-Americans-nearly-as-technologically-advanced-as-Europeans-or-most-other-civilizations-by-the-time-Europeans-discovered-them
21,"Many of us are aware of the unsinkable ship that sunk on its maiden voyage, the Titanic. The ship was guaranteed to be so safe that it was labelled as ‘The Unsinkable’. The manufacturing company said that even God could not sink that ship and yet it did not complete its first journey. Doesn’t that sound a little strange? Till now, we have been told that in 1912, it was the largest ship of that time, the Titanic that hit an iceberg and sank in the Atlantic Ocean.

The ship was guaranteed to be so safe that it was labelled as ‘The Unsinkable’. The manufacturing company said that even God could not sink that ship and yet it did not complete its first journey. Doesn’t that sound a little strange? Till now, we have been told that in 1912, it was the largest ship of that time, the Titanic that hit an iceberg and sank in the Atlantic Ocean. However, there is a very popular conspiracy theory that suggests that the ship that sank on 15th April 1912 was not the Titanic.The Titanic was owned by JP Morgan who also happened to own another ship, the Olympic. Now, the Olympic was very old and required a lot of maintenance to be done. The ship was also in some sort of an accident and the company was in need of a lot of money as well. So JP Morgan devised a cunning plan. Instead of the Titanic, the Olympic was prepared for the voyage, disguised as the Titanic. The name ‘Olympic’ was painted off at the very last moment and the name ‘RMS Titanic’ was freshly inscribed on it. There is also a burnt mark on the ship’s hull. Of course, a newly constructed ship that never went to the seas cannot have it unless it was a used ship.The theory is that JP Morgan, on purpose sank the Olympic which was actually disguised as the Titanic because he knew that would allow him to get a lot of money from the Titanic’s insurance. There was no point in sinking the newly built Titanic when he could sink an old ship that anyway required repairs and maintenance! So he scratched off the paint, swap the names and sink the Olympic. The insurance money was claimed as a result.But it gets worse. Among 2,400 passengers on the so-called Titanic were present all the business competitors of JP Morgan, each one of them! None of them survived. JP Morgan invited them to the maiden voyage of the Titanic but himself cancelled his ticket, just 20 minutes prior to the ship’s departure.There was a guy named James Fenton who worked on the ship and survived the wreck. On his deathbed, his last words were “The Titanic never sank. It was the Olympic.” And people never lie on their deathbeds.",0 followers,Keith Albert,6.3K,602,20M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-weren-t-Native-Americans-nearly-as-technologically-advanced-as-Europeans-or-most-other-civilizations-by-the-time-Europeans-discovered-them

But what they’re hiding has nothing to do with aliens.The facility near Groom Lake, Nevada is a military base where prototypes of new aircraft are tested. The first stealth aircraft, such as Tacit Blue, were tested there.There are quite likely alien organisms in the universe. Getting from one solar system to another is fantasy.

This lead to a big conspiracy surrounding roswell incident and people believed that the US government did recovered a crashed UFO and trying to cover up the incident. Conspiracy theorists and many people believe that UFO wreckage was still been studied and reversed engineered in a top secret military base called Area 51.What is Area 51 and why its related to Aliens?Area 51 is a top secret, highly classified Military facility in the world run by US airforce in the middle of the Neveda desert. It is also called the Homey Airport, Dreamland, Paradise Ranch. The first mention of Area 51 was in a CIA document after vietnam war. The Area 51 facility is so secret and even the government did not acknowledge its existence till 2013. Area 51 become a synonym to aliens and UFO mainly due to a person named Bob Lazar. In 1989 he claimed that he worked in Area 51, reverse engineering an Alien flying saucer in an underground facility called sector 4 or S4. Although there is no proof backing his claim, Area 51 has become the hot spot of Ufologist, conspiracy theorists and other thrill seekers. People report seeing Ufos on the sky above Area 51 and other unknown phenomenons happens in that place. Area 51 is highly guarded and there are been many warning signes on the road for people try to enter Area 51. There are private contractors nicknamed ‘cammo dudes' who patrol along the perimeter of Area 51, who were authorized to use deady force if necessary if Someone trespassing.Roads leading to Area 51 (image courtesy Google)The only place to get a glimps of Area 51 is from a top of a mountain called Tikaboo peak.View from Tikaboo peak(image courtesy Google)Alright now we have some idea how Area 51 related to UFOs. Lets discuss what we knew that was actually happened there.Area 51 declassified.After the second world war, the US and the former USSR are squaring of each other in an Arms race. Each side pours bilions in developing advance Military assets and developing ways to spy on each other progress. Area 51 became the development facility and testing for these highly technologic, classified projects called Black Projects.Here are some declassified black projects that has involvement with Area 51.The U2 programThe U2 program involves a development of an high altitude reconnaissance (spy plane) by Lockheed Martin called U2. Which can fly over USSR to take high resolution ariel photographs of their Military activities and nuclear capabilities. The U2 aircraft have to fly so high 60,000 feet, which makes it impossible to intercept by Missiles and fighter jets of that era. This project needs to be highly secretive from the world and US public, leaking of the information may lead the enemy to develop counter measures or lead to the development of their own spy planes. US airforce had multiple mission with U2 over Russia and the Russians unable to intercept it. U2 aircraft reigns supreme more than a decade and finally shot down in 1960 by Russian military deep inside their territory.U2 plane (image courtesy Google)SR 71 black bird:The SR 71SR 71 black bird (image courtesy Google)F117 night hawk:The F117 night hawk its the first stealth aircraft. Developed and tested in Area 51 its an highly classified project. To achieve steath capabilities the aircraft was design completely different from the conventional aircrafts, at the end the plane looks so different due to odd angles in the aircraft structure to reflect the radar waves away from the radar receiver. The test flights of this aircraft increased the UFO sightings around Area 51 since People misidentified the aircraft for a UFO. . The F117 its the pioneer of steath technology and it was used in various missions especially in operation desert Strom.F117 Nighthawk (image courtesy Google)F22 raptor:F22 air superiority fighter jet is the first 5th generation fighter jet in the world. Its among the latest projects in Area 51. Its the most advance fighter jet in the world. It has a new form of stealth technology called planform alignment. Many test flight for the f22 was conducted in Area 51. The F22 joined the aiforce in 2003 and its the most dominant fighter jet out there. Even after a decade many countries are trying to make a 5 th gen fighter with little success. The technology behind the aircraft is so sensitive need to be kept in secrect to protect the National security, this explains why the base need to be so secured and highly Secretive.F22 Raptor (image courtesy Google)Furure projects in Area 51.From the recent observation, we can determin the base is still active. Its almost impossible to know what they exacly do now. But I can guarantee you that there are some projects happening right now in Area 51 that the people dont even know their existence.The Romoured Aurora project.The term Aurora was first published in aviation week magazine article indicating the mention of the term Aurora in the 1985 US defence budget. After that there is no other mentions of Aurora found anywhere till now. The US government continuously denying the existence of such project. The Aurora project is saod to be a development of an hypersonic Reconconnaince aircraft which fly at high altitude. Its is Speculated that it uses the new type of engine called pulse detonation engine, which helps the aircraft to achieve speed beyond Mach 6 to 10. There is no evidence that such an aircraft exist, but there are many people reported to see an unusual donut on a rope shapped contrails over the sky which can be only made using a pulse detonation engine. Many airports are instructed to expect a very fast flying object on the radar.Donut on a rope contrail( image courtesy Google)People reported to hear odd double sonic booms and felt skyquakes( which is like earth quakes originates from sky due to sonic booms). There are multiple reports of seeing an triangle shaped aircraft flying the very high speeds. Right now we maynot know if such project really exists, until the government released any information about it.Conclusion:However if you asked me if i believe aliens are there in Area 51. My answer will be No. Area 51 is a place to test these highly sensitive military projects that directly involves in National security. US government is keeping these things classified because if any information leaks out and fell in wrong hands the entire project and people safety will be compromised. The place like area 51 offers a best solution to secretly keep and test this highly advance Military assets and also to keep an upper hand in Military technology from enemy countries.Hope this article answers your question..Author:Nirmal thomas.","2,143 followers",Christopher Witman,501,3.8K,19.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-weren-t-Native-Americans-nearly-as-technologically-advanced-as-Europeans-or-most-other-civilizations-by-the-time-Europeans-discovered-them
