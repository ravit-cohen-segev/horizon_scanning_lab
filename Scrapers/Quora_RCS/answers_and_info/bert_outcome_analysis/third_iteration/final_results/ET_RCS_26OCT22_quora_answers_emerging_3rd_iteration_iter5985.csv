Each of these assumptions is much more a guess than a shrewd judgment of the odds.One very interesting take on the Fermi Paradox is found in “Dark Forest”, by Cixin Liu: there is life out there, but it stays hidden because some technological civilizations are warlike and jealous.Who can say.

1,"Expect to find ‘by now’ (as this question is usually geared towards) is a bit ambitious I would say. The scales of distance and time are too large for that and even for our minds to comprehend. We’ve been looking for what? A few decades? On a cosmic scale, doesn’t even register. Not enough time for anything.Expect to find in the future? Maybe. If we don’t destroy ourselves first and actually leverage ourselves in this task. Likely involves redefining what we expect intelligent or “technological life.”","358,984 followers",Sean Kernan,9.1K,5.6K,727.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Since-technological-life-could-have-spread-across-the-Galaxy-shouldnt-we-expect-to-find-a-diversity-of-technological-species-that-could-have-emerged-independently-in-many-other-places
2,"We barely have scratched the surface when it comes to technology. It's been only a century since the advancements made in the field of technology.If you look into sci-fi, the technology that has been in use is far more advanced and we have a long way to go as we are yet to understand the subatomic world and also the secrets of the universe.Now coming to ETs.

There is a chance of them interacting with us. In this case, the interaction might be hostile or a benevolent one.Ill conclude by saying that it is possible for us to come in contact with ETs and when the time does come we need to make an interaction purely scientific and should not involve religion.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Since-technological-life-could-have-spread-across-the-Galaxy-shouldnt-we-expect-to-find-a-diversity-of-technological-species-that-could-have-emerged-independently-in-many-other-places

5,"There is one simple problem - all other problems stem from this.People like Larry Page are mathematicians - they can see the power of the algorithm and know its power in making what appears to be very complex, truly simple.Business people see a different imperative. They know that if something looks simple, even if it isn't, you can't charge much for it. The trick is to create something which is simple to do, but looks hard and complex - then you can charge lots of money for consultancy fees, make fortunes as gurus attending conferences etc. Theirs is the cult of the magician or alchemist - sThere is one simple problem - all other problems stem from this.People like Larry Page are mathematicians - they can see the power of the algorithm and know its power in making what appears to be very complex, truly simple.Business people see a different imperative.

The trick is to create something which is simple to do, but looks hard and complex - then you can charge lots of money for consultancy fees, make fortunes as gurus attending conferences etc. Theirs is the cult of the magician or alchemist - smoke and mirrors.A rocket is one of the world's simplest machines. Yet we have the ""It's not rocket science"" myth. In the same way we have an IT myth, created in the first phase when no-one knew what this new-fangled computer stuff could do or what was involved. People appointed themselves as experts and charged fortunes. A whole generation of aggressive companies grew up around providing horrendously expensive hardware and tying companies into inflexible long-term contracts based on number of CPUs, concurrent users and all the language of the confuseopoly - a way to charge more.When the hardware myth was finally busted, these companies moved onto software. SAP, Oracle and IBM bought up every available software company and created the myths of ERP, CRM and HR Management as ways to sell software - not forgetting the aggressive, tie you in and lock the other guy out, pay for lots of seats you don't use and 20% maintenance contracts - oh and the £1k/day per consultant to actually push the buttons to make it do anything.Those myths are busted too. So where do those companies go - into data, of course. The last frontier of IT complexity (well maybe not - they're in Internet of Things as well). They've brought their methodologies with them.BigData - as in ""big, frightening, you couldn't possibly understand it""They're still peddling consultants at a grand a pop. Still saying hand your company to us. Still tying you into long term contracts you can't easily get out of. Spinning buzzwords so you gain job status points by buying the latest jargon. New field - same old aggressive sales techniques. And are you fooled - you betcha! Hence questions like this - these people want you to believe datascience is hard and beset with problems only they can solve (so get out your cheque book).That's not DataScience. That's snake-oil. And it is killing the benefits big data can truly offer both companies and individuals.","47,054 followers",Abhinav Sharma,3.5K,865,7.1M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Since-technological-life-could-have-spread-across-the-Galaxy-shouldnt-we-expect-to-find-a-diversity-of-technological-species-that-could-have-emerged-independently-in-many-other-places

Its us. Every product we buy on Amazon, every Google search, every photo we like on Instagram, every information we share on Facebook. It is being used by every company and they get back to us. Data data everywhere.These are few to mention in the world where things are moving towards interdisciplinary perspective, where we learn from one field and apply to other.
