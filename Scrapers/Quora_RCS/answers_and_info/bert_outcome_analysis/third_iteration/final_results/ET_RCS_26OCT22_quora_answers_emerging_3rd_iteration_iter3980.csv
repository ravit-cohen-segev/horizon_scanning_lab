It appears today that we will never observe that event. Nowadays the conversation is around the opposite peak; that is a peak in demand, most likely in 25 years or so barring tremendous unrest above and beyond today in the ME.","5,074 followers",Jeff Ronne,2.3K,3.8K,7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Does-peak-oil-continue-to-get-pushed-further-into-the-future-due-to-better-technology
1,"I’m not an economist but here’s my take:THis is the latest World Production/demand chart I could find, to 3Q16It shows supply and demand are still on the increase. That indicates we are not yet at the peak. Demand seems to be falling behind supply, as the oil prices indicate. Increased use of alternate energy is blunting demand somewhat, at least holding down its increases (i.e. making negative growth). On the other hand widespread increase of Auto use in countries like China and India will keep demand up.So I think that in terms of production, the curve will be flattening into a broad peak.

Note that I am oversimplifying somewhat in this answer, and I am overlooking some things that some people may feel the need to point out or elaborate on - if you have any such elaborations please add them, this post will be long enough as is.In order to understand how much more smartphone cameras can improve, we first need to understand how much camera sensors have improved over time. Next, we need to understand where the primary gain in quality has come from, and in what ways smartphone cameras themselves have changed in order to overcome their physical restrictions, and lastly, we need to consider what future ways there are for smartphone cameras to improve in spite of the physical limitations.Theoretical camera performance is essentially limited by four things: diffraction, optics, format size, and light gathering capability. If you have better quality optics that let more light in, then more photons are collected, which results in an image that is sharper and has a better signal to noise ratio. There are also optical characteristics that can be desirable in photography such as a shallow depth of field, which are easier to achieve in a larger image format. There are also optics that can generate effects that can be desirable, such as lenses that allow for you to tilt and or shift the plane of focus. That can't be replicated in a cellphone through optics so I will largely ignore that.I would recommend you watch video #1 (See footnotes) - it explains ISO in depth, and  charts improvements in high ISO performance over time going by DXOmark's ratings. The short version is that he found that high ISO performance approximately doubled in 8 years, but is slowing down. For the purposes of this post, I will make the assumption that it will continue at approximately that rate even though that is unlikely.Assumption 1: High ISO performance will double roughly 8 years.Next, we need to look at where smartphone cameras have improved. Now that the megapixel race is about done, at least with smaller formats, we know that the resolution of the camera system is going to be somewhat limited by the format. The thing is, in the real world, the megapixels aren't so important after a certain point. They just limit how much detail we can cram in to pictures. On smaller image formats, diffraction is a limiting factor in how much resolution we can acheive. Diffraction is greater with a smaller aperture - not just relatively, but absolutely. One reason the common kit lenses have much better image quality than cheap point and shoot cameras is the larger aperture size. They may both be f/5.6, but on a larger format, f/5.6 is not a diffraction limited resolution, whereas on a small sensor long zoom point and shoot, f/5.6 is actually a tiny aperture and the resolution of the camera is very limited by diffraction.This is why modern smartphones have lenses with large apertures - I think the biggest these days is f/1.7 on the Galaxy S7. At that aperture, the camera system is NOT diffraction limited.Fact 1: High end Smartphone cameras use large apertures not only to let more light in, but also to avoid diffractionAs you go to a smaller and smaller sensor size, you need a larger f/number to avoid diffraction. On a 35mm SLR with a 20 megapixel sensor, diffraction may JUST be noticeable around f/11, but the image will still look very detailed. On an APS-C sensor, you'll see diffraction about 1.5 stops larger - about f/9, and on a 4/3 sensor of the same resolution, diffraction will start to kick in at f/5.6. On a high end smartphone sensor (1/2.3"") at 20 megapixels, that gives us f/1.9 as the aperture where diffraction starts to hit. If the resolution is lower, we won't notice diffraction until later. At 12 megapixels, it's probably around f/2.3 or something.See footnote 2 on how diffraction works in optics.Fact 2: High end smartphone cameras have had growing sensors and growing aperturesSo, we understand that camera sensors double in efficiency in 8 years. So why have the gains been so impressive since 2008? I have chosen 2008 because that was now 8 years ago...The iPhone 3GS had a 1/4"" sensor, measuring  about 3.2 x 2.4mm - 7.68 square mmThe Galaxy S7 has a 1/2.6"" sensor, measuring  6.69 mm x 5.55 mm - 37.1 square mmFact 3: The Galaxy S7 has an imaging sensor that is nearly 5 times as large as the iPhone 3GS. And a larger aperture too (The 3GS was f/2.8, approximately 1.5 stops slower).In very simple terms, if you double the size of the sensor and keep the aperture the same relative size, you double the gathering of light. See video 3 to fully understand the surprisingly simple relationship between sensor size, aperture, and image quality. The short version is that there's a linear relationship between sensor area and image noise. The video compares a 4/3 sensor to a 35mm format sensor, which is convenient, as the 35mm sensor is 4x as large. This is true for the larger scale cameras we love to talk about, but is also true for the wonders in our pockets.Fact 4: The Galaxy S7, with a sensor 5x as large and aperture 1.5x as large, sees 7.5x as much light as the iPhone 3GS sensor. And according to Northrup's Law, should be approximately twice as efficient at utilizing that light.So that shiny new Galaxy S7 performs about as well as the iPhone 3GS camera does, when it has 1/15th as much light...Oh yeah, it has image stabilization too, so with still subjects, you get another 3 or so stops of handholdability before you get notably blurry pictures.So in the real world, for pictures of still objects, you need 1/45th as much light.Wow!What does that really mean?Indoor photography imaging performance is much more closely tied to the amount and use of light that is gathered. Outdoor photography is restricted not by how much light you can gather, as it is bright, but by the maximum attainable quality of the camera system.Lenses are better today.A note about absolute image quality compared to point and shoot cameras:In short, we've come very far. But the low hanging fruits are gone.What do I mean here?  We've increased our sensor size by a factor of 5! Increasing it more will make the camera modules bigger.  We now have better quality, if still mass produced optics, which are capable of resolving a solid amount of detail.  Resolution is now high enough for normal usage, and diffraction is not a limitation.This begs the question: Performance improvement - where CAN it come from?Larger sensor -My guess will be that some future smartphones will have fairly large sensors, but the ones everyone uses will hit a limit and stop growing - and that's going to be sooner rather than later. Expect more large sensor phones in the future, though.Dual cameras -Dual lenses (and thus, a sensor for each lens) are actually a more elegant solution to this limitation. With a dual lens solution, you will have a wider lens and a longer focal length, which will enable you to ""zoom"" and get more detail from your subjects. They are currently in their infancy, but it would strike me as a reasonable guess that in time the cameras will work together and the phone will combine the images so you can get more detailed pictures, or perhaps a wide angle shot with a more detailed center area.As to how effective it will ever become, I'm not the right guy to ask.Computational photography -Sensor innovations -Where will we be in the future? How much can things improve?As you may guess by the tone of my post, technology will provide a slow but steady gain in quality. Another doubling of high ISO performance in 8 years will give us a noticeable improvement, but I feel the optics, and the format size of the sensor/optical combination gives us more room to see things improve. I would postulate a guess that normal sized phones may eventually get to a 1/1.7"" sized sensor, which is less than twice as large as the 1/2.6"" in the Galaxy S7 now. But in order to get there some physical compromises will need to be made - more of a camera bulge. If a camera bulge isn't acceptable, then dual camera systems are likely to provide the biggest boost.My prediction is that the gains in the next 8 years will be significantly smaller than the gains in the previous 8 years, at least on a relative scale. 8 years ago, a smartphone wasn't good enough to replace a camera for many people. Today, they are.Some of the capabilities of larger imaging formats may be somewhat compensated for via computational photography, but it's not going to be a panacea. Optics and format size aren't going to be totally replaced by computers.If I had to throw a number out my ass similar to the 15x improvement in the previous 8 years, that number would be that we should see a ~5x improvement in the next 8 years, give or take a bit, but that we will have more flexible cameras in our phones at that point thanks to improved computational photography and dual camera systems.Footnotes/secondary materials:Footnote 1Footnote 2: How diffraction worksFootnote 3: How sensor size and aperture affect image quality when comparing different formats",5 followers,Bill Otto,7.6K,7.5K,43.3M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Does-peak-oil-continue-to-get-pushed-further-into-the-future-due-to-better-technology
5,"A phone camera has an aperture of perhaps 3 millimeters. That means if the lens and sensor are perfect, it can achieve 167 microradians of resolution.Consider a DSLR with a 2000 mm focal length lens. It can resolve 2 microradians.OK, so you don’t know what that means. I grabbed my phone camera and my 12 year old modest DSLR with kit lens and took a picture under good conditions. Hand held.Cell phone.DSLR. So far, so good. But let’s take a closer look.I zoomed in on the sign in the picture. This is what the cellphone did.

It has 32 megapixels.I did the same digital zoom with my DSLR. Mind you, it only has 18 megapixels. There are a couple of take aways here. With the tiny lens, all those megapixels do not get you a clearer picture. And the cellphone picture is very highly processed to look sharper when it just doesn’t have the detail you would expect from so many pixels. If you are really sharp you will notice that the DSLR did not automatically hide the chromatic aberration in the above picture. That is something usually done in post processing on the computer.Now, I just rotated my zoom lens to a longer focal length and took another picture.You still think that a cellphone image matches up to a DSLR?Look at this building in the cell phone.It’s pretty unrecognizable and the phone went basically to black and white.Here is the DSLR. Can you argue that the cell phone is anywhere near professional quality when we are comparing to a new phone to a twelve-year-old starter DSLR APS-C frame with a kit lens? A flagship Canon full frame DSLR with a prime lens would blow even the bottom picture away. By the way, I did not do any processing on the DSLR images and I have the camera set for minimal sharpening and minimal noise reduction and output jpeg files. If I had taken raw images into Photoshop, the difference would be another quantum leap.Or, in other words, if all you ever want to do is take snapshots for social media, your cellphone is all you need. Wait until balloon fiesta and I’ll show you some comparison photos.I am actually a little surprised that the phone camera came as close as it did.
