More senior managers are expected to influence strategy and get results across the division or industry. For example, I decide which new systems should be built to catch hackers and make sure they are built correctly and on a reasonable schedule.None of this means we don't have bad managers. Just like non-managers, managers don't get fired the first time they fail to meet expectations - they're given a chance to improve. And sometimes bad managers game the system, report to a bad manager themselves, or otherwise find a way to stick around. It almost always catches up to them eventually, though.",256 followers,Priyal Gupta,9.7K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/In-Google-or-other-top-technology-company-are-the-salary-of-managers-always-higher-than-their-subordinates

You may feel that your manager may not be doing much, but most IT managers I've worked with are essential working two full time jobs. It just never ends for them: 80 hours a week is the norm. I see emails from my management team from 5am until about 11pm at night. They work weekends, and even when they are on vacation they still monitor and respond to emails. (Fires are easier to put put when they're small).I dont envy any of them, and frankly I think they are underpaid. And it doesn't get easier as you move up. I know the stereotype on movies/TV is of the ""do nothing"" paper pushing empty suit executive, and that maybe true in some industries, but not technology.(in my experience).","1,610 followers",Brian de Haaff,1.5K,146,14.6M,2015,https://www.quora.com/In-Google-or-other-top-technology-company-are-the-salary-of-managers-always-higher-than-their-subordinates

Think on the scale of a 6–12 months project.We had a PM who was excited to push us to some arbitrary deadline so that his boss could be happy with him hitting the deadline.

Think on the scale of a 6–12 months project.We had a PM who was excited to push us to some arbitrary deadline so that his boss could be happy with him hitting the deadline. There was a nice set of timelines and charts and whoozits and whatsits and so on explaining this brilliant plan.The entire team of developers and QA’s was stoked. We were going to do this in like 2 months with plenty of time to hit the 3 month later launch date. Oh, and this was attached to a larger arbitrary goal (ever heard of OKRs? or KRs? Or Quarterly Targets? Or Big Rocks?, it was one of those deals).After the full presentation of the plan was complete, I raised my hand and asked a question.“That’s a great plan, but what happens when it doesn’t work?”The room filled with silence. I got some sour looks, but I continued.“There are a bunch of unknowns. We don’t know how long issues X, Y, and Z will take at all. We are guessing and hoping for the best. Yet, every time we do this we uncover some messy thing that often takes weeks or months to unravel. What makes you think this will be any different?”The PM went on to explain that we really needed to hit our quarterly targets and that reality was basically unacceptable to them or their boss.I said, “Okay, well best case scenario is 6 months, it will probably take 12. Even if you don’t like it, plan accordingly.”Long story short, it took at least 12 months. I left the team before the project finished.The point of the story is not that I was right. It’s that most programmers love optimistic estimates. They want to say that something will be done quickly so that they look good to their boss and teammates.In almost every case something goes wrong that makes things take longer. Unforeseen problems and so on.In my experience, great programmers know that things will go wrong. They plan for it. They can usually tell you in advance what parts of the software are most likely to cause problems and sometimes even can pinpoint why.Unfortunately, honesty can be quite unpopular as great programmers aren’t often listened to unless they are in a position of authority. It is often the opinion of the most optimistic (or foolish) person that wins the day, even if it leads to catastrophe.Great programmers know-BrianP.S.

There are many lifestyle perks over and above the handsome monetary compensation to help employees deliver their best without stressing out.Our team at Google has several business and operation related stakeholders. Sometimes there are strict deadlines. Sometimes being first in the market is more important than being the best in the market. I think relative to Google standards my team is more burned out.It’s important to note that me and many others in my team do not believe in work-life balance. For us work and life is the same thing. Most of us are young (< 30) and like spending time at office more than browsing social networking website at home. We also have very minimal social life.* I enjoy the stress. I enjoy the burnout.
