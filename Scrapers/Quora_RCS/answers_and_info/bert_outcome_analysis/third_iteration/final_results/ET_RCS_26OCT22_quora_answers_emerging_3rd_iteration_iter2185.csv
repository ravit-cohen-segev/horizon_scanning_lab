Anytime you push aggressively, your troops are going to be sleep deprived.

The problem is you build tolerances to these types of drugs, and their availability is never a certainty.The army that can figure out the problem of sleep deprivation before anyone else is going to be an army that wins again and again. Provigil is an anti narcolepsy drug, and is the beginning of such an arms race. Properly dosed, it can keep someone up for days with no sleep functioning cognitively and physically close to 100%. If you command an army that does not have to rest, and can push aggressively against an army that DOES have to rest or die, you will win.Finally, consider this: A giraffe sleeps about 2 hours per day. If you could mimic this in your soldiers, even against a comparably trained and equipped foe, you would have an enormous advantage, and by some estimates the equivalent of a 1.4x larger force.","5,354 followers",Nick Layon,1.6K,794,6.1M,2014,https://www.quora.com/What-already-employed-military-technology-could-be-a-game-changer-in-the-right-hands-What-military-technology-e-g-submarines-or-shaped-charges-is-currently-in-use-capable-of-far-greater-impact-merely-in-need-of-the-right-leadership
1,"Drone Swarms. Large numbers of small, lethal drones that cannot be stopped by existing defences. This is the theme of my new bookSmall lethal drones are already in use, like the Israeli Hero-30 and the US Switchblade, but only on a small scale. When they are deployed in their thousands as swarms (i.e. groups in which the units co-ordinate they actions with a few simple rules), they will dominate the battlefield - land, sea and air.Drone Swarms. Large numbers of small, lethal drones that cannot be stopped by existing defences.

When they are deployed in their thousands as swarms (i.e. groups in which the units co-ordinate they actions with a few simple rules), they will dominate the battlefield - land, sea and air.It looked like Russia’s invasion of Afghanistan all over again. Massed firepower faced a superior knowledge of the local terrain. As in Afghanistan, the Russians sought to neutralize the opposition with airpower. The same Mil-24 Hind gunships known to the Mujahedeen as ‘devil’s chariots’ appeared swiftly to punish any rebel forces who stayed in the open.In Afghanistan, the US had supplied Stinger missiles to defeat the Russian helicopters. The situation was politically different here, and the guerrillas could not rely on American missiles. Instead, they made their own anti-helicopter weapon.The Osa (Wasp) was a simple triangular drone, modified from a consumer version sold over the Internet. The main hardware change was the addition of a small but powerful explosive charge. The flight controls also had an additional mode. The sense-and-avoid app normally used to prevent collisions between drones was modified so that the Osa would seek out other aircraft and attempt to ram them.Pilots had been warning for years about the danger of collisions with small drones; now the guerrillas would use that danger to defend themselves.Hundreds of Osas were manufactured in garages and workshops. They cost a few hundred dollars apiece and took a few hours to make.The first test was a complete failure. Half a dozen Osas rose up from the launch site and headed towards incoming helicopters. Their slow speed made interception difficult and they trailed after the faster vehicles. More disappointingly, when an Osa did finally hit its target, the tiny warhead proved too small to damage the Russian helicopter. The Hind gunships were heavily armoured and could shrug off anything less than cannon fire.The guerrilla technicians were not deterred. They modified the guidance software, and a few days later the first successful action occurred when an Osa crashed into the jet intake of a Hind. The helicopter lost power and made a heavy landing in thick woodland. The crew abandoned their aircraft, which was blown up by guerrillas minutes later.Further successes followed. Thousands of drones and components sent by international supporters were smuggled over the borders, sometimes in the parcel bays of larger drones. Designs evolved in a matter of weeks with information shared over the Internet.The Russian helicopters shot down many Osas, but a few always got through. Radio-frequency jamming was useless because, once released, the drones guided themselves and did not rely on ground control. Protective grilles on the jet intakes had limited effectiveness. The helicopter pilots took to circling at high speed, or breaking off attacks when they saw the ominous black dots of Osas spreading out in front of them.With the threat from the air fading fast, the guerrillas started using their Osas more aggressively. Special units were tasked with taking the drones as close as they could to Russian air bases; extended range versions could travel twenty miles or more. Air operations were virtually shut down as even a handful of Osas presented too much of a risk to fly through. Even Russian jets were forced to fly at high altitude to avoid the drones, making it hard to hit targets on the ground.Countless thousands of Osa were lost: shot down, crashed or failed to damage their target. But those that succeeded were deadly. More and more replaced those that were lost.Faced with rising casualties and an increasingly confident opposition, the Russians started to look at diplomatic solutions for the crisis. Arrangements were made for a face-saving peace deal, and there was an orderly withdrawal of Russian forces less than a year after the invasion.""","358,844 followers",Sean Kernan,11.4K,5.6K,726.3M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-already-employed-military-technology-could-be-a-game-changer-in-the-right-hands-What-military-technology-e-g-submarines-or-shaped-charges-is-currently-in-use-capable-of-far-greater-impact-merely-in-need-of-the-right-leadership
2,"While I agree with most of the answers here, I'm going to go a different route.The weapon system with the most ability to change how wars are fought is the XM-25 Counter Defilade Target Engagement System.The XM-25 denies cover to the enemy in that the operator fires a laser at the target, then selects how close to that impact point he wants the shell to explode.

3,"Unmanned Vehicles of All Types(Lockheed Martin rendering of their design, known as the Sea Ghost, for the UCLASS program)UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, also known as drones) are an obvious answer to this question. UAVs offer a whole range of benefits compared to more conventional military aircraft. UAVs can stay in the air for weeks at a time and the lack of a cockpit cuts down on both size and price. The only thing to be done now is for modern air forces to embrace the technology.Several other fields of warfare can stand to gain a great deal by embracing unmanned vehicles.

The only thing to be done now is for modern air forces to embrace the technology.Several other fields of warfare can stand to gain a great deal by embracing unmanned vehicles. Anti-Submarine Warfare and Anti-Mine Warfare is slowly changing with the advent of USVs and UUVs (Unmanned Surface and Unmanned Underwater Vehicles), and it's likely that this trend will only grow over time. Currently, the U.S. Navy and the Department of Defense are experimenting and testing a variety of different unmanned vehicles.(Sea Fox UUV)(Sea Fox UUV)Unmanned naval vehicles are in some ways a godsend for the navies of the western world. State actors like Iran and China are honing their A2/AD (Anti-access/anti-denial) strategies, which focus solely on disabling or destroying American aircraft carrier groups. Iran, China, and North Korea all have sizable fleets of diesel or midget submarines. Iran and China also have particularly large inventories of mines. Diesel submarines and anti-ship mines are perhaps the most pressing threats western navies face today. Diesel submarines are practically impossible to detect prior to them busting a hole in your aircraft carrier and minefields at sea can take months to safely destroy.This is where UUVs and USVs really have the potential to change the game. They offer a admiral or captain the ability to scour the seas without having to put human lives on the line, and they also double the amount of ocean that he can monitor at one time. It's clear to anyone with a navy background what a gamechanger these systems can or rather will be. However, they're not quite in the ""right hands"" just yet.A Note About Autonomous Unmanned VehiclesIt is important to note as Misho Krastev points out in the comments, that unmanned vehicles can't replace humans or traditional weapons like warships or bombers. However, unmanned vehicles can do a great deal to help out the warfighter on the battlefield such as by detonating a mine remotely, taking images of a terrorist-held village, or tracking a diesel submarine operated by a rogue nation. Despite this, unmanned vehicles cannot replace the soldiers they assist. They are not capable of making decisions as a human can, nor is it ethical to try to place them in such roles.99","43,387 followers",Misha Firer,1.7K,1.3K,133.6M,2014,https://www.quora.com/What-already-employed-military-technology-could-be-a-game-changer-in-the-right-hands-What-military-technology-e-g-submarines-or-shaped-charges-is-currently-in-use-capable-of-far-greater-impact-merely-in-need-of-the-right-leadership
