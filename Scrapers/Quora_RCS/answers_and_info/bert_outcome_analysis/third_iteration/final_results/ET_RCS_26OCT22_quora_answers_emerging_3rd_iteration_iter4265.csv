2,"Well, let’s think about it for a bit.What kind of technologies have been invented in the last century?We have things like radar, and microwave, and the internet, and satellites and computer chips, and nuclear power, and canned food, and drones, and aviation technology, and GPS, and infant formula, and indexing of websites for search engines, and bar codes, and touch screens, and vaccines, and windpower, and the accelerometer, and fire resistant clothing, and aerodynamic trucks, airbags, miniature cameras that fit in a webcam or cellphone, weather forecasting, and submarines, cellular technologWell, let’s think about it for a bit.What kind of technologies have been invented in the last century?We have things like radar, and microwave, and the internet, and satellites and computer chips, and nuclear power, and canned food, and drones, and aviation technology, and GPS, and infant formula, and indexing of websites for search engines, and bar codes, and touch screens, and vaccines, and windpower, and the accelerometer, and fire resistant clothing, and aerodynamic trucks, airbags, miniature cameras that fit in a webcam or cellphone, weather forecasting, and submarines, cellular technology and networks, RAM memory, hard disk drives, liquid-crystal displays, lithium batteries, so on.But all that kind of stuff was developed by having governments getting involved, funding research and science and so on.Which, as we all know, is a really inefficient method, it pretty much doesn’t work.Instead of this inefficient method that clearly doesn’t work, of having governments take part in research and development, we now have a much better strategy for innovation:Random guys in their garage!As we all know, that’s where all the true innovation comes from, random middle class dudes, who have ideas, and then do a startup in their garage.Either that, or huge corporations who invest in ways to extend their patents.So now, we have much more groundbreaking innovation.We have things like Amazon, who patented and made a fortune off one-click buying, the truly revolutionary idea of not making people click more than needed.Do you really think that government could have ever come up with a brilliant idea like that, huh?","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/It-seems-that-technology-sped-forward-in-the-1950s-with-many-revolutionary-advances-Does-every-decade-have-the-same-rate-of-technology-advances-Are-things-speeding-up
3,"Snow balling, yes .are you from the deep past as well? ( Born before 1984 or 74 for that matter) yes this is a time of exponential growth in technology . Pc and LARGER systems ( used to be called big iron) have kinda started to hit the Moore's wall as electron leaking and heat are an issue at scale. But the are 40 or 50 qbit quantum Machines now and extrapolation of casually interested investigating hints at generally intelligent ai at this point in time . And the possibility of a combination of the two.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/It-seems-that-technology-sped-forward-in-the-1950s-with-many-revolutionary-advances-Does-every-decade-have-the-same-rate-of-technology-advances-Are-things-speeding-up
4,"Right then. Let’s look at what’s come round since 2008.Android had its first release in 2010. Huzzah! Because unlike i-Drone, it lets us write our own apps easily!Mars Rover launched in 2011.CRISPR gene editing, 2013. Second Sight “bionic eye” the same year.Google glass was 2014. Wearable augmented reality. Shame it made you look a burke. Home 3d printers became widely available that year too.Reusable rockets - Blue Origin and Space X, late 2015. Previously we did have a reusable shuttle but the booster rockets were one-time only.Experiments into quantum computing, improvements in electric carRight then.

5,"Two come to mind: PDAs and modems.I was a fervent user of Palm PDAs, last I owned was the Palm TX. There are some funny facts about PDAs:The company that started it all was Apple in 1992 with the Newton. It failed miserably.So, PDAs were a market started by Apple, dominated by Palm and finally killed by both.The other is the modem.

Back in the early days of BBS services and the internet, the only way to connect to them was using a phone-line modem. 300bps in the beginning and then all the way to 56,600bps in the last days.Who doesn't remember the funny noises modems used to do when connecting?When was the last time you used a modem?

6,"Thisis anThisis a Cisco AGS router, first of the “big” Cisco routers. It was state of the art for Internet backbones starting in the late 80s. It wasn’t very fast - you couldn’t push more than 25Mbps “through” it (in one interface, out another). God help you if you tried to hook up 45Mbps DS-3 interfaces or 100Mbps FDDI interfaces and run at full speed.

That’s what you used for a backbone router starting in the late 90s. Sixteen interfaces, up to 9.95 Gbps, but no way in hell could you push more than about 4Gbps between any two interfaces.See how this is progressing??It’s still “the Internet”.We’re running over a gigabit per second wirelessly to our phones.Think about that. From the perspective of we started at “doing pretty good to maybe push 56Kbps from one $10M computer that filled a room to another”.It’s. Still. The.

8,There are no wrong answers to this. But I would recommend doing your bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering.
