With almost a million explainer videos crowding into Youtube, marketers are incessantly trying for a better version of explainer video.Since 2014, new versions of explainer videos are found in the internet.Initially, these videos were made as content videos but now few businesses have started to take a bold move in making it as an explainer video.As for Virtual reality videos, Big brands have used it for exemplifying their brand image. Facebook’s Oculus Rift, Sony Playstation VR, and HTC’s Vive are a few examples.Here is a level-up virtual content video by Oreo that takes the viewers into its chocolaty world.The main advantage of this video is that there will be many repeat viewers. They’ll keep on coming back just to explore things they might’ve missed the first time.This sort of repeated exposure to a brand and the thrill-factor involved will give returns like never before.Big brands have already seen huge returns and greater fandomExplainer videos in VR can be the future.This was my prediction.Trends are a progression.

So…Given an incomprehensibly vast number of planets, there is an overwhelming likelihood that life has developed inWe can speculate that on planets with similar environments, some species would have needed similar survival traits as we did, and could have evolved to look at least vaguely like us—bipeds topped with a head that can swivel around to direct its sensory organs. Two eyes are much better than one eye, but three eyes is less of a survival trait (unless the third eye sees in a different wavelength). Same with limbs—three legs just makes shoes more expensive.Sadly—barring the discovery of some loophole in the laws of physics that lets us move from one point to another faster than light does—this is the greatest thing we’ll never know.","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,742,6.8K,91.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-accounts-how-certain-technology-markets-start-and-evolve-for-example-Explainer-Videos

All answers are highly speculative, but what is more interesting than a speculative question?As many have pointed out in the literature on extraterrestrial life, it is quite possible that only a small proportion of intelligent extraterrestrial species develop impressive technologies. Just offhand, their body form might pretty much rule it out (think dolphins), their environment might do so (maybe there are no usable materials), their psychology might rule it out (think deeply ingrained conservatism), even the forms of society that develop among them might rule it out (think slavery, maybe, which has retarded technology in human history).For that matter, they might be solitary, and fail to form societies.Or they might have no need of technology. They might not even think of making tools. Why would they, if they have no use for them? In contrast, tools were immensely useful to early humans, as they are to us today.This is off the top of my head. I’m sure there are many further possibilities.Conceivably, this figures in the true solution of the Fermi paradox: the galaxy ought to be swarming with aliens, but we haven’t come across any.

3,"As David Rupp said, technology created us. More specifically, recent experiments in flaking rocks to make tools/weapons found that the more advanced rocks couldn’t be made by the earliest proto-humans—and even today it takes anthropology grad students years to become proficient stone toolmakers.Tools gave proto=humans a huge advantage—lashing a rock knife to the end of a stick enabled us to kill prey with far less risk of damage to ourselves and with far greater efficacy than other predators with bigger, sharper teeth and claws.

Our claws and teeth were our tools, wielded by our dextrous hands and huge brains.There are multiple paths to relatively high intelligence, as we can see with dolphins and elephants. But without tool-using they weren’t able to take their intelligence to the next level (also, dolphins use much of their sophisticated brains for sonar imaging, evolved in response to their first aquatic habitat: turbid rivers.I don’t think there’s any plausible way for our level of intelligence to evolve unless it’s a co-evolution with tool-using. You have to realize that intelligence is very expensive. Our brains consume a quarter of our metabolic energy even when we’re just sitting still watching the clouds. Our brains make our heads so big that it interferes with natural childbirth, leading to many more human females dying in childbirth (before modern medicine) that most/all other species. Also, human infants/children require more and richer protein to develop those brains than other primates need, putting more pressure on us to hunt effectively.So there has to be a good reason for intelligence. It’s no freebie.We’ll never know if this is necessarily true elsewhere in the universe, sadly.

4,"This may surprise you, but it was technology which made us human-like, not the other way around. Before the concept of smashing things with a stick existed, there wasn't much incentive to walk on our hind legs.

This has myriad effects. It opens opportunities to the conman, and favours resistance to being conned. It introduces vast numbers of infectious diseases, and therefore favours a more competent immune systems. It changes the cost/benefits of violent responses to strangers and would-be oppressors. There is evidence that the human species is much less cruel and violent than we used to be.
