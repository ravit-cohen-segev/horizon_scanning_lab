USB 1.x was for keyboards, mice, other relatively slow things. Firewire could support tape-based camcorders, external drives, other fast things.Intel is the key. They were basically the gatekeeper to any industry standard, because the PC was 90% of the industry. Intel always wants one thing: to sell chips. They have spearheaded many of the post-IBM PC standards, and they get patents, but they basically just give them away. Their goal is advancing the PC architecture — their bread and butter — and they’re quite good at it. And pretty good, as well, at preventing others from grabbing part of that prize.So nothing not blessed by Intel would be likely to become a PC standard. Intel was interested in Firewire, even talked about it in the early days. They were in discussion with Apple to bring that technology into their system chipsets, which would, of course, bring that technology into everyone else’s chipsets.It was around then that Steve Jobs, looking at the huge patent portfolio and very aggressive licensing program at IBM — bringing in hundreds of millions a year — decided to change the Firewire licensing agreement. Announced in early 1999, it was now going to cost $1.00 per port in royalties to support Firewire on any device. The whole idea blew up in a meeting between Intel and Apple.They weren’t the only party involved in Firewire patents. Apple approached the IEEE organization and worked with them on the standardization. But they never created a patent pool, like the JPEG and MPEG groups, that set licensing in stone early on and shared royalties. It wasn’t long before Apple did that, sort of. The blowback of their licensing announcement was fast, both the blowup with Intel and the concerns of other patent holders. Apple ultimately dropped the per-port fees to $0.25 and agreed they’re be distributed among all patent holders.In 2000, the Intel and the USB Implementors Forum (USB-IF) announced USB 2.0, and Intel threw their full weight behind it. Before long, every PC had USB 2.0 ports. There was no per-port or even per-system royalty.That relegated Firewire pretty much to video cameras. Tape-based digital camcorders could transfer digital output over Firewire without the need for computer servo control on the tape mechanism. That was not possible with USB. However, that was only a short-lived niche, as camcorders moved to flash storage and thus, full compatibility with USB file transfers.","31,157 followers",Phillip Remaker,503,11K,78.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-much-faster-is-FireWire-than-USB-3-0

Revolutions that occured at different times, in different centuries have changed the face of the world and the way we are living today. These are some of the top picks that I would like to share with the readers:Top 10 Inventions that Changed the WorldA history of ingenuityCredit: igor.stevanovic /Humans are an ingenious species. Though we've been on the planet for a relatively short amount of time (Earth is 4.5 billion years old), modern Homo sapiens have dreamed up and created some amazing, sometimes far-out, things. From the moment someone bashed a rock on the ground to make the first sharp-edged tool, to the debut of the wheel to the development of Mars rovers and the Internet, several key advancements stand out as particularly revolutionary. Here are our top picks for the most importantLive Science's Jeanna Bryner contributed to this countdown, which was originally published on March 6, 2012.The wheelWheels were invented circa 3,500 B.C., and rapidly spread across the Eastern Hemisphere.Before the invention of the wheel in 3500 B.C., humans were severely limited in how much stuff we could transport over land, and how far. Apparently the wheel itself wasn't the most difficult part of ""inventing the wheel."" When it came time to connect a non-moving platform to that rolling cylinder, things got tricky, according to David Anthony, a professor of anthropology at Hartwick College.""The stroke of brilliance was the wheel-and-axle concept,""The hard work paid off, big time. Wheeled carts facilitated agriculture and commerce by enabling the transportation of goods to and from markets, as well as easing the burdens of people traveling great distances. Now, wheels are vital to our way of life, found in everything from clocks to vehicles to turbines. [Next: The nailThe nailWithout nails, civilization would surely crumble. This key invention dates back more than 2,000 years to the Ancient Roman period, and became possible only after humans developed the ability to cast and shape metal. Previously, wood structures had to be built by interlocking adjacent boards geometrically a much more arduous construction process.Until the 1790s and early 1800s, hand-wrought nails were the norm, with a blacksmith heating a square iron rod and then hammering it on four sides to create a point,Meanwhile, the screw a stronger but harder-to-insert fastener is thought to have been invented by the Greek scholar Archimedes in the third century B.C.Next: The compassThe compassModel of a Han Dynasty (206 B.C.Ancient mariners navigated by the stars, but that method didn't work during the day or on cloudy nights, and so it was unsafe to voyage far from land.The Chinese invented the first compass sometime between the 9th and 11th century; it was made of lodestone, a naturally-magnetized iron ore, the attractive properties of which they had been studying for centuries. (Pictured is a model of an ancient Chinese compass from the Han Dynasty; it is a south-indicating ladle, or sinan, made of polished lodestone.) Soon after, the technology passed to Europeans and Arabs through nautical contact. The compass enabled mariners to navigate safely far from land, increasing sea trade and contributing to the Age of Discovery.Next: Printing PressThe printing pressA printing press from 1811, now in the Deutsches Museum in Munich, Germany. Two printers worked at each press; one moved pages on and off while the other inked the text blocks. Together they could print 3,600 pages per day.Credit: MatthiasKabelThe German Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press around 1440. Key to its development was the hand mold, a new molding technique that enabled the rapid creation of large quantities of metal movable type. Though others before him — including inventors in China and Korea — had developed movable type made from metal, Gutenberg was the first to create a mechanized process that transferred the ink (which he made from linseed oil and soot) from the movable type to paper.With this movable type process, printing presses exponentially increased the speed with which book copies could be made, and thus they led to the rapid and widespread dissemination of knowledge for the first time in history. Twenty million volumes had been printed in Western Europe by 1500.Among other things, the printing press permitted wider access to the Bible, which in turn led to alternative interpretations, including that of Martin Luther, whose ""95 Theses"" a document printed by the hundred-thousand sparked the Protestant Reformation. [Next: The internal combustion engineThe internal combustion engineA four-stroke internal combustion engine. 1) Intake stroke - air and vaporised fuel are drawn in. 2) Compression stroke - fuel vapor and air are compressed and ignited. 3) Power stroke - fuel combusts and piston is pushed downwards. 4) Exhaust stroke - exhaust is driven out.Credit: ZephyrisIn these engines, the combustion of a fuel releases a high-temperature gas, which, as it expands, applies a force to a piston, moving it. Thus, combustion engines convert chemical energy into mechanical work. Decades of engineering by many scientists went in to designing the internal combustion engine, which took its (essentially) modern form in the latter half of the 19th century. The engine ushered in the Industrial Age, as well as enabling the invention of a huge variety of machines, including modern cars and aircraft.Pictured are the operating steps of a four-stroke internal combustion engine. The strokes are as follows: 1) Intake stroke - air and vaporised fuel are drawn in. 2) Compression stroke - fuel vapor and air are compressed and ignited. 3) Power stroke - fuel combusts and piston is pushed downwards, powering the machine. 4) Exhaust stroke - exhaust is driven out.Next: The telephoneThe telephoneAlexander Graham Bell's Telephone patent drawing, from 1876.

Light bulbs changed the world by allowing us to be active at night. According to historians, two dozen people were instrumental in inventing incandescent lamps throughout the 1800s; Thomas Edison is credited as the primary inventor because he created a completely functional lighting system, including a generator and wiring as well as a carbon-filament bulb like the one above, in 1879.As well as initiating the introduction of electricity in homes throughout the Western world, this invention also had a rather unexpected consequence ofNext: PenicillinPenicillinFirst discovered in the lab in 1928, penicillin was being mass produced and advertised by 1944.

In 1928, the Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming noticed a bacteria-filled Petri dish in his laboratory with its lid accidentally ajar. The sample had become contaminated with a mold, and everywhere the mold was, the bacteria was dead. That antibiotic mold turned out to be the fungus Penicillium, and over the next two decades, chemists purified it and developed the drug Penicillin, which fights a huge number of bacterial infections in humans without harming the humans themselves.Penicillin was being mass produced and advertised by 1944. This poster attached to a curbside mailbox advised World War II servicemen to take the drug to rid themselves of venereal disease.About 1 in 10 people haveNext: ContraceptivesContraceptivesOrtho Tri-Cyclen oral contraceptives.Credit: Public domainNot only have birth control pills, condoms and other forms of contraception sparked a sexual revolution in the developed world by allowing men and women to have sex for leisure rather than procreation, they have also drastically reduced the average number of offspring per woman in countries where they are used. With fewer mouths to feed, modern families have achieved higher standards of living and can provide better for each child. Meanwhile, on the global scale, contraceptives are helping the human population gradually level off; our number will probably stabilize by the end of the century. Certain contraceptives, such as condoms, also curb the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.Natural and herbal contraception has been used for millennia. Condoms came into use in the 18th century, while the earliest oral contraceptive ""the pill"" was invented in the late 1930s by a chemist named Russell Marker.Scientists are continuing to make advancements in birth control, with some labs even pursuingNext: The InternetThe InternetPartial map of the Internet based on the January 15, 2005 data found onCredit: Creative CommonsIt really needs no introduction: The global system of interconnected computer networks known as the Internet is used by billions of people worldwide. Countless people helped develop it, but the person most often credited with its invention is the computer scientist Lawrence Roberts. In the 1960s, a team of computer scientists working for the U.S. Defense Department's ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) built a communications network to connect the computers in the agency, called ARPANET. It used a method of data transmission called ""packet switching"" which Roberts, a member of the team, developed based on prior work of other computer scientists. ARPANET was the predecessor of the Internet.Source:","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-much-faster-is-FireWire-than-USB-3-0

Ideally, AI technology will be in every aspect of our life in future, from manufacturing devices, to assisting doctors during operation to even fly an entire Airbus airplane. AI is a revolutionary technology.In Physics and Chemistry, there are many achievements, one of those is the development of new material, those like the lightest material on earth with 90% is air, or graphene technology or superconducting material at room temperature. This will have huge implication in again every single aspect of the human life. From space exploration, to medicine, to solving the energy crisis.In Biology, technology like the genome editing technology CRISPR/Cas9 will revolutionise all aspects of biology and medicine. Mosquitoes with CRISPR/Cas9 gene drive can completely eradicate mosquito-born diseases like malaria, but also can potentially alter the entire ecosystem. CRISPR/Cas9 has also the potential to solve the HIV, the cancer by snipping out the genes involved in these diseases, the food crisis by using GMO, all by the power of genetics. Furthermore, technology like regenerative medicine will one day allow us to replace any organ in the human body, ANY, even blood itself or the brain! The field is never moving faster than this! Or studying on aging will one day allow us to hibernate, prep for light-year traveling to new planets.These are just some of the most revolutionary technology out there now and these all guarantee to have enormous implication!","105,671 followers",Dave Consiglio,8.9K,6.8K,91.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-blockchain-a-fad-or-a-revolutionary-technology
