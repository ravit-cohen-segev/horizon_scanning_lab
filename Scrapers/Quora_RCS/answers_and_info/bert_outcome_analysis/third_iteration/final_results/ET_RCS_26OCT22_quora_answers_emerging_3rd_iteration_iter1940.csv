I know a transmission5G will first be used in the same LTE band - no change in frequencies there, it will just blink and blip in a different digital “language.” That’s 600 MHz to 6 GHz - all stuff we already have. It will also eventually use millimeter bands 24–86 GHz. These are used in fiber-optics, radar, some kinds of Wi-Fi and wireless video transmission.

This is unfortunately still too slow for all commercial air travel, but it does increase use cases for wireless connectivity. 5G is also expected to allow for up to 1 million devices functioning at full capability in 1 square kilometre.Are the next key areas that will be changed by 5G, allowing for devices to consume a staggering 90% less energy in data operations compared to 4G networks. Higher efficiency, lower energy, and 5G will also mean that services will take much less time to implement.Finally, the last 2 of Vestberg’s projected impacted areas are latency and reliability. He forecasts there will be a 5ms end-to-end travel time. For reference, that’s faster than the blink of an eye and it will likely be 99.999% more reliable as well. For users on all end of the data spectrum, this means good things for the world of tech.These deliverables and changes to the technology industry rely heavily on Verizon and other tech providers to update their fibre systems, network density, and real estate availability. 5G is for more than just your phone, it’s for connecting the entire world to faster better internet and it looks to be here soon.Hope you like the answer!OKportal Technology","36,818 followers",Sindhu Satish,845,1.8K,73.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-latest-emerging-technology-trends-coming-out-of-the-5G-global-introduction

If the ophthalmologist-patient said “Have you considered (just as an example) Leber’s milliary aneurysms?”, I might say “Well no, but thanks for mentioning that. That’s a real possibility I hadn’t considered here”, or something like that. If the patient has zero medical background and tells me they think they have systemic candidiasis and all I see is blepharitis, I’m going to be less sanguine.I am also assuming that the OP does not mean to recommend that the doctor should be asking their patients for their opinion about what the patient thinks the best diagnosis should be, or asking their patients to participate in the formation of a differential diagnosis to explain the patient’s symptoms/problem. Because if the patient was better at this than their physician, then they really wouldn’t need to be wasting their time going to the doctor in the first place would they?","1,896 followers",Jalon Fonseca,21.7K,485,5.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-latest-emerging-technology-trends-coming-out-of-the-5G-global-introduction

But they would have an abundance of material on Earth, especially of carbon, which would likely be the building blocks of such an assemblers. If you were carrying a jar of them and tripped and they spilled out, and they had no limit, they would quickly devour the entire earth with no way of stopping them.But here is where things get interesting: These tiny robots would have the ability to construct molecules from atoms, giving them the ability to produce amazing materials like graphene, cubes of apple, and even brain material.With advanced nanotechnology in the form of self-replicators, the entire world would experience a revolution. Think for a second about what wouldn’t change in the face of machines that can produceProduction jobs would cease. The price of every item ever created would be lowered massively. Supercomputers and experiments regarding brain material would become almost commonplace. Terraforming other planets would take years if not months.

But they never had proper app support for it.Hell, I liked it so much that I’ve reimplemented the UI on Android:I was forced onto Android when WP’s app support became so poor that I could no longer work around it. Microsoft dropped it not long after that. But the “Metro” interface on a mobile device is fantastic. I was glad to pay for the app that let me use it on Android.If a company as huge as Microsoft had to throw in the towel, it’s going to be incredibly difficult for anyone else to ever break into this market. We’re going to be stuck with the iOS/Android duopoly until some new disruptive technology comes along (like when iOS killed Symbian). I’ll probably stay on Android for a while to come, although full-blown Linux phones like the PinePhone Pro are tempting. App support doesn’t matter so much if you are running a fully-featured Linux OS. But even that’s a niche product that will only be popular with people who use Linux regularly. For most people, iOS and Android are the only game in town.",55 followers,Vincent Van Denberghe,557,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-latest-emerging-technology-trends-coming-out-of-the-5G-global-introduction
9,"I am currently using an iPhone 7 Plus. I have since it was first released. Before that I had a LG G4, and before that, a Samsung Galaxy s3. The s3 was an amazing phone, but was made of plastic, and so when it slipped out of my pocket, the screen broke. It was still in warranty, so I easily got a replacement. I loved that phone, the screen was gorgeous, had a decent camera (something I didn’t really used to use all that much), it was a great phone overall.

I loved that phone, the screen was gorgeous, had a decent camera (something I didn’t really used to use all that much), it was a great phone overall. However, a bit after my warranty expired, it died. I woke up one morning to find my phone in a boot loop, en couldn’t get to turn on properly. After some research, I found out it was because the power button was stuck, a hardware problem. After that, I had a replacement phone, the Motorola G 2 for a couple of months, until I got my G4. The G4 was fantastic, in the beginning at least. It was a year old, and I departed on holiday to Japan, and quickly noticed the battery life was abominable. I had to regulate my usage, thinking what I still wanted to do, to get trough the day, and even then I still had less than 10% battery left at the end of the day. So then, when September came, and I saw the new iPhone 7 would come in black, like a true, black black, the decision to switch was quickly made. Now, more than 2 years later, my old G4 has also die, but my iPhone 7 Plus is still going strong to this day.Originally what had me switch was the color of the iPhone (I like my black), but what made me stay was the ecosystem. I love updates, and iOS devices get a lot of those, Android devices don’t. I already had a Mac, so to be able to use iMessage at any time was great, as well as being able to use features such as Continuity or Handoff. And last but not least, the fluidity of iOS, scrolling through the iOS Springboard, opening and closing apps, scrolling across apps/webpages all feels so fluid on iOS, something that doesn’t feel quite right on Android.So, for me, when I wish to upgrade my phone, an iPhone is a no-brainer. But that’s only if you don’t mind getting locked into the ecosystem. iOS isn’t for everyone, if you like the freedom, the customisation that Android offers, you should definitely stick to that. It used to be that Android phones were struggling to keep up to iPhones, but that’s quickly changing, some of the most exciting phones released today are Android phones, with folding displays, bezel-less displays… Android is going stronger than ever, but I prefer the little things, the stability, fluidity, and guarantee for support and updates.",5 followers,Tim Dempsey,1.1K,141,1.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-latest-emerging-technology-trends-coming-out-of-the-5G-global-introduction
