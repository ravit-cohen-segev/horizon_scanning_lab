1,"Nope. We will likely never recover every last drop of oil that we know of. What will happen with oil is the same thing that’s happening with coal right now.Coal production has been dropping since about 2010Coal priced itself out of existence. Coal is a simple energy resource, it’s easy to use and transport around, but it has major limitations, which eventually see coal pushed aside as newer and more convenient technologies emerge. The same will happen to oil, albeit decades later: as it gets harder and harder to get to usable oil the price will increase and that will drive innovation into newNope.

The same will happen to oil, albeit decades later: as it gets harder and harder to get to usable oil the price will increase and that will drive innovation into new alternative technologies.The question is not whether this will happen, but which technologies will replace it. There are three real contenders: wind/solar, nuclear and fusion. We know nuclear power can keep up with all our needs for centuries on end, but it requires high capital investments and an educated electorate, we currently lack willingness to invest in nuclear power and electorate is not educated enough to back it up. Wind and solar are promising, capital investments are far smaller, but have major issues with intermittance and seasionality.Fusion is the wildcard. If we manage to develop commercially viable fusion power, all other sources of power may become as obsolete as the steam engine is. We believe to have solved the theoretical physical problems with fusion around 2005 or so and determined all of the problems are solvable, with only engineering challenges left to conquer. We’ll probably know within a decade or two how real that was.That said, humans can’t actually survive without technology. That technology may be a simple blade to cut down grass and a trained pet to help you hunt other animals, but both are examples of technology in action.",18 followers,Jens Svensson,3.9K,896,470K,2021,https://www.quora.com/Will-blockchain-technology-replace-accountants

That’s not my point. What I’m trying to convey is that natural resources in general are becoming scarce - copper being anAnyway, if you are convinced that everything is great and the future problem free - good for you.

5,"No. We will find other ways to fill the need. In fact, we already are. Other sources of energy such as renewables and nuclear power will inevitably replace oil. And hydrocarbons made from waste and/or biomass can replace oil as a feedstock material for plastics, pharmaceuticals, and other products. All of these things are actually very possible today, but are just not nearly as economical as simply pulling hydrocarbons out of the ground. But it would certainly take some time to implement them on the scale that would be needed. Hopefully, by the time these things become NECESSARY, they will alrNo. We will find other ways to fill the need. In fact, we already are.
