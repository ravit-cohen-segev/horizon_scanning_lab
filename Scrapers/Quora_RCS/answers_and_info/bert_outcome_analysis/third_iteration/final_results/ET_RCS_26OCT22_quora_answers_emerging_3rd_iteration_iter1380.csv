3,"100 years is an ambitious timeframe. However, you can extrapolate what technology might evolve if you can look at what seemingly intractable problems we have today, or those we’ll eminently have. Then you have to bet we'll invent our way through them. It's a pattern we humans are known for.There's no way to do this with any credible precision. I.E. these are wild guesses.So here's my Nostradomous100 years is an ambitious timeframe. However, you can extrapolate what technology might evolve if you can look at what seemingly intractable problems we have today, or those we’ll eminently have. Then you have to bet we'll invent our way through them. It's a pattern we humans are known for.There's no way to do this with any credible precision. I.E. these are wild guesses.So here's my Nostradomous like list applying the logical pattern above:* Climate change will lead an energy revolution, and new wealth will be generated from clean energy everywhere. Surfaces will have materials that harness sun and wind, and long term storage of energy will be solved. At least one other unknown clean energy technology will gain mass adoption (fusion, scaled use of hydrogen, etc) to power billions of homes.* Cancer cures will be as common as cold medicine or vaccines. This future generation will read about cancer in history books never knowing the toll it placed on our society. Immunotherapy today gives us a glimpse into this future. We just need to imagine a mastery of it and made available to all.","135,529 followers",Hector Quintanilla,1.8K,1.2K,88.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-will-laptops-be-like-in-the-future
4,"If I knew the answer I wouldn't be answer questions on Quora ;-) …but there will be many because new technologies are developed every year. Perhaps a qualifier would be a useful part of the question. Something like: viable, obscenely profitable, or completely unforeseen…That said, there is a good prospect for an as yet unknown technology to surface along with the many good and perhaps educated guesses that are sure to follow.","135,529 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-new-technology-will-come-in-the-next-decade

6,"I believe one of the next big disruptions will be in how real estate is presented. Nowadays most real estate is presented using boring sidewalk photographs, and I believe drone technology has the potential to disrupt this.I detailed in my previous article here some excellent real estate drones,With quality drones with excellent cameras available for under $200 U.S dollars, more and more realtors should be able to afford to buy the technology.

Realtors can offer aerial photography as a complimentary part of their package or as an extra add on to stand out from the competition in today's competitive market.From studies we have done, we have found that the perceived value of property shown via aerial photography is superior to that of property shown via sidewalk photographs while the pictures also engage users longer. I firmly believe that drones will be a disruptive technology to real estate over the coming years.Let me know if you have any questions!",2 followers,Steven Burton,1.1K,720,14.7M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-will-laptops-be-like-in-the-future
