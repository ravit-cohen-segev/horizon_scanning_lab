The developers built huge communities before they were needed, knowing that large factories were coming soon. Above that is public transportation.

The developers built huge communities before they were needed, knowing that large factories were coming soon. Above that is public transportation. Smaller cities have buses available that will take you just about everywhere within the city and bigger cities have subways as well as buses. For going between cities and provinces, China has a high speed rail system in place that is more extensive than the American highway system! For example: I lived in a city called Nanjing in China - about 200 miles/300 km from Shanghai. I could take a high speed train from Nanjing to Shanghai in about 1.5 hours!In contrast, I took an Amtrak train from Detroit to Chicago (about 300 miles/480 km) and it took over 8 hours!Another area China wins at is public utilities. They provide electricity, water, and gas for billions of people for very affordable prices! I paid maybe a total of $20 (US) per month for all utility bills, whereas it cost me over $100 in America! Atop of that is wireless technology (which is considered a public utility in China). I paid 100 rmb ($15) monthly for 16 GB of 4G data, with 1000 texts and 500 minutes of talk (which pretty much meant unlimited everything for me). In America I pay $50 a month for my unlimited plan. Yes, the 4G is a little faster, but that may just be because I’m not trying to access the foreign web here…A third area (kinda related to the second) is how the CCP controls markets and prices so everyone can live a comfortable life. I ate a big plate of food at a small restaurant for between 10 and 20 rmb… ($1.25-2.50). The government controls the means of production, so there is plenty of food for everyone!I hope you enjoyed my answer!",167 followers,Tim Brown,806,1.4K,1.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-sort-of-advanced-technologies-the-government-possesses-that-theyre-hiding-from-us

5,"In 2003 I was working for Cisco Systems and at the time we learned that the US Department of Defense had worked with Intel and other chip manufacturers to install in their hardware the ability to remotely disable any device using their technology with a certain radio frequency.

One time we weIn 2003 I was working for Cisco Systems and at the time we learned that the US Department of Defense had worked with Intel and other chip manufacturers to install in their hardware the ability to remotely disable any device using their technology with a certain radio frequency. Supposedly, this technology was used to help cripple the Iraqi air defense system when the US invaded.This was important to Cisco because we were working in security and cryptography and the NSA was forever trying to get us to corrupt our products so they could un-encrypt foreign transmissions on the fly. One time we were required to corrupt product that had been shipped to China and it started a major debate about our fiduciary responsibility to the country or to the customer. The issue was that if you sell a security product that you know is corrupted, you are knowingly committing fraud and are liable. As the Product Manager at the time I asked the NSA if they would stand behind us (and me as I might be personally liable) in court if we were discovered. Of course the answer from the NSA was “Hell no.”We were on our own. We then entered into a long debate about how to detect Easter eggs and other corruption introduced into security products unknowingly through another vendor’s corrupted hardware. The issue was never resolved but it should be known that our security source code HAD to be provided to the NSA in order to get FIPS certification and they made certain changes to it.So to answer your question, USA military technology is advanced far beyond anyone’s knowledge to describe the extent.On the other hand, the Chinese probably know more about our technology than we do since they perpetrated the greatest security breach in history by compromising the RSA key technology used by almost everyone in the world. We only learned of it through the vigilance of Lockheed-Martin who discovered the breach accidentally. But for months the Chinese had the key to almost every computer in the world.","220,596 followers",Franklin Veaux,4K,47.3K,782.7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-sort-of-advanced-technologies-the-government-possesses-that-theyre-hiding-from-us

It also acts as a bombing computer, basically telling the pilot when to push the fire button to hit its target. This was 1977 Sci-Fi level technology.Now, twelve years earlier, in 1965, very real US naval aviators, flying the very real A-6 Intruder bomber, were flying bombing missions over North Vietnam. The A-6 had what was called DIANE (Digital Integrated Attack/Navigation Equipment). The pilot’s display looked like this :Instead of looking outside (and seeing nothing, since the A-6s flew at night in bad weather), the pilot watched this screen that clearly - for a trained eye - showed relief and distances. It also conveniently provided navigation hints.This picture actually shows what the late 80s A-6E Intruder Vertical Display Indicator looked like. The Vietnam era VDI was more crude, and at one point orange, I think, instead of green. That being said, it was still an impressive piece of technology for its time :Kaiser Aircraft & Electronics (now Kaiser Electronics) built the first instrumentation system in the late 1950s. The original operational display presented ground and sky texture to the pilot with a well-defined horizon for attitude, “highway in the sky” for steering and numerous other symbols for execution of various attack maneuvers.“Life of the Intruder”, Naval Aviation News, 1997Here is how Brian Bryans, former A-6 pilot and author ofAn A-6 pilot had the world’s largest attitude indicator centered on the instrument panel right in front of his face. It was similar in size and appearance to the early TV screens and was called a VDI. It had a pale orange glow and showed an artificial horizon across the middle of its screen with puffy white clouds over it. […] When it got real black outside, you turned up the rosy glow on the VDI and it looked like you were over Kansas on a sunny day. […] The computer generated a curved path on the VDI, so all the pilot had to do was to follow the yellow brick road across “Kansas”.The Terrain Clearance Mode (using the data from the Terrain Following Radar) allowed the pilot to fly low and follow the relief to avoid radar detection and Surface to Air Missile. (The A-6 autopilot could not, as I had first written, do terrain following.)The A-6 also did its own bombing. Once over its target, it told the pilot how it wanted to be flown (attitude, altitude, speed…) and when the parameters were right, it dropped its bomb load without human intervention.Now so far I have conveniently forgotten to tell you that the A-6 had a crew of two. Sitting next to the pilot, the Bombardier/Navigator was here to work the radars and the computers, feed them the data they did not have, and make sure that the pilot had all the informations he needed.But even the X-Wing needs a R2 unit to work at its best…As you might also have guessed, the A-6 varied systems did not always work properly. In fact, especially in the early years, they never really worked as advertised. So the pilot and the Bombardier/Navigator still had a lot to do. Nonetheless, enough of the systems worked regularly enough to allow the A-6 to fly when other bombers could not, and to hit targets with unrivalled accuracy.And even the X-Wing targeting computer crashes inSo, in the late 70s at least, the US government definitely had Sci-fi level technology. By this time the A-6 had gotten much better, and the Air Force had its own smart bomber, the F-111. Both types would have taken care of the Death Star in short order!As far as the public awareness is concerned, the A-6 was not a Top Secret aircraft, and its capabilities were known. But I think most people did not realize what the military could do. My father had an electronic class in engineering school in the mid 70s. He told me that he found it fun but wondered what the practical applications could be…","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-sort-of-advanced-technologies-the-government-possesses-that-theyre-hiding-from-us
