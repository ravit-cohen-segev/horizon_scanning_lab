This was a dangerous, showy, unapproved procedure. The screwdriver slipped. In a flash of blue light, the plutonium core released an intense burst of neutron and gamma radiation before Slotin managed to flick the top hemisphere off onto the floor. A half-second’s exposure was sufficient to give Slotin a lethal dose of radiation poisoning. He suffered massive cellular damage and died nine days later.The plutonium did not detonate because it was functioning at the level of a nuclear reactor rather than a nuclear bomb. There was enough fissionable mass present, but not enough density. If the core had been explosively compressed (as happens in an implosion-type nuclear bomb), then Los Alamos would have vanished in a mushroom cloud.","246,828 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-technological-advancement-that-will-change-the-world-similar-to-the-discovery-of-the-nuclear-chain-reaction

15,"In 1996 under Gil Amelio, Apple was determined to purchase a replacement multitasking Mac OS to compete with Microsoft’s Windows NT. The two main options he considered were Steve Jobs’ NeXT and Jean-Louis Gassée’s BeOS. (Another option was licensing Microsoft’s NT kernel.) Clearly NeXT was a great choice, and Steve Jobs and the iPhone ended up changing the world yet again. However, switching to Objective-C as the development language for Mac apps was NOT a huge win for Apple. Probably C++ would have attracted more developers.If Amelio had chosen BeOS, Apple would have had an excellent C++ baseIn 1996 under Gil Amelio, Apple was determined to purchase a replacement multitasking Mac OS to compete with Microsoft’s Windows NT.

However Apple would have been without Steve Jobs, and thus would have missed out on the iPhone. Likely Microsoft and Adobe would have continued Mac software development. Without the iPhone, I suspect Apple would have poured far more resources into Mac development. But Apple could not have become the world’s largest market cap corporation with just the Mac.","21,766 followers",Glyn Williams,3K,9.1K,53.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-technological-advancement-that-will-change-the-world-similar-to-the-discovery-of-the-nuclear-chain-reaction
