0,"1) Light field recordingA light-field camera, also called a plenoptic camera, is a camera that uses a micro lens array to capture 4D light field information about a scene. Such light field information can be used to improve the solution of computer graphics and computer vision-related problems, and to make digital plenoptic pictures that can be refocused after they are taken.2) 8k ultra HD cameraAstrodesign of japan with its new technologies are able to shirk 8K recording capabilities in to a compact camera3)Fujifilm ultra-wide 99x telephoto zoom lens for broadcastFujifilm demonstrated first t1) Light field recordingA light-field camera, also called a plenoptic camera, is a camera that uses a micro lens array to capture 4D light field information about a scene.

Its ideal for not just sports like baseball or cricket, but also activities like theater, golf and skating4) Curved camera sensorSony is working on new curved camera sensor which may herald better images and cheaper lens. Sony has released the first image ever taken with a curved CMOS sensor it has developed for compact and full-frame cameras. The new image sensor features a curvature similar to the human eye that helps to fix optical distortions normally created by flat sensors5) Liquid based lensResearchers at Ohio State University are the latest to explore the possibility of creating camera lenses that mimic the wide-angle way in which insects view the world. But in an intriguing twist that could have far reaching implications for photographers, the experimental lens would also have the focusing ability of a human eye, letting it capture images with depth, as well ,Or in other words, the liquid-based lens can quickly switch from wide-angle to zoomed-in, while having total control over depth of field much like a human eye, which can focus on close-ups, with distant objects remaining blurry.6)Organic camera sensorFUJIFILM Corporation (President: Shigehiro Nakajima) and Panasonic Corporation (President: Kazuhiro Tsuga) have developed organic CMOS image sensor technology that uses an organic photoelectric conversion layer with a photoelectric conversion property at the light receiving section of an image sensor to achieve performance beyond that of conventional image sensors**. Applying this technology to the image sensors of digital cameras and other imaging devices expands its dynamic range*** and enhances sensitivity*4 further to prevent highlight clipping in bright scenes and capture a dark subject with vivid colors and rich textures.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2014,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-upcoming-technologies-we-will-see-soon-in-the-photography-field
1,There is always something new in the camera industry.   We cannot say at a particular instance that what will come next.The most things are:-The DSLT cameras- Single Lens Translucent-.-Then there are the mirror less cameras. This technology has advanced a lot and now there are many new mirror less cameras in the market.,"9,705 followers",Tim Mensch,626,3K,18.8M,2014,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-upcoming-technologies-we-will-see-soon-in-the-photography-field
2,"There is a crusade in the direction of concurrent, distant cardiac observing with the newest cohort of occasion and Holter screen schemes made byThere is a crusade in the direction of concurrent, distant cardiac observing with the newest cohort of occasion and Holter screen schemes made byThe span of observing today is also beginning to spread afar the old-style 48 hours to numerous days or weeks. Capturing larger amounts of real-time cardiac data allows for a complete picture of a patient's cardiovascular health. Real-time monitoring also can allow for immediate intervention, or patient callbacks if enough data has been gathered to diagnose their condition. The depth of data from devices recording all cardiac function 24/7 offers a clearer picture over small snippets of information from a couple events, or from short duration 24-48 hour recordings. This depth of data also allows for more detailed statistical analysis.However, capturing vast amounts of data over days or weeks would be labor intensive to manually dig through to extract relevant data, or to tabulate statistical analysis. For this reason, numerous vendors now offer software algorithms to automate this review process. Several days worth of data can now be processed in minutes to pull out the relevant information and condense it into a useable report format for cardiologists.The Rise of Smart ECG AlgorithmsIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, several vendors introduced first generation smart algorithms for automatic arrhythmia detection with in-hospital patient monitoring systems. There were high hopes this technology would eliminate the need for human monitoring of the ECG data. But, while these system worked well in product demos, they did not always perform as well in real life. However, this technology has greatly improved over the past decade and is now being used with event monitors, Holters, wearable devices and smartphone-based ECG monitors.","3,411 followers",Louis Vaught,4.8K,1.2K,13.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-upcoming-technologies-we-will-see-soon-in-the-photography-field

4,"Because at a certain point making regular magazines bigger isn’t useful. They become too big and cumbersome.AK 100 round magazineSo they tried drums because they’re less of an unholy bitch than a similar sized magazine.AK 74 round drumThe problem with drums is that the coil springs always have issues that cause feed problems. They do work, and are generally more reliable than ridiculously large box magazines, but less reliable than reasonably sized box magazines.AK with reasonable 30 round magazineOriginal question-Because at a certain point making regular magazines bigger isn’t useful.
