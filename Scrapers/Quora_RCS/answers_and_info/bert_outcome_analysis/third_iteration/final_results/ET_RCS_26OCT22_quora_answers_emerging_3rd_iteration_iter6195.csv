0,"I can identify six major technologies that would need to exist, but don’t exist, to make Iron Man possible.I can identify six major technologies that would need to exist, but don’t exist, to make Iron Man possible.A few other points:In short, the more you think about the amazing range of capabilities of the armor, the more things you realize are beyond the state of the art or outright impossible with any known technology.And the technologies listed above would be world-changing. Even just the arc reactor, let alone repulsors, force fields, etc. would reshape the world completely. Even if only Tony Stark was genius enough to invent them once, having the certain knowledge that they are possible would result in others independently discovering them.EDIT: Now, in the Infinity War movie, it's canon that the suit uses nanotechnology. Just as the latest Black Panther movie shows a necklace that turns into a super suit, now something that Tony Stark is already wearing (a hoodie, or maybe something he was wearing underneath the hoodie) turns into a complete Iron Man suit that replaces his clothes. The future likely will feature real nanotechnology, but this is magical movie nanotechnology where mass appears from nowhere. This is one more impossible thing.",UNKNOWN,Steve R.

1,"Iron man’s basic suit consists of:An exoskeleton:This one is sorta easy to do and is already being done. Essentially a robot that goes around the body and using servos and other machines lifts heavy things. They use sensors to know what to do. Possibly can connect to your brain.An AI system:This one is fairly easy, its like siri but more advanced and can learn.

Possibly can connect to your brain.An AI system:This one is fairly easy, its like siri but more advanced and can learn. You need a knowledge database (like quora) a visual processor, a text to speech program, a speech to text program and a machine learning algorithm. When I said fairly easy, I meant not at all fairly easy.RepulsorsRepulsors actually look like Ion thrusters which is already real.Looks, incredibly cool right? And even better, ion thrusters uses a gas called Xenon which sounds even more futuristic. Anyways, the propellant (usually xenon) is pumped into a magnetic chamber and shot with an electron gun, this electron gun separates electrons and protons from the xenon and the proton gas is pushed through a negative and positive grid and when outside, shot with a neutralizing electron gun. Creating propulsion.Problem is that these are usually very heavy and large, though we might in the future find a way to make it smaller. Another problem is that it doesn't produce much thrust in a short amount of time, which we could maybe fix in the future.How the repulsor shot works? I suspect they use a red-hot piece of flint, flint being extremely volatile while red hot, it will explode when struck, the flint is placed on the ion thruster, the ion thruster then builds up a large amount of protons and gas, then when there is enough pressure, the thruster is activated, sending the hot piece of flint forwards and to explode on the target.Boomthis is theoretical of course, but it would look really cool.Flight system:At the moment, ion thruster’s wont really get you, or a hundred pound suit off the ground, maybe if you used it on a different planet, or in space but right now ion thrusters are in the development stage and is not completely optimized in terms of force.Other options include: Rocket thrust, electric ducted fans, Jet engines etc.Anything that will get you off the ground.Laser weapons system:Just get a really big laser, or a bunch of lasers with a focusing lenseInertial dampenersInertial dampeners are a mechanism that keeps inertia from crushing your internal organs or destroying everything in your body.I have a few theories on how iron man goes mach 3 and can stop almost immediately for some reason.A miniature fusion power reactor:Absolutely possible!Right now the heat given off by fusion is enough to melt whatever is around it, including you, without an appropriate heat sink. So bad idea.Even a nuclear reactor would absolutely give you radiation poisoning without a large amount of lead surrounding it or radiation shielding.This is the problem with the suit, not everything else, but the power source.If we had an infinite power generator like tony stark’s arc reactor, we would basically have free energy for everyone.It sucks right?Whatever, Im gonna try to make an iron man suit anyways hehe",3 followers,Mark Bradford,12.8K,579,2.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-do-Iron-Man-s-repulsors-work-I-have-heard-it-could-be-due-to-muons-and-plasma-However-scientifically-speaking-in-real-life-how-is-it-possible-and-if-not-could-it-be-possible-with-emerging-technology-and-science
2,"We are nowhere near it.Nowhere. Not even slightly.An exoskeleton that allows the user to have greater strength for lifting in specific circumstances? Yes. But not a suit. A suit that allows you to breathe? Sure, with GIANT tanks attached to it, for a couple hours.Let’s break down what the suit is and why we can’t have nice things… yet. (and I’m not even going to use the new nano particle suit, just the one from Iron Man I - the very first movie, the basic suit).Fully enclosed suit:We are nowhere near it.Nowhere.

You need the actuators to give it the stretch but the suit would fall apart from stress so you need the exotic materials but then you need to power it so you need a power source that generates enough power in a tiny space that doesn’t kill the wearer with radiation and heat, but you can’t fly unless you have repulsors and then you can’t control it because you don’t have the mind interface, but then you are limited in what you can do unless you have the most advanced and complete and benign AI installed but you can’t do that unless you have the computing power that is insanely powerful in a tiny space and none of that matters because a couple hits from physical attacks would turn your body and brain to jelly from the outside shocks so you need electronic inertial dampeners that would put the Enterprise to shame.And that’s why we can’t have nice things.PS - I’m sure I missed something. :)","3,885 followers",Andre Xast,2K,2K,41.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-do-Iron-Man-s-repulsors-work-I-have-heard-it-could-be-due-to-muons-and-plasma-However-scientifically-speaking-in-real-life-how-is-it-possible-and-if-not-could-it-be-possible-with-emerging-technology-and-science
