How could I be surprised — when I graduated medical school in 1984, things like mobile telephony and the internet were still far in the future. We could not even begin to imagine them. Yet just over a decade later, they were a part of our lives and were to be much refined in the following 20 years.

1,"I don’t think so; not in the near future.Robotic surgery is a bit like driverless cars or pilotless aircraft. It definitely offers some clear advantages but the human element is still such an important part of the whole thing that it can’t yet be eliminated.Even supposing the robot can operate flawlessly on every possible patient (which as yet is still a far-off goal), who is going to decide upon which patients to operate?

5,"VR is not likely a replacement for smartphones. It’s a far more stationary experience than you’re likely to have with a smartphone.Also, be careful about think that “product” and “technology” are the same thing. They’re not. A smartphone is about 95% personal computer technology folded, spindled, and mutilated into a pocket-sized expression of the personal computer. And, sure, a cellular modem. But they’re descendents of PDAs more than any telephone, and PDAs were originally an effort to get some aspects of personal computing to fit in one’s pocket in an era that really didn’t allow that.So, cVR is not likely a replacement for smartphones.

But they’re descendents of PDAs more than any telephone, and PDAs were originally an effort to get some aspects of personal computing to fit in one’s pocket in an era that really didn’t allow that.So, case in point, Google’s launch Project Tango later this year (So… what replaced the Personal Computer? Both “nothing” and “the smartphone” are correct answers. Microsoft still sells 350 million or so copies of Windows every year, so lots of people are buying personal computing. But there are 1.5 billion Android devices and maybe 200 million iOS devices sold every year, allowing people to personal and mobile compute on things not obviously the same as a PC.Both smartphones and PCs are evolutionary technologies. They’ve been around for a long time, and as they wax and wane in popularity, they also continue to evolve. It’s far more likely that new versions of these continue to encapsulate new technologies rather than some new thing appears wholly formed with the possibility of replacing any of these existing products.There have been technologies that lead to such schisms, but they’re rare. The automobile leveraged some of the components of the horse-and-buggy era, but it didn’t complement it, and the change was very fast. Television had much the same effect on what radio had been in the 1950s, but radio evolved to serve other markets. Digital technologies have repeatedly replaced analog technologies, but usually by dropping directly into existing niches… I have a digital SLR camera that uses the same lenses my film SLR did.So what actually could replace a smartphone… or a PC? Imagine if we perfect human to machine communications. Initially, let’s say you get an implant that lets you think to your smartphone or PC, and see what it’s telling you in your mind. Great! Only, initially, most people won’t be able to afford that implact, it’ll seem creepy to many, etc. But it will absolutely catch on. The disabled, those who need faster and more accurate communications to computers and networks, those who need better CAD visualizations, all in time.At some point, you no longer need to ever see that smartphone. Maybe it, too, becomes a part of you, some kind of body-powered implant. It’s doing the same job as your PC or your smartphone… but I’m guessing we don’t call it a “phone” anymore. Though it’s only a weird quirk of history — the fact that phone companies, owning the cellular networks, functioned as your smartphone vendor — that we still kept calling them “phones”. Yeah, sure, they do voice communications. All different kinds. And text, and video, and email, and web, and anything else you can program up. Much like your PC, other than that one dedicated cellular network voice option. And yet, we say “phone”.",5 followers,Bill Otto,7.6K,7.5K,43.3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-in-future-the-technological-advancement-will-replace-the-surgeons-and-will-do-surgery-with-more-precision

7,"A phone camera has an aperture of perhaps 3 millimeters. That means if the lens and sensor are perfect, it can achieve 167 microradians of resolution.Consider a DSLR with a 2000 mm focal length lens. It can resolve 2 microradians.OK, so you don’t know what that means. I grabbed my phone camera and my 12 year old modest DSLR with kit lens and took a picture under good conditions. Hand held.Cell phone.DSLR. So far, so good. But let’s take a closer look.I zoomed in on the sign in the picture. This is what the cellphone did.

It has 32 megapixels.I did the same digital zoom with my DSLR. Mind you, it only has 18 megapixels. There are a couple of take aways here. With the tiny lens, all those megapixels do not get you a clearer picture. And the cellphone picture is very highly processed to look sharper when it just doesn’t have the detail you would expect from so many pixels. If you are really sharp you will notice that the DSLR did not automatically hide the chromatic aberration in the above picture. That is something usually done in post processing on the computer.Now, I just rotated my zoom lens to a longer focal length and took another picture.You still think that a cellphone image matches up to a DSLR?Look at this building in the cell phone.It’s pretty unrecognizable and the phone went basically to black and white.Here is the DSLR. Can you argue that the cell phone is anywhere near professional quality when we are comparing to a new phone to a twelve-year-old starter DSLR APS-C frame with a kit lens? A flagship Canon full frame DSLR with a prime lens would blow even the bottom picture away. By the way, I did not do any processing on the DSLR images and I have the camera set for minimal sharpening and minimal noise reduction and output jpeg files. If I had taken raw images into Photoshop, the difference would be another quantum leap.Or, in other words, if all you ever want to do is take snapshots for social media, your cellphone is all you need. Wait until balloon fiesta and I’ll show you some comparison photos.I am actually a little surprised that the phone camera came as close as it did. The thing third from left in top row is a balloon gondola shape.

8,"There will be a subset of workers needed where human interaction is necessary. However, being a postal worker (delivery) is remarkably non-repetitive. Mailboxes are very non-standard, creating a robot that understands what a “mailbox” looks like might take substantial effort.Any physical interaction with the existing housing stock (plumbing, electrical, carpentry…etc) is somewhat resistant to automation simply because of the broad variety involved in the existing housing stock. Postal workers are part of that group.","115,126 followers",Daveed Phoenix,877,9.9K,160.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-in-future-the-technological-advancement-will-replace-the-surgeons-and-will-do-surgery-with-more-precision
9,"The USPS is one of the most automated operations in the world. They invented the zip code and the ability for machines to read addresses and route mail. It is likely that their automation will continue with the likely result of fewer workers doing particular tasks but that does not mean that those workers will become redundant.

Will automated trucks move mail between depots, probably at the same time other industries start to use self driving trucks. Will robots replace the local mail carrier, probably not given the duties and variability of delivery. There will probably continue to be a need for about the same number of employees at depots and offices somewhat due to the considerable variability of the materials they must handle that have been packed by folks like you and me and Gram-papa.USPS in in the process of purchasing an initial order of $6B of new delivery vehicles that will vary from all electric to fully petrol powered with design criteria that maximizes the efficiency of the delivery personnel.

10,"I expect the USPS to become a large distribution machine as workers are displaced and much more efficient distribution models are deployed.
