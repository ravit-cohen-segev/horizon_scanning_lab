1,"I don’t think so. To gain and maintain mainstream institutional adoption, there is going to have to be a lot of faith in the reliability, and in particular, the security of the system. Bitcoin has proven itself for over ten years. It would be very hard for another system to overcome that. Saving electricity, by itself, would not be enough.Perhaps some of the energy efficient aspects of it could be incorporated sometime in the future.",2 followers,Kelly Pearson,1.7K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-a-cryptocurrency-were-developed-that-was-good-for-the-environment-would-it-overtake-Bitcoin-in-value-Why-or-why-not

The electricity market has utilities on the supply side and consumers on the demand side, with blockchain you can integrate consumers with renewable power assets like solar, wind into the local grid to act as Prosumers. The inherent de-centralized nature of blockchain technology allows to create a network of multiple nodes embedded into the electricity distribution grid creating a so called smart grid. The blockchain acts as the accounting ledger for such a grid storing the transaction records of production and consumption by each prosumer/consumer for billing purposes. This allows to create a more competitive market where the prices cannot be dictated by utilities alone.**EDIT**To further expand the above, consider a distribution grid with prepaid meters for consumers. Normally consumers would load the amount in the meter wallet based on their estimated consumption. They would thus buy the power from the utility at fixed rate and consume that many units until their wallet balance is exhausted.Now consider this in a blockchain scenario, you can replace the fiat with say an ERC-20 token, where each token is pegged to the price of 1 unit of electricity. You then define the smart contract which governs the use of the token. The network will have an infinite supply of these tokens, and while tokens can be bought or sold, the consumption of electricity units would deplete the tokens from the network, meaning they get destroyed and cannot be recovered.So within the grid, you have the power producing utility which produces say 1000 units daily and decides to sell the same at 10¢ per token, you the consumer who consumes 100 units daily, purchases these tokens from the utility and is allowed to consume that many units of electricity. Next, I move into your area and put up solar on my house that generates 150 units daily. I utilize the 100 units I need internally and export surplus power of 50units back into the grid for say 5¢ per token. Suddenly you now have an option to procure power at less rates, 50x10¢ from the utility and 50x5¢ from me your neighbor. Multiply this scenario 1000 fold and you now have a very dynamic and competitive market where the price can no longer be dictated by the utility, while giving a chance to those with renewable assets to capitalize on their investments.",12 followers,John Cate,717,14.4K,186.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Bitcoin-mining-environmentally-unfriendly

I am going to give the perspective of a 52-year-old who has seen a great deal of change, some of it for the better, most of it for the worse.

I am going to give the perspective of a 52-year-old who has seen a great deal of change, some of it for the better, most of it for the worse. I am going to share what has led to my misanthropic nihilism and negativity concerning the current “state of affairs.”Even with our greater technology, I-Phones, computers, medical advances, and other luxuries, these problems lessen us every day, and not enough people care to do a damn thing about it. Obsessive greed is one of the things we most need to tackle, from big corporations to medicine and higher education. Money is important but we have allowed that obsession to get in the way of the higher interest of caring for all our citizens. Making all their needs more affordable and obtainable is a good start. I am thankful I do not have kids. I would grieve incessantly now to think of the world I have brought them into. I only hope that younger people are observing this disaster and that they will take the reigns and make some needed changes. It may be too late.* To the few folks (including a lady who was so rude I deleted her comment) who think we should love the country as it is or “get out,” I say this. Such reactions are naive and juvenile. I love my country and I wish to see it become better. Civilizations do not progress through complacency. They advance when folks sound alarms and encourage change. That is why women and minority groups now have rights they would never have enjoyed had they just “loved it or got out.”",0 followers,Mark Adler,2.5K,755,2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-can-blockchain-technology-help-with-expanding-solar-power-usage-in-the-United-States
