2,"Elon.1- SpaceX:Elon and the SpaceX Team have proven them wrong.Elon has a mission to make Mars habitable in case the earth is no longer a viable option.I wouldn’t be surprised if SpaceX successfully sends men to Mars in this decade.2- TeslaTesla has solved problems like slow charging, short range, slow speed, and slow acceleration, plus has made EVs affordable.Now allElon.1- SpaceX:Elon and the SpaceX Team have proven them wrong.Elon has a mission to make Mars habitable in case the earth is no longer a viable option.I wouldn’t be surprised if SpaceX successfully sends men to Mars in this decade.2- TeslaTesla has solved problems like slow charging, short range, slow speed, and slow acceleration, plus has made EVs affordable.Now all the car industry is trying to catch up with Elon and the Tesla Team. Personally, I don’t think they have the corporate culture and innovative thinking to do so.Tesla will continue to revolutionize the car industry.3- Tesla BatteriesFounded in 2006, Elon is seeking to make renewable energy something that every home can afford plus revolutionize the battery efficiency of the Tesla cars.SolarCity (another of Elon’s ventures) designs and installs clean energy systems in residential and commercial settings.Elon’s goal is that by using SolarCity’s solar energy and Tesla batteries, households can become less dependent on the electric grid, power their Tesla vehicle, and reduce their footprint on the environment.With global warming in the front of the minds of governments and people worldwide, I expect that Elon will continue to revolutionize this industry.4- The HyperloopPassengers will be able to enter a 2-meter wide pod to be zipped through a long tube. The entire thing is expected to run on renewable electric energy.The Hyperloop is being tested and has proven to be successful. We will see Elon’s creation again revolutionize transportation by the end of this decade.Elon with the Boring Company is also working on neuroscience, education, AI, self-driving cars, traffic problems.Elon is changing the world in many ways — I expect to see Elon reap much of what he has sown, during this decade.Extraordinary genius!Go Elon!",2 followers,Richard Muller,3.2K,2.3K,202.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-emerging-technologies-should-entrepreneurs-keep-close-track-of-from-now-until-2020

6,"How technological?Nothing about living underwater would stop such a species from building shelters, nets, stone or other natural material tools. Nor would it stop them from farming and animal husbandry.Would it stop them from discovering fire, electricity, metallurgy, explosives, etc?We can’t say that there aren’t other technological pathways that could lead to the discovery of equivalent capabilities without mastering fire.But, even assuming fire is necessary for all that…If the planet has an air/water or water/land interface, and an oxygenated atmosphere, and our aquatic species ends up domeHow technological?Nothing about living underwater would stop such a species from building shelters, nets, stone or other natural material tools.

In caring for their floating crop, they will inevitably learn to make floating platforms. By managing their amphibious livestock, they gain a beast of burden that can pull cargo out of the sea and on to the seashore.And with access to air, the discovery of fire is just a matter of time. It might come later in their history than for humans on Earth, but it will come.Even with no access to surface air, if they manage to develop a science of chemistry, they might still discover fire eventually. Fire is just a redox reaction, after all.Perhaps it might be harder, and perhaps it might take longer, but it certainly does not appear impossible.",3 followers,Mark Bradford,12.8K,579,2.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-emerging-technologies-should-entrepreneurs-keep-close-track-of-from-now-until-2020

A select few make it, and it’s only because we like them so badly. The difference is, though, that technologies often intertwine, branching off into niche and very ad hoc topics.

Python is the language that sends the requirements to the framework and presents the answers to humans.

The more you use existing algorithms, the more you will use Python.Therefore, C++ and Python make up a very powerful tool that allows you to be very efficient, thinking at different levels of abstraction.I believe that this powerful tool (C++ - Python) is not unique to AI and could be used in almost all scientific investigations.Finally, I must clarify that of that pair, C++ today is insubtituible, while Python can be replaced by other languages ​​such as Julia or R.
