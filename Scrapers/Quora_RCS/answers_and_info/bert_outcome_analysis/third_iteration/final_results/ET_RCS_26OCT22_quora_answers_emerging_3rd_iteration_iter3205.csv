For me the whole map of the world of ASOIAF fits pretty neatly against a map of Europe and Asia:This being the case, we can safely assume that to the ‘West of Westeros’ lies some sort of analogue to America. There is little evidence of this in the books, no one who has sailed west has ever come back to tell the tale, but remember this series is based on theWill we ever find out for sure what lies to the west?

It was simply a receiver hooked by an electrical cord, and a wall-mounted box, with a bowl-like attachment, for a transmitter. We had a party line. Our “signal” was one long ring, and two short rings. About a decade later, was invented the rotary dial telephone, so we could call the party we desired, directly, without going through the operator.I was”potty-trained” in our outhouse. We used our Sear’s catalog, after we read the thing. As toilet paper was just coming into it’s own in our farming community, no one had any. I was introduced to that marvelous plumbing invention, the flush toilet, on my first day of Kindergarten.Mom used an “electric” washing machine. It was a round tub, mounted to four legs on rollers. It came equipped with an “electric agitator.” But, Mom had to heat water to dump in the tub.Mounted towards the back of the tub were two long rollers, one on top of the other. With a hand crank. Mom was able to squeeze all the soapy water out of the clothes.Mom had to attach a garden hose at the bottom of the tank, and drain the “gray water” onto our lawn. As dryers hadn’t been invented yet, after Mom rinsed the soapy clothes in the laundry sink, she hung them up on the clothesline, to dry.Mom used a hand-crank “meat grinder”, in order to help her grind up the pork and beef for her famous meat loaves.Refrigerators hadn’t been invented, yet, so I was impressed by the size of the block of ice the “ice man” put in our ice box. Again, to drain the ice box, we had to attach a garden hose to the fitting at the bottom of the box.The “milk man” brought us our milk, cream, butter, and eggs. The milk came in reusable glass quart bottles, and were kept cool on the front porch with a gunny sack, filled with ice. We always returned the empty bottles and gunny sack.We had a radio. It was actually a wonderful piece of furniture, that was kept in the living room. It was about four feet tall, three feet wide, and about two feet deep. Our radio was made of oak. I remember listening to Dwight David Eisenhower, speaking, as he campaigned for the presidency. I was born when Harry Truman was president.We bought this new-fangled contraption called the television set. It was, quite literally, a box, about two feet in every direction. We set it up on a small table, so we could watch the three or four channels, each of which broadcast between four and six hours a day.When I was old enough, I used our push-mower, which was operated by “.one little boy power.”There were no edgers, power mowers, rototillers, electric hedge trimmers, or power tools of any kind. Dad cut wood with a hand saw, or a cross cut saw. Mom never had a toaster, an electric can opener, a dishwasher, (well, my sisters and I washed dishes. But, we weren’t even equipped with batteries, much less electricity.)There were no Inter Continental Ballistic Missiles, when I was a kid. There was no passenger jet service, when I was a kid. There were no man-made satellites orbiting the Earth. No one had been to outer space.There were no freeways, until Eisenhower became president. I remember them making the freeway by our town, when I was in 8th grade.It wasn’t really as primitive as it sounds.

That's only a little true; lSome people worry about the trees we have to cut down, but paper towels are usually made from recycled wood pulp, and they don’t need the really nasty binders or bleaches. The related problem of paper waste can be solved if we just put a bit of effort in; paper towels are easily biodegradable and can be composted. By fitting paper towels into the middle of a recycling stream, we don't need to cut down any trees, and no trash has to go to a landfill.Long story short, paper towels are a clean, hygienic, and sustainable bathroom solution, and hand dryers are a completely unnecessary replacement that’s actively worse.I’m tired of having soggy hands for no good reason.2020 edit:",137 followers,Alexander Porter,2.4K,284,38.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Are-the-beliefs-about-God-slowly-reducing-due-to-the-advancing-technology

Then I stopped.After I thought about it for a few days I went back and deleted it all.I had a long marriage to this man and I didn’t want to think of him and this woman. It wasn’t that I was in denial. She was not a part of our marriage. I thought focusing on her wasn’t necessary. I just want to remember us together without a third person.I don’t regret this. If I had read the emails I’d remember all of it, all their words to each other, what he may or may not have said about me. Did I need that? No.I have never and will never tell the children.
