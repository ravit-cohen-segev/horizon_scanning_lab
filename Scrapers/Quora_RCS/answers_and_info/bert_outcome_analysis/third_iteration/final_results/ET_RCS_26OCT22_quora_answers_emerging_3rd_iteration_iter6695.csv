The wheat and barley, traditional Euroasian domesticated staple food items, are superior to the corn (of America) and South Africa.

North America populations had to remain low (compared to Europe) until corn arrived around 1000 AD. or so due to lack of a good farm plant.Europe also has many more large mammals which could be domesticated - cows, horses, dogs, sheep, pigs… Americas only had dogs and llamas. Africa had nothing (that could be domesticated - this has to do with something on how early humans colonized the continents).Wheat allows you to have large populations. Large populations can feed ruling caste - priests and kings, which tend to push for warfare on neighbors. Large populations and domesticated animals also create breeding ground for bad germs - most really bad bugs cannot exist in populations less than 500,000 for example.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,12.7K,996,156.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Old-World-evolve-into-a-network-of-technological-innovation-and-advancement-that-surpassed-the-Americas

3,"No, because most war are, and have always been regional. Despite much hystreonics, the greatest threat to human existence is, has been, and will remain for some time, over exploitation of the natural systems on which we ultimately depend.Even at the height of the Cold War, nuclear weapons posed little direct threat to our survival. They might have caused the collapse of civilization, but pockets of humanity would have survived, nature would have survived, and in the long run, nature might actually have come out ahead. Contrary to popular myth, we have never had enough nuclear weapons (or evenNo, because most war are, and have always been regional. Despite much hystreonics, the greatest threat to human existence is, has been, and will remain for some time, over exploitation of the natural systems on which we ultimately depend.Even at the height of the Cold War, nuclear weapons posed little direct threat to our survival. They might have caused the collapse of civilization, but pockets of humanity would have survived, nature would have survived, and in the long run, nature might actually have come out ahead. Contrary to popular myth, we have never had enough nuclear weapons (or even the right sort of nuclear weapons) to sterilize the Earth. Nuclear radiation does not, and never could, produce large-scale mutations and a sea filled with Godzillas (radiation that doesn’t kill outright mostly just increases cancer risk. The already high natural mutation rate would increase after a war, but natural selection would filter out grotesque deformities). The enhanced mutation rate would actually help life evolve to refill niches left vacant by man and his activities.Nuclear war and its aftermath would be horrible, but it would not be the literal end of the world and would almost certainly not be the end of us.A greater threat comes from biological weapons, not just those that infect humans but those that infect our crops. But again, natural variation all but ensures that no disease can be entirely effective. Even pathogen expressly engineering to wipe out humanity would have a very hard time of it. Again, our civilization is at risk, but we—due to our biological and ecological diversity are not, at least on the scale of millenia.What would be a real threat to humanity would be a cobalt bomb. It was proposed in the 1950s that a hydrogen bomb could be so constructed as to produce large quantities of highly-radioactive cobalt-60. A bomb with the mass of a battleship could produce enough intensely radioactive dust to essentially sterilize the surface of the planet for a period of perhaps 20 years. Even this would not wipe out life, as coverage could not be universal, not all life if equally susceptible, and marine life would be somewhat insulated. The global ecology would collapse, which means while humans might well survive in the short run, they might be doomed in the long run, and withing a million years the Earth would be back to nature as if we had never been here.Which is all so say, no, it’s unlikely we will ever reach a point in which war inevitably leads to extinction because that’s hard to achieve and generally not anyone’s objective. The greatest threat to our existence is not that we wipe ourselves out on purpose, but that we do it on accident, by so corrupting the biosphere that it crashes due to some insult, whether natural or man made.",UNKNOWN,Ian,4.5K,13.2K,17.6M,2016,https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Old-World-evolve-into-a-network-of-technological-innovation-and-advancement-that-surpassed-the-Americas

6,"Yes. Humans are the pinnacle of scum. If there was a button to press to end all human life I would mash that button until the button ground to dust. Humans are vile, insipid and incredibly destructive creatures and individually, either humans are sadistic sociopathic scum or they are cowards who refuse to take out the sociopathic trash.It could have gone differently but what happened was humans instead evolved into either sadistic elitist scum or sadistic sycophant scum who gladly exploit and cause misery to each other and to every animal on the planet all to pamper the alpha trash ape. Sure,Yes. Humans are the pinnacle of scum. If there was a button to press to end all human life I would mash that button until the button ground to dust. Humans are vile, insipid and incredibly destructive creatures and individually, either humans are sadistic sociopathic scum or they are cowards who refuse to take out the sociopathic trash.It could have gone differently but what happened was humans instead evolved into either sadistic elitist scum or sadistic sycophant scum who gladly exploit and cause misery to each other and to every animal on the planet all to pamper the alpha trash ape. Sure, there are humans who don’t misbehave, but those humans lack the fortitude to force the sadistic scum to account for their crimes against Earth’s biosphere. Humans are such losers that 7 billion of us are allowing the destruction of the biosphere all to pamper about 400 super-elitists, killing ourselves and millions of other species, while the sadisitic eltisit scum look down intro the pigpen with thigh slapping guffaws and snorts.Humans are such a threat to the biosphere that I want to see chimpanzees wiped out because chimps exhibit every evil vile attribute that humans do. I can easily see chimpanzees millions of years from now rabidly chanting “better a pedophile than a Demochimp, SNARK! SNARK!” in support of a pedophile alpha chimp who rapes and murder baby chimps and then brags about all the chimp pussy he grabs and how CO2 has no effect on climate.And the biggest reason humans deserve extinction, their infinite religious hubris. These piles of homo Sapiens filth PRETEND there is a special Magical Sky Ape of the cosmos who made the entire cosmos, a septillion star systems as an impossibly tiny human ant farm for his own sadistic entertainment. Even when humans try to concoct the perfectly moral being they prove their infinite moral relativism. Our perfect God is an Angry and Jealous God who gushes approval for mass murdering pervert tyrants like King David. God is a petty tyrant who relishes causing pain and suffering for his own sadistic entertainment and we are told that kind of evil is perfectly righteous and good. All religions’ gods are the same piles of infinite moral relativist filth. This shows that humans at their core are the most putred form of evil because they can’t even imagine a just and kind God. Humans are too dishonest, too hypocritical, too stupid and far too sadistic to even imagine a just and loving God.Humans are garbage and the cosmos should take out the trash by evolving a disease that will exterminate this disgusting species, Homo Detritus, down to the last sniveling trash ape. And when the last sniveling trash apes look to the sky to beseech God for help nobody will answer, not even a no, all the magical thinking will come crashing in at last and the last pile of filth humans will know they deserved it.",366 followers,Brett Alder,1.1K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-eventually-evolve-so-far-that-any-war-would-result-in-human-extinction
7,"Original Question: Is it true that humans almost went extinct?Yes, it’s quite true, not once but twice.The first time was around 150,000 years ago during what’s catchily called the Marine Isotope Stage 6 period (named in part because of analysing oxygen isotopes from deep-sea sediment samples). Basically, it was a specific type of ice age when not only did the polar caps and glaciers around the world expand, but deserts did too, due to the atmosphere effectively having moisture sucked out of it by the ice.The atmosphere became very dry right across the world, but from our perspective, this affOriginal Question: Is it true that humans almost went extinct?Yes, it’s quite true, not once but twice.The first time was around 150,000 years ago during what’s catchily called the Marine Isotope Stage 6 period (named in part because of analysing oxygen isotopes from deep-sea sediment samples). Basically, it was a specific type of ice age when not only did the polar caps and glaciers around the world expand, but deserts did too, due to the atmosphere effectively having moisture sucked out of it by the ice.The atmosphere became very dry right across the world, but from our perspective, this affected significant parts of central, eastern and southeastern Africa where, at the time, all known humans lived. It’s estimated that the human population at this time could have dropped down to under 1,000 people.The second near-extinction event was around 70,000 years ago following the eruption of a Sumatran volcano called Toba. Rather, it wasn’t just an eruption but it was a super-eruption, where so much ash and gasses are thrown into the atmosphere that their environmental effects threaten life.It’s estimated that the Toba super-eruption ejected roughly 10,000 times more ash and gas than the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption did and was big enough to significantly dim the sun globally for up to 6 years, resulting in worldwide cooling and a massive dying of vegetation from both cold and poor light. This again brought the human population down, perhaps to somewhere between 1,000 and 5,000 people.This was also the time that early humans began their migration out of Africa and around the world, it’s believed because once the ecosystem had stabilised following the eruption a ‘green corridor’ right the way up the east side of Africa and along the Nile Valley opened up, enabling our ancient ancestors to cross what had formerly been an impassable desert.","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,544,6.8K,91.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-eventually-evolve-so-far-that-any-war-would-result-in-human-extinction

10,"The volcanic aspect of plate tectonics produces very hot water, which cooks life forms that come into contact with it. There are colonies around black smokers that take advantage of the warm water near the hot springs, but you can’t produce a material technology similar to a terrestrial one. Also, a 30-foot deep ocean and active tectonics are probably outright incompatible.
