When I was young, I was one of the best universities among the whole country. I don't know exact number, but Top-20 for sure. I was a legendary university at that time. I used to have a handful of 300-500 hard working and smart students every year. Those students were one of the best in the country. They still are one of the best of the country and continued touching new heights of success every year. Initially, my father had his own well-established business. Until 2008, he never had any money problem. But then afterwards, his business gradually started declining. From 2008-2015, these seven years were very difficult for me, as I was not used to get insulted. I doubled my fees during this time.I managed somehow to perform well. Many parents know my past performance and considered me a great university. Many of my students are highly placed in India and abroad. From being on the boards of multinationals to serving in the Indian Civil Services. Some of them are currently working at headquarters of Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Adobe, Twitter, Cisco, Uber, VMWare etc. But now, at this very moment, my father is extremely dependent on me. Due to his money need, now I feel like an old university that is unable to cope up with the past legendary performance. I teach 1400-1500 students now. I am increasing my fees every year. Those who have more money to shower on me are my new students. They are not those hard working, smart and sophisticated students. These guys live life king size. They have only one motto - ""Drink, Sleep and Enjoy"". Obviously, due to drinking, they fight a lot among themselves.My overall journey is quite comparable to Titanic : ""Superb start, but not so happy end"".PS1 - Sorry for poor English. I lost my touch of English to Punjabi as my new students also don't know English well. Feel free to downvote.PS2 - Some of my fellow Thaparians are getting wrong vibes from my answer. Obviously, Thapar is still a brand in itself but other colleges that are opened recently like DAIICT, BITS-Goa, BITS-Hyd are now in much better position than our college. This is a serious concern for the well wishers of our university.Edit : I am overwhelmed by the support received from so many Thaparians here. I tried to answer the question humorously. Thanks a lot guys.

4,"Some of these have evolved over the years, but others have remained very close to original issue.Probably the bayonet is one of the oldest that is still in use. They have been around since the 1618 time frame, that is two years before the Mayflower landed in Massachusetts and 11 years after the first English speaking settlement at Jamestown, Virginia.

They have been around since the 1618 time frame, that is two years before the Mayflower landed in Massachusetts and 11 years after the first English speaking settlement at Jamestown, Virginia. The last I heard only the Marines were still conducting bayonet training.Combat knives of various designs have been used for many hundreds of thousands of years and are still in use today. We have progressed from flint to steel, but flint will still work. We still have the K-BAR style of knives used by Marine and Army units. In the Air Force we had a wicked little switchblade.Utility knives are in use in every branch of service. A two bladed knife that has a slotted head screwdriver is still being issued. But it is the multi-tool that almost every field troop carries. It used to be the Leatherman, but the Gerber MP-600 is usually the multitool of choice. There are 19 configurations of the MP-600, so there is one for everybody's specialty.Swiss Army knives were the original multitool and still see use today. Again we had to buy our own, as they were made in Switzerland and not the USA they don't meet the Berry Compliant Act.Although rarely used in combat we still use swords ceremonially in the military. Swords date back to 3300 BC, so we have been using swords over 5,320 years now, and I think that this would be the oldest weapon invented that still sees military use by the United States Armed Forces.American Bolt Action Rifles using cartridges that contain smokeless powder go back to the 1903 Springfield. The bolt action is still the rifle of choice for our snipers.The gun model that has seen the longest service in the United States Armed Forces is the M2 (Ma Duece) 50 BMG (Browning Machine Gun) this is our heavy machine gun built in 1933, and despite many attempts nobody has been able to build a better heavy machine for our purposes, and most of the world's nations use it as well. It also fires the oldest cartridge still in use the 50 BMG (12.7 by 99 mm NATO). This cartridge will travel 8000 yards on a huge unreliable trajectory. However it is used as the large, long range sniper round by many countries military snipers. A Canadian sniper used the 50 BMG round in a bolt action McMillan rifle to kill an insurgent at 3542 meters (2.14 miles)The oldest aircraft that is still in service is the B-52H Bomber (BUFF) heavy bomber. The B-52 in various models has been flying for over 65 years, with the last one delivered in 1962. She is in the process of an engine replacement program and is forecast to remain operational through the 2050s, for a 100 year service life.We have had tanks since 1918 in various incarnations. Our latest tank in the 102 years we have used them is the M1A2C Abrams Main Battle Tank. She weighs in at 73.6 tons (147,200 pounds, empty)A surprise to many will be that we have been using rockets since 1846, and we still are today. Our first combat rockets were given to us by the British forces in the field.Cannons go back to the 1100s , and the shorter barreled howitzers in various configurations go back to the 1600s. Today we use both howitzer and paladin self propelled cannons.We have used various forms of cars since the very late 1800s, but didn't truly see them rise to combat use until the first world war when they became capable of carrying armour.Balloons are still in use for certain specialty applications by our military. We first used them in the Civil War of the 1860s, but the French had them in 1794.I have saved the first created for last, as well as the most versatile. The most antiquated weapon in our inventory is the homosapien. We are still using the basic Adam version designed at least 196,000 years ago, although there are slightly taller versions used over the last 300 years. Despite the antiquated design these are vicious deadly weapons that can kill without using any supplemental devices.Original Question: What is the most antiquated weapon or vehicle type in the US military arsenal?","16,063 followers",Pavel Fekula,1.3K,11K,118.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-upcoming-trending-technologies-in-2022

This helps them in staying ahead of their competitors and have a first-mover advantage. If you want to take a peek at what Google is up to, then check out the following upcoming trends with Google:1.

Not only do they keep coming up with new innovations in terms of digital products and services, but they also keep investing in the latest technology trends. This helps them in staying ahead of their competitors and have a first-mover advantage. If you want to take a peek at what Google is up to, then check out the following upcoming trends with Google:1. Ambient Computing:The biggest play that Google has been investing heavily since years is to become omnipresent in our daily lives. Ambient computing is a collection of various computing devices integrating with each other to create an ecosystem that humans keep falling back to. Web browsers to search engines to Chromebooks and home devices, Google is making its presence felt whenever we need anything. Once this reaches a certain maturity level, it would become a massive data mine for Google and draw uncountable revenue.2. Ecommerce:It still surprises me that Google has not ventured into this vast space to put up a fight against Amazon and Walmart. It serves as the middleman pointing fingers towards the best links as per our search terms. Given its user base and broad reach, it has many potentials to monetize it the moment it creates a marketplace and starts selling things. While they haven't named their project, rumor has it that Google is almost ready with the blueprint of launching an eCommerce marketplace which obviously will be quite different from Amazon.3. Project Loon:The fundamental need that Google depends on is the internet. All its services make sense only when you have a decent internet connection. To fulfill this requirement, it is investing heavily in Project Loon that tackles rural and remote areas needing internet connectivity. For this, it will be launching a network of balloons in the Earth's stratosphere. Solar-powered, these balloons cover an area of 40kms and deliver 3G internet speed. Sounds fictional? They have already run test projects in several nations and delivered healthy internet connectivity.4. Project Google Glass:We all have had the fantasy of owning the fancy glasses Tom Cruise had in Mission Impossible. Google is trying to make that possible through Google Glass. Wearable computing has already become a reality with lots of options in terms of watches. But Google is working on transferring that technology directly to your eyes. This will prove to be a game-changer for virtual and augmented reality as well.5. Project Green Energy:Not many would be aware that Google is investing heavily in green energy. It already owns massive wind farms. Well aware that green energy is the future, Google has put a plan in motion for shifting all its massive energy requirements to green energy. Presently it employs the innovative technology developed by Makani Power Company. The wind turbines are flown in the sky like kites to the height of 2000 feet. The small but effective turbines keep rotating and keep generating electricity. This technology is cheap, easy to use, and mobile.Apart from the above significant trends, it would surprise you to know that Google has invested a lot of money in DNA mapping. Maybe they see a lot of potential in the data stored in it from the medical science point of view.","68,790 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-Thapar-Institute-Of-Engineering-and-Technology-conducting-a-live-webinar-for-the-upcoming-batch-of-BE-BTech-2020-students

But they would have an abundance of material on Earth, especially of carbon, which would likely be the building blocks of such an assemblers. If you were carrying a jar of them and tripped and they spilled out, and they had no limit, they would quickly devour the entire earth with no way of stopping them.But here is where things get interesting: These tiny robots would have the ability to construct molecules from atoms, giving them the ability to produce amazing materials like graphene, cubes of apple, and even brain material.With advanced nanotechnology in the form of self-replicators, the entire world would experience a revolution. Think for a second about what wouldn’t change in the face of machines that can produceProduction jobs would cease. The price of every item ever created would be lowered massively. Supercomputers and experiments regarding brain material would become almost commonplace. Terraforming other planets would take years if not months.
