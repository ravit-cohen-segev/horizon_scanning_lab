0,"I have already written lot of answers on this. Please refer to my earlier answers.‘Hyperloop ‘ is the concept to create a transport system that propels pods thru airtight tubes.This could be a mode of transportation that could change how we think about travel.The technology is extremely prohibitive and it has to be made cheaper to make it achievable.It is not only levitation systems , it is also the braking systems ( how do you reduce the speed ).So it still remains futuristic and so it is revolutionary technology for the present.","1,288 followers",Mani Gandham,771,875,3.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Hyperloop-called-revolutionary-technology

After all, when you look inside a trash bin which piece of trash is worst?I’ll give you some of my favorite “worst” bike stuff…The Landrider Autoshift system. They simply didn’t work well, and when they did they failed quickly. I have had to replace hundreds of these things along with their shiftersShimano Airlines. This system used compressed CO2 to operate. When shifting it sounded like a gun going off. Then you have the paradox of a bicycle requiring a greenhouse gas to operateShimano Positron. Instead of using a flexible cable it used a one-strand stiff wire to push AND pull the derailleur into gear. The derailleur had a series of notches that, in theory anyway- placed the chain in perfect alignment with the rear cogs. It makes me puke just thinking about this especially when combining it with the Front Freewheel System, my next contender… this one gets its very own video. Note the stiff link on the chain…Then there is the Lambert/Viscount bottom bracket and crank. The bearings were pressed into the frame which meant you couldn’t use any other crank, and in order to keep the BB spindle in place they used snap rings pushed into slots on the spindle. These ingloriously broke spindles at this slot. On top of that, the square part of the spindle wasn’t tapered so the crank arms wore badly and you couldn’t use any other brand of crank.The cool thing about this is that Lambert was the first bicycle brand to make any parts on a CNC (Computer Numerically Controlled) machine… their big chainringThe venerable Campagnolo had way more than their share of failures. My favorite was their Delta brakes. The only things that break are your hands as you tried to stopThere are MANY more losers out there. I could provide volumes of them but am guessing that most of you won’t make it this far.UPDATE. Since it seems lotsa people want more “bad ideas” here are some more…Lambert/Viscount death fork. The crown and lowers were made of cast aluminum with a steel steerer jammed on the top with 2 roll pins holding it all together. In the Lambert days they didn’t even have the roll pins… they came around after Yamaha bought the companyItoh/Kabuki frame joints. The frame tubes were placed in a mold and the lugs were die cast around the tubing. Neat and effective joint but it was very heavy. The seat post was like a quill stem with an expander so the saddle had to be removed to adjust seat heightSuspension wheel. This was prototyped in the early 1900’s and may have been briefly in production. This is a later model.
