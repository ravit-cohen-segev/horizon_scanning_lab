1,"Kodak, interestingly enough, invented the device of its own demise- the electronic camera. They didn’t pursue it because they were so heavily invested in film and film cameras. They could have been the industry leader in those.Xerox suddenly had lots of competition when its patents ran out and they didn’t prepare for all the competitors who would be offering copiers at half the price. They did make a big investment in Apple Computer.DeBeers is desperately trying to keep a lid on all the fresh supplies of diamond from companies making them with presses.

Because they have a very hungry demand and loads of money and a very intelligent and trained populace.","135,501 followers",Hector Quintanilla,1.9K,1.2K,88.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-of-these-afford-the-greatest-opportunity-for-establishing-businesses-globalization-advancement-technology-or-deregulation
3,"You don’t advance technology as a monolith. Germany is a leader in material science and mechanical engineering.Germany is sub-par in software engineering and in its physical communication infrastructure. This is in part due to persistent cultural wariness of surveillance technologies like social media. People aren’t keen to fund the infrastructure to make mass surveillance easier, and politicians don’t want to be seen as pushing for the capability.Germany also has the capability to advance nuclear technology, but doesn’t due to mass scientific illiteracy among the voting population that falselYou don’t advance technology as a monolith.

Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party. Because radiation from nuclear accidents is apparently scarier than way more people dying of regular pollution constantly and the total annihilation of all life on Earth as the oceans boil away.","135,501 followers",Hector Quintanilla,2.5K,1.2K,88.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-of-these-afford-the-greatest-opportunity-for-establishing-businesses-globalization-advancement-technology-or-deregulation
4,"Yes, the rate of innovation is generally increasing, there has been more technical advance in the last 100 years than in the last 500 years before that. It is an exponential rate of increase and it is likely to continue, there will be more in the next 50 years than the last 50 years. THere are more people generally to innovate and technology generally allows people to do more and more so the rate increases.Bar a huge unforeseen catastrophe (huge meteor strike) then its likely to continue, even things like world wars are hardly noticeable.

This is a chart from Ian Morris, its not on technology advance rather social development over very long periods, but includes energy consumption, information and organisation, so very broadly tracks technology over time, it shows that in modern times there is huge technical advance. IThe chart goes up to 1950, as you can see, one can’t indentify WWI or II, the rate of development being virtually unstoppable. Today is 1000 on the scale, e.g. off the chart.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-of-these-afford-the-greatest-opportunity-for-establishing-businesses-globalization-advancement-technology-or-deregulation
5,"For a Small Scale, Micro Scale, Cottage Industry Business like Dosa Flour, Sevai, Adai Flour or Pickles -The reason for this is simple. You dont need any formalities or bureaucracy.You can make your stuff at home and your partner can carry it on a cycle or vehicle and a small bribe to a cop can ensure you can sell the product and if it is tasty enough - you can get a sustainable business.In fact it is easier to start a Cottage Industry Business in India compared to China or Singapore.Likewise the same for a Thela or a Pav Bhaji or a Dosa Pushcart.

7,"Yes.In fact, it wouldn’t even be considered a conquest by them. If someone can move from star to star in a meaningful way, they are so far ahead of us it’s ridiculous.People often talk about what happened to Native Americans when Europeans arrived, but it’s not even like that. They had at least some chance to fight back.No. What aliens coming by and deciding they want Earth would look like, is this:We are that monkey that burned somewhere in that rainforest clearing fire.

8,"In terms of making “contact” with aliens, you have to look at our current capabilities. We’re very primitive. It takes decades of planning to go to Mars, that’s literally in our backyard and it’s incredibly dangerous for us to walk to our backyard. We’re stumbling toddlers.So, to find aliens of similar technology that means they’re primitive as well.There’s no chance there for an encounter other than a transmission and even then we couldn’t reach each other.The only way it would happen is one species is much further along than us. I would say we would need another 500 years of advancements jusIn terms of making “contact” with aliens, you have to look at our current capabilities. We’re very primitive.
