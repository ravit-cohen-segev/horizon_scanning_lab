1,"Australia did have a fledgling rocket/missile/space programme from the 1950s into the 1960s, largely in conjunction with the UK.In the end, it became too expensive to operate for not much in the result department, but quite a lot of research was carried out on rocket motors, guidance systems and countermeasures.They did have a few wins…","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Australia-not-develop-their-own-rocket-and-space-programme-in-the-1960s-despite-their-advanced-technology-in-aerospace
2,"Q: How will you help the older generation to fully understand and appreciate technology?A: Actually it was us older generation that invented all that technology that you use every day and yes we still have to teach younger generation how to use it and how to stop being such victims for trolls and stalkers on the internet, so the real question is why don’t young people listen to the warnings that we have given them for decades?","246,829 followers",Dushka Zapata,21.7K,8.5K,232.4M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Australia-not-develop-their-own-rocket-and-space-programme-in-the-1960s-despite-their-advanced-technology-in-aerospace

4,"You have to connect math to something THEY value.For engineers you show them what math does.For businessmen you introduce accounting.You can also connect math easily to computer programming, especially computer graphics which would appeal to gamers and those who want to do animation.I wanted to be an engineer since I was 4. Nobody had to get me interested in math because I found out by myself that engineering needs it. Math became a plaything for me.

When I mention to someone much younger than me that I remember when the first house in town had a microwave - I get this look of total amazement! Wow! Microwaves were invented in your lifetime?

While it’s not going away - I think it’s a shame real books aren’t also being used. I still love a real book - the feel and the smell.

About right after this show, Alcala began on a mass murder spree that shook the town.Should I trust my gut feeling?To answer your question, yes.Yes, you definitely should trust your gut feeling. It may not always be correct, but it is your safeguard. It is here to protect you at all costs.Edit: The killing spree was NOT triggered by the rejection on the show.

Perhaps as babies age a bit … and realize they may get held or cuddled and perhaps want just that … it's ok. IBabies? Babies cry because something is bothering them. I don't remember back that far.

11,"Yes. Instincts are programmed behaviors, or attitudes (that then influence behavior) that develop through evolutionary processes over long periods. The rate that instincts emerge or decline depends on the selective pressure, positive or negative, that they bring with them. Now, imagine the world we live in now, with cars, huge cities, internet porn, television, phone dating, food for purchase, and antibiotics. All of these things are less than a few hundred years old. Some happened in this century. All have an influence on our lives, happiness and behavior. Nothing that has developed in the laYes. Instincts are programmed behaviors, or attitudes (that then influence behavior) that develop through evolutionary processes over long periods. The rate that instincts emerge or decline depends on the selective pressure, positive or negative, that they bring with them. Now, imagine the world we live in now, with cars, huge cities, internet porn, television, phone dating, food for purchase, and antibiotics. All of these things are less than a few hundred years old. Some happened in this century. All have an influence on our lives, happiness and behavior. Nothing that has developed in the last thousand years can be instinctual. Its not so much that our instincts are flawed. They still work in hunter-gatherer society. Think about your instincts in terms of mate selection. Why are football players sexier than computer programmers? Because they look like they could take down a mammoth, and stick a spear through an enemy. The maximum number of people we can be close to as friends is about 70; the same number as you might expect to meet over your entire life 10,000 years ago. This is one case where our instincts help us, in that in hunter-gatherer society, if you wronged somebody, you could expect to meet that person, or their kin, and experience justice to match your crime. This helps society hang together in huge cities, even though now you can harm somebody without the expectation of meeting them again. But in most cases, our instinct are out of touch with our current needs, because we have changed the world we live in so rapidly that our genes cannot keep pace.","246,829 followers",Dushka Zapata,681,8.5K,232.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-our-next-generation-going-to-forget-basic-abilities-like-writing-painting-basic-maths-and-poem-recitation-due-to-advancing-technology
