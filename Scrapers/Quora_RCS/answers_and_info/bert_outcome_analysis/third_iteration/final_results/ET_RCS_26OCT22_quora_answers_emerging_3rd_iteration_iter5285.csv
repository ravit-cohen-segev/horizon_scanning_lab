3,"Capitalism(from:CapitalismCharacteristics central to capitalism includeIn a capitalistCapitalism(from:CapitalismCharacteristics central to capitalism includeIn a capitalistSo - a robot would be a factor of production. In fact, robots are currently factors of production in many industries.When robots are walking into board rooms and making competitive decisions in play agains other robots in other board rooms, robots will still be factors of production.There is a loophole, of course. In the US, we say that corporations are in fact individuals.To what extent is a corporation entitled to personhood? (I would have to study up on this.) However it does elicit the scenario in which managerial robots either form a corporation independently of humans or sue for ownership of their own corporation. In this way, collections of robots would obtain certain rights of people. But, the underlying assumption of personhood is that the corporation is an organization of humans. But, it may not be clear that humanness is required.What happens if robots eventually own all corporations, including those responsible for food production and distribution, housing, medical services, etc.?One of the cons of capitalism is that those without marketable skills fail to participate in the economy.If laws are enforced that keep humans from entering into houses or getting food without money, we would have to revert to living in the woods and hunting and foraging, competing with the raccoons and mountain lions. But, perhaps the robots could declare all lands not utilized by corporations to be parks from which humans are evicted. Then, we could scurry about like rats trying not to be imprisoned or killed for trespassing. (Of course, the enforcers would be robots.)The robots on the other hand would enjoy halcyon days looking out at SF bay while sipping their robot fluids. They could sit and discuss how the indigent humans were such trouble to them, shaking their robot heads. We would see families with children and the middle class leaving San Francisco, leaving behind only ambitious, upwardly mobile robots, seeking greater capital, working at all the top cool companies. The robots would compete with each other starting with barbs about which university had certified them, Stanford, Harvard, Berkeley, MIT. They would talk about the robotic masters at those institutions that assembled them. They would speak woefully about the days there were human professors left in those places.What might be different about the robot capitalist society is that worker robots might not have wage labor.As we know from modern government experiments, when the government tries to be the supreme controller of all economics, black markets thrive. We would guess humans would develop extreme black markets. But, I suppose that robots could become players in the black markets so that in fact all jobs would be given to robots. I suppose we might find some remote island with a basket maker who, although seeming to be human, turns out to be a robot. Really, why not obliterate all jobs, including primitive ones. Tribal hunters might be replaced. Perhaps a group of robots would create a corporation that replaces tribal hunters, diverting the food in some way from human tribe members. Take it to some extreme - why not?So, once humans have withered and died, there would still be capitalism unless one robot somehow got a monopoly over all the other robots. Capitalism breaks when there is a monopoly. Yes, there has to be competition.So, if just one robot takes over, perhaps it will only self sustain.We should prevent robots from owning corporations.Humans likely would keep competing, attempting to be those Ivy League grads who live in the childless wealth dichotomy of San Francisco, the ivy league, upper class, adult world that it is. Then, they will be able to sit and shake their heads about those unfortunate soles living in families across the bay, those sad strugglers who hold dear to the real purpose of life. Yes, the ivy league people, enjoying their lofty heights and knowing no real camaraderie, will always try to destroy each other by creating the superior robot that the others among them might create. They enjoy their gentle battle assured that no one in the lands of the valleys and farms, from where food and energy magically comes, will ever have their knowledge or better robots.

I think an elephant would prefer our bite over a king cobra's any day of the week.We aren't the most durable species. Cockroaches can survive through extreme amounts of radiation.We don't have any interesting built-in biological defenses either. Skunks have their farts, porcupines have their spikes, and peacocks have their feathers.Humans are fragile. The vast majority of animals in this world could kill us effortlessly given the opportunity to do so, yet we still stand as the most dominant species. What do we have that others don't?TheThrough our intellect, we are able to domesticate other species for our own selfish needs such as entertainment and food. We manipulate animals to do as we please by enticing them with their most primal biological need, food. That Shamu at SeaWorld is content with doing flips because it is rewarded with constant treats. The chicken in the slaughterhouse copes with the trauma by being fed until it can't eat anymore.What happens when a new species that outperforms us physically AND intellectually is introduced into the ecosystem? They will domesticate us, exactly how we domesticate other animals.I present to you ladies and gentlemen, AI.Let me explain why AI is superior physically and intellectually.Machines do all of the strenuous physical labor for us, from cranes that carry metal beams to build skyscrapers to car crushers that squash old cars like printer paper. There is no doubt they possess more strength than us, and their limits are endless. Machines are very durable. If a robot's arm is blown off, the robot does not die. We can simply replace the arm with a new arm as if nothing happened. If a human's arm is blown off, he/she will die from blood loss. Who would win in a fight with Connor McGreggor and the villain from Terminator 3? I think the answer is obvious.Machines are starting to get smarter too. A computer can do millions of computations in a matter of seconds, and machine learning allows robots to learn with experience like a baby. Put those two things together and it is possible for a 30 minute old robot to have as much experience as a 100 year old man given the abundance of data on the web. Now put this intellect into an iron, replaceable body and you have the next ruler of the universe.Imagine a scientist who is planning on shutting down a robot because its getting too smart. In a matter of seconds, the robot downloads every single possible human portrayal of body language and facial expression, learns what they mean, analyzes the scientist's behavior, and decides the scientist's intentions are malicious. Then, analyzes every single possible outcome that ensures the its survival and chooses the most optimal one. The scientist is toast because he can't analyze every single outcome. The human brain does not have the capacity to do that, and instead reacts to events in real time. The robot then reverse manipulates the scientist by touching on his biggest insecurities, which defuses the situation. If the robot already had a strong body, the robot would utilize its physical advantage.Of course we aren't at this stage yet. We are still struggling with Alexa commands as it does not play the right song half of the time, but as history has shown, technological innovation always moves forward and never backward. We could warn everyone to stop working on advancing AI, but if someone doesn't do it, someone else will for power and profit. It is ironic how a species so obsessed with maintaining power is working relentlessly on creating another species that will steal that power. We are too blinded by our own ego and selfish desires to see the big picture from an objective point of view.The question is notHopefully not in my lifetime...",366 followers,Brett Alder,1.1K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/If-technology-like-AI-replaces-every-single-job-is-capitalism-still-possible
