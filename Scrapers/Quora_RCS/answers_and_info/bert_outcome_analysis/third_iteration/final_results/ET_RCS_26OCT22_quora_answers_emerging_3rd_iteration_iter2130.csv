0,"Incorporating roadways into the IoT network may be one of the most difficult aspects for many people to imagine when they begin to think of smart roads. This is because current roadways have little connection to how we use the internet today. Roadways are inherently “dumb” systems that have little to no connection to networked devices.

Up until recently, roadways were built solely with safety, reliability, and cost effectiveness in mind. However, new efforts are being made to build road systems that incorporate IoT networksand data gathering tools to create road networks where drivers can be smart on the road. Many roads have begun to be retrofitted with sensors that enable them to gather the critical information needed to keep our road infrastructure up and running. State and local Department of Transportation agencies now rely on sensors to monitor changing road conditions and traffic patterns.Future roads would take this a step further, by incorporating interconnectivity into their design parameters. More robust and intelligent data sensors, and the analytics to support them, will enable future roads to be constantly monitored for changes. This information could then be acted upon in an efficient and rapid manner. These target levels of interconnectivity will give transportation managers the information they need most, in real-time. This will allow them to make more informed and intelligent decisions when it comes to road maintenance, usage, and features.",27 followers,Ben Reynolds,1.4K,3.8K,8.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-upcoming-trends-in-smart-roads-Are-there-any-road-technological-companies-that-are-working-on-future-road-plans
1,"PLASTIC ROADSPlastic roads are greatly emerging in India. They have a life of 5 to 10 years. They can bear more wear and tear than normal bitumen roads. Just use 2 to 5% of shredded polyethylene in place of bitumen, lay the road as usual, you are promised a good quality road that needs lesser repetition over the years.","358,840 followers",Sean Kernan,11.7K,5.6K,726.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-upcoming-trends-in-smart-roads-Are-there-any-road-technological-companies-that-are-working-on-future-road-plans
2,"They are quite different. American roads are largely designed and built for cars.British Roads have been used for hundreds, if not thousands of years for people, animals, herds, and carriages and wagons. Cars are a very recent invention on these roads. On the way to my son’s school I have about four miles of these roads. My son took this photo, the road’s maybe eight foot wide with no curb or road markings.This road is a 60mph limit and is a two way road. About every 50 to 100 yards there’s a widening in the road for overtaking. People drive quickly and must remain very alert. In a week’s wortThey are quite different.

About every 50 to 100 yards there’s a widening in the road for overtaking. People drive quickly and must remain very alert. In a week’s worth of driving to school and back I might have to stop and reverse 20 yards to let a train of traffic past. Obviously not all our roads are like this but most people that don’t live in cities will use roads like this fairly often.The roads follow ancient pathways winding their way through the landscape. Aside from motorways (our equivalent to freeways) the roads are twisty, fast and fun. Our cars are different for this reason. They are on the whole smaller and lighter for better handling and cornering as well as having firmer suspension, better brakes and softer tyres for better grip. When driving in the US, I feel like I am captaining a ship, turning the wheel long before the car turns and braking very early unable to stop in time compared to European cars. That’s not a criticism though, American cars are much more suitable for American roads and journeys.Our roads are fast, fun and, due to our extensive driver training system, surprisingly safe.Motorways aren’t that different to any country, including the US, wide, fairly straight and well signposted. This is the junction from the M1, the main motorway heading north from London at my turn off.",688 followers,Don Scult,1.6K,1.9K,6.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-upcoming-trends-in-smart-roads-Are-there-any-road-technological-companies-that-are-working-on-future-road-plans
3,"There is a company that is now designing special, glow in the dark paint that you can lay over roads or sidewalks:Specifically, this would be useful for people who are going on evening strolls.It would also be helpful in reducing injuries incurred by people while walking at night.
