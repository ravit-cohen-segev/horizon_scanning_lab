0,"The largest scale currently used is likely to be pumped hydro. Simply because with every hydro plant, its very easy to turn it into a battery. Other methods of compressed gas underground are simply not popular enough due to the added cost of building or retrofitting old mines.Solid state batteries are getting increasingly popular though they have yet to be deployed on the scale of pumped hydro.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-peak-shaving-technology-currently-on-the-market

4,Of course not. I remind you that at one time during the early 20th century US Patent Department considered closing because they thought everything had been invented.

10,"No technology can claim to have reached its peak at any time. Things keep evolving as new materials and ideas come up. New applications crop up, and in turn add their requirements on new types of capacitors to be developed. This thing happens in every field.

11,"How can better capacitors make better computers? I'm going to go off on a slightly different tack from other answers and tell you how about howRon Garrett'sDRAMThere is one indispensable use case for capacitors in general-purpose computing devices:How can better capacitors make better computers? I'm going to go off on a slightly different tack from other answers and tell you how about howRon Garrett'sDRAMThere is one indispensable use case for capacitors in general-purpose computing devices:This is the main form of fast, high-density, low-power random-access memory* used in modern computers, tablets, and smartphones. And we just can't get enough of it:And we need to be able to get data into and out of this memoryThat might sound pretty abstract, but it is usedConventional DRAMThe DRAM cell (one bit of memory) is a pretty simple structure, consisting of a storage capacitor to hold charge, and a single access transistor to mediate access between the cell and the ""outside world."" (Contrast this with the more complexIn brief, when the DRAM cell's wordline is ""on,"" the storage capacitor is connected to the bitline‚Äîby which the stored voltage or charge can be read‚Äîand when the wordline is ""off,"" the storage capacitor is isolated and the charge is retained. In reality, the charge slowly leaks out of the cell, which is why DRAM needs to be periodicallyIn brief, when the DRAM cell's wordline is ""on,"" the storage capacitor is connected to the bitline‚Äîby which the stored voltage or charge can be read‚Äîand when the wordline is ""off,"" the storage capacitor is isolated and the charge is retained. In reality, the charge slowly leaks out of the cell, which is why DRAM needs to be periodicallyOne of the typical traditional implementations of a DRAM storage capacitor in a silicon chip is as a trench coated with successive thin films of conducting andWhat's wrong with DRAM?For our present purposes, the problem with DRAM is that it can't easily be manufactured on the same die as a high-density, high-speed digital logic circuit. An efficient DRAM manufacturing process produces charge storage devices with low leakage (high resistance) and high capacitance. But high resistance and high capacitance isSo DRAM memory normally has to be manufactured in a physically separate die from a CPU. Now your computer motherboard contains two chips instead of one. No big deal, especially for a desktop computer where there's plenty of room inside the case, right?So whyRemember how I mentioned above that a computer's speed is often limited by memory bandwidth, by how fast the CPU can get data into and out of memory? Take a look at this picture of a 2GiB laptop memory module (contains about 16 billion bits of DRAM):There are a couple of hundred gold pins at the bottom, by which the DRAM is connected to the motherboard and the CPU. Basically, that means there are only a coupleThat's a major bottleneck.Integrating DRAM into a CPUIf we could combine DRAM memory into a CPU or GPU, we could vastly increase our memory bandwidth. A modern CPU or GPU contains billions ofAs a result, there has been a lot of research intoIntel's Haswell processors withFor some details of how it's done, you can read the paper announcing this technology, ""","246,851 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.4M,2015,https://www.quora.com/When-the-wheel-was-discovered-it-transformed-the-way-humans-lived-forever-Do-you-believe-humans-have-reached-the-peak-of-inventing-life-altering-technology
