It used to be common to run cables from the pilots controls to the devices, which can get complex on a large airplane.Then came hydraulic actuation.

It used to be common to run cables from the pilots controls to the devices, which can get complex on a large airplane.Then came hydraulic actuation. This gave the pilot a significant increase in his ability to move heavy controls at a distance from him, however hydraulics are heavy and maintenance prone. But it also required a lot of electrical wiring for power and position control, adding weight to the aircraft.Then came fly-by-wire with electrical actuation of devices that replaced hydraulics. This entailed putting an electrical actuator at the device and wiring to connect it to the pilots controls. Much lighter than hydraulics and far less maintenance prone.But the main thing to remember, it is not just a single strand of wire connecting the pilot to the device, there are usually several wires involved, for power, backup power, position sensing, temperature monitoring and other functions specific to the device. Which means a multi wire cable with fat connectors at each end.And for connecting electronic devices, radios, GPS, etc. really fat cables are involved, some times several. Note that every cable needs to be electrically shielded from external interference, and that shielding adds even more weight.Fly-by-light is simply using a fiber optic cable (glass or plastic) to carry control signals from the pilot to the device and status signals back from the device to the pilot. Plus a single or dual strand of wire for just plain power. Far simpler and lighter than FBW installations, a single strand...",UNKNOWN,Deep Sarkar (दीप सरकार ),2.3K,669,2.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-Fly-by-Light-will-replace-Fly-by-wire-control-systems-on-aircraft-How-matured-do-you-think-the-Fly-by-Light-technology-is-as-of-now

8,"I think the answer is pretty clear because it has happened before, at least twice.200 years ago 97% of the American population was farmers. Now just 1% of the population grows enough food for the rest of us plus a lot of the rest of the world. This is because of automation through things like steel plows, tractors, harvesters, irrigation systems, fertilizers, pesticides, and improved seeds. This happened fairly quickly too. What happened?

Huge numbers of people left their farms and became factory workers, making steel, cars, wire, pipe, engines, pumps, etc. and becoming secretaries, telephone operators, miners, journalists, movie stunt men, landscapers, interior decorators, artists, musicians, telegraph operators, newspaper delivery guys, truck drivers, and a million other things that those farmers in 1800 could never have imagined.The same thing has happened in the past 50 years too. Back in the 1960’s there were huge numbers of secretaries, telephone operators, printing press operators, car mechanics, etc. doing jobs that are non-existent or a faint shadow of what they once were. They have been replaced with computers mostly but with other technologies too. What happened? They got new jobs as webmasters, baristas, YouTube performers, yoga trainers, network installers, sushi chefs, search engine optimization experts, topiary artists, and another million things that could not have been predicted in 1960.I can’t tell you what the big new employment opportunities there will be in 50 years any more than my grandfather in 1960 could tell that his grandson would be building computer simulations of cargo terminals, but there’s always plenty to do out there to make the world a better place.But for a moment let’s consider what would happen if literally every useful thing that could make our lives better were to suddenly just happen without any need for our lifting a finger. You want dinner? Boom, the best food any time you want it. You want a better house with a beach view? Boom. You feeling lonely? Boom! Instant girlfriend! Feeling bored? Boom a perfect adventure! Want to see a movie better than anything from Hollywood today (a low bar these days, I know)? Boom! You want a star ship to explore the galaxy in? Boom. That isn’t possible of course, but if it were, you are right that there wouldn’t be an economy anymore, but why would we need one? Everything you could ever want is just instantly provided for you. The problem in that world is not economic collapse but how to not turn into the Eloi from The Time Machine or the fat people on scooters from the space ship in Wall-E.

When school reopened he had the option of attending 100% online or physically. We encouraged him to do it online, but after a week he was starting to complain-cloud not sleep so well at night, kept falling asleep during the digital classes. So we let him go to physical school, but there most of his friends stayed locked down at home. By the end of November he was showing definite signs of depression. So I reached out to his fiends parents, at first individually then we had a few zoom discussions and nearly all shared my concerns. So we have made a few adjustments. For example we scheduled field trips to local parks and trails and to the beach.So yes, digital will probably remain at a high level, but there’s no doubt in my mind that face to face time is not just essential, but an absolute necessity.","6,248 followers",Pratiti Guha,16.2K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/President-Biden-states-frequently-that-his-administration-will-replace-1-7-million-fossil-fuel-jobs-with-high-paying-union-jobs-No-viable-large-scale-technology-exists-to-replace-these-jobs-What-are-his-plans
