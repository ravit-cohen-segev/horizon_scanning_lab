They'd give companies and individual faster computers, and let well-off parents give birth to smarter, better-looking children without genetic defects.Breakthroughs in solar and battery technlogy, on the other hand, could be truly disruptive. It would kill most of the coal and petroleum industries, dramatically alter how electricity is created and distributed and stop vast amounts of pollution from being generated. Funny thing, though, that probably wouldn't be a big change for middle-class people in wealthy countries. We might pay lower electric bills, but we'd barely notice the difference.  The real change is that, 50 years from now, when we'd otherwise go through dramatic energy shortages, we'd be able to hum along comfortably like nothing had happened.","29,921 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,5.9K,7.7K,249.7M,2014,https://www.quora.com/What-breakthroughs-in-science-and-technology-might-we-make-in-the-next-fifty-years-that-could-change-the-world-as-we-know-it-today

The pollution of cities and a large percentage of greenhouse gas emissions will have been eliminated.As a button shows, I received some time ago, a brief summary of some innovations that, as a prediction, offer us an inexorable future in progress. I think your reading is very appropriate because it speaks precisely of what you are interested in knowing. This brief summary talks about the rest of your days.1- The auto repair shops will disappear.2- The gasoline / diesel engine contains 20,000 car components. An electric motor has only twenty. Electric cars are sold with a lifetime warranty and are only repaired by dealers. It only takes 10 minutes to remove and replace a new electric motor.3- Defective electric motors will not be repaired at the dealer's workshop, but will be sent to a municipal or regional repair shop where robots and intelligent systems will repair them.4- When a light comes on that indicates a malfunction of the electric motor, you can drive it to a place where besides a car wash station there will be a place where, while you have a good coffee, your car will be equipped with a new electric motor.5- The service stations will disappear or become electric charging stations, slow or fast, for all types of vehicles.6- All the edges of the sidewalks of the streets and the public and private parking lots will have electric recharging points. The companies will install electric charging stations that, in fact, are already installed in cities where they have already begun their transition to electric mobility, such as Oslo, Amsterdam, Paris, San Francisco, San Jose, San Diego, Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Montreal, Portland, etc., among others.7- The main manufacturers of road vehicles have already allocated funds to start building new plants where only electric cars are manufactured.8- The coal industries will disappear. The oil companies will leave. The oil drilling will stop. So say goodbye to OPEC. The Middle East will get into trouble.9- There are already ZEB technologies,10- A baby born within a decade will not see gasoline cars more than in museums.The FUTURE is moving faster than most of us can handle.11- In 1998, Kodak employed 170,000 people and sold 85% of all the photographic papers in the world. In just a few years, their business model disappeared and they went bankrupt. Who would have thought that this would happen one day?12- What happened with Kodak and Polaroid will happen with many companies in the next 5 to 10 years ... and most people do not see it coming. Volkswagen will no longer have any other opportunity to cheat.13- Did you think in 1998, that three years later, you would never take photos in a movie camera? Did you buy a digital camera? Nowadays, with smartphones, who has a digital camera to take pictures, if we have smart phones?14- Even when digital cameras were invented in 1975. The first digital camera only had 10,000 pixels, but they followed Moore's law. Then, as with all exponential technologies, it was a disappointment for a while, before taking off and becoming the only camera reference in the market, and it did so in just a few years.15- Now this pace of innovations or more will happen again - but this time everything will happen much faster - thanks to Artificial Intelligence applied to commercial sales, to artificial intelligence applications in professional activities such as intelligent health systems systems, to autonomous and electric automobiles, to education assisted by Artificial Intelligence, to 3D printing, to intelligent agriculture and to jobs based on Shared Intelligence, SI, which will modify the generic competences of workers.16- Do not forget to read the books17- The intelligent software has penetrated and will continue to penetrate most of the traditional sectors, during the next 3 to 10 years.18- The UBER platform is just a software tool, they do not have cars and now it is the largest taxi company in the world.19- Airbnb is now the largest digital hotel platform in the world, although they do not own an apartment.20-21- In the United States, young lawyers can no longer find work. With22- The23- Facebook now has a form recognition software that is able to recognize faces better than humans. By 2030, computers will be smarter in the vast majority of jobs than humans. Only human-machine collaborative work based on SI (Shared Intelligence) will have a future.24- Autonomous cars: in 2018, the first autonomous electric vehicles began to circulate in some parts of the United States. In the coming years, we will see how the entire automotive industry will begin to be affected. In about five years or sooner, you will not have to own a car, in addition to shared electric vehicles, you can also call a car with your phone, it will appear at your location and take you to your destination.25- You do not need to park the autonomous electric car, you will pay only the distance traveled and you can work or rest while driving. Many of today's youngest children will never have a driver's license and will not own a car either. The public transport, the shared electric car and the autonomous taxi will make it possible.26- This deployment will change our cities because we will need from 90% to 95% fewer cars on the streets before the end of the century. Thus, cities will be able to convert old parking spaces into pedestrian zones and green parks.27- Around 1.2 million people die each year, worldwide as a result of traffic accidents, even distracted or intoxicated. Now we have an accident every 62,137 miles; Thanks to autonomous driving, the accident rate will be reduced, becoming: an accident every ten million km. This ratio will save an extra million lives every year in the world.28- Most traditional vehicle manufacturers will surely go bankrupt. They will try to give you an evolutionary approach or they will simply build a better car, while the technology companies (Tesla, Apple, Google) will give you the revolutionary approach and build autonomous cars as if they were computers with wheels.29- Observing what the vast majority of the world's car manufacturers are doing now. As of this years, Volvo will not manufacture more cars with internal combustion engines. All 2019 models, all will be exclusively electric or hybrid, with the aim of eliminating hybrid models.30- Many Volkswagen and Audi engineers are completely terrified by Tesla and should be. There is more to observe all the companies that already offer electric vehicles. Something that was unheard of just a few years ago.31- The insurance companies will have big problems because, since without accidents, the costs will become much cheaper. The model of your car insurance will disappear.32- Real estate will change. Because if you can work while traveling, people will leave their towers to settle in more beautiful and affordable neighborhoods in the periphery.33- Cities will be less noisy and will not pollute the environment because all new cars will run on electricity.34- The cities will also look much healthier.35- The electricity will be incredibly cheap and clean.36- Solar energy and wind energy have known an exponential growth curve during the last 30 years, but now we can see the impact will be increasing. Fossil energies will be banned.37- Fossil energy companies are desperately trying to limit access to the network to avoid competition from domestic solar installations, but this abuse that undermines freedom of trade, simply can not continue because non-fossil technologies are much more competitive38- Health: The price of Tricorder X will go down a lot. Currently, there are companies that manufacture a medical device (called Star Trek Tricorder) that will work with your phone, which will take your retinal scanner, your blood sample and the rhythm of your breathing. Currently there are more than 70 biomarkers capable of identifying almost all diseases. There are also dozens of telephone applications available now for health reasons.39-Today, in the case of a gasoline vehicle, the sum of the weight of a 15-gallon gasoline tank (110.2 lbs, 45 kWh efficient) and the weight of the induction motor is 837.8 lbs. The total weight represents a total weight of 948 lbs. On the other hand, in the case of the electric vehicle, the weight of the batteries of a 60 kWh electric car is 882 lbs and if we add the weight of an electric motor of 67 lbs. The total also represents approximately 948 lbs. Which means that vehicles have the same energy density. The same would start to happen with commercial airliners.40. At present, substantial improvements have already been made with respect to the increase in the energy density of batteries for airplanes, which will grow between 5 and 8% per year. This means that we can achieve that this ambitious objective, consisting of the fact that the kerosene planes capable of transporting 150 passengers up to a distance of about 683.5 miles were all electric, would be fulfilled at the beginning of the 2040s decade. The biokerosene could be used in larger aircraft, until the technology allowed to use only electric batteries aided by the electrical generation from solar energy.WELCOME TO TOMORROW: although, in fact, it arrived a few years ago.Let's wake up with the desire to prepare for the future, so that the challenges of the 21st century do not surprise us as usual. Instead of strangling us with narrow thoughts, which prevent us from adapting to changes in a non-traumatic way, it is necessary to eliminate unnecessary obstacles in the spirit. We need to be owners of our future and thus enjoy our world as a better place that will allow all human beings to find the lost paradise.","5,084 followers",Bobby Tatro,3.9K,2.2K,45.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-breakthroughs-in-science-and-technology-might-we-make-in-the-next-fifty-years-that-could-change-the-world-as-we-know-it-today

We know how that statement turned out.It would seem that science is on the cusp of some significant biological breakthroughs which might alter what it is to be human in terms of capabilities and possibly lifespan. New unimaginable materials may revolutionize the transportation and electronics industries which would help accelerate the progression of society. At the same time, there is a darker dialectic side to technology, whereby evil applications of these same technologies will coincide with those that help propel society forward. It is the unknown synthesis between the two conflicting forces, which in the end might help elevate and propel the human race forward.

And it's not ""artificial consciousness"".Everyone is afraid that AI will suddenly wake up, get upset, and take over the world.Or that AI will wake up and take all of our jobs. This will happen. But without the ""wake up"" part.Below I describe what real AI is.If we want to understand the “existential threat” we first need to know what AI is.Then, if you are at a cocktail party and someone says, ""but what if robots are intelligent?"" you can argue with facts, mixed with a little bit of alcohol.---------A) STATISTICSStatistics is at the heart of most AI programs.Just like statistics is at the heart of a lot of human decision making.For instance, if you see clouds in the sky, your brain thinks: ""Hmmm, the last 100 times I saw clouds this dark, it usually meant it was about to rain"".When you think like that, you are using statistics to make the decision: ""I should _probably_ go inside now.""I'll give an AI example: Siri or Alexa. How does Alexa understand the words you just said?In 1989 I was visiting Carnegie Mellon to decide if I would go to graduate school there.One of the graduate students, Kai-Fu-Lee (now one of the most famous investors in the world and I would check out his excellent recent TED talk on AI) showed me what he was working on:It was speech recognition for the 60 or so commands that might happen on a Navy battleship (ten guesses as to who was funding his project).When you say the word ""Fire!"" a sound wave is created. When you say the word ""hello"" a sound wave that looks different is created.If 100 people say ""Fire"" and 100 people say ""hello"", all of those sounds waves are stored in a database.Now, if a brand new person says ""Hello"" the computer program needs to determine if that person said ""Hello"" or ""fire"".There might be 10 different attributes of every sound wave. It breaks the new person's sound wave into those 10 attributes.Then it compares that ""vector"" of 10 attributes with all of the vectors in its database for ""Hello"" and ""Fire!""It uses a statistical technique called ""Hidden Markov Analysis"" to determine if the sound wave is more like the ""hello""s in the database or more like the ""Fire!"" in the database.Then it says to itself, ""This guy said ""Hello"". ""It then has a line of code that says, ""If someone says ""Hello"" Then say ""Hello"" back"".Additionally, it adds your ""Hello"" to its database.Your ""Hello"" might be slightly different than the other 100 ""Hello""s so it just learned a new way to say ""Hello"". That gives it greater ability in the future to recognize the word ""hello"".In other words, it ""learned"".So it used Statistics to hear you, code to respond to you, and database technology to learn. There's no real intelligence there but it feels like it's intelligence.Multiply that by 30 years and millions of patterns and computers a million times faster and you have Alexa and Siri in today's kitchens.Ask ""Siri"" what gender it is.-----B) EVALUATION FUNCTIONI just mentioned about language recognition. But how does a self-driving car work?Every second it has to make a decision. Does it move forward? Does it brake? Does it swerve to avoid an accident? Does it turn left?How does it get from point A to point B?1) Google Maps. - Using GPS it knows where it is. And it puts itself on Google Maps.2) List all of the possible routes. This is a ""hard"" problem in the mathematical sense (there's no way for it to guess the fastest route. It has to list each route and then sort by the shortest. )But now computers are so fast what would normally be a slow decision (drive me from this corner in Piscataway, New Jersey to the capital building of Sacramento, California) now just takes seconds.3) Waze. Use Waze to eliminate the routes with too much traffic.4) Start driving.5) Statistics: Every microsecond it uses statistics to see if there is blank space or an object that must be avoided or a traffic sign that must be followed.6) Decide what to do according to the code. For each traffic sign, it has code that tells it what to do (if a sign says ""Stop"" it Stops for a second, uses Statistics to see if any traffic is happening on its sides (with radar and cameras to provide the images). )If there is a person standing in front of it, it might just stop.If there's traffic it didn't expect, it might trigger the program to re-route.If it's blank space it will just keep going.If there's a baby crossing the street and it has to swerve to avoid hitting it, but if swerving will cause the car to hit a truck, killing the passenger in the car, then the ""AI"" of the car is dependent on the ethical decisions of the programmer of the car.In other words, in every situation, it determines it's options, then uses an ""evaluation function"" programmed by a coder, to determine which option has the most successful outcome (move the trip forward, don't kill anyone).Eventually the evaluation function will NOT be programmed by a human coder.Instead, through thousands of experiences of other self-driving cars, the experiences plus the outcomes will all be put into a central database.When a new experience is encountered, the code will look up that experience in the database and the database will spit back the best possible outcome.The code will learn statistically what the best outcomes are of each possibly decision and change the code accordingly and send updates to all self-driving cars.-----C) TREESThe hardest game in the world is a board game called GO. With chess, if a computer can evaluate a billion possibilities a second, it can be a world champion level player.But a Go game can involve trillions of possibilities. How did Google make a program, Deep Go, to beat the world's best Go player. This was thought to be impossible.And yet Google did it.For any game, a computer program first builds a tree of possibilities. Much like a human would.A human thinks: ""If I make this move in checkers, my opponent might respond with A, B, or C and then I can do D, E, or F and then my opponent can do G, H, I if I do D or it can do J, K, L if I do E and I'm never going to do F.A computer doesn't select as well as a human so it builds the FULL tree. Meaning, what are ALL of the possible moves it can do, what are ALL of the possible responses of my opponent, etc.And then it uses a programmed evaluation function to look at the leaves of the tree it built.Whichever move results in the best leaf of the tree (as determined by the evaluation function) that is the move it makes.That's how computer chess worked for decades. I'll get to the secret sauce in a second for how computers conquered chess.And then after that I'll describe how computers miraculously conquered Go.It's only a miracle until science can explain it. It's only ""intelligence"" until it can be coded by a programmer.D) HARDWAREEverybody thought for decades (including many Nobel Prize winners) that the best computer chess programs would be developed when scientists encoded the knowledge of the best chess players in the world into the evaluation function.How does the world champion value a position instead of a weak player?This turned out to be wrong.The MORE code in the evaluation function (i.e. the ""smarter"" the evaluation function was from a human perspective) the SLOWER the program.Which meant a smaller tree would be built, which meant less possibilities would be analyzed.What really allowed the programmers at IBM to build ""Deep Blue"" which beat Garry Kasparov in 1997 were two things.Both related to hardware.a. Computers got faster.And finally, they made the evaluation function STUPID in order to use less code so the hardware could value more positions.Then, before anyone caught on to their ""artificial intelligence"" they retired Deep Blue right after it beat the World Champion of chess.As hardware gets faster, artificial intelligence gets ""smarter"".[as an aside, I once gave a date a chip that was the initial chip for “Chip Test” - the “ancestor” of what became the best chess computer, Deep Blue. She was weirded out.]----INTERLUDEWhat I just described is all the basics. You can stop now.The rest of artificial intelligence is simply combining the basics to make more advanced techniques.-----E) STATISTICS + TREERemember the TREE from computer gaming. And STATISTICS from speech recognition.Now let's go to the impossible game of Go. Google developed the program ""AlphaGo"" to win at Go when everyone else thought it would take another 20 to 50 years.First, remember Kai-Fu Lee who worked on speech recognition. And later developed Apple's first attempts at speech recognition in the 90s?At one point in his grad student days, he was getting tired of navy battleship commands (as one does) and decided to focus on building a program to play Othello.He ended up building the world champion of Othello.He took a lot of games, let's say a million, and put them in a database. And each position from each game, he would label, ""winning"" (if it was a position on the winning side) or ""losing"" in a massive database.He would identify several attributes of each position (how many white pieces, versus black pieces, how many corners were controlled, how many pieces were on the sides, etc).Now, if the computer was playing a brand new game, it would determine all the attributes of that position, then use Hidden Markov Analysis (remember: speech recognition) to match that position to the database.If the position pattern-matched a ""winning position"" then it would make the move that would lead to that winning position. If it matched a ""losing position"" it would not make that move.That program became the world champion of Othello.AlphaGo took it one step further.It put in the positions of millions of Go positions and did the same sort of breakdown.It used faster hardware to speed up the process.Then, once it became pretty good at GO, it played BILLIONS of games against ITSELF to put many BILLIONS of new positions into the database. In other words, it ""learned"".Now it was ready to play Go. It crushed the world champion------That's basically it. That's all of artificial intelligence.Let's say a bank wanted to fire all of the employees in charge of lending. And replace them by artificial intelligence.How would the bank lend money?Well, there's 100s of millions of loans already out there. And for each person who has ever borrowed money I know:- their ageI can put all these vectors in a database and divide them into people ""most likely to pay back the loan"" and people ""most likely to default"".Then, just like speech recognition or the Othello program above, I can use statistics to determine who I should loan money to.And if I say ""no"", I don't have to explain. On to the next one!---Let's say I want to fight terrorists.I already have examples of many terrorists who trained in the US and then went on to perform or attempt acts of terror.I know everything about their bank accounts. How often they transferred money. How often they traveled. How often they took out cash versus using a debit card.And so on.I can build a vector of attributes of what a terrorist bank account looks like. Then I can match new people against that database of vectors of terrorists.Believe me, every time you do a bank transfer, some AI program is out there trying to determine if you are a terrorist.----This is all that AI is.It is nothing more. It's not ""intelligent"" from a human sense. It's not conscious, nor will it ever be.Here's how AI has improved in the past forty years (and how it will improve the next 40):- statistics has gotten betterWhat is changing the fastest is data. The land grab of modern society is not land, or gold, or oil.It's data.I have been invested in many companies that collect and sell data. I was an early investor (and on the board of)Believe me when I say, data-driven companies know how many strawberries you ate last summer.And right now that data is used mostly to target you for ads about sneakers. Or politics.But this is AI 1.0. Soon that data will be used to target your every movement, your every want, your every need.Amazon Prime won't be about delivering you what you want tomorrow. Amazon Prime Plus will be about delivering you what you want yesterday.Police 2.0 will be like the movie ""Minority Report"".Even art and music will be driven by AI that studies the neurochemical responses to music you like to music you don't like. And then compose accordingly.Where will humans still be unique?I don't know. Ask the humans with AI implants that enhance their brains so when they look at you they know exactly what answers will make you happy.BUT… will AI replace jobs?The answer (at least in the next decade or so…) is NO.Look at recent examples:A) Many people were worried ATM machines would replace bank tellers.Instead, the banks made so much in profits they opened up more branches than ever, creating new jobs.B) Will autonomous delivery services cost jobs.Right now there are millions of truck drivers involved in delivering goods. With autonomous delivery, less people will go shopping, more people will be required to shop in the aisles, finding products for people.Obviously this is not a high-end job. But this replaces the fact that less cashiers and drivers will be needed.Meanwhile, there will be more high-end jobs. More maintenance engineers for the cars, customer service, marketing, etc.C) Ecommerce. Branding will become less important (branding is VERY important when everyone is shopping at the big box store but advertising will have to become more clever and digital) so the millions in profits that are generated from AI will filter down to more people starting e-commerce ventures and the ancillary businesses associated with that.)Final conclusion:This is probably a net NEGATIVE for society as the higher classes will be able to afford “super AI” capabilities, making them demi-gods to lower-classes.Instead, massive profits will be generated, which will be soaked into the economy through a rising stock market, increase in opportunities, etc.",78 followers,Rajan Singh,1.5K,360,25.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-breakthroughs-in-science-and-technology-might-we-make-in-the-next-fifty-years-that-could-change-the-world-as-we-know-it-today
