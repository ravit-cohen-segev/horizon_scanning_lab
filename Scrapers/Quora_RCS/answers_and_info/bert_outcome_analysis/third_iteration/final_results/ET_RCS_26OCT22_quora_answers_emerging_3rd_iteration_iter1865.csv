PhD Organic Chemists need exceptional lab skills, Chemical Engineers do not. On Chemical Engineering courses at university you will be using mostly chemical plant and pilot scale plant rather than laboratory glassware. The manufacturer installs that sort of equipment.Pilot scale polystyrene manufacturing plant :Chemistry lab skills aren’t that important for practicing Chemical Engineers.

1,"Absolutely, let me tell you my personal story then you can decide whether it is good or Bad career option.When I was opting for Chemical Engineering in 2009, all my friends were opting for Electronics and Telecommunications or Computer Engineering. Everyone responded weirdly when they get to know that I am opting for a branch which people usually prefer when they are not getting admission in their desired branch so that they can change it in second year if possible. No topper opts for Chemical engineering atleast in small towns.When my father's friends used to ask me “Beta konsi branch main hoAbsolutely, let me tell you my personal story then you can decide whether it is good or Bad career option.When I was opting for Chemical Engineering in 2009, all my friends were opting for Electronics and Telecommunications or Computer Engineering. Everyone responded weirdly when they get to know that I am opting for a branch which people usually prefer when they are not getting admission in their desired branch so that they can change it in second year if possible. No topper opts for Chemical engineering atleast in small towns.When my father's friends used to ask me “Beta konsi branch main ho?” I used to reply “Chemical Engineering”, they used to give me a sympathetic nod and say “Accha hai accha hai wo bhi achi branch hai”. For a year I had to convince people that so could have got any branch but I wanted to do research and this branch has immense scope then any other branch. But then I stopped explaining my choices, as Prof. Dumbledore said in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone, “It’s not our abilities that show what we truly are, it's our choices”.In one of my introductory sessions in Engineering Mechanics (usually taught by a Civil Engineering department faculty), I was being asked “Why you chose Chemical Engineering?” to which I replied “Because I want to be a Scientist” and whole class started laughing. By the end of first semester, I topped in the very subject in my whole college comprising 11 branches of Engineering including Mech., Electrical, Civil, Computer etc. Then the same professor gave me the title ofI was topper for 8 semesters in my Undergraduate, then I cleared GATE without any coaching by just studying for 2 months, let down admissions in IITs over ICT Mumbai (Mecca of Chemical Engineering in India,And my journey hasn't ended yet.I believe if you are passionate and goal oriented, the stream doesn't matter that much. Because our dreams gets changed with time so go with the flow and make heaven for yourself from whatever life throws at you.Best of Luck",754 followers,Sarang Nath,1.5K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/I-have-a-love-for-chemistry-and-upcoming-technology-Is-chemical-engineering-a-good-choice-What-can-I-do-after-chemical-engineering
