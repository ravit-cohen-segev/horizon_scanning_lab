There are a few JVM languages I’m quite interested, such asLikewise, while I’m not the biggest fan of JavaScript, it is proving to be a rather interesting platform for language development. I believe this is largely because JavaScript is unavoidable on the web, but people are desperate to avoid it.I think this division of labor is something that we’re going to see continue very much in the future of language design: There are going to be low-level but abstract compiler targets, and then there’s going to be the languages built on top of them. I also think we’re just going to keep seeing static analysis tools getting better and better and provide “zero-cost abstractions” for what used to be considered very high-level language features.","29,209 followers",Mattias Petter Johansson,1.9K,1.1K,16.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-emerging-technology-that-we-can-learn-without-knowing-programming-language
5,"The word ""language"" in both terms leads people to suppose that natural languages and computer languages have more in common than they actually do. Natural languages exist to facilitate inter-human communication of feelings, needs, desires, and activities, with as much breadth and flexibility as possible. The variations in goals, usages, and formulations are practically endless. Language use, grammar, syntax, and lexicon are close to chaotic, especially if you compare multiple languages. Instructions or commands consitute only a tiny fraction of language use, and most of those given are ignoredThe word ""language"" in both terms leads people to suppose that natural languages and computer languages have more in common than they actually do. Natural languages exist to facilitate inter-human communication of feelings, needs, desires, and activities, with as much breadth and flexibility as possible. The variations in goals, usages, and formulations are practically endless. Language use, grammar, syntax, and lexicon are close to chaotic, especially if you compare multiple languages. Instructions or commands consitute only a tiny fraction of language use, and most of those given are ignored or disobeyed.Computer languages exist to help humans control computers, to accomplish specific and concrete tasks. Flexibility and variability in language use are very limited. Computer languages strive to avoid chaos, ambiguity, and disorder. Virtually every statement in a computer language is a command.In spite of these profound, fundamental differences, many skills are transferable between the two learning objectives. Learning a new natural language requires acquiring the ability to handle a whole new set of data, a new way of looking at the world and addressing problems, and the ability to let go of lifelong habits, while adopting a new set of rules that doesn't seem to make a lot of sense, initially. All of these skills and abilities are helpful in learning computer languages, as well.","9,707 followers",Tim Mensch,626,3K,18.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-emerging-technology-that-we-can-learn-without-knowing-programming-language

Your background2. Your interest (red team versus blue team: red team attacks and blue team defends and both are equally important)3. Market/job opportunityYou can be an inch deep and miles wide in security or you can be inch wide and miles deep. For example there are different skill set required based on at which layer(network, OS,application , data) you are providing security. For example1. Network security (IPS, proxy, web filtering, email filtering, firewall, APT detection, next gen firewall and so on )2. Endpoint security (mostly desktops,mobile and laptops)3. Application security (code review, white box testing, black box testing and all three requires different kind of skill sets)4. Server security (web server, application server, database servers)5. Data security ( encryption, DRM, tokenization, compliance , data classification and policies and so forth)6. Network forensics or endpoint forensics7. Incident response and security monitoring8 malware analysis and reversing9. Hardware hacking (p0wning IoT devices smart meters, phones or Barbie dolls for fun)10. Surveillance (man in the middle for cell phones, sessions , cookie stealing, and so on)These are some of the high level buckets you have to think about and what matches your background.But before you do that I would strongly advice following .1. Read the entire TCP/IP illustrated volume I and when you finish it, read it one more time. If you can't finish the whole book atleast read first 10 chapters. You can thank me later.2. Read basics of port scanning on3. Read up on cyber kill chain4. Download kali from5. Once you are familiar with Kali and tools, Start with CTF (capture the flag) and try and solve few challenges.Now you have basics to conquer any advanced stuff in network and data security. For application security specially for white box testing or security code review you should have some programming background.Application security , malware reversing and security monitoring are really hot. Depending on the vertical you choose data security and compliance can be really in demand for example financial , healthcare or retail.Last but not least, there are ton of books on the topics I mentioned above , and ton of material onNow after all this if you say on top of this I have CISSP or CISA then it holds some water but it won't automatically get you a job just because you are CISSP . By the way there is an inside joke within security community but may be will table that for some other time.Good luck and I promise, you will never ever be bored in security.Regards,Vijay""If you can see the invisible you can do the impossible""P.S : the question was changed after it was answered.

So desire and continuous learning for defenders is key to success in this demanding field.The education system in most countries are outdated and not designed to meet the needs of the industry. The paper certification is just a piece of paper. There is very little relevant knowledge or skills taught in many school.IMO some amount of formal education is very good but then how will you differentiate with many others who have the same/similar formal education/certificates and nothing else to write in a resume?Those interested in entering the demanding field of Cyber Security, need to go beyond formal studies or certifications. They need to get up and do some hands-on work, do some interesting projects on their own. Need to show self-motivation, self-learning, desire and hard work. Don’t wait for someone to give you a first break.I would encourage all youngsters to show some initiative to breakthrough this first-job barrier. For example: attempt to make some money via a bug-bounty program. Participate in capture-the-flags competition and get some attention from experts. Create a useful security tool and publish them in github.Doing such projects on your own will make your resume look richer and interesting to companies.

I think AI will kill jobs, and over time, AI might kill most “jobs” as we know them. I think that people are somewhat complacent in regard to the economic impact of AI, and will likely be ill-prepared for the changes we have to adapt to in the not-so-distant future.First, let's start with the comparisons to machinery and automation. They did indeed put factory workers out of work. In that respect, I agree AI today is similar in many applications, replacing workers who have less specialized skills, perhaps call center operators, office assistants (in a limited extent), and maybe soon, taxi drivers and truck drivers. But I would argue that AI is fundamentally different from machinery or most of the other analogies commonly made when answering this question, because AI is growing and is unlikely to stop growing. It's growing in breadth (of applications and industries), in geographic and economic scope, and in power (it's capacity to address increasingly complex tasks). A more fitting analogy would be machinery in an automobile plant that not only made the parts one day, but then learned how to assemble them the week after, and then how to design cars a year later.I think that there is little that is out of reach for advanced AI of the future. Let's leave the question of the AI singularity alone for now. Instead, I think that deep learning efforts at Google and elsewhere are making AI systems learn faster and faster, with a growing rate of acceleration. Advanced AI can now address increasingly complex tasks including medical diagnosis, stock market trading, weather prediction and human behavioral modeling. Very soon, it will be able to take the place of certain types of teachers, and find a role in education. It can already deal with complex systems in software and mathematics, and seems to be only limited in applications that require interactions with the physical world (sensors are still imperfect), and with people.So without projecting too far into the future, we can ask the question, what jobs will NOT be killed by AI? Jobs that involve labor are already (or soon to be) replaced. Jobs that require logical reasoning are being replaced, albeit at a slower rate. What are the qualities that humans have that cannot be captured by AI? Perhaps creativity, emotional responses? So perhaps researchers in academia will survive longer than most, and artists (though AI stylistic mimicry is already quite impressive and their results enjoyable), and counselors/psychologists/case workers, and decision makers like CEOs who cannot be predictable or error prone. And hopefully software engineers and algorithm designers who develop AI systems.This leaves a very, very small portion of today's jobs intact. Many say: we just need to train people to fill higher level jobs created by AI, e.g. Programmers, ML researchers. But this is no easy feat. The US educational system is struggling to meet the demands created by advanced technology today. This failure is in part responsible for the economic divide plaguing the country today. The challenge of educating the public for a job market that is both decreasing in scope and increasing in complexity, is nothing we've ever faced before.I am far from original in this opinion. But if I had to guess, I would say that AI will put far more people out of work than we can (re)train in time. That will have significant economic repercussions as corporations seeking to minimize cost will do so at the cost of rising unemployment. There will need to be dramatic changes in social policies in order to avert large scale economic disaster, first dramatic rises in minimum wage, then eventually some type of universal income/welfare. It's the kind of change that requires significant leadership in our government, something that seems woefully absent today.","284,853 followers",James Altucher,992,878,91.7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-emerging-technology-that-we-can-learn-without-knowing-programming-language
