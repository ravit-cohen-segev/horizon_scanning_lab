The benefit and to some degree curse of Linux is that there are so many flavours with their own feature sets and advantages, compounded by the packages one can select, that one may completely miss the advanced features that you speak of. Although one of a technical bent may think OS X lack of selecting packages/features will end up with a flabby product with lots of features one may not use and likely just cause security or other issues, it does mean that that feature set is available at a whim and visible on all installs to chance upon or try.","3,124 followers",Becca Royal-Gordon,1.1K,4.3K,12M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-Apple-fans-rave-on-about-technologies-that-Apple-has-revealed-recently-as-being-revolutionary-but-the-Linux-world-has-had-for-many-years-now

And it was my full time job. I was going to auto tech school at night hoping for a better career one day.I started drinking heavy. I didn’t care. It was bad enough that I was already poor, on welfare and housing assistance. But when all that misery combined with alcohol, my situation made me feel even more hopeless. And I was ready to let go.But life turned into a blessing on that fateful(SOOOO EMBARRASSING!)I started to walk out after my purchase when I decided to buy a NY Daily News. But it’s too early. No daily news, only The NY Times. So I grabbed one, handed over my $1.50 and walked out.I immediately went to the help wanted ads when I got back in my apartment. And there it was. The biggest help wanted add on the page.$12 - $18 per hour.For one day only 9AM-12PM. on that following Monday.Doors close promptly at 12.I was twenty-four years old and never came close to earning $5 per hour.I woke up early that Monday morning. And gave myself two hours to get there for a trip that takes about one hour. I put on my Sunday best, grabbed some résumés and started my trip to the JFK Hilton.I arrived and found the conference room and it was barren. There were only about fifty people in the conference room. It didn’t feel like a job fair. I almost turned around because I thought I was in the wrong place.We were called in the order that we signed in. I watched as some people left after the short interview and some sat back down. I was one of the people that was told to sit back down after my interview.Round two came as fast as round one. This company has this job fair thing down to a science. I’m called back up to the table by Mrs. Alexander. I will never forget her. She hands me a drug test cup and says follow me. A drug test! at a job fair. Probably the best way to weed out the druggies.After that, I fill out all my employment forms. And then she says. “let’s go over some things while we wait for your results. Because of your experience and interests I have decided to hire you as a motor pool mechanic. This is your rate of pay, you will be on 90 days probation with random drug testing, report to this man at this location this time next Monday. Now read and sign your code of ethics booklet.”(And with the most beautiful motherly I understand what you have been going through smile) Mrs. Alexander says “Congratulations Gerry and fix your tie.”I’M HIRED! The whole process took all of 40 minutes. I went from $4.35 per hour. To $16.52 in 40 minutes. I walked out of that Hilton with tears in my eyes.It only gets better from there. I start work and immediately fall in love with the company, the work hours, the people, and of course the pay. Life got good and was only going to get better.I get great advice from an older worker. One can go anywhere in this company. Just get your Qualies (Qualifications) for everything, go to class for everything, read and study everything and then get your ass out of the motor pool.So I did just that. I went from repairing company vehicles at the motor pool, to lineman electrician, and now my present position as a locomotive engineer earning six figures. Six figures with a high school degree and a technical school certificate. And I can honestly say that I do not mind paying taxes at the end of every year.Being poor and uneducated gave me serious depression. And That Sunday NY Times was destiny.Something was definitely pulling the strings behind the scenes for me. I was going the opposite direction of where I am today.","9,405 followers",Visakan Veerasamy,20.1K,1.4K,9.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-Apple-fans-rave-on-about-technologies-that-Apple-has-revealed-recently-as-being-revolutionary-but-the-Linux-world-has-had-for-many-years-now

My main task during my 6 month contract was to find ways to improve their product and/or save costs. That’s kind of what I do everyplace because… well, that’s what I do.So, by the time I get hired by a place, they have already gone through the most obvious solutions that they could think of. Generally what’s left, really needs to be found someplace out of the box. I enjoy finding these solutions, when others couldn’t. But there is one particular idea that sticks out as one of my most unconventional, which was a really big success. And it was at this door manufacturer, where it appeared.One of their issues was that it took too damn long to put a door together along their assembly line, and there were numerous bottlenecks. One of the bottlenecks was at the station, near the end, where the 14″ square security-glass window was installed. Security glass is the glass that has that grid of criss-crossing wire embedded in it. Installing that glass securely, so that it couldn’t be removed from the outside required a complex framework of retainers that were first welded in place to the door, and then needed an additional steel frame that then screwed into the welded frame, holding the glass in place. There was always a terrible log-jam here, what with all the precision welding and screwing. It was ripe for an out of the box idea.On the first day, it came to me… and it was brilliant, if I do say so myself.I eliminated everything except the glass. No frames that had to be made, no drilling, no welding, no screwing, no second frame… all that was gone. All we had left was door and square of glass. The new process removed about 20 minutes from each door. That was about 20% of the entire time it took to make a complete door, start to finish.In place of all the metal frames, welding, drilling and screwing, I used… Velcro!I Velcro’d those windows in, directly to the door. This was the strongest Velcro that was made. Super Industrial strength. I used permanent glue to glue the “hook” part of the Velcro to the door, and the same glue to attach the corresponding “loop” part of the Velcro all around the edge of the glass, then just pressed them together, and… Bob’s your uncle! Done.To un-attach one part of the Velcro from the other part, a screwdriver was needed to carefully pry the glass away all around the edge. Took less than a minute, but could only be done from the inside-side of the door. And the Velcro was stronger than the glass itself. Smashing the glass in from the outside would break the glass before it released the Velcro.Yeah, I’m kinda proud of that one. When I first mentioned it, they all said that was ridiculous. It was a “Security” door, after all. Not a basketball shoe.What was ridiculous was the ridiculous success of the process. They all gave it their best shot at finding the flaw in the idea. Nope. It held tight no matter what was thrown at it. They’ve since permanently changed how they install their security glass. Your own security door, in fact, may have a Velcro attached window. No hardware at all. No worries, though. It works! Even if you know it’s Velcro, and you’re a potential burglar… it still works.And with that… my horn-blowing in this article has come to an end.

It has survived generational replacements of the hardware that runs it. That’s because it was designed first and foremost to endure hardship.The internet is robust, in the sense that it was originally designed to keep American bunkers connected in the harsh physical and electromagnetic environment of a world-ending nuclear war with the Soviets. Most of the internet’s communication protocols degrade very slowly, even in chaotic and noisy environments. The network is robust to the addition or loss of new hardware and websites. It’s pretty easy to get on the internet, and to do so anonymously. (Being a network, it’s also antifragile, but presumably that would be true of any future replacement too.)Several countries - notably France and China - have put forth alternative internets. Teletel, the French internet, - accessed by the Minitel terminals - despite being well designed and technologically sophisticated and persisting for a time, was outcompeted by the Internet and finally closed down in 2012 after decades of operation. China has maintained by fiat its own closed and censored internet, which is widely derided everywhere else. A few other authoritarian countries also censor their internet, but nobody censors like China.And even the internet changes over time. We use longer RSA encryption keys than we used to. We first adopted HTTP and now are currently upgrading to HTTPS. Even the fundamental addressing system, Internet Protocol (IP), is on version 6. The universal language of the internet, Unicode, releases new updates and characters on a steady drumbeat. But for all that newness, the internet has kept compatibility with the old. Even as consumers have adopted generations of web browsers, engineers still sometimes use decades-old tools likeAnyone who wants to make a new internet has to replace all of that, or people won’t switch of their own free will.",289 followers,Deepak Mehta,756,3.9K,105.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-Apple-fans-rave-on-about-technologies-that-Apple-has-revealed-recently-as-being-revolutionary-but-the-Linux-world-has-had-for-many-years-now
22,"You sort of answered your own question by saying technology is revolutionary and becomes obsolete. And you are totally correct. I keep running across something called Metaverse. It’s already being used but I’m not up on it except I read it has something to do with virtual reality.Its amazing how fast things are going with technology. We just had our first flight on Mars! We have gone beyond our own world with technological advancements. And it’s all been in a small time frame considering the history of our world since the invention of the phone, airplane etc.The internet isn’t that old and theYou sort of answered your own question by saying technology is revolutionary and becomes obsolete.

And it’s all been in a small time frame considering the history of our world since the invention of the phone, airplane etc.The internet isn’t that old and there are many people on this earth who only know cell phones and internet. It wasn’t that long ago where everything was sent by mail. Airmail was a big thing. A long distance call was a big deal and cost a lot of money. Phone booths were on every corner.Yes, technology has boomed and will keep rapidly advancing. I think somehow they will figure out a version of mental telepathy through the transmission of brainwaves. And I think it will be fairly soon. Just incredibly sci-fi but not as crazy as we would of once thought.","68,792 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,1K,17.3K,413.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-Apple-fans-rave-on-about-technologies-that-Apple-has-revealed-recently-as-being-revolutionary-but-the-Linux-world-has-had-for-many-years-now

25,"Just read elsewhere about making foresight studies ""societal changes are usually under-valued in their impacts, and technology is over-valued"". I agree, but it can go hand-in-hand: if a society doesn't provide for people over 70 to have meaningful activity and resources to survive, there's no need for technology to increase health at that stage.So maybe one should ask the question: What are the societal changes that will come which require technological advances or re-interpretations?","36,819 followers",Sindhu Satish,845,1.8K,73.4M,2013,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-Apple-fans-rave-on-about-technologies-that-Apple-has-revealed-recently-as-being-revolutionary-but-the-Linux-world-has-had-for-many-years-now
