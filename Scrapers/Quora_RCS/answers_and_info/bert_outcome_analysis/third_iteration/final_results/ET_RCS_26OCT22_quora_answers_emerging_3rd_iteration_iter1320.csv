Technology has changed the way business is done and has enabled many people to reach goals and try new things that they’ve never done before.So which recent technological innovations are the most impressive? Eleven members of1. Practical Augmented RealityAugmented reality stands to be the most immediate tech development that will affect our lives in the near term. With microdisplays becoming reasonably priced, we will see personal wearables becoming available to the masses. This will provide us with a whole new avenue of information retrieval use on a daily, minute-by-minute basis. -2. Generative Adversarial NetworksGenerative adversarial networks (GANs) are a new type of neural network that is semi-supervised and enables companies to learn more from less labeled data. Let’s say you would like to identify customers who are likely to churn but only have labels of actual churn after X days for a handful of customers. GANs enable this and succeed where other fully supervised neural networks fail. -3. Real-Time Language TranslationDriven by voice recognition technology coupled with AI, real-time language translators allow single-language speakers to have real-time conversations. It’s impressive both on the usability front (earphones) and on the level of complexity insofar as getting both the language and accent right. -4. ChatbotsI love the idea of chatbots and what they can do to take on some of the time-consuming work companies have while making businesses look good in terms of their customer experiences. Plus, chatbots are good at collecting information and analyzing it for further insights. It’s just a great way to cover tech support and service questions. -5. Artificial Intelligence In Mobile AppsA year ago, building AI into mobile apps would have been extremely difficult and costly. Today, it’s a lot less expensive, and we can incorporate Microsoft Cognitive Services, Google services, or Amazon services that use AI to make a mobile experience more intelligent, anticipate users’ desire and needs, and present information in context. Artificial intelligence, particularly in mobile devices, has transformed the user experience in the last few years as cognitive services have advanced exponentially. -6. Inexpensive, Fast StorageThe cloud, AI, VR and other buzzwords are often considered the hottest tech trends. However, the rapidly declining cost and increasing performance of flash-based storage powers these trends. Without the modern, low-cost solid-state drive (SSD), VR and AI would still be inaccessible to most businesses. Cloud providers rely on SSDs. Innovation in the storage industry builds a foundation for new tech. -7. Deep Learning-Based Predictive AnalyticsThe biggest technology innovation of the last three years just might be predictive analytics using AI-based deep learning. The ability of a computer to learn by just analyzing data without having to let the algorithm know what variables are important is unprecedented. This form of unsupervised learning is drastically changing the role of technology. -8. Serverless ComputingToday, developers have to worry not only about building their application but deploying and hosting it as well. It is a large portion of their workflow and requires them to commit resources in time and money up front. Serverless computing makes launching applications cheaper and faster by letting companies focus on the customer value without having to worry about deployment and scaling. The possibilities this will unlock are endless. -9. Brain-Computer InterfacesBrain scanners can10. AI And Machine Learning ApplicationsThe most impressive piece of tech that has come out in recent years is the practical application of AI and machine learning. Whether it is modeling data, analyzing speech or driving a car, we are starting to see real-world applications of these technologies. It may have taken a few of decades, but the field is making good on the promises that were made back in the 1980s. – Chris Kirby,11. The CloudNo doubt that the cloud service is one of the great technologies that happened in the last three years. SMBs that need to concentrate on the business do not have the right knowledge or the teams in place to maintain their systems or are not willing to spend the money in that direction. The cloud offers a unique and flexible option for them to make sure they will be able to concentrate on business execution. -","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,631,1.5K,2.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/When-do-you-think-the-next-biggest-innovation-in-technology-will-arise
