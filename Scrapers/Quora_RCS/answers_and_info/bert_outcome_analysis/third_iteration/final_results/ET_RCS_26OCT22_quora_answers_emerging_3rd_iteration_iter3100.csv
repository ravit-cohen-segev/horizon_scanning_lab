We’re just retrofitting an amazing invention that has stood the test of time.Technology changes the world. Chances are, you’re reading this on a mobile device that didn’t even exist a decade ago. In contrast, the first elevator was put into service in New York back in 1853. And what we ride in today hasn’t changed drastically—for the most part.What hasn’t changed at all is the need for elevators. They get people—and things—up to parts of buildings that would otherwise be impractical by way of stairs. What has changed? Read on. But first …Modern myths and little-known facts• People call it “elevator phobia,” but there’s officially no such thing. Most people dislike riding in elevators because they have claustrophobia (fear of enclosed spaces), or agoraphobia (fear of being trapped in a situation where escape is unlikely).• Often, people say they get nervous in an elevator because they’re afraid something will cause it to break loose and crash to the ground. There’s only been a single known occurrence of this happening—and it was in 1945 when a B25 Bomber crashed into the Empire State Building. An elevator car plummeted from the 75thfloor when its cables were severed by the aircraft. A woman in the elevator survived the incident because the elevator car landed on 1,000 feet of the cable that had fallen and coiled itself, acting as a landing spring.•Safety has been the objective of advances in elevator technology. From the very beginning, it’s what has determined the usage of these transportation devices. The first innovation was the elevator safety brake. Far from “modern,” this patented device was put into use in 1861. Here’s what’s been added because of technology advances since then.1. Automatic DoorsOkay, the automatic door has been around since the 1940s, when Joseph Giovanni patented the sensitive door bumper. It automatically stops further closure of the elevator doors if it encounters an obstruction.The concept has seen further innovation since then, though. Today’s elevators use infrared or ultrasound sensors in the doors. Elevator doors equipped with this technology won’t politely bump into you. They’ll stop beforehand.2. Microprocessor ControlElevators used to be run manually by dedicated operators. They didn’t just push buttons to open and close doors, and move from floor to floor. Early on, these human operators also used a lever that controlled the speed of descent. A soft landing was due to their skill.By the late 1970s, microprocessors were added to elevator operation. It automated this process. These mini-computers took over the decision-making of when and where an elevator stopped. It greatly increased elevator efficiency because it automatically controlled the speed. It also meant that it was time to retire if you were an elevator operator.3. Sky LobbiesYou might not even know what this is—and that’s mainly because the innovation isn’t really part of the operation of an elevator itself. Sky lobbies are essential in modern skyscrapers. Think of them as staging areas.You’ll enter an elevator on the ground floor. It’ll ascend at a high speed to a certain level of the building without stopping. When the doors open, you’ll have arrived at the sky lobby. From there, you’ll switch elevators to ascend the rest of the way to your designated floor—and these elevators have the ability to stop at any floor along the way.This innovation was introduced as a way to move a large number of people around with a limited number of elevators. The position of the sky lobby is determined by passenger flow models, and the analysis behind it has created a highly efficient way for elevators to service large, tall buildings.The bottom line is that technology has made modern elevators more comfortable and able to accommodate more people—but they were always very safe from the beginning. Short ascents may now be driven by hydraulic shaft lifts instead of cables, but even that technology was already in use by the earliest of elevators before electricity became reliable enough to introduce the electric-driven motors that now drive elevator cable-winding cylinders.Elevators are responsible for shaping our modern cities. There would be no skyscrapers without them. For the most part, however, they still operate using the principles that made the first elevators possible more than 160 years ago.",469 followers,Daniel Cohort,11.9K,377,1.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-advanced-technology-used-in-elevators

As you look for lighter materials - they get weaker and it still can’t support it’s own weight.It turns out that the ONLY material we’d have a hope in hell of using for this would be a VERY exotic material called “carbon nanotubes”.Theoretically a carbon nanotube cable could just barely support itself (plus a fairly lightweight cab) providing the cable was in one long continuous piece - and providing you could taper the thickness of the cable so it’s thinner at the bottom and thicker at the top.For a while, this looked technologically feasible - although the longest carbon nanotube ever made was just a few millimeters long. So it’s not ENTIRELY possible yet.At least a couple of companies started up with the idea of working on this - and there was a LOT of enthusiasm for it.However, detailed mathematical work on the nature of the cable revealed that the cable would start to become unstable - whipping around like crazy…the only way we know to stabilize it would be to put rocket motors at intervals along the cable…and this rapidly puts you back into the realms of the impossible (or at least the highly-improbable).So the space elevator concept still comes up in discussions quite a bit - but the truth is that the idea is pretty much dead.",256 followers,Priyal Gupta,9.7K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-advanced-technology-used-in-elevators
3,"Where an idle elevator parks depends on the software settings or the relay logic design of the system. On many low-rise installations, especially ones with single elevators, the elevator simply parks where it last delivered a passenger.The next level of sophistication is to have the elevator return to the highest traffic floor after a preset timer has expired. This timer is typically a few minutes so that if someone has to return to their floor to get something they forgot, the elevator will still be waiting for them, but after a few minutes, it would return to the main floor since that is theWhere an idle elevator parks depends on the software settings or the relay logic design of the system.

This timer is typically a few minutes so that if someone has to return to their floor to get something they forgot, the elevator will still be waiting for them, but after a few minutes, it would return to the main floor since that is the most likely place where someone will need it next.In larger and higher groups of elevators, the software can get quite complex as it tries to predict where elevators will be needed and what elevator positioning will minimize the total waiting time. These algorithms often consider the buildings historic traffic patterns and the time of day and week in the decision making.Clearly there is a trade-off here between power used to move the elevators and the waiting time for the passengers. The first scenario uses the least overall power.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-advanced-technology-used-in-elevators

What kind of vehicle can fly the trajectory needed keeping tension in the belt while unrolling the belt and then arriving at the ground while tugging on the satellite counter-balance?If you think you just unroll it and let gravity pull it down, why do you think that the satellite itself isn’t falling down?The belt/cable needs to support its own weight plus the counterbalance force plus the weight of the largest satellite and its climbing mechanismThe extremely high specific strength requirements mean that the tiniest bit of damage or manufacturing defect in the belt will lead to a tremendously disastrous result, making our current space debris problem look like a cake walk. And people expect many climbing satellites to be on the cable simultaneously.The energy needed for climbing the elevator is non-trivialSolar power can only do the job after the first 40 km. Below that, it looks like only a nuclear reactor could carry enough energy in a small enough mass. All we need are nuclear reactors climbing up cables into space. Did I mention that the cable is going to be destroyed in a collision in less than a week?The elevator is only useful for nearly geosynchronous satellites or higher.You can’t launch a satellite at a low altitude from the elevator because the satellite would just fall to the ground.The space elevator is a fun thought-experiment but it is about as impractical as a Dyson sphere.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-advanced-technology-used-in-elevators

In ages past potassium nitrate has been dissolved out of ancient bad guano deposits in some caves. That would be their best bet. Sulfur deposits can be found around some volcanoes. Assuming they could get the ingredients, they have to be combined in the right amounts and ground very fine. In primitive times this was done by putting the mixture in a circular stone trough and running a multi-ton rock wheel around the trough to mix and pulverize it. Virtually every one of these shops blew up eventually. It’s important to keep the mixture moist, but not wet. With that done, the mixture is pressed in thin sheets between metal (wood?) plates with several tons of pressure. The thin sheets of black powder can be laid in the sun to dry and then broken up with a hammer to consistent size. Have your ever heard the expression “Lock, stock, and barrel”? Those are the three main parts to making a muzzle-loading rifle. The lock is an intricate mechanism requiring steel that can be hardened. You’d have to make your own screws and springs. The stock is the wooden part into which the other two are inlaid, and by far the easiest to make, though hardly easy. The barrel can be mild steel made by blacksmithing, but it has to be drilled through the middle, polished, and grooves cut into the inside. It can be accomplished with wood and steel and hand tools, but is complex technology in it’s own right. Of course, they’d have to smelt iron and steel, as well as lead for making bullets to push down that muzzle-loading barrel.
