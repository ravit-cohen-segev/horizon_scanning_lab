0,"Unfortunately, clearly the second. Our instincts do not evolve even remotely as fast as our science and technology, and we are horribly incapable of overriding bad, instinct-driven behaviour with better, knowledge-driven rational behaviour, even if we have all the necessary information. This is why we are unable to stop destroying our own living environment. As individuals, we are simply not programmed for the right behaviour in such a context.","2,530 followers",Daniel Lindsäth,3.3K,5.5K,9.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Will-human-beings-become-more-rational-as-science-and-technology-develop-and-continue-to-shape-our-psyches-Or-will-our-irrational-potentials-e-g-emotions-likewise-evolve-and-remain-central-to-our-humanness
1,No one gets it. Technology will not change human impulse. The unconscious mind is the wild old man living and screaming in the dark forest and loving it. We will always be controlled by our bigger hidden selves. Tech won't help because it will never find it. We will do radical things with technology because of it.

Ironically the counter-example to this would be the evolutionary biologist Dawkins, whose missionary zeal and inflammatory attacks all over the scale hardly can be calledScience also embodies cultural traditions, competition for Nobel Prizes, finding ways to get funding and a lot of scientifically irrelevant factors. Or better, as shown with the ironical example,It may, however, be “meta-rational” to have authorities. We do not have time to personally invent the wheel, the iPhone, cars, writing and you name it. We must also allow ourselves to believe in others or life becomes meaningless. And feeling life is meaningful may help you advance and help your genes stay well represented in the pool. Flattering the right evolutionary biologist at the right time may also. Evolution is not moral. Survival of the fittest is what evolution is, not survival of the most rational, moral or ""best"" ones. But it is also not survival of the irrational. In all likeliness, rationality helps. Possibly a sense of ethics may too. We can always hope.__________","358,964 followers",Sean Kernan,1K,5.6K,726.9M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Will-human-beings-become-more-rational-as-science-and-technology-develop-and-continue-to-shape-our-psyches-Or-will-our-irrational-potentials-e-g-emotions-likewise-evolve-and-remain-central-to-our-humanness

4,"The answer depends on what the questioner means by “rational” and “irrational”. Jung’s definition of “rational” in“The rational is the reasonable, that which accords with reason.

I conceive reason as an attitude, whose principle it is to conform thought, feeling, and actions to objective values. Objective values are established by the everyday experience of external facts on the one hand,There is a narrow view of rationality as dealing only with external facts. There is a better term for that attitude: scientism, the notion that only that which can be proven scientifically is valid. (I would call it a modern extension of logical positivism.) One branch of scientism that is troubling is the notion that the human mind is simply a very fast computer. This creates very difficult problems, particularly since it implicitly denies the existence of free will. There is a strain of philosophical thought going back to John Lucas in the 1960s and developed extensively by the British physicist and mathematician Roger Penrose that strongly (and scientifically!) denies this notion.Religion, love, beauty, compassion—none of these can be reduced to an algorithm in any satisfactory way. Are these irrational? Not in Jung’s definition, above. Is Descartes wrong in seeing the mind as an epiphenomenon above the phsyical? I think not. I think (and I am, in the MBTI an extreme thinking type, ENTJ) that to try to reduce our humanity to mere programming is irrational, in that it goes against human history. There will always be the numinous and the apparently inexplicable. Even Star Trek, an extrapolation of the future in a highly scientific way, does not dismiss the praeternatural.Now, whether we can call any of these things emotions is another interesting question.

NASA, then a group of 20-somethings tasked with an historic objective and effectively blank check is today an entrenched bureaucracy with deep political ties to congressional districts across the nation.In the 1960s, our astronauts were military men who were safer flying a rocket than they would have been flying over Vietnam—which was the alternative for most of them. While we tried for safety, losses were seen as the inevitable consequence of any great effort, from building a dam to defeating Nazism to going to the moon. Today, we have the expectation that any project that kills people is a failure, whether building a water tower or going to the moon. I’m not arguing the point, but that does affect project design and cost.And the big ticket items—the rocket engines themselves—have not improved substantially since the 1960s except that they can be made to higher standards more cheaply.So…if the Congress gave NASA a commitment to fund a mission to the moon, then yes, NASA could do it for a fraction of what the Apollo program cost—but a larger fraction than you might think. And partly for that reason, they have not been given such a commitment, and have had to progress by fits and starts, which actually increases the costs over time.If you like space, you might enjoy my",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,839,9.4K,195.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Will-human-beings-become-more-rational-as-science-and-technology-develop-and-continue-to-shape-our-psyches-Or-will-our-irrational-potentials-e-g-emotions-likewise-evolve-and-remain-central-to-our-humanness

If it was up to the kids that were around during Apollo Mission we would have never made it past low earth orbit. They had their hands out buying up everything Lyndon Johnson said about the Great Society. That was the first generation of Americans where it was more important to smoke pot drop acid get drunk and eat mushrooms and become a decent part of society at a young age. They had children. Then they're entitled children had children. We also had a president in the 1980s they convinced everyone that greed was a virtue. And now there's not the money to do an Apollo mission with that same funding the 1960s did. The wealthiest Americans don't feel like they have to pay more than 15% in taxes once all deductions are taken out. We have companies not paying taxes like Amazon and the Motor Company's from the bailout of the economic collapse. We have the banks that caused the economic collapse to never pay back America for what we did to save their butts. Then we have this new generation that feels like absolutely everything in their life should be taken care of by the government. They filled their daycare should be paid for by taxpayers, their health care and prescription drugs 100% should be paid by the government. We even have people saying we need to have a universal income for people who don't work. We have a smaller subset of the population wanting to give $150,000 to every man woman and child of African descent which would be more money than the entire GDP of the United States.

Back then, the goal was to get a man on the Moon; safety and comfort were not really part of the equation, unless absolutely necessary. When I graduated college, my first job was as an engineer on the Space Shuttle. One of the coolest things about that job, at least for me, was that so many of the men with whom I worked, was that they worked on the Apollo program, some even the Gemini and Mercury programs. (You want to talk cool!!!) I remember two phrases which seemed to come up from time to time; the first was, ""We would have been done by now if this was the 60s."" (That line only a few times.) And the second phrase was, ""we were able to get men onto the Moon because we didn't know we couldn't"". I was not totally sure how that was meant until I was getting close to leaving that job, and simply, they meant that we were not yet capable of developing a Moon landing program. We did it because we cut so many corners that COULD NOT be cut today. On a simple level, if a kid was building a tree house to building codes, it would be impossible for him (or her; sorry, I'm a dinosaur). On a much more grand scale, if we were to build the Panama Canal today, it would never be built because it would break too many codes and violate too many restrictions, not the least of which would be environmental. Back then, the men who went to the Moon were the best of the best. In a certain sense, we do not have such men (or women, sorry, the dinosaur thing) today. I make no comment on which was right or wrong, that is up to individual mores. I simply make the comment that if we had to abide by today's standards, requirements and restrictions, we would have never made it to the moon. As a side note, isn't it interesting that despite the various codes, safety measures and restrictions, by which we must abide today, we lost two space shuttles and 14 people, just to get a reusable ship into orbit. But to send men to the Moon at a time when it was impossible, and only happened because we basically said, ""to hell with the rules"" we got six teams to the moon, and the seventh which did not make it (Apollo 13) was salvageable at least to the point of bringing the men back safely. And with the same ""don't give a damn"" attitude, we had five programs (Mercury - getting a man into space; Gemini - Manned orbit of the earth; Apollo - Landing men on the Moon; Skylab - Space Station; Apollo–Soyuz Project - Space Diplomacy) and not one single American died during an actual mission, over that 16 year period.",3 followers,Steve Baker,4.5K,27.4K,163.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Will-human-beings-become-more-rational-as-science-and-technology-develop-and-continue-to-shape-our-psyches-Or-will-our-irrational-potentials-e-g-emotions-likewise-evolve-and-remain-central-to-our-humanness

While it is, indeed, possible that a tribe would start writing beforehand, it--nonetheless--does not mean that the detailed literature could come about in a hunter-gatherer tribe.

Nuclear energy always follows the invention of machinery and other layered sciences.
