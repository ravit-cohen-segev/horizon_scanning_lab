Notch displays makes the phone look good but I don't know how useful it is. Airpods became just another way of looting people's money, as you have to buy them separately for $159 even after paying $1000+. Now, a fan will say that it was a step toward wireless technology, but pal if Apple is so concerned about wireless techs then why didn't they announed wireless charging feature till now which was available in the market way before the Airpods? The answer is simple 'because it doesn't make them money'.They swank dual SIM card, fast charging and 60fps 4K video recording like they have introduced something radical in the market, even my $200 phone supports 60fps 4K recording. Not to mention, they do not include fast chargers with the device you buy, off course you've to pay extra for that. Also there's no slot for second SIM card because its a virtual sim (eSIM) they are talking about, a technology that is available only in 10 countries.On that note here are some basic but bold moves that apple can make to gain customers :After Apple implements the above mentioned things we can talk about innovative ideas.Pallavi BiswasThank you for reading.",652 followers,Al Barleta,3.4K,219,1.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-should-be-Apple-s-next-bold-move-in-terms-of-technology-and-innovation

NFC outside of mobile payments has been a useless product and opening it up to developers has significant security problems. It also doesn’t make Apple money in any way. Customers in general doesn’t care about customization, in spite of what people constantly say. How would lowering repair costs be innovation? If that’s the bar for innovation, that’s an incredibly low one. Fast charging would be nice out of the box but it also would lower margins. How many people who would not buy an iPhone today would buy one if Apple had fast charging out of the box, lower repair costs, more customization, and um…NFC? The number is so low it’s negligible, so all of these would be BAD business decisions. Also I don't see how any of them would be called innovative. If Apple did any of these things, people would shrug and say Android did it first.Apple is hugely innovative. You mentioned a few from the last few years (in spite of your assertion that they haven’t innovated in ‘so many years’ but there are so many more. Apple Watch, the A-series chip (which enables the iPhone to be the only phone to do 4k 60FPS and 1080p 240FPS), AirPods, Face ID, and so many more that it’s not possible to count.Basically, your complaints aren’t that Apple isn’t innovative, because they clearly are, but because Apple doesn’t do the things you want them to do, even if it wouldn’t make them money (or in some cases would cost them money). The answer is, Apple is a business and is not in the business of pleasing you, but of making money. It’s working really well, which is why they are the most valuable company in the world.","58,988 followers",Michael Wolfe,504,2K,17.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-should-be-Apple-s-next-bold-move-in-terms-of-technology-and-innovation

They will be the first iPhones to have it.Which is rather interesting because it's a feature most Android phones, even budget ones, have had for years. And they've had it because it's damn useful, especially for those who travel frequently.For a company that invented the modern-day smartphone being so behind the curve is just criminal.

When I heard the doctor tell her “six months”, it felt likeI met my wife, Jess, twenty-one years ago when she was nineteen.Our parents owned side-by-side cabins in the northern part of New York and we both happened to be along for the week-long hunting trip our fathers planned that year.Jess' father was a skilled hunter and could hit a headshot from a mile away — same as my dad.Jess and I didn't hunt with them — we hung out by the lake.The moment I saw Jess I fell in love. We've been together ever since.But now, now that she has an expiration date, I just don't know what to do — I'm scared and lost.Monday morning at work I was telling my best friend and supervisor, Timmy, about my wife's condition. Timmy told me that I.T. or Intelligent Terrestrial just came out with their latest models.These models are different than those of yesteryear because they are 52% mechanical and 48% biological.Timmy said all you have to do is mail a sample of DNA to I.T. and upload a digital copy of your consciousness through an app. You can then purchase a custom made clone at an age of your choice. When the clone arrives it will turn on, study it's surroundings and await a consciousness download.“Oh my God Timmy, what's the catch?”“The price, Leon.”When I got home from work, Jess and I plugged in and uploaded a digital copy of our entire conscious catalog to I.T. and then mailed off DNA samples.Jess asked me what age I wanted her to be. It felt awkward to say “twenty”, but I did it — I was honest. I miss her smooth, youthful skin and I want her to be young and healthy — especially if I have to cash my entire 401K in to afford it.We told her parents that we were going to basically bring her back from the dead and her father threatened to shoot any abomination that we brought into this world.One month later, on a day that Jess was particularly ill, the doorbell rang.Jess and I dragged the box through the door and laid it on the living room floor. I gently cut along the lines and when I opened the flaps, there,she,was.The last time my heart fluttered like this was the day I met her.Jess helped me lift I.T. out of the box and sit I.T. up.I.T. was warm and soft. I.T. was mine. I paid for I.T. I own I.T.Machines like this don't have rights — even though they are part biological, the governments recognize them in the same way they would a lawnmower — so, as I said, I.T. is my possession.The science behind uploading a digital consciousness is so cutting edge, that the laws just haven't caught up yet.Jess turned I.T. on and I.T. looked right into my eyes. I was in love — with two women, but, it was the same woman. We hadn't uploaded Jess' consciousness yet, so, I.T. was running on basic programming, but I.T. was gorgeous.Jess asked me what I wanted to do, and for the first time in a very long time — I lied to her.I told her we should go shopping and buy I.T. some clothes.I.T. doesn't seem to have a personality yet.“Hello…. Smile…”Jess picked outfits for both of them and we went for a walk through the park together. It was amazing — I was so happy.We walked down a cozy little trail and found a tuck away to sit and talk.I.T. watched and studied every move Jess and I made. I.T. was learning and adapting.I.T. was becoming aware.At one point Jess and I got distracted and I.T. wandered off. When we found I.T., I.T. was gazing at the sky.I asked I.T. what it was doing. I.T. said, “Where do I come from?”“You come from Heaven. You are my angel.”That answer seemed to work for I.T. We all walked back to the car and headed home.When we got home, Jess immediately started coughing. She fell to the ground and I tried to help her, but I didn't know what to do.Jess passed away right then. It was finally over.I called her family and the police. It took an hour for them to remove the body. I had Jess 2.0 sitting in my back room waiting for them to leave.After the police left, I plugged I.T. into my laptop and downloaded Jess' consciousness.After the download was complete, we walked outside and I looked into her gigantic brown eyes. I asked her, “Is it you, Jess?”She smiled and said, “It is, silly — now kiss me.”Her head slammed back. I didn't know if she was glitching or what and then I heard a bang and saw a hole above her left eye.My beautiful Jessica died twice today. I was crushed.Over the next two decades, I fell into a deep, dark, alcohol-fueled depression. Although I had developed a serious alcohol problem, I was able to work and save every single penny I earned.After twenty years of saving, I decided I wanted both of them back — the twenty-year-old Jess and the forty-year-old Jess.I sent my entire life savings off to I.T. and in one month, my doorbell rang.I cut the box open and wept when I saw my angel(s).I turned them on.I also clothed them. The younger version of me may have left them in the nude, but at this age, I just want my companion(s) back.The ladies helped me back to my room to lay down. I was so tired from all the excitement.I've waited and worked an entire lifetime to be with the woman I love. And now, at long last — she is beside me.I died, on that very night as a happy man.One day later, the doorbell rang. It seems my beautiful Jessicas used my direct deposit life insurance benefit to make a purchase.They gently cut the box open.And turned me on.You ask where technology will be in 2050?We will be everywhere.LeonSpecial thanks:Cameron — Dear friend. Thank you so much for all your help with bringing this idea to life. You are awesome. I'm proud to call you friend.Kinsalynn — My sister and friend.

Form 1Just as the term suggests, 3D printing is the technology that could forge your digital design into a solid real-life product. It’s nothing new for the advanced mechanical industry, but a personal 3D printer is definitely a revolutionary idea. Everybody can create their own physical product based on their custom design, and no approval needed from any giant manufacturer! Even the James Bond’s Aston Martin which was crashed in the movie was a 3D printed product!Form 1 is one such personal 3D printer which can be yours at just $2799. It may sound like a high price but to have the luxury of getting producing your own prototypes, that’s a reaonable price.Imagine a future where every individual professional has the capability to mass produce their own creative physical products without limitation. This is the future where personal productivity and creativity are maximized.3. Oculus RiftVirtual Reality gaming is here in the form of Oculus Rift. This history-defining 3D headset lets you mentally feel that you are actually inside a video game. In the Rift’s virtual world, you could turn your head around with ultra-low latency to view the world in high resolution display.There are premium products in the market that can do the same, but Rift wants you to enjoy the experience at only $300, and the package even comes as a development kit. This is the beginning of the revolution for next-generation gaming.The timing is perfect as the world is currently bombarded with the virtual reality topic that could also be attributed to Sword Art Online, the anime series featuring the characters playing games in an entirely virtual world. While we’re getting there, it could take a few more years to reach that level of realism. Oculus Rift is our first step.4.

20,"This is what happens when you read pop media news reports but don't do any research beyond that.Obama is not “giving control of the Internet away.” Sigh.Okay, here's a quick lesson in how the Internet works:There is no such thing as a Web server that has a name, like “Google” or “Facebook” or “Quora.” All Web servers, indeed all devices attached to the Internet, only have numbers. These numbers are called an “IP address.”When you go to Google, you actually go to 74.125.224.72.

These numbers are called an “IP address.”When you go to Google, you actually go to 74.125.224.72. There is, as far as the Internet’s routing is concerned,Imagine a telephone. Same thing. There is no such thing as a phone called “Franklin.” My phone number is just a number.When you type “google.com” into your browser, the browser goes out and consults a DNS server. This server is just a giant telephone book. It lists names and numbers. The DNS server says “Google…google….ha, here it is. Google is 74.125.224.72.The job of maintaining this enormous list of names and numbers belongs to an American corporation called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN. ICANN was started in 1998. Before 1998, this job was done by one guy, a guy named Jon Postel, a university researcher.When ICANN was first founded, it received oversight from the United States Department of Commerce. The US government had paid for and done a lot of the research on the networks that we today call “the Internet,” and so it wanted oversight to make sure ICANN was up to the task.This government oversight was always supposed to be temporary. It was supposed to expire in 2003, after which ICANN would no longer be controlled by the government.However, its contract with the government was extended to 2006, then to 2009, then to 2014. In 2014, the Department of Commerce decided it didn't need to continue overseeing ICANN, so it started negotiating letting go of that oversight. The negotiation took two years, and now ICANN is an independent American corporation that is no longer subject to Department of Commerce oversight.All of this is just about management of the American corporation that runs the list that assigns numbers to domain names. This change in management had been planned since September 1998.Then something bizarre happened.Conservatives, most of whom favor small government and minimal interference of government in private corporations, went apeshit.Ted Cruz bizarrely started spouting that the US was “giving control of the Internet to the United Nations.” (I still scratch my head every time I hear this. ICANN is an American corporation, headquartered in California. It is not the United Nations.) People who don't know how to use Wikipedia bizarrely believe him. (Wha—?)Folks, here's the scoop: ICANN is an American company. ICANN makes lists of names and numbers, just like they've been doing for the past 18 years. ICANN no longer has to report management changes and operational procedures to the Department of Commerce, that's it. Exactly as was planned in 1998.Obama did not hand over control of the Internet.

Say what you will about his policies, but I’ve always been impressed by the way he treats other people, and the brief time I spent in his presence strongly reinforced that opinion.Depicted: a bunch of girls in lime green polo shirts, plus one guy who didn't follow the dress code.
