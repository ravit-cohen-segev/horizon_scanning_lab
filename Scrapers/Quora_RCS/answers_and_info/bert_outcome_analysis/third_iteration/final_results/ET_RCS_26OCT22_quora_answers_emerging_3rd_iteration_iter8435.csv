Every two years Boeing and its industry partners along with the US Navy work on delivering new capabilities to the fighter. Critical mission systems such as the radar, mission computers and sensors continue to evolve to match up to the mission profiles of the future.To address the capabilities needed in the air wing as early as the 2020s, Boeing has also developed the Block III Super Hornet to complement existing and future air wing capabilities. Block III is the same aircraft as Advanced Super Hornet. The Advanced F/A-18E/F Super Hornet’s multi-mission capabilities include battle-space situational awareness, counter stealth targeting, greater range and increased acceleration, improved survivability and reduced signature and room for growth.The Block III Super Hornet will come online at the same time as the F-35. In the 2020s, three Super Hornet squadrons and one F-35 squadron may form the airwing of carrier fleets. Currently, in the US Navy three out of four, and in most cases all four squadrons based off aircraft carriers, are Super Hornet squadrons.These advanced capabilities can be both built into new aircraft and incorporated into existing aircraft, allowing maximum ability to field these capabilities quickly and affordable. Block III Super Hornet is built from the same airframe as Block II, providing low risk development and maintaining the lowest operating costs of any US tactical fighter. While Boeing demonstrated advanced Super Hornet capabilities in flight in 2013, the package of upgrades has evolved to best complement F-35, EA-18G and E-2D as they will be operating together in the air wing well into the 2040s.The F/A-18 is the most modern and capable aircraft on the US Navy’s carrier decks today. In fact, the Block II Super Hornet reached initial operating capability in 2007. The F/A-18 Super Hornet was designed from day one for carrier operations and is the world’s preeminent carrier capable aircraft. It is a combat proven, supersonic, all weather multirole fighter jet with a defined US Navy flight plan to outpace threats into the 2040s.Boeing’s proposed ‘Make in India’ plans for the Super Hornet are not about moving a production line but rather building an entirely new and state-of-the-art production facility that can be utilised for other programmes like India’s Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) programme.Boeing will partner with Indian industry to develop the right capabilities as efficiently and cost effectively as possible to integrate these suppliers into the global supply chain.

And, while we know that the technology exists to have absolutely massive hovercraft, the Empire comes at them with easily-trippable death traps.Finally, the Emperor plots to destroy the Rebel Alliance by . . . building the same thing they blew up, but I guess it’s a trick this time, and the Rebels . . . use basically the same plan to blow it up. And you know what? It works. They blow it up, the Emperor is dead!I have some environmental concernsNow, I really can’t emphasize enough that think all of this is fuckin’ awesome, but I also think it’s extremely clear thatPart V: Clever Title Something SomethingSo we aren’t doing physics here. We ought to evaluate this in story terms.Q: So what is the Holdo Maneuver?A. It’s where you (1) ram into a ship (2) with your ship (3) while accelerating to lightspeed (4) and you both blow up. So far so good.Q: Does this violate anything we’ve been told about the “physics” of the world?A: Does ships being rammed violate some story tenant? Well, no, we’ve actually seen that happen before. It also just makes logical sense: things can hit other things. So 1 and 2 are good.Can you hit things while accelerating to lightspeed? I think so: fleets seem to take a lot of effort to coordinate these jumps in a way that makes me think they are worried about hitting each other during the jump. Han at one point implies that hitting thingsCan a ship hitting another ship blow both ships up? I mean, yeah. So that’s 4.So the Holdo Maneuver doesn’t violate the Star Wars “physics,” such as they are (*cough* Kessel Run in 12 parsecs *cough*).Q: Well what about the story, wiseguy? Why haven’t we seen someone do this before?A: Well, probably a couple of reasons.First, suicide attacks don’t really seem to be how the Rebels or the Resistance roll. People don’t want to blowSecond, I’m not sure we’ve seen a scenario where a single suicide attack would have been much of a difference. The A-Wing hitting the Star Destroyer in ROTJ was close, though that was accidental if I recall. So where else would this have come up?Third, this extended chase w/ secret escapes of most of the crew is actually a weird situation. Hux seems to figure out what Holdo is doing at the last minute, which seems to imply this is the sort of thing people have conceived of, but that wouldn’t generally make a lot of sense. If the Raddus had just show up to throw down, the Supremacy would have just wasted it before it got in position to do this. It’s very clearly telegraphed that you need to beFourth, I think this sort of precision aiming is just sort of hard? Like they type a bunch of numbers into a keypad when they want to do the lightspeed. What numbers are you typing to hit the other space ship? This is actually the part of it that makes least sense to me, though nobody who is bitching about it seems to care. In particular, how is she doing this without more people in the ship? Doesn’t it need a crew? Like there should have been more people on it when she did this.Q: Doesn’t this totally invalidate every prior event in the series? Luke could have just rammed his X-Wing into the Death Star and saved 13-year-old me from Revenge of the Sith.A: I . . . don’t see how? The Raddus isI’m not sure why we wouldn’t expect an X-Wing to just go splat on thePeople also seem to be convinced that the Holdo Maneuver implies that people could just attach hyperdrives to asteroids and run them into planets . . . which is true. It’s actually quite baffling the Empire didn’t decide to just throw big rocks at planets instead of build the Death Star. Why not just attach an engine to one and let ’er rip? Or hell, grab it with a tractor beam and chuck it, don’t even neee the engine Just of those suckers wiped out the dinosaurs.But in any event, to the extent you think “absence of drone asteroid weapons” is a logical flaw,Again, this is notPart VI: Return to the PointThe “Holdo Maneuver” is just as plausible as anything else we’ve seen destroy the Big Evil Space Ship/Station in these films. Which is to say not very, but it’s not exactly out of character for the series.And I just don’t really see why “suicide attack by flagship destroys other flagship” strikes people as either totally implausible or worldbreaking. Again, literally one of the first things we find out about this universe is that a single-person fighter can drop a smallish bomb into a heating vent and blow up a super weapon the size of a moon. And we think that is cool! And it is!But at the end of the day it’s space wizards fighting space Nazis. Does the “trench run” make any damn sense?

Indicator ship doesn’t but has special Clark space magic balls to make gravity.Of course sequel trilogy ignores completely how hyperdrive works with stupid hyperspace skipping thing and coming out in planet’s sky instead of in space.Have ever you watched Star Wars? This is not how hyperspace is.Holdo is just as dumb. There is no excuse. Is [greek phrase I cannot remember that means god has fixed things]. They even hang lamp on it to say is one in million thing to justify why only works now but cannot again because they know this breaks rules but are not smart enough or too lazy to write themselves out of corner. I have seen Sir work much harder to fix far less bad mistake in his stories.And why is so stupid? This breaks completely how hyperdrive works. Wookipedia says hyperdrive has exist for 25,000 years. If this was good idea somebody would have tried it before. Everything that can do is tried. Russia built tanks from tractor.British built some kind of gun that shoots air.Some crazy man build this.If hyperspace weapon worked after at most 2000 years everyone would be flying around with big gun to launch hyperdrive bolted to rocks. Would not waste time with death star.Maybe if whole movie revolves around revolution like Manhattan project to build and test new hyperspace bomb this makes sense.

Why not send and X-Wing at lightspeed the main reactor to cause and explosion there?I mean seriously, why not build hyperspace platforms? Why didn’t the rebels build large platforms that they could use like Holdo. Motti even calls the Alliance well funded, so it wasn’t like that was too expensive.In TLJ, why not send a bomber at lightspeed to destroy the dreadnought? The bombers get destroyed when they destroy their target, so it’s not like you’re wasting an irreplaceable asset. The bombers clearly have the ordinance to destroy a dreadnought. Wow. The Holdo Maneuver doesn’t just ruin other movies, it even ruins it’s own movie!I could go on. In the Phantom Menace, why didn’t they Holdo Maneuver the droid control ship? In ATOC, why didn’t they hyperspace ram Confederate Core Ships? At Coruscant, why not hyperspace ram enemy ships? Why not hyperspace ram the Death Star? Why didn’t X-Wings hyperspace ram Death Squadron at Hoth? Why not do the same at Endor? Why not hyperspace ram Starkiller Base?You may say that they had a one-in a million chance. So why did Holdo try that then? Why not physically shield the ships with the Raddus? And why is it one-in-a-million? TLJ leads us to believe it’s just pointing and jumping to hyperspace.Hyperspace is also an alternate dimension. Even the Star Wars databank says so.> crossing space through the alternate dimension of hyperspaceSo how could you hyperspace ram if it is an alternate dimension? You’d just pass right where that ship would be! Or, if it’s mass shadow pulled you out of hyperspace, then you would hit it at sublight speed! And, despite what any have claimed, when you transition from normal space to hyperspace, you don’t actually move forward.Now, to rebuff some arguments from TLJ defenders so that I don’t have to do it in the comments.And don’t tell me that Holdo invented hyperspace ramming. Hyperdrives have existed for 25,000 years. There are millions of inhabited planets. Don’t try to say that nobody decided to point a hyperdrive at something and jump. Keep in mind that the US military tried to militarize the nerf football.Please don’t say “oh, but Ben, lots of things in Star Wars make no sense.” Well, many things in Star Wars don’t make sense in our world. However, Star Wars is a fictional universe. The problem is when Star Wars breaks its own internal rules. Then it becomes a plot hole.Some people say that the Rebels didn’t have a ship big enough.

That being said there’s a difference between this and saying the ManeuverThe Tale of Two ExplanationsThere are two common interpretations of what happened during the Holdo Maneuver.HyperspaceThe first scenario looks like it creates a lot of problems at first glance. If you could send a projectile zipping in from across the galaxy, it would drastically change how combat is fought: stationary or slow moving fortifications would be useless, in person combat would pointless, etc etc. Until you realize that the vast majority of Hyperspace travel is done through Hyperspace lanes.These have known entry and exit points so any ships/stations outside those point would be safe from cross galaxy fire. What about smaller jumps like what Holdo did? Well luckily for the sanity of fans everywhere, the Empire already has a solution:No hyperspace for you!This no-fun-Freddy is an Interdictor, a ship designed with the express purpose of preventing ships in a significant area from entering hyperspace. So it’s already possible to tell that the suicide maneuver wasn’t particularly popular nor effective and even if itAccelerationThe second scenario presents a different challenge in that it’s a more detailed dive in what exactly happens when a ship enters hyperspace. Do ships accelerate into hyperspace or do they only appear to do so and kind of pop into the dimension?
