0,"I’d argue it is a Tesla. The combination of performance, economy, zero emissions, and user interface technical features are unmatched. How many cars can you watch Netlix in on a built in display and have the car record intrusions with 8 cameras while parked or drive itself from on ramp to offramp with little to no user intervention. Nobody else doing any of that that I am aware of? And, the performance versions are lightning quick and nimble.",956 followers,Fabio Seixas,24.5K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-most-innovative-car-and-why
1,"I think its tata nano, most of the high end cars are packed with a million features and a thousand horse power. Engineers have worked hard and innovated a lot on these but they had time and money. Now imagine somebody told you to design a car worth 100 k rupees or 1.67 k$ as of today and in a fixed time a fixed budget should be safe or at least pass Indian seafty standard should seat 4 people work in hill, desert , sea shore, handle Indian roads can easily serviceable should be powerful enough to bear overload( we Indians do it a lot of times) and more in a very limited time and budjet.

What will you tell your boss I think the phrase would be go @#$% yourself well not tata motors engineers they- built it, the worlds cheapest car. There are so many innovations that its a separate answer itself, like they squeezed out 38 horse power from a 624cc engine while Suzuki with its immense experience in bike and car engine could get 40 horse power from an 796 Cc engine.

The reason that you are not seeing huge gains is that the easy solutions have been found and now it is going to be very hard slugging from here on out.

19,"Here’s another example of a writer weaving a declarative sentence into a question. In this case, the writer is very wrong. Battery research has not slowed. Today more money and effort is being spent on battery research than ten years ago. This trend of spending more and more capital on battery research will continue unless and until world-wide calamity strikes, or something like atomic fusion energy is developed. I’m guessing that world-wide calamity will strike before any breakthrough, Star Wars type power source is developed.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-most-innovative-car-and-why
