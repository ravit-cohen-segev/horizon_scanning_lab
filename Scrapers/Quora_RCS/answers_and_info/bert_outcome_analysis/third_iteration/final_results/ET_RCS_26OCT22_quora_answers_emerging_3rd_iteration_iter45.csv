1,"1. Go guerilla.Guerilla marketing looks to leverage creativity, imagination and originality in place of a big budget. Smart small businesses with a limited budget often use guerilla marketing to compete with huge companies. There is no shortage of creative guerilla marketing ideas. Here are just a few examples:1. Go guerilla.Guerilla marketing looks to leverage creativity, imagination and originality in place of a big budget. Smart small businesses with a limited budget often use guerilla marketing to compete with huge companies. There is no shortage of creative guerilla marketing ideas. Here are just a few examples:2. Socialize on social media.Popular social media channels include Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Reddit, LinkedIn, Google Plus and Snapchat. Each of these social media platforms are unique in its own right and require unique ways of engagement. Rather than try to master it all at once, choose a few you like and try to master those first.3. Create valuable content.Not only do potential customers love great content, but so does Google. There are many ways to share information -- blogging, creating videos, hosting podcasts, designing infographics or submitting articles to online authority sites. Not only do you gain authority as an expert, but you also get free traffic. You can also offer to be a guest blogger for another complementary website or be interviewed on a podcast.You don’t always have to produce the content yourself. You can hire freelance writers, graphic designers and personal assistants through websites like Upwork. If you run out of ideas, you can repurpose old content and give it a new spin.4. Contests and giveaways.Everyone loves free gifts! Give away desirable or fun items to gain goodwill, build brand awareness and connect with potential customers. They don’t need to be expensive. Things such as online ebooks, white papers and checklists don’t cost you anything but your time.You can also promote your products through Facebook groups where members agree to try your product for free or a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. Physical gifts with your advertising on it such as balloons, smartphone wipes, key chains, fridge magnets, pens and notepads are always popular too.You can also create a viral marketing effect by making your marketing interesting, attractive and fun. One of the craziest marketing efforts that went viral is the Als ice bucket challenge. People dared their friends and family to pour ice cold water on themselves within 24 hours. Those who failed to do so would then have to donate to the ALS charity.5. Piggyback your partners.When you are a small business with a limited marketing budget, it makes sense to partner with other complementary businesses. These can include manufacturers, suppliers and vendors. Not only do you both win when your businesses succeed, but there is added credibility when another business recommends you.As an example, you can exchange customer lists and offer to pay the business a commission for every sale you make. Just make sure that you have requested permission from your customers to share their details!For direct mail marketing, offer to share postage costs and include your flyer with the other businesses’ mail. If the other business has a physical retail space, ask to put your business cards in their customer waiting area.You can also seek partners within your existing customer base. Create a referral rewards program where you reward your customers for referring business to you. Word of mouth is extremely effective when it comes to marketing.6. Leverage scalable advertising channels.Conventional advertising mediums such as TV, radio and newspaper ads can be extremely costly and hard to measure effectiveness, but online advertising can be cheaper and more targeted. Popular options are Google pay per click ads and Facebook ads. Also, don’t forget to list your business in free online directories like google business for Google Maps and Yelp.You also can promote your latest products and services through these free or cost effective methods:7. Milk the media.Getting your business featured by the media is free marketing. To capture the attention of the media, try these and invite the media to come and cover it.8. Help yourself by helping others.All your marketing should be of some use to your audience. There are many ways that you can make your marketing efforts a welcome intrusion rather than an annoyance to your audience. Try these:Marketing your business on a limited budget is completely possible. You just need to get creative and think out of the box.",UNKNOWN,Cory A.

4,"Investing money in your business should be a priority. However, if you are just starting up, you might have to invest your time.Once you get things going, you’ll notice that your time is actually worth a lot more.It’s like a journey through the mountains, at first you’ll have to work really hard to climb the first peak, but when you reach the end it will be worth it.Anyways, here are a few things you can and should start doing today, from free to really cheap:Investing money in your business should be a priority.

But since you want cheap ways you can’t expect to hack your growth, like VC funded startups did.After 1 or 2 years you’ll start seeing really great results.If that sounds like a lot, think of how far you would’ve been if you started doing any of these one year ago. Or 2 years ago. Or 3 years ago. It’s never too late to start your organic growth, so go out there and do it.Dan C.","2,738 followers",Gericke Potgieter,892,1.2K,5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-ways-to-use-the-top-technology-lists-to-promote-a-business
5,"One of the problems leading to South Florida receiving an anti-intellectual label is a structural one. The sort of industries that compose it's economy aren't exactly intriguing to a young intellectual person. The economy is driven by tourism - people looking to come here to have a good time, not to discuss politics or philosophy. Other pertinent industries are real estate, international trade, professional services, and agriculture. None of these are particularly intellectual, and thus, the people who inhabit the area and work in these industries won't be particularly intellectual, either (foOne of the problems leading to South Florida receiving an anti-intellectual label is a structural one.

None of these are particularly intellectual, and thus, the people who inhabit the area and work in these industries won't be particularly intellectual, either (for the most part, always exceptions of course). Compare this to a place such as Washington, DC which is ripe with start ups, non-profits, communities of young ambitious people who are in touch with the world on a global scale, and want to make change or find their own unique path.Basically, what I'm saying is that there is a relationship between the type of occupations available, the type of people who work in them, and the community that those kind of people create. South Florida is more a place to make money in proven industries and less a place to innovate, carve your own path, and be intellectual.",256 followers,Priyal Gupta,9.7K,0,0,2014,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-ways-to-use-the-top-technology-lists-to-promote-a-business
