Some new, some extremely older, some like ours coming out of primitive era, some at countless advanced levels between us and the super advanced ones of extreme age.These planets are NOT all like earth. Some are larger, some smaller. Geography and resources differ. Atmospheres differ. Sunlight differs. The variety and abundance of the various mineral elements differs.Each mortal life form comparable to humans here was created and has evolved to function best on their home sphere, not all spheres, and they will be different from us as to structure and physiology. Their plants and animals will be different. Some of these inhabited spheres are moons (one is close to us). Some few inhabited spheres have no atmosphere.I considered how their technology would develop and concluded they could have vastly different technology at any and all levels from our own level to the most advanced.On our own sphere we do not know how the great heavy stones in Egypt, Lebanon, Peru were moved and fitted, even with earthquake resistance and with surpassing skill.Their bodies work differently, their medicines would be different. Their DNA and genes all vary — they are constructed and have adapted for THEIR own spheres…I doubt any such inhabited sphere exists without any technology. Not to fight over definition of that word or your construal of it, they could have developed in a way beyond our electric and electromagnetic tech, or using it quite differently. They would have sciences unknown to us, even some spheres not greatly advanced.Mortal brains vary sphere to sphere, how beings think, what they experience differs.I do know the elements (periodic table) is the same on all mortal spheres — but there are places (higher space cosmos levels) where it is not the same. Mortals do not live there, albeit they may advance in afterlife to such levels.Therefore I see near infinite diversity as to technology and even the basic methods of life chores day to day. Not all earthlings build homes the same. Bamboo is used widely in Asia, and in Iraq there are floating houses. Aztecs had similar. England uses more stone, USA more lumber.Resources vary, see? People in cosmos do the best with what they have.Our flowers might not grow there. Does not mean they have no flowers of their own.Plant life here varies. Myanmar is different from Switzerland.If EARTH has such diversity, it is part of the proof of what I am saying about other places, see?Gravity and temperature ranges differ too. We have to take our minimal necessary environment into space, and likewise for extraterrestrials. Perhaps some use saucers with inside temp of 40 Celsius or others prefer 5 Celsius.Yes, some planets very similar to ours. But even those people have different histories, different events. Life not the same there. They do not speak English, nor Japanese, nor Russian language. Some science and tech may be like our own, but their civic institutions and most technology could be QUITE different, see?This means all of our own future here will be very interesting, and more so as WE ENCOUNTER OTHERS COSMICALLY.How very interesting life has become. They could know far more about some or all of the elements.I am ABSOLUTELY sure of what I have written here. 1980 to now = almost 4 decades of thought, and I have only summarized what I know.Space is transcendental to accommodate such variety, a last thought. Means there are many feasible Realities in the Space-time Cosmos. There are vast higher realities and a flawless Judicial System which operates perfectly when things go awry. God has Infinite Foresight. The Ancients of Days oversee this, but Christ likely executes The Judgment here. Check outAlso seeAll thoughts here are my own too. Still cannot afford books, and almost no college was allowed. Does NOT mean I am not equal to BS or MS. I am more than equal to those. There is such a thing as learning on one’s own, and our own ancients started that process, see? I have seen only Avatar short preview, cannot afford more. So, in one way you are more fortunate. You cannot live there, it was fiction. We have to solve The Planet Earth problem.Other peoples can do the same as well. Learn to have respect for others.‘Star Wars’ are 99% a fiction. The 1% originates right here, as to our locale.It appears many earthlings need to explore and develop their own innate powers of mind, body and spirit too. Many people are doing so and say this enables us to see other dimensions and to attain higher planes of consciousness, about 13, though going to 5th dimension is a great accomplishment for earthlings now. Apparently our planet will ‘translate’ to 5th dimension too, so we do not want to be left behind with the improgressive. To me, this leaves the question of children: You will not easily explain 5th dimension to baby, toddler, eh? I cannot imagine the celestial powers separating us from our kids under 18 either. So I feel sure there is some provision for our kids to accompany us which others are not mentioning. I am working on this myself, but I am single with no kids. I tend to share generously, so when I learn more, it will appear. You can trust me. Some of my answers may have pointers as to instructions on how to do this yourself with meditation-like techniques. I am at work on this, clicking away diligently. Further experience always yields better.I will share any best or better I find. I do TRUST First Source and Center or God, as you prefer. I’ve never found reason for questioning best intentions of God, in fact, so far have found infinite dedication to truth, goodness, beauty and merciful and loving tolerance for our slowness too. But we are doing better nowadays, perhaps getting a bit sharper too. I am optimistic, not unwarrantedly so. God says we can do these things, and Jesus said so likewise, see?Each extraterrestrial mortal person arrives there with differing talents and potentials too. The same as here. They are not all plumbers or chemists. Some do art, some music, and some are doctors. What they have to work with is not merely their available materials, but their special talents and learning (different from us) just like we bring all to bear here for ourselves. Lots of specialists everywhere, see?Some planets are unspeakably advanced. You would consider these (mistakenly) as Highest Heavens could you see them, but earth has a similar destiny. And there are true Heavens beyond through which we and they can all ascend.

For instance, some wild chimpanzees have entered the earliest stone age using manufactured stone tools. But we can’t tell if they succeed, and right now, we’re in the way of their evolution. Simply put: we won’t let them succeed.That’s a thing in evolution: species evolve to survive. If a species evolve into a niche that’s already taken, then that species is at a disadvantage compared to the other species that is already in the niche and will be out-competed. So species generally don’t evolve into taken niches. They evolve in other ways, not because they choose to, but because they are more likely to survive and reproduce that way.",3 followers,Samuel Bateman,1.1K,102,56.3K,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-invention-in-the-world-that-allowed-us-to-evolve-so-fast-technologically-in-so-few-years
11,"Couldn’t the humans in Avatar wipe out the Na’vi if they wanted?Yes.That was actually one of the biggest flaws of the whole movie.Let's say we humans one day become an interstellar species.And lets say that for a while that interestellar travel is done slower than light.Until we found a planet where an exotic ore existed, that would allow us to actually travel faster than light.But on that planet there is not just life, but also intelligent life.So we humans needed the ore, and we were willing to trade with the natives in order to get the ore we needed.But the natives didn't want to trade.SimpCouldn’t the humans in Avatar wipe out the Na’vi if they wanted?Yes.That was actually one of the biggest flaws of the whole movie.Let's say we humans one day become an interstellar species.And lets say that for a while that interestellar travel is done slower than light.Until we found a planet where an exotic ore existed, that would allow us to actually travel faster than light.But on that planet there is not just life, but also intelligent life.So we humans needed the ore, and we were willing to trade with the natives in order to get the ore we needed.But the natives didn't want to trade.Simple solution…That way the natives are gone, and we can mine the planet resources as we damn well pleased.Same could have been done on the movie Avatar.Which is why they should've gone to the trouble of explaining exactly why was unobtanium so important and some of its properties.In a five to ten minutes explanation they could've said something about how that ore, if contaminated by certain types of particles like fast moving neutrons would become mostly useless.That in its natural state, it needed to be mined carefully, until it could be used for human technology purposes.Thus explaining why they didn't simply nuked the entire planet from orbit.",5 followers,Dave Williams,891,879,682.4K,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-invention-in-the-world-that-allowed-us-to-evolve-so-fast-technologically-in-so-few-years

If the animals could talk they would say “Oh god, it just never stops!”.
