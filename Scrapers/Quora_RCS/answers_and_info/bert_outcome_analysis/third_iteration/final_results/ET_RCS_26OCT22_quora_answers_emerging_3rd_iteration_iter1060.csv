Most other buildings have apparently been swallowed by forest and swamp. You explore until dusk, then return and set up camp. In the morning, you search more widely. Barely anything remains, building wise, and you’ve found nobody else. You have seen a couple packs of wolves. One of them came aggressively towards you, but a couple warning shots scared them off. You see the river near where downtown used to be, but no buildings, bridges, or roads. What happened to all the people?Another day like this, and you decide to head towards Indianapolis, the nearest big city to you. You find what you think might be the route the interstate took, but it’s just a grassy path. Eventually you get there and do find a few more building remnants, and some in slightly better condition. There are no papers left to tell what happened though. On a wall of what appears to be an old courts building is spray painted “Only God can save us now”.In all your searching, you’ve found records, mainly labels on plastic items, dated up to May, 2094, but nothing after that. You are worried. You only took supplies for a week, and have no way to travel backward in time. This isn’t the future you expected. You hoped for a united Humanity, maybe even evolved into the next stage of being. You expected at least some semblance of normal society. You hoped against any sort of dystopia, but you never thought all of Humanity would be long gone.You resolve to travel to where Washington D.C. was, to try and locate answers on what happened. Two days later you scare off a wolf pack from a deer kill and cut yourself a nice slab of meat to smoke for provisions. At least the water from the streams seems clean enough. You find D.C., and the remains of the capitol building, the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, and a few other buildings. In the White House, there is a faded dry-erase board with medical jargon and the name of a Doctor at the CDC, so you assume there was some sort of terrible plague or epidemic.You go to sleep that night assuming that you are the only human left alive, but praying that you are wrong. Four weeks later, you believe there is more to the truth than just a plague. The Pentagon showed signs of an active military action being managed. Outside of it, a 100 meter tall obelisk of dark crystal with unintelligible etchings on it, stands in stark contrast to the rest of the complex. It looks almost alien to you. There are two sliders on one side. Activating one changes the etchings somewhat, sliding the other has no apparent impact, though it clicks into place and can’t be moved after that.Later that night, you are awakened by walking noises and see lights coming towards you. You emerge from your tent hoping to see humans, only to find five alien beings walking calmly towards you. They are bipedal, but with two arms on each side, grey skinned, tall and thin. The tallest is over 3 meters and the shortest is still over 2 meters. The heaviest can’t weigh more than 100 kilos. They wave you over, making peaceful motions. One speaks, but you can’t understand it. It’s speech changes once, twice, and you think to recognize Mandarin. Another few seconds and you definitely recognize French, having taken two years of it back in college. You reply “Parlez-vous Anglais?” That gets their attention, and another change gets them to speak English!They explain that they are the Parroniac race, originally from a planet orbiting a star in the Cygnus arm of the Milky Way. They now reside on hundreds of planets in that sector of the galaxy. You ask what happened to Humanity. They tell you it is a sad story. They were allies and witnesses to the Last Stand of Humanity, in the War against the Cindah-Klorids. The Cindah-Klorids were a warlike race bent on the destruction of any other race of beings they encountered. They came from the far side of the Milky Way, exterminating two other races on their way.The Parroniac had lost several planets to them, as they were not a warlike race, but a race of thinkers, artists, scientists, and logicians. The Parroniac were aware of Earth and Humanity, but had purposely avoided contacting us. Now threatened, they visited Earth and told our leaders of the future trouble headed our way. Some military advisors were flown deep into space to see the Cindah-Klorids in action. A few were caught by surprise, and lost. The ones who returned were convinced our only hope was to prepare for war, and to help the Parroniac learn military strategy to help defend themselves. That was in 2026. The Human-Parroniac alliance spent the next almost 70 years preparing, skirmishing, and outright fighting the Cindah-Klorids, much of it done with Guerrilla warfare tactics, on Earth as well as some of the Parroniac worlds.Those proved very successful against the Cindah-Klorids, who had never seen such resistance or tactics, and didn’t know how to counter them. Unfortunately, the enemy unleashed a biological weapon on the Humans - the unnamed plague you learned of. The Parroniac were not affected by it, but they could not help the Humans survive it either. The last remaining human leaders offered to give the Parroniac all of the nuclear weapons we had left to use against the enemy. The Parroniac were able to improve them by an order of magnitude, along with their guidance systems. They sent them at every known outpost of Cindah-Klorids, and waited. Their observers reported complete annihilation of the enemy.The Parroniac then offered to take the last Humans back to their planets, in order to put them in a version of cryogenic sleep, until such time as they could create a cure for the plague. There were less than 170,000 humans remaining at that point, all infected. They agreed. It took the Parroniac almost 20 of their generations (a little more than 9500 years) to find and build a cure.Then the Parroniac woke their allies and cured them. They spoke of a great celebration, a feast that lasted an entire year! The humans were returned to Earth, but the devastation and lack of infrastructure made it difficult to live there anymore. After less than a generation, they asked the Parroniac to help them find a new planet to settle. About 400 years ago, Humanity moved for the first time - to a planet they called Oceania. It is described as being very similar to Hawaii and the South Pacific Islands, only with far more islands. The survivors have been fruitful and multipled: Humanity is now up to about two million people now.Then the leader of the Parroniac group pauses a moment, looks at you, and asks the question you didn’t realize you were waiting for: “Would you like us to take you to them?”UPDATE 7/14/16: Thanks for the upvotes and the positive feedback about my little story here. You’ve motivated me to try and flesh it out more. Once I get that done, I’ll post an update here on where to find it.

Agriculture on Mars is a problem. The exterior environment is inhospitable, the soil is extremely poor, the light is weak, there’s very little water, very little nitrogen, etc, etc, etc.In order to feed people long-term on Mars, we need to grow food indoors, most likely under artificial light, and we need to be extremely careful about recycling nitrogen, water, and other minerals like phosphorus, sulfur, etc.We don’t know how to do it, but we need to know before we send people to Mars. And while we have an abundance of food on Earth today (we have a bit of a distribution problem, not a production problem), we have problems which mimic those on Mars.It’s easy to grow food when you have an abundance of water, an abundance of of fertilizer, an abundance of good soil, etc. There are places on Earth which lack some or all of these, so solutions to those problems will be of benefit on Earth and a necessity on Mars.So I would not be surprised if, once Musk gets the existing pieces of his plan back on a steady path, especially Tesla at this point, he starts working on an indoor greenhouse company.",UNKNOWN,Hector Quintanilla,27.8K,1.2K,88.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-will-technology-be-like-on-Earth-10-000-years-from-now

It’s an annoyingly long read, but I don’t know how else to explain it. Time is precious, feel free to ignore them if you’re busy.When Elon was 22 and was deciding what to do with his life, he asked himself the question: ""What will most affect the future of humanity?""2015 SourceSo when Tim Urban of Wait But Why had a chance recently toMusk's response was that it wasn't really a ""technical battle"" standing in the way, but a ""moral battle.""""You know, I call it the Hitler Problem. Hitler was all about creating the Übermensch and genetic purity, and it's like— how do you avoid the Hitler Problem? I don't know,"" he told Urban.Once you startAnd delving into the ""perfect human"" waters starts to get ethically murky very fast, especially if you are eliminating conditions that you consider undesirable. Maybe we can all agree that we'd like to get rid of Huntington's disease, but would we want to edit genes to slow aging or to eliminate autism? Those questions get harder and harder. Do we have a minimum acceptable intelligence level?It's not that Musk thinks editing humans is impossible though. When Urban pushed him on the question of solving aging, Musk said ""I mean I do think there's … in order to fundamentally solve a lot of these issues,(2016) Elon Musk interview transcript - How to Build the FutureInterviewer:Elon:Stuff doesn't need to change the world just to be good. But in terms of things that I think are most like to affect the future of humanity, I think AI is probably the single biggest item in the near-term that's likely to affect humanity. So, it's very important that we have the advent of AI in a good way. It's something that, if you could look into the crystal ball and to the future, you would like that outcome because it is something that could go wrong, as we've talked about many times. And so, we really need to make sure it goes right. So that's AI, working on AI and making sure it's great future. That's the most important thing, I think, right now, the most pressing item.Then, I would say anything to do with genetics. If you can actually solve genetic diseases, if you can prevent dementia or Alzheimer's or something like that with genetic reprogramming, that would be wonderful. So I thinkAnd then, I think, having a high-bandwidth interface to the brain. We're currently bandwidth-limited. We have a digital tertiary self in the form of out email capabilities, our computers, phones, applications. We're practically superhuman. But we're extremely bandwidth-constrained in that interface between the cortex and that tertiary digital form of yourself. And helping solve that bandwidth constraint would be, I think, very important in the future as well. Yeah.Now we check if Elon has invested in any companies researching genetics.This ambitious, future-oriented genetics biotechnology startup was founded by brothers William and Michael Andregg in 2008 with the goal ofThe company said in 2009 that it wanted to ""sequence 100% complete human genome"" in less than 10 minutes for less than $100, according toBut with many companies competing with the fastest and cheapest DNA sequencing technologies,SourceHalcyon Molecular was aHalcyon was founded by the brothers William Andregg and Michael Andregg in 2008, and was based, first at theWikipedia(Jan 4, 2017) Synthego Raises $41 Million From Investors, Including a Top Biochemist(Mar 1, 2017) How Synthego’s founders went from a mission to Mars to a mission to cure disease(April 15, 2017) The not-so-secret plan to genetically modify astronautsExperiments have begun to alter human cells in the lab.
