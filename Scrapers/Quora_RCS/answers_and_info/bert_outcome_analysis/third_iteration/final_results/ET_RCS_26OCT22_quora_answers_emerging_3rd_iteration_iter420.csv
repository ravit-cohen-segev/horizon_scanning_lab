Hence, Ratna arrives when all other varieties of mangoes are making an exit from the market.It bears a fleshy, pulpy fruit that's much softer than Alphonso. It's deep orange inside, and is so saccharine that you'll suspect if they've injected sugar artificially into it.

5,"People who ask this question unfortunately do not know what they're doing. I don't want to sound harsh, but it's absolutely true.I know people who make $150,000 every single year on Kindle without lifting a finger. They did the work a long time ago, and every single year, just like clockwork, Kindle delivers $150,000 to them without fail.This is the power of online passive income, and yes, Kindle Publishing is one powerful example of such income.What Did They Do Right That a Lot of People on Kindle Do Wrong?1.

I don't want to sound harsh, but it's absolutely true.I know people who make $150,000 every single year on Kindle without lifting a finger. They did the work a long time ago, and every single year, just like clockwork, Kindle delivers $150,000 to them without fail.This is the power of online passive income, and yes, Kindle Publishing is one powerful example of such income.What Did They Do Right That a Lot of People on Kindle Do Wrong?1. You Have to Target the Right CategoriesI wish I could tell you that all book categories on Kindle are created equal. They are not.And that's why if you picked the wrong category, don't expect to make any money. It's as simple as that.If you wanna know which categories make money, you have to explore a lot of categories, read a lot of book descriptions, and you will see the sales ranking of many different books.And after enough research, you would realize that some categories have more books ranked 10,000 or better in the sales ranking than others.Why should you pay attention to the 10,000 sales ranking mark?Well, if your book has that sales ranking, there's a 99.9% chance that your book will make $10,000 per year. That's per title. Imagine that.If you had 10 books and all of them ranked 10,000 or better, you are pretty much guaranteed $100,000 year after year.You don't have to work to produce that money. It comes automatically.And this is all possible because authors target certain categories and not others.Do your research. Find those categories.2. Produce VolumeI wish I could tell you that once you've identified hot categories where you get your book a sales ranking of 10,000 or better, then you're good to go.Wrong!You have to sell books in those categories first.How do you do this?Well, you won't be able to pull it off with just one book or even ten books. People have their preferences.In many cases, they have established themselves as authors in your target categories. It's going to be very hard to peel people away from the communities that have sprung organically around their author brand.How do you make headway?Produce a lot.So you look at a category and you break it up into different subtopics and produce a book for each subtopic. This way, people keep seeing your name. Eventually, enough of them will give you a shot and read your book.Does this mean that all of them will become fans? Obviously not!The vast majority of them probably won't like your work. But that's ok.As long as you keep up the volume, enough will like your stuff and before you know it, a chain reaction takes place and you have a nice organic community of ready buyers and fans for your work.Not only do they buy your back catalog, but they also wait eagerly for your new stuff.That's how you play the game on Kindle.Two Solutions to Kindle SuccessThe first solution to producing a tremendous amount of books in a short period of time on Kindle is to do the obvious.That's right! Look into outsourcing.There are lots of cheap writers all over the world who would love to jump at the opportunity to write your next book.The problem is, a lot of them are not very good and a lot of them don't know how to write for an American audience. This is the sad reality that a lot of publishers, who use outsourced writers who are nonnative English speakers, find out in the worst way possible.They spend a few hundred bucks outsourcing outside the country and they end up selling very few books if at all.You should look for native English speakers, more specifically American authors who are published ghostwriters. I'm talking about people like Kim Maddow, Timothy Phillips, Gene Eugenio, Michael Paulson, and similar authors.You may be thinking to yourself, ""Don't these people charge thousands of dollars per book?"" No.These are known to be cheap ghostwriters. I'm not talking about cheap in terms of quality, but I'm talking about cheap in terms of price.Gene Eugenio for example produces 6,000-word books for less than $150. He's not alone.There are many other low-cost American writers.The downside to this approach, though, is that they tend to specialize in certain topics. that's why they're able to crank out so many books in such a short period of time and charge very little money.You have to do your research as to which authors specialize in which categories so you can pick the right category that you can saturate.The Other SolutionThe other solution is to write the book yourself.I know you're probably breaking out in a sweat right now because you're thinking you're gonna have to slave over each book. If it takes you forever to write a grocery list, can you imagine how long it will take you to write a complete book?Well, the good news is, you don't have to write things by hand. That's right! You don't have to hunker over your keyboard, cranking out every paragraph and sentence.No!You can get in front of a microphone and just talk.This is how I've been writing my books for several years now. I just get in front of a microphone and I have my outline on my word processor and I just look at the few words on the outline and I speak improvisationally.If this sounds fantastic to you, please understand that it's very hard the first few times you do it.But as you get used to it, eventually you start thinking in clear terms and your train of logic becomes harder to derail.You're able to focus and remain concentrated until you get whatever you're trying to get off your chest out.That's how you maximize your volume.Because if you're gonna be writing stuff by hand, you'd be lucky if you can crank out 2,000 words per day.But if you dictate your books, you can hit 50,000 words per day.This is not a theory. This is not speculation. I've done it so I know it's doable.To get started with dictating your books, look into online resources like HubSpot and dictablogger. These are online resources that help people create content through dictation. These are free.You just need to have the time and discipline to perfect your dictation skills.",68 followers,Aashray Raj,705,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-10-technology-or-finished-products-that-India-imports
