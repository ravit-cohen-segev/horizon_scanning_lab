Calculus is hard the first time you learn it. In a way this is a positive because you won't coast and then get murdered in junior year.-Even if you are academically prepared you will be spending a lot of time studying while the kid across the hall goes to frat parties Tuesday nights.-The lack of coursework in your area of interest can be infuriating, though this can be remedied with student orgs in your area of interest. I added a list of good engineering student orgs to look at below.Second Year:Pros-This is when you start to feel more like an engineer and less like a high schooler. Mechanical Eng, Aerospace Eng. and Civil Eng. are learning about how structures work and more about the math that governs mechanics. Computer Science/engineering is learning what a computer really is the intricacies of algorithms. And i'm sure the other ones do something cool...-You will probably be able to get a cool internship! Keep in mind doing all the applications is a lot of work. My one friend got a summer job at SpaceX and while he was there happened upon Elon Musk and Larry Page.Cons-It's more work than freshman year and if you were coasting through thus far you are going to need to change up your work ethic.-You're going to need to make priorities. Is getting this project done more important than working out this week? Is going to a party worth getting a lower grade on that test on monday?Third Year:Pros-This is real engineering. By the end of the year Aerospace Engineers will be able to design an aircraft. Computer Engineers can basically design a computer. Chemical Engineers will be able to end their miserable full course load existence with a powerful poison they concocted (Full disclosure I don't really understand what a chemical engineer learns junior year and whether they would be able to poison themselves)-You will almost definitely get a cool summer internshipCons-OMG it gets hard.Fourth Year:Pros-Hopefully you finish with a pretty good >3.0 GPA in which case you can look forward to a nice starting salary at a good firm doing cool things.-You get to watch the anguished faces of liberal arts majors struggling to find employment-Engineering teaches you how to think in a very methodical way.

Power - including HVAC for cooling, power distribution, power backup, etc - is the big soul sucking cost involved in running a supercomputer center.Uptime, that’s a thing too - give a very large number of cores (say, oh, I dunno, 100k cores or bigger) and very complex problems, the odds of having a CPU core failure or a memory failure or some other failure that blows out one of the nodes in your computing constellation are nearly guaranteed to mean that you have to deal with that, in real time. So, you can’t write software that just naively assumes that everything is fine all the time, and you can’t count on the OS to know that things are fine or not because there’s no “OS” for the constellation as a whole, just for the individual blades…If you’re trying to make a supercomputer for your own use, you will find that it’s not too hard, for some definition of “supercomputer”.

What is the maximum amount of energy he could produce?Superman's powers rely on his cells' ability to absorb and metabolize solar energy from yellow stars like Earth's sun.So next we would want to know the amount of energy the average star can provide. Fortunately, one of our friends on Quora has already answered this question for us:1.3 Quattuordecillion (10^45) Joules.1 Quattuordecillion is 1 quintillion times 1 quintillion. Now, if Superman decides he wants to drain all the energy from other stars and give it to us I think we’ll end up with more energy we can handle! But let’s calculate just for fun.There are about 100 billion stars in the observable universe. So we end up with a simple multiplication.Answer.Also, for the person who asked me what Superman's salary could be in the comic;First, In the comic, a scientist commented on the generator saying,The energy it generates will be so cheap, everyone can afford a western style of living.I think we can assume that everyone would have given up on competing in the energy market and Superman has dominated it, so Superman would at least be making 567 Quintillion joules a year.In a 6 hours-a-day, 5 days-a-week work schedule, he'd be making around 400 Quadrillion Joules an hour. That would be around $100 million!! Nice!But wait there's moreIn reality the surplus amount of energy will result in a decrease in electricity prices.According to the UNECE 2011 statistics the country with the poorest average annual income is Tajikistan at $247, and the energy bill in an average U.K. household is £1,264 or $1849(If energy prices are affordable to everyone, then the energy would be so cheap that even people at Tajikistan can afford it. So, whats 4% of $247? $9.88. 0.7% of the original price of electricity.Answer.If I get 150 up votes I might do the Flash too;)",1 follower,Atom Scott,2.2K,0,0,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-impact-would-be-on-the-China-Navy-after-Japan-unveiled-the-3-000-ton-Big-Whale-submarine

Why should Lex be jailed and Max go free merely because of an accident in geography?At first, you dismiss Luthor’s prattling. Who is he to discuss morality? I mean, Christ, you’re Superman. Truth, Justice, blah, blah, blah. But you can’t avoid the nagging feeling that he may have something. How can you punish or save people based solely on who lives closest? Wasn’t it just this morning when you saved that boy from drowning in the Hudson, while 186 people died when a dam gave way in Taiwan? And yesterday, when you stopped a boulder from crushing that lady and her daughter in their car, a landslide killed 73 Koreans. How can you justify that?Well, you try. Your motto is about theYou’ve got a problem, but you’ve also got a 300 point IQ, so it doesn’t take long for you to come up with a solution.

In that five minutes it takes to save Lois, you could diffuse a bomb which stands to kill 40 Jordanians. Now what are you supposed to do? You can’t just turn your back on Lois, but your time/ lives saved ratio goes right out the window if you start making exceptions for those you care about.Time for that Einstein IQ to kick in again. The solution is simple. All you have to do is vow to saveWell, you’re feeling pretty good about yourself until a few lobbyists come a-knocking. It’s all very well and good to save people from death, but what is becoming of the rape victims, the robberies, the torturing of prisoners in totalitarian regimes? Aren’t these things pretty bad? How can you draw the line at saving only those about to be killed? Of course you can’t. They must be stopped. You may have to quit your job at the Planet, but you certainly can’t sit idly by and let people be harmed. After all, Truth, Justice, et cetera...Well, you’re working overtime now. But they don’t call you Superman for nothing. You handle the job diligently, and you don’t even take off for New Year’s, missing the party on the Paramount backlot that Aquaman was going on and on about. You’re just starting to think that you’ve got the hang of this superhero thing when the ACLU wonders why only blue collar, violent crime is being prevented. What about the corporate crime, what about scams which take money from the elderly, the Bernie Madoff’s of the world, and the Martin Shkrelis of the world, pricing their drugs out of the reach of the lower and middle class?The scientists of the world are also coming at you hard. Sure you’ve stopped crime, but more people die of diseases in the world then by guns and knives. You’ve got a 300 IQ. Surely you can come up with a cure for most diseases. You agree, because Truth, Justice, whatever, and you start working on vaccines for plagues around the world.They say Superman never sweats (remember that Arid Extra Dry endorsement deal?) but your day is getting pretty full. Twelve hours of crime prevention, four hours of research into corporate crime, and six hours developing vaccines for the world’s most deadly ailments. You’re burning the candle at both ends, and you never get to your little cabin in the North Pole anymore, but you accomplish your task. AIDS, cancer, Coronavirus, everything.But life turns ugly pretty quickly. Sure, crime is no longer a concern, but you’ve created an even bigger problem. Now, thanks to you, only the elderly pass quietly away, and you’ve tripled the speed of population growth. Starvation, overcrowding, diseases, energy depletion, are being affected by your heroism. Within a year, things will become desperate.“What the hell???” you think. You are doing everything you can, but the world doesn’t seem naturally built for saving. And saving the human race is like a huge game of whack-a-mole. Beat down one problem, and another pops up in its place. You come to one inevitable conclusion.Superman cannot save the world.The only thing you can do is help people help themselves. But perhaps you can inspire them. Maybe you can show them how wonderful life can truly be. Help get people to involve themselves in life, not simply fight their way through it. Help them unleash their creativity, start schools, talk to neighbors. Help people express themselves creatively and have a voice in the world. Become a teacher of people rather than a savior. Because in the end, maybe the world can never be a completely safe place, but it can be a BETTER place.And you don’t need to be Superman to make it that way.","19,567 followers",Ariel Williams,536,2.8K,23.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-impact-would-be-on-the-China-Navy-after-Japan-unveiled-the-3-000-ton-Big-Whale-submarine

17,"I kind of agree with the ""all of them"" answer, because not only do writers not want to make characters too powerful, they also probably don't think as hard about a character's powers as someone with those powers would. IOW, if you had Iceman's powers, you'd probably spend a lot of time thinking about them and experimenting with them -- and figuring out how to maximize them. A writer can't put that much time into making a character more powerful, and probably wouldn't want that end result anyway.But some of them do stand out to me. Speaking of Iceman (and as mentioned elsewhere in this thread),I kind of agree with the ""all of them"" answer, because not only do writers not want to make characters too powerful, they also probably don't think as hard about a character's powers as someone with those powers would. IOW, if you had Iceman's powers, you'd probably spend a lot of time thinking about them and experimenting with them -- and figuring out how to maximize them. A writer can't put that much time into making a character more powerful, and probably wouldn't want that end result anyway.But some of them do stand out to me. Speaking of Iceman (and as mentioned elsewhere in this thread), he is manipulating energy (heat) at an atomic level somehow, and that's incredible -- much more impressive than making ice. If he could figure out how to access that energy manipulation directly, he would be the most powerful person on earth.The same principle applies to characters like Cyclops and the Hulk. When Cyclops fires his force beam, Newtonian physics say there must be a recoil -- which there isn't. Where does it go? How does it go there? Ask the same question with the mass that Bruce Banner gains and Hulk loses in their transformations -- where does it come from/go to, and how does it get there? Marvel's explanation is that the missing stuff goes to another dimension -- which means both characters can open and close dimensional portals. Right now they're doing it subconsciously, but if they accessed that power directly they wouldn't need force beams or great strength any more.Then there are characters like Invisible Woman and Green Lantern, who can create anything they can imagine out of thin air. The physics of that is hair-raising, so again figuring out how that works would probably lead to even greater power. But as is, they can beat anyone who breathes by cutting of their air, and any humanoid by blocking blood to the brain by imagining a ball bearing in their carotid artery.In Green Lantern's case, it's amazing that anyone can beat him. Even in the Silver Age, when fighting Goldface (a guy in gold armor), there was an astounding array of indirect ways to beat him: Cut off gravity beneath him, remove the earth's inertia and sling him across the solar system, cut off his air, dissolve the ground beneath him, and on and on. It just takes imagination.And since color is a perception of radiation absorption and reflection, would something still be yellow if you blocked light around it? It would be effectively black. Or heat the air around it until it changes color. Or bring a spray can and spray one spot black and affect that. Seriously, there's no way to beat a Green Lantern with a functioning brain -- which is probably why Hal Jordan got the reputation for being a little dim among comics fans, all of whom could imagine more effective ways to use the ring (and they could remember them issue to issue, which is something Hal Jordan didn't do, because then the strip would be boring).In fact, there's an argument that pulling on a green uniform and fighting crime as a superhero is the least effective use of the power ring. One can imagine a Green Lantern solving everything from cancer to the Mideast from his La-Z-Boy, with no one knowing where all those green miracles were coming from.Ditto with the Flash. A guy who can move at close to the speed of light can't be stopped with a cold gun. Captain Cold would be in jail before he was aware the Flash was present. And that's just if he uses the Speed Force to move fast -- if it was better understood, it could probably be used to freeze time or blow up planets.Or take Spider-Man's spider-sense. It means Spider-Man can, in some sense, see the future. If he could master that ability, it would be a lot more useful a power/weapon than a proportional-strength-of-a-spider punch!But the purpose of comics isn't to make the characters all powerful. It's to entertain. And the more problems and hurdles a hero faces, the more entertaining the story.

He did try to join the FF early on, and was propositioned by the Avengers in the 90s, was briefly on the Fantastic 4, but didn't join a team until sometime after 2003 (when my knowledge stops.)  Spider-Man is probably the BEST teammate a superhero could have.  One the one hand, he has the power and personality to go into the action and distract. On the other hand, he's smart and creative and can have a more strategic approach if there's time.  His Spider-Sense allows him to react quickly and he's great with spontaneity.In any battle, I would put my money on the side that has Spider-Man - not because he's the most powerful, but because he's the best team player.  He would have been a lot more effective in New York had he invested in finding a teammate - practically invincible.

27,"Shortest possible answer: All of them.Explanation: Keep in mind that when characters are conceptualized, that's exactly what they are: Concepts. They fit archetypes.

Characters generally fit into a group as a role. SeeSomeone like the Hulk or Hercules generally fit the same role in a group. They're The Big Guy. They represent physical power, and that's what they bring to a fight scene. Even in their solo comics, the way they generally solve their problems is in a Big Guy sort of way.The reason comics do it that way is because someone who can do literally everything equally well is boring and too powerful (see Superman in the Silver Age) because there's no drama.Now...The flipside is also true. When Grant Morrison took on the relaunch of the JLA back in the 90's, he was told that the JLA membership was going back to the ""Big Seven"" comprised of Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, Green Lantern, The Flash, The Martian Manhunter, and Aquaman. To someone in 2015, Batman seems like an obvious choice, but back then you had some of the most powerful people in the DC universe on tap...why do you need Batman? A lot of Batman's ludicrously over-preparedness started coming into focus outside of Batman's own comic at this time, and hearkened in an age of writers coming up with creative thinking. This culminated with the ""Tower of Babel"" storyline in JLA, where it turned out Batman had elaborate plans laid out to take out every single member of the DCU, especially the JLA, in case they went rogue.But it's always fun to see when a good writer gets on a series. In Morrison's JLA, Wally West apocryphally made Barry Allen out to be a master of creatively using the wishy-washy physics of the comic book world (in the form of ""Flash Facts"") to do things like infinite-mass lightspeed punches that can be delivered a near-infinite number of times a minute to a target.On the other hand, some writers have tried to come up with in-universe explanations for why someone with X power can't do ancillary power Y. The explanation for this is usually something to do with ""Required Secondary Superpowers"" (which is also a trope; seeOne of my favorite characters who had the implications of his powers explored by someone else was Iceman. When Emma Frost was living in his head, she pointed out that Bobby had squandered his powers. He got defensive and pointed out that initially he wasn't so much ICEman as much as he was SNOWman with a slushy coating. She pointed out he clearly had no clue how his powers had to work. Keep in mind that to create the cold to freeze things, you areAnother one was Storm. One author pointed out that while Storm's powers explicitly protect her from the effects of weather (including heat and cold) it does so by overclocking or underclocking her metabolism. When she was stuck in the Arctic with Xavier and Cyclops, her body was dangerously overclocking her to try and fight the cold and it was killing her. In some cases later on, her vastly flexible metabolism was used on at least one occasion to feign death.
