4,"96% of all companies seeking funding, never get funded. So, the short answer is, in most cases “you don’t”. You will need to create a business plan and pitch deck and lots of other things that investors will want to see. You will have to pitch hundreds of times with no success. Uber pitched 523 times before someone said “Yes”. I passed on both Uber and Lyft.

They pick a topic and we discuss it to narrow it down, then define a problem statement. They propose how to address it by posting an outline and I critique that, then they begin to populate a draft outline with references they’ll use in writing and I comment on those. Then they begin populating the outline with draft text and I critique that.
