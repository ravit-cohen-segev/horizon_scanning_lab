0,"The world’s smallest propeller is one of the biggest advancements in nanotechnology.Its made out of Nickel and Silica, believe it or not but it’s length is just 70 nanometers long!Meaning that it is 100 times smaller than the diameter of a red blood cell.It was developed by German Scientist and has been giving many engineers the possibility of nanotechnology.The STM(Scanning Tunneling Microscope) is another advancement in nanotechnology because it has a point that is one atom long. It can actually move individual atoms.These are the biggest advancements in nanotechnology so far.",469 followers,Daniel Cohort,11.9K,377,1.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-technologies-are-currently-in-development-that-when-they-emerge-will-suddenly-accelerate-nanotechnology-advancement-at-a-rapid-pace

3,"Goodness gracious, where do we begin?Polymeric biocompatible nanoparticles are a hot topic! Nanotechnology is seeing a huge exploration for a class of nanoparticles to be used as miniature packages for admistering drugs. Many labs are searching for the “Nanotech Holy Grail” of these classes of materials to increase the efficacy of anti-tumor drugs, or vaccines, or atherosclerosis drugs. Any day now, a breakthrough will change modern medicine forever, in that diseases will no longer be death sentences and harmful side effects will be a thing of the past.Some examples of prominent researchers inGoodness gracious, where do we begin?Polymeric biocompatible nanoparticles are a hot topic!

5,Plain and simple answer: for political convenience of Muslim appeasement and vote bank politics. India has its culture that is rooted in its ancient civilization that was never phobic of diversity. Indian society will remain an open democratic society only as long as Hindus are in majority. Whether you add word secular or delete it makes no different.Now imagine if all Hindus are slaughtered as Hyderabadi fanatic mullah Owaisi desires. Will India be secular or democratic? No. It will be another terroristan.,357 followers,Rohit Dwivedi,2.2K,370,2.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-technologies-are-currently-in-development-that-when-they-emerge-will-suddenly-accelerate-nanotechnology-advancement-at-a-rapid-pace

7,"No. I do not think so.Whatever the faults Pandit Nehru and his daughter had, and they had plenty of them just as all humans have plenty of flaws, they cannot be accused of any communalism. I don’t think they had a single communal bone in their body.Asking this question also brings another question to mind - Do we really think that millions of Muslims in IndiaNo. I do not think so.Whatever the faults Pandit Nehru and his daughter had, and they had plenty of them just as all humans have plenty of flaws, they cannot be accused of any communalism. I don’t think they had a single communal bone in their body.Asking this question also brings another question to mind - Do we really think that millions of Muslims in IndiaI think Indira added ‘secular’ to the preamble of the constitution to signal the fact that India was NOT repeat NOT a theocratic State.Putting the word ‘secular’ in the constitution also meant that it would make it harder for succeeding generations of politicians to make India a theocratic-democracy (read India for Hindus). I think she had a genuine abhorrence for majoritarianism and this move make it difficult for it to be enshrined in the constitution of the country.I have issues with a lot of decisions that Mrs. Gandhi took, this is not one of them. In fact, I am quite glad that she did it.It is also possible that she was being very cynical. Emergency had stolen civil rights from citizens. Perhaps she wanted to put up religious rights as a substitute.","2,273 followers",Neelarka Ray,601,172,3.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-technologies-are-currently-in-development-that-when-they-emerge-will-suddenly-accelerate-nanotechnology-advancement-at-a-rapid-pace
