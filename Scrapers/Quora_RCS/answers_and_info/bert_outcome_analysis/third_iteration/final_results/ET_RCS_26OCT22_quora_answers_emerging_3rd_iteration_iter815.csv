0,"Making a 3D printer that could print a 3D printer was the end goal of the RepRap project, who spent a long time trying to device a 3D printer what could be built using only parts made on a 3D printer, as well as figuring out how to increase the range of materials which a 3D printer could print. This project had a large hand in the development of much of the technology in modern low-end 3D printers, including a lot of the research that went into the nozzles and filament drive mechanism. But the Reprap project was ultimately a failure, and never really got all that close to a completely printedMaking a 3D printer that could print a 3D printer was the end goal of the RepRap project, who spent a long time trying to device a 3D printer what could be built using only parts made on a 3D printer, as well as figuring out how to increase the range of materials which a 3D printer could print.

But the Reprap project was ultimately a failure, and never really got all that close to a completely printed printer.One major challenge is the materials. It’s not hard to print the major structural elements, but 3D printed bearings and linear guides don’t work very well, and there’s just no good way to print a microcontroller or a motor at the moment. There’s also the issue of the extruder nozzle, which has to be harder and withstand higher temperatures than the materials it’s printing, so there’s no way to print it with itself.Your application would also have problems with print accuracy. All printers have a limit to the accuracy of the parts they print. A printer’s accuracy is limited by the accuracy of the parts it was printed with. With a normal hand-assembled printer you can hand-tune for better accuracy, but printers which blindly make more printers without assistance are going to have worse accuracy in every generation. That problem gets even worse if each generation is smaller, as the accuracy errors will get much worse with each iteration there.","3,411 followers",Louis Vaught,708,1.2K,13.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-technological-advancement-after-the-3D-printer

A detector whose sensitivity to light varys in wavelength and depth of the sensor. Each pixel having a substantial depth and sensitivity to particular wavelengths from top to bottom.Just guessing here, but1. 2D hyper spectral imaging over wide wavelength bands (UV, visible, near, mud and long wave infrared).

4,"It will launch a great suppression of the people. First, wars will be lauched. Alongside that, a situation like now in China will be installed over the entire globe: camera’s, point system. There will be slavery. There will be an elite controlling the people with A.I. There will be torture. There will be killing.Then I expect sooner or later the whole thing will collapse.Besides that, since regions like Africa are hard to control quickly, I expect there will be a resistance movement.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,17K,996,156M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-technological-advancement-after-the-3D-printer

7,"No. AI is NOT advanced and after more than 50 years in development it still is bug ridden and very limited in its abilities. You can learn how to use these programs very inexpensively. AI is really called “machine learning” and several companies have taken the misery out of trying to write the programs and offer services (such as Amazon) that will analyze your data and teach you about machine learning. Their services are VERY inexpensive, and you will discover most of what you hear about AI is hype or just plain science fiction.What will propel the markets is the same thing that has propelledNo. AI is NOT advanced and after more than 50 years in development it still is bug ridden and very limited in its abilities.
