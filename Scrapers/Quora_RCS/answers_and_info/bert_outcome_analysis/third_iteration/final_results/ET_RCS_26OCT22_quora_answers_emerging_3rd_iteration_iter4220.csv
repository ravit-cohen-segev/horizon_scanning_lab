0,"Because China has one of the biggest, if not the, markets in the world.And because China has the most complete supply chain in the world, highly skilled labor force, and a pro business legal environment. It's not about low labor costs.It took them just one year from starting building the factory to producing the first batch of Tesla cars in China. Can you do that anywhere else?",3 followers,Steve Baker,1.1K,27.4K,163.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-supportive-can-we-expect-to-be-of-Tesla-and-Elon-Musk-in-the-face-of-demand-and-competition-from-China-and-Japan-for-this-revolutionary-technology-since-it-is-fairly-costly-to-produce-own-a-Tesla-at-this-moment-1
1,"They were waiting on the Chinese government to give them permission to actually sell them. They got that permission to start shipping on Dec 30th…so you’d expect them to be filling up every available space with new cars ready for the moment when they could start shipping them.Since they had only ever shipped a few dozen cars to employees prior to the 30th, you’d expect it to take time to iron out any kinks in the delivery system.Once they have cars heading out to their delivery centers - and with the small mountain of pre-orders from Chinese customers, that parking lot is going to get empty, fThey were waiting on the Chinese government to give them permission to actually sell them.

The more up-market dual-motor cars are still being exported from the USA. So right now, the flow of cars is definitelyShould the production of cars in China ever get to the point where it exceeds Chinese demand, the excess cars would likely to go Australia - which is also gradually building in demand now that they have a halfway decent super-charger network. Shipping cars from China to the USA and from USA to Australia makes no sense when the Australian market is hungry for Tesla cars.Beyond the Australian market lies South Korea and India…both of which may well prove to represent a HUGE demand - which would also be most logically be supplied from the Chinese factory.The photo below shows something else - on the left side of the photo you can see a large area of empty concrete with a lighting pole sticking up from it…looks to me like that’s the start of a new parking lot. If they’re going to increase production to 400,000 cars per year - then the existing 600 car parking lot we see there would fill up in just 13 hours!For me - the most interesting question is why there is not one single red or blue car in the photo?!?",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,960,996,156M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-supportive-can-we-expect-to-be-of-Tesla-and-Elon-Musk-in-the-face-of-demand-and-competition-from-China-and-Japan-for-this-revolutionary-technology-since-it-is-fairly-costly-to-produce-own-a-Tesla-at-this-moment-1

The video of a Chinese Tesla (Model 3?) swimming out of a flooded tunnel went viral a few weeks ago, a testament to the robust design and technology of Tesla brand.Before asking why, ask if.

3,"Tesla is being treated as the standard-bearer of an American company setting up and operating in China without local partners. As such, China wants to demonstrate that Tesla can succeed. I think they’ll do fine as an established brand and a company already selling imported cars into China. China is a much bigger market than the USA and electric cars are obviously popular due to government regulation so if Tesla can’t succeed, there’s something wrong with them.The problem for Tesla is that unlike in the US, there is a lot of competition for electric vehicles in China, some established and plentTesla is being treated as the standard-bearer of an American company setting up and operating in China without local partners.

4,"Smartness on part of ChinaTesla was looking for a cheap manufacturing place. It had to be either China or India because both have the same cost.

6,"Remember way back when Jobs was forced to step down from running Apple, only to be brought back because they discovered no one had the moxy, vision, or intelligence to keep Apple as innovative and successful as well as he did?

Not because they're incapable of understanding how to run a business, but because no one could possibly possess the vision and willpower Musk has to accomplish the mammoth job the same way he can.If Musk were voted out as CEO, I would personally sell every share of Tesla stock I own. Not because there aren't people as smart as Musk or with perhaps more experience, but because, like Jobs, there is only ONE Musk, and he's the proverbial man of the hour for the arduous task at hand. I've witnessed Elon do the impossible not just once or twice, but many times--things I'm certain not another living man could do, and that's if they had the balls to even try.Expect human flaws, expect bumpy and uncertain periods, expect stock prices to rise and fall, expect negative press and critics, expect competition, expect the unexpected, because that's where we're at. But don't for a second think that because you disagree with some of Musk's personal choices, or you're uneasy about your Tesla investment, or you’re scared due to the press you read, that there's a single person on this planet as adept as Musk to run Tesla--if for no other reason than Elon is used to hearing people tell him he'll fail and then ultimately proving them wrong.",12 followers,Johnny Le,601,1.5K,4.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-supportive-can-we-expect-to-be-of-Tesla-and-Elon-Musk-in-the-face-of-demand-and-competition-from-China-and-Japan-for-this-revolutionary-technology-since-it-is-fairly-costly-to-produce-own-a-Tesla-at-this-moment-1
