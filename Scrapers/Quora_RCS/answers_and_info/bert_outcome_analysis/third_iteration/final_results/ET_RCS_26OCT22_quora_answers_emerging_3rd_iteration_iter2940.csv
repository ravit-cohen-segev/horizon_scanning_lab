1,"Such a question can only be answered on the basis of our current understanding of fundamental physics. According to that, the most advanced technology would be a small artificial black hole. It would convert half of all matter dropped into it into radiation that could be used to accelerate a starship to almost the speed of light. It is not physically possible to design a more powerful engine.There is a similar upper limit to the power of any computing device, because cramming more than a certain amount of information into any finite radius will cause the formation of a black hole.

You can’t invent computing without electricity. You can’t have gunpowder without strictly controlling fire (ignition at will). All technology is built on a platform of previous technology.We probably developed modern brains on a wide scale between 60 and 100 thousand years ago. For quite a while after that, we were still just spending time surviving. Language is evolving, we’re doing the hunter gatherer thing. Our days were mostly consumed with subsistence and learning how to express abstraction. There was no such thing as abstraction before we came along. We had to invent how to talk about the future, plan, and communicate with other tribes without killing each other. There were lots of things to work out with this new hardware upstairs.Finally, we learned how to control plants on a wide scale, i.e. agriculture begins. That was about 10,000 years ago. At this point, we have an abundance of food and we don’t have to chase animals around the land all year. So, we’ve really only had 10,000 years to develop anything resembling technology. Before we had an abundance of calories, we were too busy surviving and figuring out what to Do with a brain like this before that.If you think what has happened in 10,000 years, it is almost mind blowing. Everything in history, everything that has ever been invented, written, or built was effectively done in the last 10,000 years. Wow, incredible!Last thing, it was really industrialization that led to the acceleration of technological development. You have to have machines to build new machines. “Machine shops”, where they build parts for other machines, took off. From the early part of last century on, we built a ridiculous number of machines and figured out how to use electricity as a power source. Remember, that’s only about 100 years ago. Another wow. So, in 100 years, we went from a light bulb to a computer doing billions of calculations a second (that’s on almost everybody’s desk top). We built a huge machine, stuck a few computers, and some bottled up fire in it, and flew some humans to our moon. In about 100 years. Again, mind blowing.I’m almost scared what is going to happen in the 100 years, let alone 1000. We’re almost too smart for our own good. Hopefully, smart enough not to extinguish ourselves.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-advanced-technology-you-could-imagine-humanity-producing-in-millennia-to-come

Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party.

Or maybe no one ever invented it in the first place.Of course, there is the real world answer: the first Star Trek was made on a tight budget and the Transporter was an idea used to get the cast onto alien planets without having to make expensive effects shots of the shuttlecraft leaving the Enterprise and landing on the planet. Star Wars had a much healthier budget for effects, especially after the first movie was such a success.","220,600 followers",Franklin Veaux,738,47.3K,782.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-advanced-technology-you-could-imagine-humanity-producing-in-millennia-to-come

Once again, we have a tiny analog screen on a large bulky panel, surrounded by buttons and lights.Considering how advanced the technology in Star Wars is, the computers (and cameras for that matter) look very outdated even by our current standards. We have large but compact screens with much higher display quality. Our controls are much more compact. In fact, we can make touch screens with minimum external controls.That said, there were times when Star Wars displayed some very nice futuristic technology. What comes to mind is “Sabotage”, an episode from 5th season of Clone Wars. In it, Ahsoka Tano is investigating bombing of the Jedi Temple, using interactive holographic reconstruction of the event.This looks like something straight from Iron Man, and it is nice to see something as futuristic in Star Wars, though it is somewhat rare.

This part of the galaxy was technologically behind the core worlds, and as a result is less technologically developed. This is alluded to when Luke says “If there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.”Plus, over half of the locations we see in the Original Trilogy are mostly uninhabited. Yavin is hidden, secret base, as is Hoth. Endor is inhabited by teddy bears, and Dagobah has a ketamine-fueled frog with terrible grammar. Do you expect these places to have skyscrapers like Coruscant?Finally on our planets list, we have Bespin. Bespin is very technologically advanced. It's literally a massive city hanging in the clouds that’s 400 stories high. Making that is pretty impressive, and is arguably more impressive than anything in the prequels.When it comes to ships, remember that the Rebel Alliance used anything they could find. They stole their Y-Wings bombers and made their X-Wings in suboptimal conditions. The Empire, on the other hand, emphasized fear. Their ships emulated this, by using strong shapes and dark designs instead of sleek edges like on the Naboo fighter.It's also important to remember, when discussing the droid army, that in the Original Trilogy, that it wouldn’t make sense for either faction to use droids. The droid army terrorized the galaxy, and so whoever used them would be villainized in the public eye.The prequels, on the other hand, spend much of their time in the Galactic Core.
