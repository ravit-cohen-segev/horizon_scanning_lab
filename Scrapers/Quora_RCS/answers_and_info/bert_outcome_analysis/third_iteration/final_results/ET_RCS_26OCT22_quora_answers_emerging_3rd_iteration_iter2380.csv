Generally, there existed a technological equilibrium between the Allies and the European Axis. Sometimes the Allies had the technological advantage, sometimes the Axis, and most of the times it didn't matter as the advantage was mostly temporary and so minuscule that your “advanced technology” had little practical effect.Nevertheless, I think that many here fail to appreciate what kind scientific giant WWI and WWII Germany really was. Today English is the unchallenged lingua franca of science, but this was not always the case.Back then the dominant language was not English, but in many areas of natural science it was German. The most extreme example among these is probably chemistry. If you studied chemistry at the beginning of 20th century, then you also had to study German. Period. You could forget English, completely forget it. There was no way around it. Either you started learning German, or no chemistry at all.If we compare, for example, Germany and the USA in the number of awarded science Nobel prizes, then we can see that it took the USA 20 years, mass immigration of specialists, a lost world war for Germany, a complete breakdown of the German scientific sector, the division of the country, a gigantic German brain drain to achieve 1965 parity with Germany.Or based on more general terms, the use of language. The combined Anglosphere (USA, UK, Ireland, India, Canada, Australia) against the Germanosphere (Germany, Austria, Switzerland). We see that the shift occurred 1960 when the scientific output of the English-speaking world finally rivaled and eventually superseded the German share.","1,708 followers",Niklas Kager Kofler,688,305,8.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-Germans-in-WW2-have-such-advanced-technology

They were also prone to mechanical breakdowns, and near-impossible to salvage from the battlefield. A Tiger with a breakdown was a loss; a Panzer IV with a breakdown could be salvaged and put into the field the next morning.The British Sten submachinegun cost $11 to make a piece in 1944 value. The German Stg 44 assault rifle cost $26, and that did not include labour as they were made by slaves. The real cost would have been at least four times as much.

This is a very different matter, often tied to politics.For example British tanks were unbelievable crap for years largely because the contracts went to Morris owned factories who simply weren't competent. While they were making Churchills British Leyland developed the very competent Cromwell. Similarly the Bolton Paul Defiant: if the Germans had had it they would have added four front firing 20mm (like the Sturmovik). It was potentially a great ground attack aircraft but the British built a thousand and completely wasted them because of politics. Another example is the impact of Milch, the German Air Ministry's chief procurement officer. He was effectively an enemy agent due to his petty squabbles with the manufacturers. And of course Hitler's meddling in matters he knew nothing about is legendary.So what I am talking about is engineering. Doing stuff with what you have to hand and being effective with it at least cost to you. So while everyone here is panning the Panthers and Tigers what they are forgetting is the Sturmgeshutz III which destroyed more enemy tanks than any other (except the T34) during the conflict. The STUG III was 82,500RM or US$33,000 (at 1941 exchange rates) which is exactly the same price as a Sherman tank, but built while under bombardment . The M4 Sherman was 2.74m tall with 50mm of armour. A perfect target. The STUG III was 2.16m low also with 50mm of armour. It was perfect for ambushes but could also assist assaults.Critics are also forgetting that Germany suffered from terrible strategic shortages. They had to make fuel from coal. Aluminium was very scarce. In short Germany was about trying out new ideas to find out what might work. They made hundreds of new inventions. From remote control bombs to night vision sights to jet engines. German engineering was plundered for these ideas after the war because they were so good.But what was great about German engineering was not necessarily the hero projects like the V2 but kaizen projects developed by field engineering done at the front often under bad conditions scrambling to respond to the overwhelming tide of allied manufacturing. The German engineers improvised all over the place. The potato masher grenade could be bound into a group of six to make a very nasty detonation charge. They scavenged old tank hulls and turned them into effective tank hunters. They developed Shrage Musik which started knocking allies bombers out of the sky in frightening numbers.In short German engineering was demonstrably great because everyone copied it afterwards.Why was is great?I should point out that what I am talking about here is the German cultural underpinning of the Third Reich. The Nazi mentality and belief system in my view was a manifest liability not only to itself and its insane goals, but also to the German people.",659 followers,Tony Purtell,929,139,2.3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-Germans-in-WW2-have-such-advanced-technology

The Germans didn’t have anything like that. Also, the British were developing the PPI (Plan Position Indicator) display for use with “Chain Home Low” and had them working in 1940. This is the “modern” type of display. The RAF was also experimenting with airborne radar for night fighting and anti-submarine use in 1939, and the first centimetric radar was produced in the UK long before the Germans had any. There was a saying that they aimed for “third best” because “best” was unobtainable and “second best” would take too long.It’s also often said that German jet engines were better than British engines because they used axial flow compressors whereas Whittle used centrifugal compressors. That’s not really true either. The UK and USA had their own axial flow engines but the centrifugal ones were better understood because of their use in superchargers. This made them a better bet in the short term. The British Metrovick F-2 axial flow engine had a better power to weight ratio and relaibility than the German engines but it was nowhere near as reliable as the Whittle engines. After the war, the Soviets used German technology in their first jt engines. They had access to better materials than the Germans but they still couldn’t match the western engines.

Clarke began circulating a manuscript calledClarke was not the first science-fiction author with uncanny technological predictions — and certainly not the last. Many works of science fiction involve technological speculation that bears remarkable resemblance to the pieces of technology woven into our lives today. This brings to mind an intriguing question of the role that speculative fiction (and especially science fiction) plays in driving technology by postulating future advancements — and sparking innovation.The following list of fictional works were technologically ahead of their time and stand testament to the immense creativity of science fiction authors.1.1888: Credit Cards, Edward Bellamy’s Looking BackwardIn the book: In this futuristic utopia, a card allows people to borrow money from a central bank on credit, eliminating the need for physical money. Sound familiar?“Are credit cards issued to the women just as to the men?”“Certainly.”“The credits of the women, I suppose, are for smaller sums, owing to the frequent suspension of their labor on account of family responsibilities.”In reality: The first popular credit card was introduced by the Diner’s Club in 1950. As of 2012, over two billion active credit cards were in use around the world, accounting for $1 trillion of debt. In fact, the average American household receives six credit card offers a month.2. 1911: Video calling, Hugo Gernsback’s Ralph 124C 41+In the book: The “telephot” is a video-telephone device used by the heroine, Alice 212B423, to call for help when she’s threatened by an avalanche. In a blinding feat of technological progress, she is able to place this call to Ralph… from over 4,000 miles away.After several vain efforts to restore it Ralph was about to give up in disgust and leave the Telephot when the instrument began to glow again. But instead of the face of his friend there appeared that of a vivacious beautiful girl. She was in evening dress and behind her on a table stood a lighted lamp.Startled at the face of an utter stranger, an unconscious Oh! escaped her lips, to which Ralph quickly replied:“I beg your pardon, but ‘Central’ seems to have made another mistake. I shall certainly have to make a com­plaint about the service.”In reality:3. 1931: Mood-Enhancing Pills, Aldous Huxley’s Brave New WorldIn the book: “Soma” is a hallucinogen distributed by the government, en masse, to control the population. Citizens are conditioned to love the “calming” effects of the drug, using it constantly to avoid feelings of discontent.“A gramme is better than a damn,” said Lenina mechanically from behind her hands. “I wish I had my soma!”In reality:4. 1939: Surveillance, George Orwell’s 1984In the book: The dystopian concept of Big Brother originated withIn reality:4. 1968: Tablets Arthur C. Clarke’s 2001: A Space OdysseyIn the book: Described as a “foolscap sized Newspad,” astronauts use tablet computers while conducting spaceships diagnostic checks, or when they need a line of communication to Earth.“Floyd sometimes wondered if the Newspad, and the fantastic technology behind it, was the last word in man’s quest for perfect communications. Here he was, far out in space, speeding away from Earth at thousands of miles an hour, yet in a few milliseconds he could see the headlines of any newspaper he pleased.”In reality:What’s more: NASA pilots can sometimes carry bags with over 40 pounds of hard-copy aviation documents. This has caused many NASA pilots to start a “tablet computer revolution in aviation.”5. 1969: Electric Cars, John Brunner’s Stand On ZanzibarIn the book: Brunner’s depiction of America in the year 2010 includes motor vehicles that are powered by rechargeable electric fuel cells.It’s supposed to be automatic, but actually you have to push this button.In reality:6.In the book: Pilot Steve Austin crashes in flight and loses his legs, left arm, and an eye. His legs and left arm are replaced by a team of doctors with bionic limbs — leaving him a “cyborg” (part man and part machine).To make everything clear, I don’t much give a shit for your operation. I’m willing to go as part of the great experiment. I just want you to understand that I don’t owe you a thing.In reality:Today, researchers are building man-made organs that contain living human cells. Advancements in bionic livers, kidneys, lungs, and hearts are poised to end live-organ transplants — a development which would likely come as a relief to the 121,000 Americans currently on a waiting list.7. 1984: The World Wide Web, William Gibson’s NeuromancerIn the book:A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding…In reality:To get into the ways that the internet and cyber-crimes affect our society today would require an article in itself. For now, you can take a peek at this (frightening) Internet Live Stats website for scale.What’s next?— In 2004, Geoff Ryman’s— Equally as forward-thinking, Ernest Cline’sAnd after that?Well, if we’re lucky, the events of H.G.

Consider the following. The base version of the F-16 costs an estimated 30 million dollars. Fully upgraded it can easily cost twice that. For this amount of money you want to get as much usage out of the machine as possible.Furthermore, there’s really not much you can do to improve on the design. The human body can only handle so many G forces before it dies. The F-16 is every bit as effective a weapon now as it was when it was first created, and barring a major paradigm shift in air combat, it will remain effective for the foreseeable future.Compare this to a Commodore personal computer from roughly the same time period. This machine is hopelessly outdated. It would have a hard time running a modern word processor, let alone anything I’d actually want to use a computer for. But the machine was only a couple hundred dollars, which is what it would cost me today to get one about a million times more powerful.To be more precise, if we look at transistor count, a computer from 1974 has roughly 10 million times fewer transistors than a computer made last year. Let that sink in.And the people who manufactured both devices knew this. Military engineers knew they were making big, expensive products that were going to be in service for decades, and which wouldn’t really need to be improved upon until there was another major war. And at that point there’s no telling what improvements would be required.Consumer products engineers knew they were making small, cheap, disposable products that the customer would probably throw away in under a decade, because by then an improved version would appear. They could make the device sturdier, but that would increase the cost to the consumer for a device they were going to throw away anyway.If a Commodore microcomputer was indestructible, you’d still have thrown it away by now because you don’t need it anymore. So why bother?Although, with careful use and regular maintenance, even old consumer products can last for decades.
