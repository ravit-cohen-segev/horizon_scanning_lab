0,"People have clearly missed the concept of this question. For example Roman concrete is superior than modern concrete because of its make-up. Concrete structures built by Romans still stand today, while modern concrete structures can barely make their first century. Because of the volcanic material used, Roman concrete becomes stronger with age.People have clearly missed the concept of this question.

2,"Yes. That started with the discovery of fire and the technology of cooking. Cooking releases more nutrients from food, enabling larger, more nutrient-hungry brains. Agriculture, one of the largest technological innovations in human history, accelerated that trend.Technology has shaped our evolution since the beginning.","220,632 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,783M,2020,https://www.quora.com/As-we-learn-more-about-the-technologies-of-Ancient-Rome-and-Greece-do-you-feel-that-mankind-has-evolved-or-devolved-in-our-abilities

4,"We’re continuing to evolve physically. For instance, some people are more resistant to this novel coronavirus than others, either due to their physical makeup or tendency towards healthy lifestyle choices. This outbreak will tend to weigh the surviving population towards those who have genetically better resistance for one reason or another. That is how evolution works.I’m not trying to be cold towards those suffering. I believe I may have the virus myself, and have an 87 year old father to worry about. I am anxious and upset. I nevertheless felt this was an effective illustration of one of thWe’re continuing to evolve physically.

6,"When information technology evolves quickly, how do IT education providers constantly keep their curriculum relevant?They don’t need to. Not just new frameworks, even new languages are usually not that new. Few of the big subjects change, and humans don’t really change, at least since the Romans we didn’t really change.Data structures remain the same. We use the same C language for microcontrollers we used … C is older than me, but at least I’m older than Java. Design patterns, language features… all the same.
