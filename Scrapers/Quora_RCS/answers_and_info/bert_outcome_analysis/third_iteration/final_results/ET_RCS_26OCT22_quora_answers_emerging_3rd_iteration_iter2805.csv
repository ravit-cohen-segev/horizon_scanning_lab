4,"It’s not about technology (well, it is - but not much) - it’s about ECONOMICS.A colony out in space will probably NEVER be 100% self-sufficient (defined here as:If it needs periodic shipments of spare parts, advanced electronics, food, fertilizers, space suits, rovers…anything of that nature - then it has to make some kind of a product that it can sell to the people of Earth to compensate for the cost of running the colony.The cost of shipping to and from the colony from Earth makes finding such a product EXCEEDINGLY difficult. If therIt’s not about technology (well, it is - but not much) - it’s about ECONOMICS.A colony out in space will probably NEVER be 100% self-sufficient (defined here as:If it needs periodic shipments of spare parts, advanced electronics, food, fertilizers, space suits, rovers…anything of that nature - then it has to make some kind of a product that it can sell to the people of Earth to compensate for the cost of running the colony.The cost of shipping to and from the colony from Earth makes finding such a product EXCEEDINGLY difficult. If there were pure gold bars just laying around on the surface of the planet - the cost of shipping them to Earth would not make that an economically viable product.The best kinds of products for a colony are the ones that don’t need shipping anywhere…KNOWLEDGE.EXAMPLES OF COLONIES HERE ON EARTH:The Amundson/Scott Antarctic Research Station:There are about 4,000 people living and working at the South Pole.They need shipments of just about everything except air and water. They produce ZERO physical goods - and yet there are frequent flights of aircraft full of supplies.That colony survives by producing knowledge of various kinds that the people of the rest of the planet are OK with paying for…climate research, the neutrino observatory, etc.The International Space Station (ISS):A MUCH smaller micro-colony - of 6 to about 15 people. They produce knowledge - things like how the human body responds to zero gravity and what you can do about it.That can work for a limited amount of time - and for a SMALL colony - but eventually, the amount of knowledge you can produce will taper off (as has happened with the ISS) and demands to save money and stop supporting it will grow (as indeed they are)…so this alone won’t keep the colony alive indefinitely.The “Pilgrim Fathers” in the USA:When the first European colonies started up in the USA, they had plenty of ways to become self-sufficient. Local food, water, air - no problem. Construction materials were wood, straw, mud - no problem.They DID (initially) need metal products - guns, nails, hatchets, knives, cooking pots - but they had valuable goods that they could send back to pay for those things - lumber, furs, tobacco, cotton…so there was an economic balance that made it all work until they could become self-sufficient.The cost of shipping was fairly high - but not impossibly so.Pretty soon they were able to build iron mines/refineries - and over 100 to 200 years - gradually become completely self-supporting.So what about Mars?It’s not like the pilgrim fathers - where the basic necessities are easy to get.Just stepping outside of your “house” - you need a very high-tech spacesuit.Then consider just the visor on your spacesuit - made from acrylic plastic - which here on earth is made from fossil fuels - which you don’t have on Mars - so you need a plastics factory - which has to be fed by plants that make all manner of specialist chemicals.In some places (Mars - perhaps) there is the prospect of EVENTUALLY becoming self-sufficient - but to be able to make EVERYTHING you need - right down to the screws that hold the visor onto your spacesuit. Everything has to be made locally…to make a screw, you need iron, molybdenum, chromium, carbon - which has to be found by geologists, mined and refined.The steel works is a MASSIVE facility requiring a monumental amount of energy - then you need a screw factory.Just looking at the sheer number of mines, refineries, factories…it’s CRAZY.Most of those facilities will be impossible to build without screws…but you don’t have a screw factory yet. These factories will need electronics that you don’t have manufacturing capability for…The insane complexity and interlocking dependencies implied by becoming self-sustaining are overwhelming.And for all of that time until you reach that goal - you’re somehow going to need to compensate the people of Earth for supporting you.CONCLUSION:This is all about economics…and it’s *far* from easy.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-we-need-more-advance-technology-for-space

Maybe he and Wong were just watchingVision, however, is most likely using Stark technology. Maybe “turned off his transponder” meant going into Stark’s stealth mode, which Nat revealed (inRhodes tells Ross that satellites lost Vision over Edinburgh. It doesn’t seem like Rhodes knew how to contact Steve to tell him, so it may not factor it to the answer. However, Bruce is at the facility with Rhodes. Since Bruce is a genius, he may have deduced a way of tracking Vision and telling Cap.The flying donut that Glaive and Proxima must have parked over Edinburgh would have been a huge indicator of trouble, and must have caught Steve’s eye. It seems as though his team was already in the quinjet, probably trying to find Wanda, or maybe following a tip from Rhodes (and Bruce). Since Wanda would have been carrying one of Steve’s communication devices, she may have turned hers off later than Vision, thus leading Steve and the others closer to Scotland. Or, she may have mentioned she wanted to go there; we don’t know, unfortunately.The only tech Steve is really good at are those earpieces. Since he’s a combat veteran, he knows it’s imperative that he has an open comm link to his team. All of them are in imminent danger of being arrested. Nat says “I thought we had a deal, stay close and check in,” and Wanda said she made “promises,” too. To me, that means she strayed away from a group that agreed to help protect her. This would have most likely had Steve, Sam, and Nat in the quinjet already looking for her before the crisis. They’ve learned Wanda shouldn’t be running around loose.There are only two reasons Wanda and Vision would have deliberately “gone dark”- they were “stealing some moments” or they were in trouble. Both were true. Good thing Steve didn’t bust into their hotel room.Still, it was a clunky way to handle this plot point, but it bought them Cap’s grand entrance.",1 follower,Abigail Martínez,3.5K,118,3.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Tony-Stark-has-some-of-the-most-advanced-technology-in-the-world-and-Captain-America-doesnt-really-use-technology-Why-in-Infinity-War-did-Tony-say-Cap-would-be-the-best-person-to-find-Vision

There was little glaciation and little of the subsequent erosion and deposition that created river plains such as the Tigris-Euphrates or Nile, or the plants that swarmed as weeds across the ground laid bare by receding ice sheets. The weeds that grew so well in ground disturbed by ploughing and became the cereal crops of the Western Hemisphere.It is unwise to compare what you know of technologies without knowledge of the circumstances it is devised to cope with and the materials available to achieve those ends.Sedentary agriculture and cities were not a meaningful response to Australian conditions at least until foreign crops and domesticated animals were introduced.
