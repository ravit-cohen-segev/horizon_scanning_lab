The automated cab driver greets you cheerfully as you step inside and scans your hand before automatically deducting a fee from your account. Because everything is connected, the cab can tell exactly how long you will travel and has charged accordingly.The automated cab driver says that he’s noticed that you’re hungry. You nod, still tired from work. The automated driver quickly recommends a restaurant nearby and you accept. You’ve never been to this restaurant before but the automated driver knows everything about you and has guessed a restaurant that you’ll love.The automated driver drops you off at the restaurant, calculates the time it will take you to eat, then goes off to pick up more people, ordering for another self-driving cab to pick you up once you’re finished.A while later you come back outside, happy that the food was so good. A cab is waiting for you and you step inside before being driven home.From there, you watch a VR movie and interact with a couple of the characters before taking a pill and going straight to sleep. Your day is over.…That was my approximation of a day in the future. What does all the technology in the above scenerio have in common?Algorithms.Specifically, computer code written to maximize efficiency. You might think that self-driving cars will be the biggest thing in coming years but what you might not expect is the programmer who makes billions off the software for the automated cab driver that recommends restaurants. Good for the customer, good for the restaurant, good for the self-driving cab.Your life is being increasingly dictated by algorithms designed to maximize efficiency. The ticket price when you step on a plane was decided by a computer. So was the price of a train ticket, or shelf item at a store.AI is going to be big, but what will be big earlier will be the algorithms that power the world and maximize efficiency. It isn’t a huge revolution, just a quiet growing efficiency in everything we do.",UNKNOWN,Bessie J.

3,"Transfer learning in ML models.Humans are really good at generalizing. We only have to see a few dogs before we can recognize a dog when we see one.Machines are not. ML models require millions of examples before forming a reliable classifier, and that classifier is very specific to the data on which it was trained. If your training data doesn't include dogs with three legs, the model won't recognize them.

It's hypothesized that the reason humans learn so quickly is that we are fitting new examples into our existing knowledge rather than forming entirely new categories. If we could teach machines to do the same, they would learn exponentially faster and apply that learning more effectively.Transfer learning is a very hot topic in AI research right now, so I expect major breakthroughs in the next few years. I think this may be sufficient to achieve artificial general intelligence, but even if not, it will dramatically extend the range of tasks that machines can accomplish.",17 followers,Fabius Fairchild,1.8K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-technology-that-the-world-is-waiting-for-in-the-next-10-15-years
4,"The Energy RevolutionI think a so-called Energy Revolution would be the next big paradigm shift.  If a day comes when we learn to tap into energy effortlessly, wirelessly, and without monetary charge, it will open up the minds of human beings in a whole new way; to not be dependent on expensive, expendable energy sources and energy cables would truly separate us from our caveman past.  Imagine a world where free wireless power reaches the remote mountains of Afghanistan and the remote plains of Montana and the farthest reaches of Antarctica.Obviously, this seems like a pipe dream.

If a day comes when we learn to tap into energy effortlessly, wirelessly, and without monetary charge, it will open up the minds of human beings in a whole new way; to not be dependent on expensive, expendable energy sources and energy cables would truly separate us from our caveman past.  Imagine a world where free wireless power reaches the remote mountains of Afghanistan and the remote plains of Montana and the farthest reaches of Antarctica.Obviously, this seems like a pipe dream.  But there are several innovators who thought along these lines.  The prime thinker on the topic of global wireless energy generation and transmission was Nikola Tesla.  He wanted to get rid of power cables and use the earth itself (the static electrical charges between the earth and the ionosphere) to create a worldwide wireless energy field that could power -- wirelessly -- everything in its range.  He wanted to set up a series of transmission towers that would broadcast not only power but radio communications as well:[Please, gutter-minds, don't snicker][Please, gutter-minds, don't snicker]A modern-day equivalent would broadcast wireless power as well as the Internet (which I believe will consume radio and telecom in general in the near future).Unfortunately, while many have tried to replicate and recreate Tesla's work, none have yet succeeded -- leading many to deem Tesla mad or just plain deceitful in his claims of success.  Others claim conspiracy:  the U.S. government stole and hid away Tesla's technologies.  And his ideashttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardenclyffe_TowerIf it's possible to tap into the energy of the planet itself -- rather than its tiny byproducts like oil and coal -- then isn't that the smartest way to go?  Since the planet is constantly spinning and producing electromagnetic radiation, it seems like a no-brainer (Lots of what-ifs, I know.  But what if we reach a point where our current sources of energy just aren't enough; where our consumption outweighs production?  Then what...?Keeping up with the KardashevsSomething to think about is to so-called Kardashev scale, a science fiction-esque concept measuring the state of advancement of a civilization.  In essence:  a Type I civilization is one like ours that has mastered the process of harnessing potential energy from our own planet; a Type II civilization is one that can harness all the potential energy of their local star; and a Type III civilization is one that can harness all the potential energy of their galaxy.While these are clearly hypothetical concepts (like a potential Type IV civilization that harnesses all the power of the universe -- becoming, essentially, God), the idea of harnessing such vast amounts of energy requires some sort of Energy Revolution.  And science fiction concepts like the Kardashev scale often drive real science.  HumansWhich is why technology is advancing at such a rapid rate, often in the areas of energy efficiency and consumption.  For example, Apple uses super energy-efficient processors in their iPads, which makes the battery last longer and which, in turn, helped turn tablet computers from an afterthought into the new hot thing.  This, in turn, increased demand for super energy-efficient processors, leading to further breakthroughs in energy efficiency.And given the faster and faster rates at which human beings consume energy -- especially with the smartphones and tablets in everyone's hands -- we are clearly heading in the direction ofWe","51,709 followers",Chris Ebbert,906,11.4K,278.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-technology-that-the-world-is-waiting-for-in-the-next-10-15-years

Something like 33% of people get headaches from the glasses, the screen itself, or both. The next ‘big things’ in display technology must be useful to a much larger demographic- on the order of 95% or so.4k is the most recognized new standard, but it isn't the newest, nor does it meet that larger demographic requirement.

Fact is, some people can't see the difference in a program in native 1080p and 4k(2160p). It's about to become a moot point as the cost to manufacture 4k displays has dropped nearly to the point of manufacturing 1080p display. Soon, it'll be cheaper to only manufacture 4k screens and do away with the vast majority of 1080p models*.*We may see 1080p displays among the smaller sizes (I'd guess 32″ and down) as that level of detail isn't perceptible to most folks.So, what's next? There exists a small bit of content in 8k- so long as you have a set like the 88″ OLED TV that LG debuted at CES earlier this year. It's only $20,000- what a deal!Doubling down on the number of pixels every few years isn't it. What if we could make the picture better in another way?This is where HDR comes in. HDR- or high dynamic range- is the difference between the darkest black and the brightest white-basically meaning better colors. Ever notice how a red sports car doesn't *pop* on TV like it does in person? A display without HDR isn't capable of rendering some of those hues and shades. Today, there are 2 major standards in HD-Dolby Vision and HDR-10. Dolby Vision is objectively better, but to use it, manufacturers must pay Dolby royalties. HDR-10 is an open standard- meaning anyone can use it.To me, displays are sharp enough for now. The only reason to get more pixels is for a truly gigantic picture. 100 inches and up, 8k starts to make a lot more sense. Today, HDR is taking immersion to whole new levels, and what's better is that unlike pixels, HDR can be updated with software- you don't have to upgrade yet again.The next thing will likely be 360 degree video- what is erroneously called virtual reality today. But that's another answer.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-technology-that-the-world-is-waiting-for-in-the-next-10-15-years

With current VR games, you move around with a controller, just like with traditional video games. They need to make VR fully immersive.
