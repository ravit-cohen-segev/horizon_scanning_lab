2,"No it isn’t. Much of it is WAY behind the civilian equivalent, especially electronics.That’s because the military is more interested in survivability and reliability than performance and civilian engineering companies have no interest in things like stealth technology so they aren’t going to bother researching it.Most NATO Aircraft still communicate using Link-16 which has performance down in the analog modem range (4G ?? Hahahahaha!). The F-22 Raptor is possibly the most advanced plane in use and it manages (drumroll) “FireWire”!The list goes on (endlessly). There are odd bits of advanced stuNo it isn’t.

Plus the infrastructure that is needed to support communications, the ability to maintain the equipment, and the people to deploy, and use the gear.","68,791 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Does-the-army-have-more-advanced-technology-than-civilians

9,"No. It says something about us. We regard as complex something we have that our parents didn't, and simple as what they did. I am sure that our children will have more complex things and regard what we have now as simple.All of which says nothing about what we ""should"" do. We can choose what we want. Generally, people have a limited ability to absorb new complexity. So each generation can advance a few steps further than its predecessor without suffering discomfort.

11,"The lack of technological distractions was a blessing. To truly contact God you must free yourself from all worldly distractions, free yourself from yourself and control your thoughts. And you must strengthen your faith. You must become purified . It is then that you can start to truly communicate with the One true God. Through your pineal, Ajna or your spirit eye.

13,"Alibaba is a shopping platform. This means that it is simply a marketplace for manufacturers in China. Alibaba is also only for whole sale or bulk purchases. This means that there is a minimum amount of items you can purchase. (you mostly cant buy one piece or item at a time.)Let me give you a little bit of advice if you are looking to purchase on Alibaba. Remember that you are buying wholesale products here, this means that you are going to spend a lot of cash since you can’t buy one item at a time. So you have to make sure that the product you are going to buy is from a good supplier and legAlibaba is a shopping platform. This means that it is simply a marketplace for manufacturers in China. Alibaba is also only for whole sale or bulk purchases. This means that there is a minimum amount of items you can purchase. (you mostly cant buy one piece or item at a time.)Let me give you a little bit of advice if you are looking to purchase on Alibaba. Remember that you are buying wholesale products here, this means that you are going to spend a lot of cash since you can’t buy one item at a time. So you have to make sure that the product you are going to buy is from a good supplier and legit supplier. Now, you are asking, how do i do that? simple, you employ a drop shipping agent to order, check, and ship the product for you. I happen to be an affiliate of a drop shipping agent for Alibaba and I would like to help you out specially if you are considering purchasing from Alibaba.One of the most reliable drop shipping agent is Alibaba Agent. What we in Alibaba Agent do is make sure that your money investments in buying bulk products will not go to waste by offering you numerous services, but I will only mention two for the sake of making this conversation short.1.) Product Quality Audit - When buying bulk or whole sale items you must always be cautious with the product you are buying. Remember that you are not only buying a single piece but you are buying numerous pieces and if all of them are defective or are of very low and poor quality, your money may just go down the drain. Alibaba Agent will help you by making sure that your product is in good quality. We have a dedicated team that is responsible for checking the product you ordered if it is of decent or good quality. We also check every corner of your product to make sure that there are no hidden defects. And lastly we also check the size, color, and model of the items you bough to make sure that they are the same as what you ordered.2.) Factory audit - Aside from the product itself you must also be cautious as to how the products you ordered were made. Are all the items you bought consistently of good quality? Alibaba Agent also offers you Factory Audits to suppliers that you purchase from. We check if the Items you bought were manufactured in a decent and legit factory. Once again, since you are purchasing on bulk or whole sale you truly must make sure that the product you bought are made in a legit and decent factory.Purchasing on Alibaba is a little risky because they offer items at very low cost. But again there is always some risks associated when buying fairly cheap items. Since you are buying bulk you really must make sure that the products you bought are good because you are paying a lot of money. That is why Alibaba Agent offers you an alternative of taking away those risks for you. We check the items and we check the factory. Hopefully this will make you sleep better at night and won’t be too scared of buying from Alibaba.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Does-the-army-have-more-advanced-technology-than-civilians
