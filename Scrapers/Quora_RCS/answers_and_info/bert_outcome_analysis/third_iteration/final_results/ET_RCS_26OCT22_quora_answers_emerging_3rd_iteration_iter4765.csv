Lightly constructed and armed, it could not withstand frontal attacks nor could it out-dive Allied fighters such as the P-40; if it attempted to, it often came apart in the air.

Except for the few that thought that the Luftwaffe and George Soros were behind it.Claire Chenault and the AVG, American Volunteer Group or Flying Tigers, did not get into combat with P-40‚Äôs until after the war began.Chenault was in 1941 however warning that the fighters that the IJA and IJN were putting up over China were not crap and had to be taken quite seriously. The Chinese were at that time flying Soviet I-16‚Äôs and all of the Japanese fighters introduce in 1941 completely dominated the I-16 in 1941. The I-16 was the first monoplane fighter in the world and dated to 33 so it was several years older than the Brewster Buffalo, Grumman Wildcat and P-36 but on paper came close enough that the Japanese total dominance clearly showed that the Japanese were seriously better, at least as they were being flown, than those American planes which were only somewhat better on paper than the I-16‚Äôs..But the perception of Japanese aviation remained that the Jap planes had to be crap and that the new Japanese fighter, the Zero, which had barely been seen was only a copy of the P-36 and the only way the Japanese could level the field was with German pilots and German planes..The Zero appeared in China only in the fall of 1941 escorting bombers for the 500 mile each way to Nanking. The Chinese Air Force (an under appreciated story the Chinese Air Force was at war for nearly 10 years and then there was the Revolution so the RAF‚ÄùS ‚ÄúFor the Duration‚Äù was less than Chinese flyers did by years -or at least the very few that survived) was already beaten down. They did not come up against the few Zero escorted raids because the Zero‚Äôs simply flew 500 miles out and then destroyed any I-16 that dared to contest and then flew 500 miles back to base. An incredible achievement.. Thus the fact that the Zero was even better than the similar shaped Imperial Japanese Army fighters was not apparent. What was apparent was the incredible range that the new plane had.December 7th a bunch of near sighted pilots flying crap copies of out dated American planes , or at least that is what many AMericans werre saying on 12/6/61, destroyed the American fleet. A day later twin engined bombers successfully fly a strike mission against the Philippines that Americans thought could only be flown by 4 engined B-17‚Äôs. The next day Singapore suffers the same embarrassment. 2 days later the longest ranged torpedo strike ever takes down another unsinkable battleship (I think that this Saigon to Gulf of Thailand attack on the Prince of Wales remains the longest ever - even the Avenger with its long for an American legs and multiple strikes did not fly as far).IIn the next few weeks the only aerial combat was over Malaysia where the Japanese Army flew in planes to fly from Thailand and Kota Baru captured from the British. These planes are correctly explained in other answers as not good as a the Zero. But they were more than good enough to take on the second line British aviation in Malaya. Since the 2 Zero‚Äôs that had crashed in Hawaii were the only planes that Americans were familiar with and every radial engine fighter looks the same everything was called a Zero. (The fact that the Zero was radial and that the Germans did not do radial fighters in 41 meant that the Germans were behind it did not hold water anymore even to the most gullible Americans of the time .)Why did the flying Tigers do well against Japanese fighters?Primarily because they chose the right times to fight. They chose to fight when they had an altitude advantage and even better surprise. They chose to not fight if they did not have an advantage. The P-40 had a substantial speed advantage over the IJ Army fighters they engaged. Again the AVG did not fight Zero‚Äôs. After the American War started the IJ Navy withdrew all their planes from China proper. But any Jap fighter was a Zero in the minds of the American public but not necessarily reality.The turning point in the Pacific war was the meat, aluminum and steel grinder that was Guadalcanal. The American/Japanese version of Kursk. Ships sailing a thousnd miles to get immolated in a few minutes, japanese palnes flying nearly a thousand miles from Rabaul through ever present thunderstorms to do battle with planes from Henserson field, reinforcement and supply shiops dashing in and out, the Americans by day when the Cactus Airforfece could shield them and the Japanese by night. Gradually the air war there over Henderson Field (code named Cactus therefor the Cactus Air Force) went from numerically in the Japanese favor but with loses the Americans could replace and the Japanese could not,, to regular American victories. American radar improving and coast watch in the Upper Solomons gave the Cactus Air Force time to get in position. The terrible weather in the Solomons and 600 miles that the Japanese had to fly from their base at Rabaul regularly took as much of a toll as combat. The Americans (that includes the minority but notable ANZACS in the fight) could build up numbers. The Japanese got weaker. So the fights became more Allies than Axis.The Zero was better than the fighters that it entered the war against, the Naval Wildcat and the P-40. Definitely better than the Hurricane. It had a impressive record against the few Spitfires that met it in the defense of Darwin , Australia. As people figured out how to counter the Zero‚Äôs advantages it became possible to fight it on more even terms but probably never on truely even terms in anAnd a great deal of the reputation of Japanese combat aviation in 1941 and 1942 comes from the real skill of the veteran cadre of pilots that was eroded as the war went on.end of part 1The following is my first attempt which I have not erased.The Flying Tigers were flying against the IJArmy aviation arm and therefor not the A6M-2 Mitusbishi called the Zero which was an IJN (Imperial Japanese Navy) plane. The Flying Tigers were contesting the skies against theWhen WWII started the Japanese were regarded as not possibly capable of smashing Pearl Harbor. The British sent their Malaya Army on the offensive into Thailand, even though in 2 world wars dashing on the offensive into Belgium got them a heap of trouble. Of course that was against the Germans; surely we can whip the wogs. The Japanese were tremendously underestimated and yes it was stupid racial prejudice.The Oscar, the Nakajima Ki-43, had cleared the skies over China of Chinese planes which had been primarily SovietThe Flying Tigers, who recived P-40 A‚Äôs in 1942, for a number of reason fought boom and zoom; attack at speed and do not stick around for a low speed dog fight. This turns out to be exactly the best strategy for fighting against either the Oscar or the Zero. It‚Äôs a very good strategy in general and the for the best documented running combat between Zero and WildCat, the extended fight between Lt. Cdr Thatch‚Äôs wing and Zeros at Midway, it is exactly what the Zero‚Äôs used on Thatch. The Japanese used it against the Americans! Thatch survived with good team defense and probably because the Zero‚Äôs had used up the limited 20 mm ammo on torpedo planes first and were shooting 30 caliber or had trouble get the lower velocity 20 mm on target. The Wildcats were riddled with 30 caliber holes and the brand new (and somewhat hated self sealing tanks*) worked against rifle bullets preventing the Wildcats going down in flames.The US first saw the Zero December 7th ,1941. They caused a serious and well deserved fright. Several crashed at Pearl Harbor. Immediately every Japanese fighter was called a Zero and that continues to this day. (every tank a Tiger)The Flying Tigers tried only to accept combat when they had an advantage or at least equal altitude. With the early P-40 armament of 2 50 cals and 2 30 cals they had a huge advantage over an Oscar which had only 2 30 caliber guns.In the first months of the war against the Imperial Japanese Navy Zeros the US Navy F4Fs fought with 4 50 cals and a modest advantage in armor plate protecting the pilot and the same unprotected fuel tanks as a Zero. The Zero was faster and could climb much faster and had more punch in its guns. Until the Hellcat arrived the best that could b planned on was an equal face to faceInstead of the Flying Tiger books, a much better and more reliable account of the P-40 vs Japanese fighters and especially the Zero, as the Flying Tigers did not combat Zeros, is the battle over New Guinea fought by as many Australian and Kiwi pilots as American in several different type fighters.Zeros probably had a significant advantage against P-40‚Äôs, P-39‚Äôs and Spitfires in an individual combat but the allied fighters and pilots scored heavily against Japanese bombers and won the battle.Aerial combat was short and deadly. From Lundstrom‚Äôs book which covers the US Navy F4F fighter squadrons, many combats went like this, ‚ÄúI came out of a cloud and there was a Zero and I blasted it‚Äù. The reciprocal story would be ‚ÄúEnsign Brown took off and did not return.‚Äù. That is the epitaph for one of the best fighter pilots of the era,*The F4F-3‚Äôs with self sealing tanks arrived 2 weeks before Midway; Thatch had little time to familiarize with them and the additional 200# which made an already slowish plane a dog.",UNKNOWN,Guy D.

However being hit by a burst from a Zero‚Äôs cannon and machine gun mix was more often fatal than being hit by an Oscar‚Äôs 3 machine guns and that makes a big difference. Especially against a strongly built aircraft like a P-40. The Oscar never got cannons as the Japanese could not fit them into its small frame.However the basic premise is correct that the US pilots were ordered to perform boom and zoom tactics by Chennault (diving from higher altitude and then zooming back up) and this was the best by far tactic against a superior turning fighter. The P-40 had an outright top speed advantage over the Zero and Oscar and so providing the pilot was not duped into a turning battle they could avoid combat in slow turning fights.Young aggressive pilots were slow to learn that their attitude could not overcome the comparative turn rates once they got into a turning fight. What is also under reported was the acceleration of the Japanese pair of fighters. The early war US and British machines (except for the P-38 which was simply in another league) were much slower to accelerate and climb.Once you were at the same altitude and speed and in shooting range of the Zero and Oscar you were committed to a fight. You would find it hard to break away. If you tried to break away you were going to get shot up. Yes the P-40 could dive faster and had a higher top speed but the Japanese aircraft‚Äôs acceleration meant you were not going to escape without a burst in the tail because you accelerated more slowly.The US Army taught Boom and Zoom tactic as well. However this required the pilot to have the discipline to walk away from a fight if they did not have a starting altitude advantage and this was something many young pilots of every nation simply would not do. Young fighter pilots are aggressive competitive creatures. Those that got lucky learned. The others died.Chennault would ground them if they got into and survived a turning fight and they did not get paid while on the ground. So they had no choice if they wanted to fight for Chennault they did it his way. The US Army was not so tough in this way at least at first.I believe that also the Chinese were often able to give the Tigers early warning of Japanese aircraft movements. This allowed them to climb to altitude and be in position to dive on the Japanese aircraft. In The early stages of the Pacific campaign the US did not have the luxury of early warnings and the US aircraft were often climbing up to meet Japanese high attacks. You start with an altitude deficit and that severely limits your ability to dive on them until later in the battle, if they let you. .",19 followers,Paul Adam,851,4.2K,44.7M,2022,https://www.quora.com/If-the-Flying-Tigers-had-such-a-good-record-against-the-Japanese-why-was-the-Zero-so-highly-regarded-when-the-US-entered-WWII
15,"The Zero (and other Japanese fighters) could turn and climb faster than American planes. American planes could dive faster, being heavier.

There were basically two reasons for this:1 - The Zero was flown by the IJN (Imperial Japanese Navy), and IJN pilots at that time had enormous amounts of experience and as a result were very good indeed. US naval pilots weren‚Äôt outstandingly bad, but in general they simply were not nearly as experienced as the Japanese. And experience counts a lot in fighter combat.2- The US pilots who flew against the Zeros had no idea how they ought to do it,, and as a result their tactics were very bad and played directly into the hands of the IJN pilots. And paid the price.The Zero was entirely designed around the need for long range and high maneuverability. This meant that the aircraft was light and supremely agile at low speeds. At high speeds it was not nearly as maneuverable since there was no hydraulic assist for the flight controls.At first, US aviators tried to meet the Zero on its own terms, and trying to do that cost a lot of planes and lives. In fairly short order it was learned that the way to fight a Zero was to maintain high speed and never, ever try to outmaneuver a Zero at low speed.As the war progressed, the US developed more agile aircraft, and the IJN lost most of their experienced pilots when their carriers were sunk, and the Japanese training establishment was unable to provide well-trained replacements.

17,"The question poses an erroneous premise.The US knew almost nothing about the Type Zero naval fighter in 1941. Jane‚Äôs annual aircraft of the world only referred to a single-engine retractable-gear fighter probably from Mitsubishi.Furthermore, contrary to legend, the AVG never fought Zeros, which had been withdrawn from China after the pre-production batch finished its combat evaluation.
