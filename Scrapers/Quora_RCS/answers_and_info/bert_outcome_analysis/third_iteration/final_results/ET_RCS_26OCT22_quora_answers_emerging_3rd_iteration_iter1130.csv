Pokemon Go changed a huge number of people’s lives significantly…it wasn’t even a new thing, just a funner version of existing software that let people collect location tags with their smart phones.The next really big thing isn’t a technology advance at all, it’s the global economic collapse. And it’s already happening. How bad it gets can’t be predicted very well, but it is going to result in major alterations in the current geopolitical paradigm and probably very long term changes in global commerce. National governments after this crisis will probably be far more economically protectionist because of the numerous ways in which economic interdependence will drastically affect everyone.It will take decades to redevelop and explore economically viable applications of technology that already exists now.Still, I’m going to go out on a limb and say that safe, economic extraction of methane hydrate from the ocean floor is going to play a major role in revitalizing the world’s major economies. Structural instability in the global oil trade has been a major driver of the current collapse, a lot of nations are going to need or simply prefer something else, and other ‘renewables’ don’t offer the same kind of energy as geologic hydrocarbon fuels. But maybe that’s not the kind of “big change” this question is looking at.I guess the “big change” would be adoption of high-density agricultural techniques that could allow urban areas to be independent in food production, possibly incorporating water treatment techniques that would allow cities to recycle pretty much all the biological waste of their population. But I don’t even know that is likely to be pursued, or at least not at urban densities.","135,532 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/When-and-what-is-the-next-big-human-technology-advancement

Yes, we convert Energy into Power by ”boiling the water,“ which has a low energy conversion rate. Today's principle of nuclear fission reactor power generation is not fundamentally different from steam engines hundreds of years ago! Regardless of the current thermal power or nuclear power, it is heating water: heat converts water into steam, and the steam drives the turbine to generate electricity. (Note: The conversion rate of nuclear fission we use today is only 0.135%)It is most likely that human beings will not be able to ""go out"" the solar system, and even be ""trapped"" to die on earth!The nuclear fusion conversion rate is 0.7%. If nuclear fusion power generation is realized, it may alleviate the current energy crisis. It is not enough for interstellar flight. (Note: As science fiction says that ""Positive and Anti-Matter Annihilation"" is the most efficient, can achieve 100% quality conversion, can help us fly out of the solar system. )Realistically, if we fail to master the controllable nuclear fusion before depleting fossil energy, it is not only ""Civilization Retrogression,"" but the entire human sci and tech civilization will be ""locked out"" until we die. Because in those days we will be unable to ""organize higher-scale industrialization"" and not be able to further test our scientific theory.Human beings are powerless and insignificant. Think of Traveler 1, the man-made object farthest from the Earth, and the fastest man-made object. It takes 40,000 years to fly to the AC+79 3888 star of Ophiuchus. It takes 73,600 to fly to Proxima Centauri of Centaur. The interstellar voyage for it is just a simple fantastic lies. How negligible us? Please be humble~As for interstellar travel, if the person who does not wear the spacesuit leaves the surface layer, just like ""The deep sea fish leave the deep sea will detonate himself"", yes, in any other environment, the human body will be vulnerable to ""cannot withstand even a single blow"". Hey, we humans are the creatures born in the surface environment. We are destined to be inseparable from such environment, and it is even more difficult to cross the ""space measured by light years."" The earth is the cradle of humankind and it will surely be our destination and cemetery.Almost all of the Earthian is still bound by gravity, and it is difficult to fly out of it.Humans used to go to the moon with ""The primeval Chemical Rocket,"" but never went to Mars. Most people are trapped in the earth's tiny plot of land, let alone the universe.Although we can now ""observe dozens of billions of light years of the universe"", no matter how influential bigwigs can't leave the earth. They can only be like the common people who feet can't leave the ground. Exhausting the limits of the power of human tech can barely enough landing on the moon, its number can be counted on the fingers of one hand.The natural resources in the universe are inexhaustible, but we can only divide into some hostile factions, scheme against each other, intrigued, mutual suspicion, resorting to deception… excessive competition for such a little bit of unremarkable resource on earth. The human civilization at this stage is still too primitive.I really want to ""strive for the cause of human civilization in the universe all my lifetime"", but now I can only ""work for the sake of making a living and fortune"", such a life is not reconciled.We even have not been able to explore the earth.In terms of crustal exploration, the deepest borehole that our drilled has just reached more than 10,000 meters depth. Our drill bit with difficulty went to the bottom of the crust for humans and took a look at the edge of the mantle. This depth is only equivalent to ""The worm takes a bite of apple peel."" This is why we cannot predict earthquakes because even the ""normal state"" of the crust can only be inferred by indirect evidence, and the judgment of its ""abnormal state"" is even more unreliable.…SummaryIt seems that some of today inventions of ""redoubtable and formidable"" are mostly the advancement of Applied Science, not the progress of Basic Science. The development of personal computers is only consistently integrated and shrinking smaller, supercomputers are always stacking and piled up, naturally, their computing performance is strengthened…But quantitative change is unlikely to trigger a qualitative change. It won't bring us quantum computers.The so-called ""innovative tide and creative spoondrift"" is just something ""in application-level."" Basic theory has been stagnant for a long time, and superstring theory has not progressed for many years. In any case, ""Basic Theory"" is the ""source power"" of human sci and tech development. Tomorrow, we may have some room for growth in the application of tech, but the development of the ""fundamental power"" has not been reformed for a long time!Chier Hu's answer to Has fundamental physics stagnated?Chier Hu's answer to Do you think our technology is primitive?Chier Hu's answer to Why is medical technology so primitive compared to computer technology?Chier Hu's answer to What are some examples showing how underdeveloped or powerless present-day human technology is?",UNKNOWN,Tiny Nair,776,689,28M,2019,https://www.quora.com/When-and-what-is-the-next-big-human-technology-advancement

Here’s why.VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing) vehicles have received some favorable acceptance from the FAA, because they won’t be flown by people as Martin Juul assumes, which would eliminate 95% of the problems.There aren’t going to be a bunch of “Joe six-pack rednecks” or “Suzie makeup artists” behind the wheel dangerously distracted.These vehicles would be “fly by wire” (i.e. punch in the coYES, COMPLETELY.They’re here already, in their infancy…While the writer Martin Juul (above or below) makes some good points, his negative “never gonna happen for a long time” attitude isn’t realistic. Here’s why.VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing) vehicles have received some favorable acceptance from the FAA, because they won’t be flown by people as Martin Juul assumes, which would eliminate 95% of the problems.There aren’t going to be a bunch of “Joe six-pack rednecks” or “Suzie makeup artists” behind the wheel dangerously distracted.These vehicles would be “fly by wire” (i.e. punch in the coordinates, and the vehicle flight path system communicates with the FAA to determine & authorize the 3D flight path). The vehicle’s computer takes control, then it takes off on its pre-determined exact course, utilizing a crap-load of 3D air space (latitude, longitude, altitude) which can handle tens of millions of vehicles at a time, and then lands on the exact dime sized destination spot.Everything would be computerized. Planes have been equipped with auto-pilot for decades, so this isn’t some wild fantasy.GPS, communication satellites, radar, etc., are all employed simultaneously, along with additional radar-like on board systems in each vehicle to recognize other vehicles nearby (above, below, front, back, left, right), to assist in the entire process - almost like bumper cars, except virtual air bumpers.On top of all that, each vehicle is small and light, and equipped with a parachute. So even if one did fall out of the sky, the parachute would bring it back to the ground safely. But even if that were to fail (HIGHLY unlikely), the small & light vehicle doesn’t have enough energy or weight to radically destroy large buildings like in Martin’s attached photo, which was destroyed by a large passenger aircraft, laden with fuel (more about that later below).Although I would agree the vehicle definitely could destroy property and kill people, but gee… silly me seems to think we already have vehicles that destroy property and kill people, and it hasn’t stopped them from being legal for over 100 years — even though we have plenty of suicidal people, and people with nefarious thoughts.Either we halt all transportation progress for fear’s sake, or we leapfrog ahead like we’ve always been doing in our modern era.Just my two-bits.Regarding “traffic jams” as Martin asserts. I think Martin has overlooked that these vehicles are VERTICAL takeoff and landing, which means they don’t need to be in a lineup to takeoff or land like an airport. Furthermore, these vehicles won’t need an airport! They’ll be coming out of garages and lifting off from designated areas in each neighborhood.In other words, there’ll be TENS-OF-MILLIONS takeoff and landing zones. Moreover, as I touched on above in my 3D comments; the sky-airspace is MASSIVE. So massive, that it can handle whatever volume is thrown at it. There will be no such thing as “traffic jams” in the sky. Imagine having a freeway that is ten thousand lanes wide, ten thousand lanes vertical, yet WITHOUT a specific directional road path restricting the direction of travel. Moreover, the sky vehicles will not be lined up left and right, and stacked on top of each other. They will be randomly dispersed throughout this massive 3D sky-grid, of spherical 360º dynamics.Again, keeping in mind, every vehicle’s flight path (ascent, descent, speed, direction, altitude, etc.) will be mapped out, in relation to all the other vehicle’s flight paths, controlled by computer systems. So there won’t even be a problem with “speeders” needing to be caught, as Martin asserts.By the way, VTOL’s won’t have large wings and fins as Martin asserts. All one has to do is look at the modern mini drones, which have no wings. Their fan blades will have protective shrouding around them for safety, and they’ll be scaled up in size to carry passengers instead of small loads or cameras. I just saw a news report a few days ago of two kids in Germany making their own personal human passenger drone, and SUCCESSFULLY flying in it with the government’s (restricted) permission!(Young German flying drone bathtub)Progress (Young Philippine flying drone debut)Most of these personal VTOL vehicles will be built for short distant trips (i.e. general metropolis commuting, just the way most of us use our cars). Which logically means they probably will be run on battery charges, rather than fuel. This would take away the “explosive” dangers, making them even more safe, than assumed. Of course, commuting longer distances, say LA to Vegas, will probably occur as the result of personal VTOL time-speed-freedoms, but these types of vehicles in my estimation will require fuel to be able to travel that much distance.In my estimation, I believe people ought to start buying preferred & cheap land just outside the city they live in, because it won’t be too long before that distance of a commute will be shortened from 1 hour to 10 minutes. Many people will prefer to not have neighbors 20 feet away.As for personal VTOL’s being “only toys for the rich”, “for the upcoming decades”, I beg to differ. If kids in Germany can build their own on a shoestring budget, coupled with the fact that mini drones’ component requirements are creating an economy of scale for these kinds of parts (GPS, navigation, circuit boards, electric motors, etc.), the cost of these personal VTOL’s won’t be too far out of reach. Not to mention other economy of scale parts that are being created for other things (Tesla’s batteries, electric motors, GPS in phones, accelerometers, communication equipment & infrastructure, etc.).I’m looking forward to our new world.

However, I’d like to add some further aspects.Even if the pilot’s license wasn’t the issue, the physics would be. If something happens mid-air, a flying car would be coming down like a kinetic missileThe logical outcome would be strict regulations.To prevent accidents due to mechanical failures, each flying car must pass inspection. I can only imagine the interval. Once a year? Twice a year? Once a month? Once a day? The planes are inspected afterTaking this into consideration, upkeep costs could rise rapidly, which is not attractive for an average user. Not to mention that flying cars could not use an engine start-stop system and other fuel-saving tricks to keep themselves in the air, hence the higher fuel consumption.All the buildings should be redesigned to withstand an impact of a flying car. There will always be speed limit offenders, there will be malicious people with suicidal thoughts and horrific accidents or actsAll the prisons, military bases and restricted areas must be redesigned. They must either have AA guns or be built underground. And the backyard privacy in your local suburb would be complicated.To conclude, instead of giving us another layer of freedom, flying cars could compromise our sense of security by introducing some “new” types of accidents and regulations. Even if technology wasn’t stopping us, flying cars wouldn’t catch up with regular cars as we all imagine in promising sci-fi movies.

16,"Web developers can switch to software development easily with the right experience and a suitable approach. I’ll list 5 general steps applicable to most cases.1. Assess your foundationWhile web developers come from different backgrounds, understanding the foundation of software engineering is generally recommended - especially for larger organizations.Let’s say you’re building an ERP, a CRM, a large wiki for a corporation hosting millions of entries which are accessible by different roles and edited simultaneously.The only way to handle that efficiently is understanding the underlying server iWeb developers can switch to software development easily with the right experience and a suitable approach. I’ll list 5 general steps applicable to most cases.1. Assess your foundationWhile web developers come from different backgrounds, understanding the foundation of software engineering is generally recommended - especially for larger organizations.Let’s say you’re building an ERP, a CRM, a large wiki for a corporation hosting millions of entries which are accessible by different roles and edited simultaneously.The only way to handle that efficiently is understanding the underlying server infrastructure, load balancers, RAID storages, what impact everything has on CPU, RAM, I/O operations, how does the web server spin processes, what are effective ways to cache database queries and the like.The rest is general programming knowledge which is always applicable - loops, conditional statements, functions, OOP, standard algorithms.2. Revise your technical stackIf you program in PHP, you will have to learn a completely new programming language for software development. Same goes for Node.js, probably Python or Ruby (although you can technically build a software app in any of those).It’s a bit easier if you do web development in Java or ASP.NET since both stacks are cross-platform and the transition would be simpler.You can look for specific guides on “transitioning from web development to desktop programming” or programming language comparison guides. It may seem dumb at first, but it’s a quick way to apply your existing knowledge and understand the semantic differences between languages and environments.Figure out what goes into a web application - setting up a web server, a database server, building the front-end and back-end separately and the like. You may already have some experience with RESTful applications or other concepts that are applicable to software development.3. Review your new technological stackYou have probably picked a specific technical stack - if you’re assigned to build a project in a few months from now or want to join a specific organization.Applying the previous step would be a good entry point. Find out what skills are directly applicable to the new platform and what you would need to learn.For instance, a PHP developer working with MySQL may look for a Swing or JavaFX with Oracle or Windows Presentation Foundation with MS SQL. There are certain similarities that you can pick quickly and learn the foundations of building a web application in the first place.Some desktop applications are merely a front-end layer for a cloud infrastructure. You may still need to build a service-oriented infrastructure in the cloud using your existing skills and simply provide a desktop app for accessing and updating these.Others are products shipped to tens of thousands of people. Releasing a new version follows different paradigms since people may run different versions of your product at the same time. You need to ensure backward compatibility and support various versions of the same desktop application.Your application may support different platforms as well - different Windows versions or Windows, macOS, Linux. This may require you to dive deeper into cross-platform challenges - which kinda resemble front-end development across different browsers and OS, too.4. Build an actual projectBuild a pet project with your new technical stack.Pick a programming book, watch some YouTube videos, enroll in an online course. You can combine a few of those and fill in the gaps.You can browse for existing GitHub projects built on your preferred technical stack and figure out how to structure the files and folders, how to set up your configuration, a sample database schema and migration scripts and separating the business layer from the rest.Start with your strength - set up the database layer, build some simple forms and take it from there. You can always refine the rest and you will likely hit some blockers - but this is the best way to learn a new stack.5. Assess your new job expectationsThe reason for your interest in software development is likely a new job opportunity or a freelance project.That comes with certain job requirements and expectations. Figure out what are the missing areas that you need to catch up on and focus on those.Complete your pet project (at least some working version). See if you can apply the required concepts into a simple MVP again.Once you feel readyLet them know what your background is and what you’ve done during your transition period.Given the right background in web development, that should be enough. Otherwise, there may be several areas to catch up on. Spend a few weeks improving your skills there and apply again.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,10.5K,996,156M,2018,https://www.quora.com/When-and-what-is-the-next-big-human-technology-advancement
