I doubt if 3D printing will enter the average persons household as much more than a hobby, I see this technology becoming big in retail service companies like automobile garages.  I see this technology being used to fabricate parts and tools, saving time and money for the companies that implement it.I also think we should expect to see advances in electric batteries and automobiles functioning on them.  I think companies like Tesla are just the tip of the iceberg and as they become more cost effective  (through their efficiency and an increased price of oil) consumers will purchase more electric cars.I also feel we should expect to see a large integration of wearable technology like google glasses, and apple watches.","51,704 followers",Chris Ebbert,906,11.4K,278.5M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Can-you-predict-where-technology-will-go-in-the-next-decade

Condoms are only worn by about 5 percent of the male population. That’s pretty troubling, considering that when condoms are used correctly, they’re about 98 percent effective in preventing STDs. Developing countries are especially at risk, because an HIV diagnosis in those parts of the world remains a death sentence due to the high cost of antiretrovirals.So the following designers called upon couples to instigate as much bedroom research as they were able to for each design. Here are a few of the candidates:The yellow latex “Origami Internal Condom” created by ORIGAMI Condoms founder Danny Resnic. It’s designed to work alongside the mechanics of sex as an “active condom.” It moves alongside the body’s motion and actually creates a sensation on the inside of the condom.A hydrogel condom developed by a team from the University of Wollongong in Australia. Hydrogel as a material is purported to be a more durable latex alternative, and is engineered to feel and perform like real skin.Aravind Vijayaraghavan and a team from the University of Manchester plan to use nanomaterials to heighten sensation. It's made of elastomeric composite materials, to be specific – which should be able to increase natural sensations.A one-size-fits-all condom made from a composite material, developed by Benjamin Strutt and a team from Cambridge Design Partnership. The material is engineered to tighten ever so slightly during intercourse, which should both enhance sensation and increase reliability.A condom made from collagen (the main component in connective tissue) designed by Mark McGlothlin of Apex Medical Technologies Inc. Using collagen allows a hydrated skin-like exterior that permits transfer of heat to facilitate a more natural sensation.Mass-produced blood in a lab!

Military planes will soon be pilot-less.There's a lot of advantages to it, as advances in electronic sensors, communications technology, and guided weapons  have fundamentally transformed the nature of air combat.At the beginning, pilots relied on the human eye as the primary air-to-air sensor and machine guns and automatic canon as their primary weapons.  But the human eye can only spot an aircraft-sized target up to about 2 nautical miles in range, and aircraft cannon are only effective to less a nautical mile.The introduction of air-to-air radars and missiles transformed air combat beginning in the 1960s.  In the late 1960s and 1970s, short-range air-to-air missiles began to overtake guns as the dominate means for air-to-air kills, not just for the U.S. military but for foreign air forces as well.  During in the 1980s and 1990s, missiles that could operate beyond visual range overtook short-range missiles as the primary means for shooting down opposing aircraft.  This meant that the success of fighter pilots was no longer “linked to what they can physically see through the cockpit canopy, but what they glean from cockpit displays.”In other words, the days of Maverick and Goose in Top Gun having to maneuver behind an enemy MiG are long gone.  Air-to-air combat today is more like playing a video game, and engagements occur at distances so great that neither pilot ever sees the other.  Whereas speed, acceleration, and maneuverability were important in the gun and short-range missile eras, stealth, sensors, long-range weapons, and endurance are increasingly important in the beyond-visual-range era.  This raises the question: What is the advantage of having a person sitting in the cockpit looking at computer displays when that person could be sitting on the ground looking at the same information?Remotely piloted aircraft can match or exceed manned aircraft in many of the performance attributes of increasing importance for modern fighter jets, particularly when it comes to endurance.  Manned fighters are limited in how long they can stay in the air not by fuel (since they can be refueled in the air) but by how long the pilot can stay strapped into an ejection seat.  Unlike cargo planes and bombers, where the flight crew can get up, go to the bathroom, and even swap crew members mid-flight, fighter pilots can barely even stretch their legs in their tiny cockpits.  Remotely piloted aircraft, on the other hand, are not limited by the endurance of the pilot because they change out crew members as often as necessary.  And since remotely piloted aircraft can be refueled in the air, unmanned aircraft can stay in the air (and in the fight) until they run out of lubricants or need maintenance.Another reason the Navy’s next fighter jet is likely to be unmanned is that remotely piloted aircraft cost less over the long run.  To be clear, the aircraft themselves do not necessarily cost less, and in some cases they may actually cost more per plane to build and more per flying hour to operate than the equivalent manned aircraft.  The savings come from not having to fly them as often for training missions.  Fighter pilots need to be in the air to stay at peak readiness because flying a fighter jet, as Stillion has noted in another report, is like “simultaneously playing the piccolo, driving a formula-one race car, and bench pressing 200 pounds.”  Remotely piloted aircraft, in contrast, don’t need to be in the air to maintain pilot skills–simulator training is a realistic substitute for actual operations.There is more to the cost factor.

(2) By dumb luck.

Sometimes you get lucky and find partners who excel in multiple areas, but the more common scenario is that the team is held back by the absence of a cog.(Other roles like legal counsel and accounting can be done by partners, too, but are easily enough solved by outside help that we'll leave them out for parsimony's sake.)BUT — Who's the Boss?More often than not, each type sees themselves as indispensable.

What entrepreneurs are really excited about here is the category of technologies that work on the principles of distributed transactions that are cryptographically enforced. I think it's by no means a safe bet that today's cryptocurrency technologies (or currencies) will be an integral part of our future, but it's definitely a possibility we shouldn't ignore. People scoffed at the Internet back in the day, and now look at where it's taken us.My take on this set of technologies is that there is little doubt they, or a derivative of them, will become relevant in the longer-term future. Even beyond being a good transaction system for people to use on the internet.Here's an example: As people train machine intelligence to be able to exploit weaknesses in systems or socially engineer humans (or even other AIs with elevated permissions) to gain access to a system, we'll need to stop relying on firewalls and passwords as forms of protection. We'll need solid auditing technologies that can withstand strategic intelligence, and cryptocurrencies are already built that way. They're so tamper-proof that there's no firewall, in fact all the data is left in the open.I think we've only seen the beginning of what cryptocurrency will do for us.

Scroll to section II and III for other neat things :)RoboticsAs I was having a meeting with my professor today, I absentmindedly stuffed a piece of paper into my backpack. This task was done so effortlessly that I didn’t even remember where I had misplaced the paper afterwards. However, a robot would have a very difficult time doing this, because the paper bends and crumples according to very complex physics. The robot's planning algorithms need to somehow anticipate how the paper will respond to its motor policy.Current robots (like Boston Dynamics’ Big Dog) use inverse-dynamics to decide how to move. An internal model of the robot dynamics is used to calculate required torques for everything from balancing, to walking, to making pancakes. Manipulating tools / a piece of paper is not really possible right now because the robot needs to change its internal dynamics representation, as if the paper has become an extension of the hand. A lot of math is involved.How did I do the task with barely any mental computation? Instead of inverting matrices and solving nonlinear systems in my head, I moved by “replaying” motions from memory that I had acquired over a lifetime of motor experience. Not optimal control, but fast and robust.It turns out that recent robotics research have started to incorporate these ideas as well. The combination of reinforcement learning + guided policy search + deep learning results in incredible results [1] . I will let this video here speak for itself:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4bMcUk6pcwIt's worth mentioning that robots using neural network-based controllers can move way faster than ones that need to solve and integrate their dynamics analytically.I think visuomotor-based control will be the dominant robotic control framework for the next decade until something even cooler (like unsupervised learning) comes along.A commercial control package that implements this would sell for a lot of money.There are no good robot operating systems yet. ROS is okay, but the bar it sets is kind of low.An App marketplace for robots will probably show up soon- think Baxter units in a factory being able to download instructions on how to open a certain kind of weird packaging, or perhaps a detector for hazardous objects. Deep Learning shines here - transfer learning allows robots to flexibly ""merge"" knowledge from other trained neural nets and learn in a shared-experience way.Companion AIsMicrosoft’s XiaoIce (微軟小冰) app is a chatbot app that is extremely popular among Chinese Netizens [3]. There are no public numbers on how many user-hours are spent on XiaoIce, but my conservative estimate is that XiaoIce logs ~1000 years of interaction in a single day.Implicit in these chats is a ""projection"" of the world we live in: current events, named entities, a complete knowledge graph. Every day XiaoIce experiences 10 lifetimes worth of theMuch like how motor control can be “re-played from memory” by a neural network policy, I believe that emotion can be convincingly simulated by “re-playing” human data (rather than coming up with some artificial model of emotion). The idea of using big data to create a general AI is hinted at in the movie ""Ex Machina.""Crucial to the development of this technology are advancements in Unsupervised Learning, so that some kind of world representation can be extracted from this without coercing learning to some narrow optimization objective. It’s too early to say whether Deep Learning will deliver on the UL pipe dream, but I'm optimistic and would not be surprised if there was a major breakthrough in unsupervised learning in the next 2-3 years.People cringe when they hear about XiaoIce being used as a “Girlfriend App”, but the reality is that quality companionship, robot or not, is extremely valuable (read: high margin business with sustainable moat and natural monopoly).And of course, there is a market for sex robots that we now have the AI and batteries to address. Think of the Paro Therapeutic Seal...... but a larger, sexier, human-doll version.Control problems are... just vision problems?Remember Google DeepMind’s arcade-game-playing bot from 2014? I was somewhat surprised when I read that it used an ordinary convolutional neural net for generating moves. It makes sense to use a convnet for visual perception, but at some point the network goes from “visual information” to “control information”.Levine et al. 2015 does something similar: a robot is trained to do motor control tasks by using a convolutional neural net to do both perception and control [2]. Again, the network is mapping from a visual domain to a control domain.DeepMind’s Go-playing AI paper came out last week. Even though they use MC tree search to enhance performance, the learning and policy generation is done by a convnet.Something very spooky is going on here, which I only realized after seeing the Go paper. We have a highly logical game whose search space is incomprehensibly vast, and yet a convolutional neural nets can generate very good approximations for inverse-dynamics solvers and search algorithms for game strategy. Is there some deeper connection between planning and vision?Perhaps ""hard problems"" are not so hard when we view them in ""visual space"" rather than their ""true"" problem space. If this hypothesis is true, then we’ve been thinking about game playing and control problems in the completely wrong coordinate frame.This also begs the question - what other kinds of hard computational problems can be approximately solved using visual intuition? Protein folding? Optimization?Noisy inferencePart of the reason we don’t have high-resolution “brain scanners” yet is because measuring process for MRI and EEG is inherently very noisy. To make things worse, the signal reconstruction equations makes some rather crude structural assumptions; for instance, that your brain is a perfect sphere in an isotropic medium.Why do we assume the brain is a sphere? Well, it’s too analytically complex to solve the MRI / EEG diffusion equations for a brain-like geometry.Here’s where Deep Learning techniques can be very useful. Instead of using a kalman filter calibrated to a population of people, we can instead use Deep Learning techniques to overfit the reconstruction process to a specific patient.This leads to increased accuracy and resolution for MRI software, neuroprosthetics, VR controllers.Self-learning inference tools also have military/cybersecurity applications -- for instance, almost all forms of communication have some form of side channel information leakage. Filtering this data in radio receivers could make less assumptions about the noise process and instead use deep learning to ""learn"" the denoising function for the underlying generative process.Cloud-based deep learning systemsBeyond the theoretical aspects of AI research, there are lots of software opportunities for building and scaling up Deep Learning.It’s hard to get into large-scale AI research without their computational resources of Google, Facebook, etc.One market I'm particularly interested in is cloud GPUs for Deep Learning, and a general shift back to mainframe computing (the cloud) for AI. Right now there is no ""AWS for Deep Learning"" because:1) A convenient data pipeline/marketplace does not exist2) Sharing GPUs in the cloud is an unsolved problem3) User interfaces for cloud-based research are nonexistent.I've used several Deep Learning Frameworks and thought a lot about the design of AI research software. While recent frameworks like MXNet and TensorFlow are very good, I don't think their evolution is quite done yet. There's much to be desired in tools for debugging and unit-testing and visualizing neural networks, especially if they are coupled to things like robots.Domino (There's also a lot of opportunities elsewhere in the software stack: optimized OS kernels for running Deep Learning algorithms, HPC design, synchronization + reproducibility of parallel gradient descent, network cards. Facebook's Open Compute Project (Within 2-3 years I expect several cloud-deep learning startups to crop up.AI in other sectorsThe Financial Analysis and Music Industries stand to gain a lot from recent developments in AI.</ end AI hype>II. BiotechSoftware-defined research, Lab-as-a-ServiceA lot of time in labs is spent pipetting (carpal tunnel syndrome, anybody?), counting colonies under a microscope (an exercise in ""getting really mad""), moving tubes from one machine to another, waking up at 2am in the morning to change media in a culture. I would rather spend more time analyzing data and designing experiments than doing backbreaking bench-work.The basic idea of a “services-oriented architecture” is to rent your idle equipment and resources to outsiders. The classic example is AWS, which Amazon created in order to turn a cost center (data centers full of computers) into a gigantic revenue stream.One of the companies I’m most excited about is Transcriptic (Here's another example of an antibody-screening robot at UCSF.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXSeaOhhb40Software-defined agricultureThe same technologies for automated labs can be scaled up to automated farms, where ""cultures"" of crops are autonomously grown, nurtured, and harvested.A fully automated farm is farther out into the future, but companies like FarmLogs are already building the first pieces to turn agriculture into a more data-driven process.Filtering antibodies from soil-dwelling bacteriaPharmaceutical companies have largely shifted from the screening of chemical compounds (i.e. variations of tamoxifen) to the screening of antibodies for finding treatments to cancer, MS, and so on. Many believe that antibody synthesis is the future of custom therapeutics.Antibodies are typically harvested from genetically-modified bacteria living in a lab medium (such as a petri dish). Unfortunately, many bacterial species that produce antibodies we are interested in are fragile and cannot be grown in a lab.Last year a protocol has been developed for extracting antibodies from soil-dwelling bacteria in their natural environment [4].This protocol is very robust (unlike most biology protocols) and is apparently easy enough to do at a small scale in your own backyard.This explosion in what antibodies we are now able to cheaply synthesize presents huge opportunities in the pharmaceutical and basic research space.III. MiscellaneousSolidia CementThe manufacture of standard ""Portland"" cement produces carbon dioxide (CO2) as a waste product, which in turn contributes significantly to human-caused climate change. In fact, the manufacture of cement accounts for ~5% of global human emissions. I suppose this isSolidia Cement is a new type of cement with 30% the CO2 footprint of the Portland variety. More importantly to the investor, it is cheap to make and overcomes previous technical difficulties of CO2-cured cement [3].VR ecosystemI think there will be a resurgence in computer-graphics startups that build content and tools for the VR ecosystem.Presently the industry is dominated by fairly large, slow-moving incumbents like Autodesk and Adobe.Creative tools, 3D modeling software, data analysis, VFX pipelines could be completely re-imagined in VR interfaces. Internet Pages are assumed to be rendered on some 2-dimensional rectangle, but there might be value in a 3D web markup language for interactive VR web pages.As Sam Altman mentions, VR is a promising way to hold conferences and meetings in the future.BatteriesThe main problem with batteries as a form of energy storage (for say, a car) is that they are about 1/30 as energy-dense as petroleum (which has an energy density of about 12,000 Wh/Kg). This means that cars that run on batteries are heavy and can’t go very far.However, MIT has developed a lithium-air battery with energy densities of over 10,000 Wh/kg [5]. Not only that, but it expels clean air rather than CO produced by fossil-fuel-powered engines. Thanks to the entry of tech companies into the automobile market, there is quite a bit of innovation pressure on developing newer hardware components. The mass production of efficient car batteries and on-board GPUs has great synergy with robotics efforts.Copycat tech companies in emerging marketsThere's a lot of low-hanging fruit by copying American startup ideas in other countries. The most obvious example is China, but there are lots of opportunity in other developing countries.For instance, Ghanaians and Nigerians use SMS extensively for mobile banking, and yet there is no Twilio clone in those countries. If you want to build an SMS-powered service, your users have to text international numbers, which sucks.Increased internet connectivity in places like India, Piaui, and Thailand presentMaturation of Julia and Rust languagesJulia (It's not obvious at first how the choice between Rust and C++ or Java and Julia can create that much value for startups. With the exception of ecosystems like iOS / Android, one usually chooses whatever language she wants to make anything.Julia and Rust lower the technical barriers-to-entry and time-to-market for scientific computing startups and high-speed apps, respectively. A good programming language is a force multiplier - what used to take a 3 C++ developers can now be accomplished in the same time frame by a single developer that leverages Julia or Rust.For instance, many scientific applications start as a prototype written by a couple of researchers in MATLAB. In the following months, a team of programmers re-implement the technology in a more robust application or a web service.But what if those two researchers could just write their ""prototype"" and ""production"" code in the same language, saving months of algorithm translation? This language would need to be ""science-y"" enough to make math / array manipulation easy, and yet be general-purpose and fast enough to make Web programming, string parsing, IO easy.I've been following Julia since 2012 and believe it has the most potential to deliver on this. Julia has all the ""first-class technical computing"" features of a MATLAB, while still being good for tasks that you might do in Python.Rust addresses a different need: the speed and flexibility of C++ while being memory-safe. A startup whose production stack gives them the safety of a garbage-collected language for free, plus the performance of a low-level language, has a decisive resource advantage over a competitor that must spend more time debugging segfaults.WebAssembly (wasm)Web developers have some intuition of what client-side JavaScript is capable of:Even the ""moderate"" apps mentioned above require significant performance optimizations that push JavaScript to its limits. Still, there are fundamental limitations to JavaScript's performance, which explains why most professional applications remain as desktop apps.To address this, a new standard calledWhy is this important, and where is the opportunity here? wasm has a lot of cute features, but crucial thing here is thatWeb apps have much less friction when it comes to acquiring users, since clicking a link or opening a bookmnark is way easier than downloading and installing applications. There are many users to be captured by simply porting existing software to the browser. Furthermore, developing UIs on the web is much easier than writing native Cocoa / QT / .NET code - even less barrier to entry for startps.I'm excited to see what games, content creation tools, and scientific software shows up in the browser in the coming years. Here is a demo of running Unity games in wasm:Meanwhile, technologies like WebRTC will greatly enable higher-bandwidth applications that previously weren't possible.ConclusionThough laborious and incremental, the march of technological progress is quite fast. The things I've listed above will continue to mature, and in 2-3 years their market opportunities will be more obvious. I strongly believe in Deep Learning / robotics / AI, the scaling of biotech via robots and services, and programming technologies that give developers far more productivity leverage.What a time to be alive!

You'd also pay a lot for Oracle's database, spend time figuring out how to configure it, and then hire a database admin or two to manage it.On the other hand, if you were recreating Airbnb today, you'd use Amazon Web Services for any hardware you need. You could use Amazon RDS or MongoLab as your cloud-hosted database. You'd use Optimizely for your A/B testing needs, and Google Prediction API or BigML for machine learning. Projects that took years or decades of engineering time twenty years ago can often be done in months or even weeks today.The impact of more open source software and more APIs cannot be overstated. In 2000, you needed to raise a $5m Series A just to get a product built. You needed to hire a bunch of people, buy a bunch of machines, and manage a lot of complexity. Today, engineers can launch products by themselves while working full-time jobs.
