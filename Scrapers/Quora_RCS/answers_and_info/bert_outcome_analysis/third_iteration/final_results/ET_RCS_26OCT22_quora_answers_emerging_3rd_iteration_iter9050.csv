Well, a week later the boss comes over and offered us to order food for lunch. He totally knew I was vegan and especially mentioned it to meI was pissed off and that confirmed it. My coworkers were talking to him with great details. It only took 2 weeks to unfold.The next day, I confronted my coworker alone in a conference room. I told him everything and why I was pissed off by his behaviour. His face became red and he had difficulty to breath. Well the guy was like 400 pounds, ate meat all the time and he had a maple syrup business on the side.After 5 minutes of me talking with too much intensity he became ill. He left and sat on a chair in the shop with a hand over his chest, face all red. I asked him if he was all right and if his reaction was because of our conversation. He said No! To save his pride… He then stood up and left and sat outside for a while.He called his wife and asked her to come and get him to the hospital…He didn't show up at work for 2 weeks! I learned he got a cardiac mesh cylinder inserted through his arm in a vein in his heart. When he came back he told everyone he thought he was dying. Not a word about our conversation.I left a week after he came back. I could not stand that guy for a second.","1,213 followers",Jennifer Finger,3.9K,7.4K,4.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-your-co-workers-biggest-communication-issues
1,"I remember a former co-worker whom I thought was being rude exclusively to me. She was the receptionist at my then employer and would get into bad moods and slam down my mail on my desk. I asked her if she could please place it on my desk more quietly and she responded “Lalala” with her fingers in her ears like a little kid trying to tune out his parents. I tried to rise above it and ignored her for a while, hoping she would knock it off, but she didn't stop. I didn't see her treating anyone else like that so I finally went to her boss, the office manager, asked for a private meeting, and toldI remember a former co-worker whom I thought was being rude exclusively to me.

She was eventually fired. We all liked her replacement.","7,030 followers",Maura Rudd,972,18.3K,40.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-your-co-workers-biggest-communication-issues
2,"Any business relationshipDo not share your political beliefs, opinions, personal stories or personal tragedies with your co-worker or your boss/manager. Do not engage in gossip and rumors about others at work either. Steer and stay clear of the office “Any business relationshipDo not share your political beliefs, opinions, personal stories or personal tragedies with your co-worker or your boss/manager. Do not engage in gossip and rumors about others at work either. Steer and stay clear of the office “The bottom line is this,IF you approach every conversation with that mentality and think before you speak you will be better off in the long run. WORK is WORK. It is not your family, these folks are not going to “back you up,” when you make an off comment about a manager, a boss or a co-worker.How does this relate to trust?Trust isIn and at work, that is something that would be established over time. You would TRUST your coworker to do their part on a job. You might TRUST that they are telling you the proper information on a project or a job related issue. Outside of that type of work related trust that is the extent that you should hold any trust in a business related relationship.",UNKNOWN,Ross,941,3.8K,85.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-your-co-workers-biggest-communication-issues
3,"Why do narcissists communicate signs of leaving?The signs you perceive from a narcissist are warning signs for you. From the beginning you probably get the gut feeling that something is just not right. If you are ignorant to the disorder like most of us were, the highs of the relationship overwrite the common sense.So, why do they communicate signs of leaving? That is because, in most cases they were never in it in the first place. A narcissists knows their new toy will become less desirable. They know that eventually it will be put on a shelf.You are basically a new record (vinyl for me) thatWhy do narcissists communicate signs of leaving?The signs you perceive from a narcissist are warning signs for you.

The narc does not throw that old record away, it might be nice to reflect on it some day and play it again, but for the most part it is old and scratched and now does not give the narc the emotional high it used to.When the new record becomes old and boring and nothing new has been released, the narc will pull out the old record (you) and play it again. It will not be played over and over this time. It will be played just long enough for a little high and then slapped back on the shelf.",3 followers,Martin Mann,880,943,1.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-your-co-workers-biggest-communication-issues

5,"What's that?arHa!Ok, seriously …when generally competent people get details mixed up, that's poor communication. If you find your team being offended by each other easily, that's poor communication.

6,This I assume is at work? My first indication was when I was trying to do an application in our system they had changed it without informing me. We had upgraded our system there were other departments involved and there was a lot of miscommunication between departments in the same Department it was very messy. The whole upgrade and merger was not well thought-out to the very last detail,9 followers,Lisa Bates,547,269,466.7K,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-signs-that-your-team-is-suffering-from-communication-issues
7,"Ask your son if he knows some kids at school who have special teachers or rules.  Just like some kids at school are treated differently, this grandparent needs to be treated differently than most adults.  You don't have to go into much detail about the grandparent, just the child's responses to the grandparent.  ""So, when grandpa repeats himself, we pretend he's not repeating himself, because he may not remember what he said before.""  ""When grandpa does x, that's' not ok.  It's not your job to worry about it, the grown-ups will handle it,  but please tell me if you're worrying about it"" (and aAsk your son if he knows some kids at school who have special teachers or rules.

That was the last time anyone saw her.Luckily for all of us involved she won't live too much longer. The pain and suffering will die along with her. Questions from my kids will be SO much easier: we didn't see her then because she was mean and awful. Luckily, no one else in the family has communication with her either so it's a united front we have going.My advice is to be honest but limited in details. 10 year olds have a beautiful world surrounding them, don't taint it too much if you can limit the details. As they get older they'll figure out what dementia and mental illness looks like on their own.Best wishes to you.","1,001 followers",Ruben Kusi,3.1K,165,2.2M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-are-your-co-workers-biggest-communication-issues
