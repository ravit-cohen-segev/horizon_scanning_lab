0,"The Lockheed work is on deuterium-tritium fusion. This cannot be compact because 80 percent of its energy output is in the form of kinetic energy of very fast neutrons. These must be stopped in a thick envelope of neutron absorbing material surrounding the plasma. Fission power plants also must have their neutrons stopped, but it’s easier in their case because, per watt, there aren’t nearly so many neutrons, nor so energetic.Moreover, a fusion reactor’s neutron-absorbing material must be mostly lithium-six. This stable, naturally abundant isotope, when it captures a neutron, forms tritium. TheThe Lockheed work is on deuterium-tritium fusion.

6,"I believe that there may be commercial possibilities for fusion powered aircraft.Picture of the Boeing “Pelican” long haul ground effect cargo aircraft designThe Boeing Pelican designed by Boeing senior designer Blaine Rawdon is a very large aircraft designed to operate on ground effect while moving a lot of cargo quickly and cheaply between continents.

In fixed-wing aircraft, ground effect is the increased lift (force) and decreased aerodynamic drag that an aircraft's wings generates when they close to a fixed surface like the surface of the ocean.The Pelican if built would be the largest airplane in the world. If you stood the Pelican on one wingtip, the other wingtip would almost reach the top of a 50-story building. The Pelican would weighs 6 million pounds and has 76 steerable tires to distribute that weight and keep it from turning runways into rubble. The aircraft is planned to be powered by eight 80,000-horsepower turbine engines driving four counter-rotating propellers, each of which is as tall as a five-story building. I believe that the aircraft design would be compatible with fusion nuclear-electric propulsion (in my technical proposal an aneutronic He3-He3 Inertial Confinement Fusion power plant producing nuclear electricity via direct conversion of fusion charged particles [protons and alpha particles] collected on light stationary screens which in turn is used to drive multiple electric motors and props).TheWhile some effort has gone into fission powered bombers some decades ago, this effort never produced a successful nuclear fission bomber prototype - mostly because of shielding related problems and the excessive weight adequate biological shielding would require to keep the aircraft crew and pilots safe.Fusion has many significant advantages when used in direct nuclear aircraft propulsion and may ultimately have advantages over other alternative power methods including fossil fuel powered jets.Some fusion advantages -1) Fusion has no critical mass requirement; all that a fusion reaction requires is the right conditions be met (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) to support fusion. As a result, very tiny fusion power plants can potentially be built.2) Fusion fuels are widely available in space. Hydrogen (and deuterium) is the most abundant elements in the universe. Hydrogen is fully 10^10 times more abundant by atoms in the universe than any combination of fission fuels (U233, U235, Pu239).3) When fusion fails to work, it tends to just flame out, and serious accidents and melt downs do not tend to happen4) Neutrons and gammas produced by fission reactors are hard to shield for vehicle or nuclear propulsion applications. Charged particles like protons produced from He3-He3 fusion are somewhat easier and more cost effective to shield. A combination of magnetic fields and electrostatic fields can be used to provide a low mass solution for biological shielding needed to provide excellent operator safety for mobile He3-He3 Inertial Confinement fusion reactors.Helium3-Helium3 fusionHe3 + He3-> He4 + 2 protons + 12.86 MeV (energy)He3-He3 fusion produces only charged protons and energy (no difficult to shield neutrons at all).Charged Protons produced from He3-He3 fusion can be collected on light weight grids and screens and used to directly power electric motors that actually drive the props of a long haul fusion cargo aircraft. Neutron-less He3-He3 fusion does not require an expensive and heavy precision turbine-generator to convert nuclear heat into electricity (for He3-He3 fusion, lower cost and lighter weight direct collection of charged particles on grids suffices).Will there ever be fusion powered Aircraft?Picture of the Boeing Pelican flying at its normal height of 20 feet.I believe that it is possible that the future requirements of international trade may support a fleet of very large fusion powered aircraft that use ground effect over the oceans to increase the load carrying capabilities and performance of the cargo aircraft.The Pelican: A Big Bird for the Long Haul",0 followers,John Holmes,826,1.2K,784.1K,2019,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-a-fusion-reactor-aircraft-will-be-built

It is extremely safe and free of long term nuclear waste.Currently the Chinese have a record of 100 seconds of plasma energy operating at 3 times the heat of the Sun.In 2025 the very large international ITER research reactor will be completed in France.

This is likely the most expensive powerful machine ever built. It will use giant powered super magnets to create extreme temperatures and pressure.This reactor may be successful at producing very cheap, low carbon energy. The problem is that such reactors will be far too expensive for useful energy supply. Such reactors will also need expensive maintenance due to Neutron radiation damage to the reactor.Ideally, fusion is great. But such reactors may just be far too expensive. ITER will cost over $10 billion. But other options are available and lessons learned from the ITER reactor may be invaluable.For a lower cost and in much shorter time Generation 4 nuclear FISSION reactors may be developed cheaper and sooner. Such reactors could be far safer than current safe fission reactors. Next Generation fission reactors are highly resistant to meltdowns. And have significant other advantages.Gen 4 fission reactors could give us vital options for cheap, low carbon power. Cheap is vital. They need to be competitive with fossil fuels to be successful. They are a much better short term option to fusion power. Potentially small, transportable reactors could be in production within 10 years. Given enough support and investment.A number of different types are available. The next step is the construction of prototype reactors. To prove they are safe and efficient. China is leading in the construction of Gen 4 reactors.China has just started operation of a gas cooled, pebble bed reactor prototype fission reactor. It uses sphere fuel pebbles protected by layers of highly heat resistant material. Including ceramics, silicon, carbides, graphene and carbon materials. Able to tolerate temperatures of over 1000 degrees. Much hotter than the operating temperatures of PWR, Pressurised Water Reactors, using metal fuel rods and Uranium fuel pellets.These gas cooled reactors can operate at temperatures that would melt solid fuel rods. These reactors are also far easier to operate. Even without coolant, pumps or electrical power these reactors can cool effectively with natural air convection cooling. The fuel can be burnt far more effectively. The pebbles are easily removed, checked, reused or replaced without closing down the reactor.Other possible options are Molten Salt Reactors and sodium-cooled reactors. These reactors can also use a variety of cheap and abundant fuel. Cleaner and cheaper than enriched Uranium. They can use nuclear or mining waste as well as un-used weapons material. Actually reducing the amount of material available to make nuclear weapons. These reactors are also smaller, cheaper, safer, easy to operate and transportable. They also produce much less waste. The fuel and fission products can be thoroughly burnt up as energy. Leaving far less, and short term waste.","29,977 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,3K,7.7K,250M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-tomorrow-small-1-5-megawatts-economically-feasible-fusion-reactors-were-available-what-would-happen-to-the-world-economy

Nuclear fusion reactors seem to be getting closer, but even IF a useful nuclear fusion reactor (one that produces more energy than it uses) is ever built (which is still a big “if”) then it still has to be something that could be made cheaply enough to compete with existing methods of electricity production.Frankly, when I look at ITER (which is the experiment that will lead to the design of DEMO, which is the design that will in turn lead to PROTO - the first commercial nuclear fusion reactor) I see something that looks as large, complex and expensive as an existing nuclear fission reactor.
