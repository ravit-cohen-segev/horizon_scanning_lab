1,"It will be whatever a genius marketer manages to convince people they cannot live without. The technology could be sticks and stones; what is more important is being able to convince idiots that they cannot exist without it, that it makes them cool and sexy and will help get them laid. It may take about a billion transistors to achieve that, but I would not be surprised if a handful of clay could do it too.",269 followers,Karthik Reddy L,16K,0,0,2013,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-great-personal-technology-device

If you where trading or just investing a few FIAT coins in them. Such profits you could only get if you where a top trading company on Wall street .With crypto we could archive and still can, this same high results in our living room with a bit of time and no heavy investment.So the secret is out and the banks and goverments are trying to break this little unregulated space, which a few tech savy people created and many enthusiatic idealists shared. Well the battle is alredy raging as you can see in the red of manny cryptos in the moment.What can you do ?First clapp then upvote then speak out loud and of course join the crypto comunity .

So he invested his time and money on improving that and today we see Amazon, a leader in the online market.The secret that Jeff threw at us to find the ‘The Next Big Thing’, is not by looking at something that will drop from the blue but something that will stick with us.

He will give it a transaction number, and also note down the name of the two parties involved.Understand the fact that whenever you transfer money, the bank is the third party which gets involved to note down the credentials of the transaction.What if there was no bank required to make a transaction?So, when Batman transfers money to Hulk through Bitcoins, all the information related to it is handled by a blockchain.A block chain is a digital ledger in which transactions made in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are recorded chronologically and publicly.It is a continuously growing list of records, which has the time stamps and transaction data.Now, to maintain the block chain, or the list of records you need a network. A network of people who ensure the transactions are securely taking place and there is no disparity.These people are our miners, who use their processing power to maintain security of block chains and to ensure that they keep working properly.Miners are rewarded as well when they help maintain the block chain system.So, basically, Bitcoin as a digital currency eliminates the need of a third party like a bank server, and makes it decentralized.

You can go about your daily life, easily contact others, record your memories, learn things, be entertained, and put aside a lot of the nuances needed to do those things in the past.We no longer have to load a movie projector, program a VCR, tape songs off the radio, find a library with a certain “how to” book, or spend forever searching for that certain item that you want.The current internet is fast enough for most things for some time, computers/phones won’t need to be replaced as often, and most changes will be incremental, rather than dramatic. TVs will get bigger and sharper, phones will get more storage and better cameras, but in a way, I think the average person will have less technology but is more compact.In the past, you might have had a floor TV, VCR, DVD player, CD player, Tape deck, turntable, amplifier, camcorder, big speakers, portable music player and a whole bunch of tapes/CDs/DVD - but now you have a wall mounted TV, sound bar and a WIFI hotpot in another room. The computer might even be gone, and a couple phones and tablets took its place.In the last 20+ years, tech has really covered what people really hoped for and wanted to use it for. Unless I’m missing something due to my age, I’m having a hard time trying to figure out what need still needs to be solved.","51,709 followers",Chris Ebbert,906,11.4K,278.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-great-personal-technology-device
