0,"There seems to be new interest in unducted prop-fans. They seem to split the speed difference between turbofans and turboprops with lower fuel consumption than the fans.Another direction is electrically driven props and fans, possibly supplemented by fuel burning engines for takeoff, climb to cruise, and landing go-around capability.Pure electric for commercial flight seems quite a ways off.",699 followers,Colin Povey,904,3.7K,6.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-next-technology-in-aircraft-engines-after-the-jet

2,"Hey, most probably the next type of engine will be the plasma thruster engine. Or any electric solution that might come along. In the meantime if we don’t find a good enough solution, a temporary one could be nuclear-powered propulsive engines even though they could be dangerous in a crash and probably the public opinion about them won’t be great either.",UNKNOWN,Chris O'Leary,1.7K,4.1K,89.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-next-technology-in-aircraft-engines-after-the-jet

4,"The first wave of breakthroughs has happened, with “aeroponics” and “aquaponics”, what we need is dirt cheap electricity.We need 3D farming where livestock are in a huge multi storey building so they don’t take up farmland, pollutes water streams etc, that forest are not cleared in favor of livestock.","29,927 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,5.9K,7.7K,249.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-next-technology-in-aircraft-engines-after-the-jet
5,"As of yesterday it’s no longer “next”.First pig heart being transplanted into a humanYesterday, January 10th, 2022, marks the first time an organ from a genetically modified animal, a pig, was transplanted into a human. We don’t know what will happen, but the pig was genetically modified in a way that makes it unlikely the organ will be rejected by the recepient and pig organs in general are quite similar to our own.I hope the recipient lives a rich full life with his new heart of a pig. Even if not, this is still a major step forward towards generating organs to order, without fear of rejectiAs of yesterday it’s no longer “next”.First pig heart being transplanted into a humanYesterday, January 10th, 2022, marks the first time an organ from a genetically modified animal, a pig, was transplanted into a human.

Even if not, this is still a major step forward towards generating organs to order, without fear of rejection. Even if the heart is rejected and the donor dies, what we learn from the process will enable us to succeed the next time. I reckon this will become the mainstream way we get spare parts by the end of the decade in an optimistic scenario, by the end of the next decade in the pessimistic one.Either way, the moment is as groundbreaking as December 3rd, 1967, when the first human heart ever was transplanted, ushering the era of organ transplants of today. That patient died after 18 days, I hope this guy does better.","358,859 followers",Sean Kernan,2.8K,5.6K,726.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-next-technology-in-aircraft-engines-after-the-jet
6,"That’s a good question, and we don’t really know the answer.One of the problems around the adoption of agriculture is that many of its perceived advantages don’t appear until hundreds or thousands of years after agriculture is invented, and some disadvantages appear immediately. For example, very early agriculture doesn’t produce a notable surplus of food beyond what one could get by hunting and gathering and doesn’t support a larger population. By centralizing production, it allows greater populationThat’s a good question, and we don’t really know the answer.One of the problems around the adoption of agriculture is that many of its perceived advantages don’t appear until hundreds or thousands of years after agriculture is invented, and some disadvantages appear immediately. For example, very early agriculture doesn’t produce a notable surplus of food beyond what one could get by hunting and gathering and doesn’t support a larger population. By centralizing production, it allows greater populationIdeas about the adoption of agriculture break down into two categories: push theories and pull theories. Push theories posit that people started farming because they had to. The initial invention of agriculture in the Neolithic happened during a period of climate change. Shifting patterns of plant growth and animal movement would cause old hunting and gathering techniques to fail, potentially prompting people to take greater control over their food supply. The problem there is that computer simulations indicate that if youThen there are pull models, which posit that there was something that drew people to agriculture. Making more food isn’t one of those, nor is the eventual ability to create craft specialists and higher technology. The first farmers wouldn’t have known about any of that. One thing they might have known about, though, is beer. If you figure out how to ferment grain, you can make alcohol pretty much at will, and that’s immensely valuable. One theory about the adoption of agriculture, then, is that it was driven at least in part by a desire to produce a valuable commodity. I’m not sure I buy it, but it’s worth thinking about.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-next-technology-in-aircraft-engines-after-the-jet
