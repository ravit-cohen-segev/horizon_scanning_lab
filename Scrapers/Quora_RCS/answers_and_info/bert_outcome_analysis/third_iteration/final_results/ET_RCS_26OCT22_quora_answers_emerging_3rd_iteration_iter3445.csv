I'm not exactly sure what the effect of that would be, as I'm not sure what practical difference there would be between a massless electron, a massless muon, and a massless tauon.Likewise, variants of protons and neutrons composed of similar mixtures but with up and/or down quarks replaced by charm and/or strange or top and/or bottom quarks would flourish; but again, I don't know what practical difference this would make, as these variant nuclear particles would interact electromagnetically exactly the same way protons and neutrons do.","7,171 followers",Barak Shoshany,2.1K,1K,7.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-conceivable-that-sufficiently-advanced-technology-could-be-used-to-manipulate-the-Higgs-Boson-Higgs-Field-to-reduce-the-inertia-mass-of-an-object

There is still a backlog of aircraft and the newer planes, 777-X, A321 XLR (still being developed) future NMA and probably FSA will have 2 pilots. Boeing already said the NMA would seat 2 pilots and that the 1 pilot rumor was just that, a rumor.anyways I think the first plane that may have 1 pilot may be the “Maverick” or “Bird of Pray” that Airbus is planning to develop in 2035 or so. At this point there will probably still be 2 pilot airliners being produced, and the single pilot airliner being designed will be operational probably around 2045 or so. Most planes will still fly with 2 pilots but the newer planes will only have 1 on board and 1 on the ground along with a lot of automation (assuming an AI that can think and operate the airplane like a pilot is aboard the airplane I want to note that the autopilot on modern airliners is NOT an AI it doesn’t think it doesn’t plan, it doesn’t make decisions it does everything the pilots are telling it to do)This is where Aviation will stay for a long long while (assuming single pilot operations doesn’t cause extra crashes)I think at this point both Airbus and Boeing will start making short and long haul single pilot airliners at first with a pilot in the air and a pilot on the ground monitoring with an AI co pilot on board and this will become the norm from 2060/ 2070 onward.I personally believe there will be a single pilot on board longer than there has been 2 pilots and 3 pilots.Why?Because no one has developed a computer system or machine that never fails or that doesn’t need correcting or is impervious to hacking. This isn’t a question of passenger willingness. People who board planes generally have NO IDEA what is going on. Very few people understand aviation so maybe people would be willing to fly on a pilotless airliner. I suspect that by 2080/ 90/100 or so people will feel comfortable with it (again assuming there are no crashes or incidents) but just because the flying public is OKAY with it doesn’t mean it is safe enough to do so.I will use this as an example. In Japan there was a fully automated train that randomly went in the opposite direction and hit a wall at a train station.Why? faulty wiring. Had there been a person on board to push a stop button nobody would have gotten hurt.imagine a plane without a pilot crashes and the investigators close the report with“it there would have been a human at the front to turn the plane these 200 souls would have been saved” (obviously not the actual wording)It would be unacceptableI think after a long long long time of single pilot operations without any crashes. And I mean zero incidents, no malfunctions, no pilots saving a plane etc. There will be new planes which have no pilots onboard but they will be monitoring the plane from a ground station. That will be the furthest it goes. They will be flying the plane like drone operators. At this point I think surgeons, captains on ships, and other professions will also be relegated to monitoring a machine with AI do the work simply because human lives are at risk.Now this is all based on the assumptions:It doesn’t take a genius to say that if single pilot airliners crashes when they are introduced the even if it is pilot error there could be a massive push to go back to 2 pilots. Why?Because Planes that fly with 1 pilot will need to be able to fly themselves (in the case of pilot incapacitation) if the plane crashes that would mean neither the single pilot, the AI along with the help of the pilot on the ground were able to fix it.If the AI or computer causes the crash then the situation would be even worse.If it’s a case of pilot suicide there could also be a push to add a second pilot to prevent that from happening as well.the public and regulators would do probably allow 1 crash a pass as a coincidence. If we see anything like the 737 MAX where there are multiple ones it will probably be assumed (and rightly so at that point) that having 2 pilots on board is safer than 1 and the regulations will probably be changed to have 2 pilots on board for the safe operations of the aircraft.if a plane crashes during the transition between the single pilot and autonomous phase then planes will remain with 1 pilot.4. this is also based on the assumption we survive because at the rate 2020 is going on hay probably isn’t a guarantee.That is my guess on the future of airliners when it comes to if there will be pilots flying planes.There will still be pilots for a very very long time onboard airplanes and there will be pilots flying from the ground after that.TLDR: No pilots won’t disappear when planes can really be fully automated. Planes will move to single pilot and be single pilot for many decades and if nothing ever happens (crashes, computer failures etc.) there will be pilots monitoring aircraft on the ground like military drone pilots do today. All this is based on the assumptions above the TLDR","2,324 followers",MA Sadik,15.9K,124,2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-importance-of-human-capabilities-and-operational-implications-of-automation-in-advanced-technology-flight-decks

We wouldn’t have electric inter-communication, wireless well- anything, this would be a much older time to live.In the yearThis led to a greaterIn 1821,The motor used a bath ofThe firstThis motor design was then improved upon until it was discovered that the process wasTo keep this answer concise, I will quickly summarise the remaining major inventions:In 1833, Farraday invented the thermistor and the laws ofMoritz von Jacobi created the first ‘real’ rotating electric1836 - Nicholas Callan invented the electric1837 - Edward Davy invented the1844 - The first electrical1845 - Kirchoff developed -non-other-than-1855 - First utilisation of1873 - Zenobe Gramme discovered that his DC generator could be used as a DC motor (developing the first1877 - Thomas Alva Edison invented the1877 - Werner von Siemens invented the1879 - Thomas Edison patentedMost modern electrical inventions, such as semi-conductor usage and components were developed in the 1900s.And that is a brief summary of what the invention of a battery led to.Thank youPhoto References:Further reading:","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-importance-of-human-capabilities-and-operational-implications-of-automation-in-advanced-technology-flight-decks
19,"Sure, you can also be an engineer without any kind of degree. I work with engineers who don’t have degrees but are extremely skilled and knowledgeable people. It’s reasonably common in engineering for smart people to work their way up off the shop floor without having a strong academic background.A lot depends on how you define “engineer”.

In some countries it’s a protected title (like doctor) and so the pathway to getting officially recognised is more restrictive. However, most professional registration bodies are flexible enough that they can recognise people who’ve taken a work and experience-based pathway instead of an academic one. Having an accredited degree in engineering gives you a substantial leg up to registration, but it’s not the only way. You can have the “wrong” sort of degree or even no degree at all, but if you have the knowledge and skills and you can prove that then in most countries you’ll be able to achieve registration. You’ll just have to jump through a lot more hoops to prove it.Of course, in some countries “engineer” isn’t a protected term, so the guy who comes to fix your boiler who’s done a two-week course is referred to as an engineer. As are software developers who wouldn’t know one end of a screwdriver from the other. It’s a hugely misused term.","68,793 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.5M,2022,https://www.quora.com/EU-has-been-no-natural-resources-no-financial-center-lack-of-wheats-no-advanced-technologies-military-technologies-inferior-space-program-Why-does-EU-keep-shouting-sanctions-against-others-countries-especially

We have portable computers with most field-companies, drones overhead, the latest jets in the air and our satellites in the sky.Our tanks are technological wonders. The technology for tanks to fire, at a pin-point target while on the move-at 50 Km/h is made and used in Israel.We have robot boats, tunnel -destroying technology and face-recognition cameras in most ‘hot-spots’.The technology to shoot down enemy rockets-while in the air-over the enemy side of the fence is made in Israel and well applied.Our computerized and radarized anti-‘car-crash’ system is now sold all around the world.In medicine, We have the latest technologies and we have developed many of them.The simple facts that Google, and many other high-tech companies have R&D centers in Israel —and that the second ‘Silicon Valley’ concept is found in Israel-is a reflection of ‘advanced-technologically’ Israel.…and the local joke: “ Why don’t they move theIsraelThe acute distance between the scientific/technological Israel and all her Arab neighbors…is astounding.

Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party. Because radiation from nuclear accidents is apparently scarier than way more people dying of regular pollution constantly and the total annihilation of all life on Earth as the oceans boil away.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/EU-has-been-no-natural-resources-no-financial-center-lack-of-wheats-no-advanced-technologies-military-technologies-inferior-space-program-Why-does-EU-keep-shouting-sanctions-against-others-countries-especially
