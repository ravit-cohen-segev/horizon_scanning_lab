Can you reverse engineer this divine weapon? Wouldn't the mere thought of doing such a thing be sacrilege? Besides, even if you wanted to, where in the Machine God’s name would you even start?And that is-That's right, these bad boys are the same as an illiterate peasant when compared to the heights that Mankind achieved during the Dark Age of Technology.This stagnation is further exacerbated by the Red Priests belief that technology is sacred and everything worth knowing already exists somewhere out there in the galaxy if only one has the faith and perseverance necessary to find it.Indeed most of the higher echelons of the Martain Brotherhood deliberately hide knowledge away, especially lore that they feel is too powerful and dangerous for mankind to be trusted with.Thus most members of the Mechanicus are more akin to priests than scientists. Blindly following ritual and dogma withoutIn fact, the reaction of The Death of Integrity, A DAOT ship when encountering the Mechanicus was quite telling-“Oh spare me your feeble rituals, they are ineffectual, being based upon erroneous assumptions as to the nature of machines. We have no souls, “priest”,’ said the ship. ‘Yet another of your specious beliefs.’Plosk’s voice stopped. He could not move. The abominable intelligence was in him, possessing him. Nuministon stopped, strain on the flesh parts of his face.The Space Marines aimed their guns at the column. No fire came.When the Spirit of Eternity spoke again, the machine’s voice came from the air and from the lips of all the servitors on the ship.'What shall I not tell them? Who are you to tell such as I what to do and what not to do? Once I gladly called your kind “master”, but look how far you have fallen!’ It was full of scorn. ‘Your ancestors bestrode the universe, and what are you? A witch doctor, mumbling cantrips and casting scented oils at mighty works you have no conception of. You are an ignoramus, a nothing. You are no longer worthy of the name “man”. You look at the science and artistry of your forebears, and you fear it as primitives fear the night. I was there when mankind stood upon the brink of transcendence! I returned to find it sunk into senility. You disgust me.’Plosk’s nervous system burned with agony as the abominable intelligence burrowed deeply into his machine parts, but he was unable to voice it, and suffered in terrible silence. As the Spirit of Eternity spoke, it spoke within him too. It took out each of his cherished beliefs, all the esoterica he had gathered in his long, long life and threw them down.‘Wrong, wrong, wrong,’ it said over and over.And this is how far Mankind has fallen. From an era when we could build ships run by loyal AI that were capable of time travel, armed with weapons that fired black holes to a state in which those same creations refuse to even acknowledge us as human.So while the Mechanicus can often build awe-inspiring pieces of technology like the God Machines of the Titan Legions, they don't always understand the underlying concepts beneath what they are doing.For the knowledge of the Mechanicus comes almost exclusively from the few STC fragments that survived the devastation of the Dark Age of Technology and then the madness of the Age of Strife.Which, as you might have guessed from the names, were conflicts that pretty much eradicated Mankind’s galaxy-spanning empire.To make matters worse STC’s were originally made to enable colonists in the hinterlands to quickly and efficiently set up a functioning society.Why is that aWell because that means the instructions contained within are both as detailed and complex as the instruction manual you got alongside the sofa set you bought from IKEA. Sure it lets you set up a perfectly nice sofa in the living room with minimal fuss but you are hardly going to becoming a master craftsman after that simplified experience are you?-Looks fancy but its more or less the same thing.Plus what incentive is there for the Mechanicus to spend thousands of years researching and reverse engineering when they might just find an even more powerful STC tomorrow. SoTo sum, it is often impossible for the Imperium to reverse engineer DAOT tech because of religious injunctions, fear of the unknown, a near-total loss of mankind's accumulated knowledge over the ages and a crippling dependency on Standard Construction Templates.Sure there are exceptions such as Belisarius Cawl and his Primaris marines. But that's all they are,In the grim darkness of the far future, there is no hope for enlightenment or progress for humanity. There is but an eternity of war and the laughter of thirsting Gods.Adeptus Mechanicus",2 followers,Steve Anderson,1.2K,149,1.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Warhammer-40K-If-humanity-cant-make-a-lot-of-advanced-technology-any-more-because-the-knowledge-has-been-lost-what-stops-them-from-reverse-engineering-the-stuff-they-have-to-figure-out-how-it-works

It was meant to be used with a conjunction with advanced human intellect that, while intelligent, lacks the engineering and scientific knowledge to adapt to every possible situation. So the STC and artificial intelligence were meant to fill in that gap. The STC were essentially supercomputers that spat out detailed plans based on the demands the colonists made. Since the STC system itself was not creative, it had several variations on the same design and so it only knows how to make things a certain way and does not innovate. Artificial Intelligence was meant to guide this development so that it was more than just the immediate demands of the colonists that were being factored in… this would prove to be a huge problem, as I will get into later.What truly plunged humanity into a Dark Age, was the Men of Iron: soldiers created by A.I. that developed a hostile intent towards humanity. The constant pressure put on the A.I. to satisfy the long term demands of survival of the human race had the A.I. come to the conclusion that, based on their continual short-sightedness there was no long term future the human race and that any demand they made of the A.I. was now seen as invalid almost by default. The eventual destruction of the Men of Iron necessitated the drastic reduction in A.I. until it was phased out and made illegal strictly as a matter of self defense in the early days of the imperium. With the loss of A.I. to assist in more intricate and advanced technology and the toll the war took on the far-flung human race set the course of technological decline to their present state.Soon, all that was left was what relics from the past age have survived but anything constructed brand new relies upon what remaining STC the imperium maintains and jealously guards.During the Age of Strife, colonies became isolated and the more advanced technologies that STC could not create were no longer accessible. Now, it’s still possible to reverse engineer them at this point and it’s certainly possible that a planet-wide colony can nurture a knowledge base enough to preserve much of what is known, but the period of time lasted so long and the unique machines themselves so rare, that dismantling them for the sake of understanding them was impractical. Absent of deeper understanding, it eventually took on an aspect of superstition.",169 followers,Christopher Barnes,872,7K,7.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Warhammer-40K-If-humanity-cant-make-a-lot-of-advanced-technology-any-more-because-the-knowledge-has-been-lost-what-stops-them-from-reverse-engineering-the-stuff-they-have-to-figure-out-how-it-works

Reverse-engineering is heresy, and heresy is illegal.Finally, the matter of them not having enough stuff to reverse-engineer. Dark Age of Technology tech and, to a lesser extend, Great Crusage-era tech is rare and in demand. They don’t have enough pieces to go around, so reverse-engineering several is not going to happen.

I'm not with the big boys in the CIA but that's a fact!But will you believe me if I told you, during the Antediluvian times (pre-flood) there was way more advanced technology than we will ever have in 50 years maybe. All we strive to attain in technology was easy as breathing for them. Traveling to Mars was as easy as driving to your local store or even walking. They had all technologies we have now plus more including what we see in our sci-fi movies (some). Their Biological makeup was also different and more peaked than ours. From cells to blood and other tissue, which clearly explains why they could live up to 600 + years. (Please I am not being religious here).Their way of thinking was more vivid that they could bring to pass into the natural whatever idea they had, from cars to tech devices to extremely advanced satellites.But as years passed beyond the flood, the bloodline grew weaker and weaker till today.I laugh at our so-called intelligence of today with scientists. If I could add up all human intelligence we have today, it won't match what existed then.Somewhere in the Sahara 4,000 - 6,000 years ago there was some communities that used advanced phones as a means of communication.(I believe an indian historian once said)There was atomic and nuclear power being harvested for energy with ease including Quatum energy. Phones, Artificial Intelligence(more advanced ) robotics. They were most probably a type 2 civilization, how come, strange human objects are being found on Mars? What could explain it?They went there!Building nuclear rockets was like lego to them.And it's that same rocket that was blasted that tilted the earth and caused the flood. Too powerful a force that it rocked the earth violently and broke the crust. Now that is ENERGY!Note before the flood the earth was at 0°, not tilted at all. I don't care what “Science,” tells you.Then why don't we have the same things now you may ask? It could so easily have been so. For those who read the Bible, 'didn't man come together to build the tower of babel to reach heaven?' The intelligence of man again at play again!But that intelligence was lost in time and rapidly degraded. The same Bible predicted an increase in knowledge in these times. And we see it. It took only 64 years to go from horse and buggy to land on the moon! Just that short time! Also, see how AI is rapidly advancing our world.We are making strides but the pace is too slow!2000 years of lost technology under our feet buried in the ground. Less than a percent have been discovered and kept secret. If we can recapture all that superintelligence man once had, we will be heading for the multiverse.I am not a free thinker either, just a man drawn by these things!

Other forms consist of a helix revolving in a fixed cylinder or a helical tube wound around a shaft.The Archimedes Screw is still used today in some limited applications (usually electrically-powered), and can range in size from a quarter of an inch to nearly 4 meters (12 feet) in diameter. A large screw or banks of screws may be used to pump rainstorm runoff or to lift water or wastewater, for example.2.THE BATTERY-The Baghdad Battery, sometimes referred to as the Parthian Battery, is a clay pot which encapsulates a copper cylinder. Suspended in the centre of this cylinder but not touching it is an iron rod. Both the copper cylinder and the iron rod are held in place with an asphalt plug. These artifacts (more than one was found) were discovered during the 1936 excavations of the old village Khujut Rabu, near Baghdad. The village is considered to be about 2000 years old, and was built during the Parthian period (250BC to 224 AD). Although it is not known exactly what the use of such a device would have been, the name ‘Baghdad Battery’, comes from one of the prevailing theories established in 1938 when Wilhelm Konig, the German archaeologist who performed the excavations, examined the battery and concluded that this device was an ancient electric battery. After the Second World War, Willard Gray, an American working at the General Electric High Voltage Laboratory in Pittsfield, built replicas and, filling them with an electrolyte, found that the devices could produce 2 volts of electricity. The question remains, if it really was a battery, what was it used to power?3. THE CALENDAR-Research carried out last year on an ancient site excavated by the National Trust for Scotland in 2004 revealed that it contained a sophisticated calendar system that is approximately 10,000 years old, making it the oldest calendar ever discovered in the world. The site at Warren Field, Crathes, Aberdeenshire – contains a 50 metre long row of twelve pits which were created by Stone Age Britons and which were in use from around 8000 BC (the early Mesolithic period) to around 4,000 BC (the early Neolithic). The pits represent the months of the year as well as the lunar phases of the moon. They were formed in a complex arc design in which each lunar month was divided into three roughly ten day weeks representing the waxing moon, the full moon and the waning moon. It also allowed the observation of the mid-winter sunrise so that the lunar calendar could be recalibrated each year to bring it back in line with the solar year. The entire arc represents a whole year and may also reflect the movements of the moon across the sky.4.STEAM ENGINE-Heron Alexandrinus, otherwise known as the Hero of Alexandria, was a 1st century Greek mathematician and engineer who is known as the first inventor of the steam engine. His steam powered device was called the aeolipile, named after Aiolos, God of the winds. The aeolipile consisted of a sphere positioned in such a way that it could rotate around its axis. Nozzles opposite each other would expel steam and both of the nozzles would generate a combined thrust resulting in torque, causing the sphere to spin around its axis. The rotation force sped up the sphere up to the point where the resistance from traction and air brought it to a stable rotation speed. The steam was created by boiling water under the sphere – the boiler was connected to the rotating sphere through a pair of pipes that at the same time served as pivots for the sphere.Some old steam engines are still used in certain areas of the world and in antique locomotives. However, steam power is still heavily used around the world in various applications. Many modern electrical plants use steam generated by burning coal to produce electricity.5.Earthquake Detector 132 A D -Earthquake Detector 132 A D According to court records of the later Han Dynasty, a seismograph was created by the brilliant inventor Zhang Heng (78-140 AD) in 132 AD. Its function is to determine the direction of an earthquake. In 138 AD, this instrument indicated an earthquake occurring in Longxi a thousand kilometers away. It was the first time that mankind to detect an earthquake. Modern seismographs only began development in 1848 in Europe.6.Paper Money 9th century A.D.-Paper money were first developed by the ancient Chinese, who started using folding money at the end of the 8th or beginning of the 9th century AD. Paper bills were originally used as privately issued bills of credit or exchange notes. A merchant could deposit his cash in the capital, receiving a paper “exchange certificate” which he could exchange for metal coins in other cities.Thanks for scrolling,Sandip bhatnagar.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Warhammer-40K-If-humanity-cant-make-a-lot-of-advanced-technology-any-more-because-the-knowledge-has-been-lost-what-stops-them-from-reverse-engineering-the-stuff-they-have-to-figure-out-how-it-works

But over a ten-year span, the lack of satellites would“We’re quite dependent on satellites for a global view of what’s happening on our planet — and at a time when we really,It’s also worth pointing out that, without satellites, we alsoHope this explanation helps,OKportal Technology","246,849 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Warhammer-40K-If-humanity-cant-make-a-lot-of-advanced-technology-any-more-because-the-knowledge-has-been-lost-what-stops-them-from-reverse-engineering-the-stuff-they-have-to-figure-out-how-it-works
