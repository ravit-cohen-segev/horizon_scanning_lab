Supposedly, this technology was used to help cripple the Iraqi air defense system when the US invaded.This was important to Cisco because we were working in security and cryptography and the NSA was forever trying to get us to corrupt our products so they could un-encrypt foreign transmissions on the fly. One time we were required to corrupt product that had been shipped to China and it started a major debate about our fiduciary responsibility to the country or to the customer. The issue was that if you sell a security product that you know is corrupted, you are knowingly committing fraud and are liable. As the Product Manager at the time I asked the NSA if they would stand behind us (and me as I might be personally liable) in court if we were discovered. Of course the answer from the NSA was “Hell no.”We were on our own. We then entered into a long debate about how to detect Easter eggs and other corruption introduced into security products unknowingly through another vendor’s corrupted hardware. The issue was never resolved but it should be known that our security source code HAD to be provided to the NSA in order to get FIPS certification and they made certain changes to it.So to answer your question, USA military technology is advanced far beyond anyone’s knowledge to describe the extent.On the other hand, the Chinese probably know more about our technology than we do since they perpetrated the greatest security breach in history by compromising the RSA key technology used by almost everyone in the world. We only learned of it through the vigilance of Lockheed-Martin who discovered the breach accidentally.

Even it was our first hackthon. Before I begin with my experience I would like to share that we are enrolled in Bachelor of Technology course in computer science and are currently in theI have subscribed to Hackathon.com mailing list and get updates for hackathons happening near me. Through this I got to know Paytm was organising its first hackathon and the ticket was free of cost. The only eligibility being here was to propose a lucrative idea(that throws a great impact on Indians) and explain how you would use Paytm APIs with it.So I was ready with an idea and called 3 of my peers to come up as a team, who further contributed towards polishing the idea. No later, we gave our proposal and mailed the organiser personally elaborating the idea. The day later we got a mail from the organiser. He found our idea really interesting and asked for our applications. Soon we got theMy Team:The rightmost guy in this picture is me. The other guy is Prateek Arora and from the girls are Nikita Taneja and Nidhi Chhillar.As soon as we reached the Paytm’s office we were astonished by looking at the crowd there. We found ourselves as theWe took photographs, interacted with staff and no later, we were taken to our workspaces and were asked to settle ourselves. Caffeine stalls were set all over. Food and snacks were also arranged by the organisers itself. The thing began with some introductions and overview of their APIs. Some already started to code while some were taking part in whatever was happening on stage. We decided toAfter an hour or two,Apart from coding stuff, we met some smart peeps over there and discussed our ideas with them. Most of the teams were corporate ones. Some came to launch their startups with well-versed marketing strategies too. All in all, it was a great learning process interacting with such people.Some hours later, guys fromWe went back to our workspaces and resumed with the code stuff. Our work was totally based onAll we brought with us was some learning, some new experience, gained some knowledge from smart fellows, new skills and ofcourse not to forget the Hackathon Swag and our small-but-engouraging achievement:Here’s what we call Hackathon Swag!Just wanted to end with saying that,Needless to say, Hackathons can change your perspective towards coding, for good. Period.UPDATE: Got a few requests about what our idea was. We intended to build a peer teaching app, where anyone with a knack or skill could sign up as a teacher and can earn part-time at their own convenience. Any student who wishes to gain knowledge or guidance on a particular subject can get a teacher on per minute basis. (Charges would be as low as Rs 2/min). The app will look for all teachers nearby and will match their expertise that the student desires for. Could prove of great help during last moment studies.We are still working on the project. Still a lot of challenges are yet to be tackled.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,2.3K,996,156M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Does-Arthur-C-Clarkes-third-law-Any-sufficiently-advanced-technology-is-indistinguishable-from-magic-bug-you-Does-it-mean-that-not-understanding-the-process-of-say-understanding-how-a-TV-is-impossible-for-someone-to
