All of these are ionizing radiation and will hurt you in sufficient quantities.However, these high-speed particles are all relatively easy to capture and shield. For example, a foot of plain old water will capture 99% of the neutrons (but you may need 8′ of water to capture enough to make it safe — and it should be pure water — see below).

This may make some of the hit elements radioactive and they can produce all kinds of radioactivity.Let’s say you chrome plated your reactor. An absorbed neutron would turn Cr-50 into Cr-51, which is radioactive and emits gamma rays with a 27 day half-life. So, don’t chrome plate your reactor!The solution is judicious use of elements much less susceptible to neutron and other bombardment. A reactor designer might use elements that require a single atom to capture 9 or 10 neutrons before becoming radioactive (such as copper and aluminum).If the shield is made with an appropriate liquid, another way is to filter out partially bombarded atoms before they become radioactive. For example, in a water based shield, filter out deuterium atom before they capture another neutron and turn into tritium.Original Question: What type of radiation is produced in a nuclear fusion reaction?",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,202.4M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-type-of-radiation-is-produced-in-a-nuclear-fusion-reaction

These are the ones where non-technical people say “All you have to do is…” or “Why don’t they just…?” and in the case of politicians demand credit while leaving other people to deal with boring details like scientific fundamentals.Hydrogen. It burns to pure water. No CO2. No global warming. No pollution. Why did nobody think of it before? Why have we been burning coal for electricity and running cars on gasoline when we could have been using hydrogen?The fundamental deep ignorance was to suppose that hydrogen could simply be magicked out of thin air, or at least water. (See questions on Quora along the lines of “as water contains hydrogen, why don’t they just…?”)So why did all these chemists and engineers not see what a politician could grasp? Why have we been digging coal and pumping oil and gas, when you can make hydrogen from water?The answer is that when you burn hydrogen the product is water, plus the energy value as a fuel. To make hydrogen you have to unburn the water. And how much energy does that take? The same amount? Close, but not right. The same amount and more. No matter how clever the chemistry or physics, you will have to put in more energy than you take out, thanks to rules of the universe called thermodynamics.Hydrogen is not a free lunch.It is technically feasible to run all our power stations, vehicles and ships on hydrogen.If we had hydrogen! For example if natural gas was hydrogen instead of methane. But it isn’t. We have to make it from something else, using energy. So instead the hydrogen we need is mainly got from methane by some chemistry, which produces CO2. (Both by the main process and the extra methane you have to burn in order to get the energy. Neither of these processes are 100% efficient.)So every litre of water coming from your green and virtuous hydrogen car has already released more CO2 than it would if you had run it on methane.Very little is produced by electrolysis of water, because this requires even more energy. (It is more efficient to convert methane into hydrogen chemically than to burn the methane to make electricity and then electrolyse water.)This is generally answered by vague hand-waving about renewable energy, as if solar panels and wind farms were free. However, if you do have low-cost electricity why not use it to directly power electric trains and trams, and charge up batteries for cars? Cut out the middle bit.Hydrogen has some possibilities as a means of transmission of energy, but is not, repeat NOT an energy source.With enough determination it could be used on vehicles to limit local pollution (but not global) and this may happen in some areas, mainly from political reasons (and the influence of industries on politicians).It can be mixed with natural gas, or even replace it (though it is much harder to prevent leaks compared with natural gas.) And if it is made from natural gas, why bother?The main theoretical possibility comes from a breakthrough in nuclear fusion which would produce large amounts of energy at low cost. Hydrogen might be a possible way of using some of this energy. More immediately it could replace the vast use of hydrogen to manufacture ammonia (and thus fertilizers which feed more than a quarter of the world’s population) and in industry, reducing the current CO2 production involved in nearly all of it.Hydrogen can be got from microbes, (it is a common component of farts) or by direct thermal splitting of water from solar power but not in the immense quantities required at an economic rate.I am personally concerned about the safety implications of large-scale use of hydrogen. (To the extent that I am a contributing author to a technical paper on the subject. That is, we have considered the technical requirements, known possibilities of failure and done the calculations on the consequences. I also know someone in the hydrogen business who has witnessed a test release of a large amount of liquid hydrogen as an experiment to see what could happen in an accident.)","51,719 followers",Chris Ebbert,1.1K,11.4K,278.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-type-of-radiation-is-produced-in-a-nuclear-fusion-reaction

The clothes were washed in gasoline and then dried in large rotary dryers before being pressed. Laundry was an extremely hazardous operation. In around 1880 the 4-stroke Otto engine for autos started to appear and while at first they used benzene or ligroin, an industrial solvent, it became apparent that gasoline was the best fuel. In 1890 the “hit or miss” engine, a one-cylinder, magneto powered flywheel driven portable gas motor was developed and it revolutionized farming. While people were experimenting with cars, farmers were buying one-hit engines by the thousands. The cheap engine was worth a dozen farm hands - and it used gasoline to run (though it could also run on kerosene). The impact of the one-lung, hit or miss engine cannot be underestimated because its invention required hardware stores to stock the new product “gasoline” which was how car drivers were able to get it. It wasn’t until the cracking process was perfected in 1913 by Standard Oil that gasoline in gas station pumps became practical. Until then, there was a battle between farmers and auto enthusiasts for gasoline.The one-lung engine was perfected by Wilbur and Orville Wright who were seeking a cheap way of powering the machines in their bicycle-cum-airplane shop. The One Lung Engine popped up all over the world and was one of the most useful gasoline powered tools ever made. They powered everything from log splitters to power saws to ice cream makers to washing machines and because of the flywheel, were extremely efficient. They could run an entire day, without stopping, on less than a gallon of gasoline because of the momentum stored up in the flywheel - the spark plug only fired when the machine began to slow down. However, the development of these machines put gasoline on the road to being the fuel of choice for automobiles. One lung engines are keenly sought after by collectors today. Production stopped in 1940.The world’s first gas station was built in St Louis in 1907. It took a few years for the concept to catch on and even by 1913 there were probably fewer than 10 gas stations in the US.This is not the first station as no photos exist of the first station but this is similar to what it looked like, taken in 1911. The purpose built gasoline pump came out in 1911 and was pumped by hand from a reservoir. Gas was 27 cents a gallon, which is the equivalent of about $7.75 per gallon today. Gasoline cars on average could achieve 15 miles per gallon. Henry Ford’s first Model T factory was built in Cambridge, MA in 1911 and was the first completely integrated vertical manufacturing plant in the world. Through 1929, this plant produced more cars than all of Detroit. The building is still there but is a biolab now.America does drill for its own oil. The US is the number 3 producer of oil in the world behind Saudi Arabia and Russia. It produces 9.4 million barrels of oil per day. It imports about 9 million barrels of oil a day as well. It also exports 8.5 million barrels a day of oil and gas and other petroleum products. A barrel is 42 gallons. The US is by far the world’s biggest consumer of oil in the world at nearly 20 million barrels of oil per day. China is the second biggest consumer and consumes a little more than half what the US consumes. America imports oil from 73 nations and exports to 176 nations and organizations. It costs 500,000 dollars to insure a single oil tanker traveling from point A to point B with oil, a cost which has risen from 100,000 in just two years because of world tensions. Russia has attacked oil tankers delivering oil to the Ukraine at least twice so far.Oil is a commodity and is traded on a futures market, that is, bought and sold based on what the price WILL be in the future. Because it is a commodity, the concept of “oil independence” is not completely correct in thinking about oil production. Oil production is by far the biggest industrial operation in the world today and produces the highest revenues. A single 42 gallon barrel of oil produces almost 6 million BTUs, far and away the best, cheapest and biggest bang for the buck of any producer of energy. It is better than solar, wind, nuclear, coal - anything - and by a huge margin, which is why it is so difficult to replace.Most oil produced is “cracked” (refined) into gasoline. A 42 gallon barrel of oil renders about 20 gallons of gasoline, 15 gallons of diesel and the rest as chemicals, kerosene, and tar. The US consumes almost 9 million barrels of gasoline per day, a major increase over the previous year by 12 percent. There are currently 521 major oil towers (rotary drill) wells in operation, a 247 percent increase over the last year of Trump, but way below the record number of rigs in operation, which was over 1100 during the Obama Administration in 2011.The current price of oil is 110 dollars a barrel versus 85 dollars a barrel in 2021 on average.Oil is broken down into types based on sulphur content, the best being called “sweet” (low sulphur) and “sour” (high sulphur). Amost 60 percent of the oil produced in the US is the most desirable kind, called “Light Sweet Crude”. The heavier or more sour an oil is, the more resources it requires to drill it, pump it and refine it. The US is broken in 6 oil pumping regions by volume, proven reserves and difficulty of access. The East Coast is nearly negligible in production; nearly half comes from the Gulf Coast. Oil is priced in barrels by desirability with West Texas Intermediate being about the best the US can produce; when looking at the price of oil per barrel, Brent is usually the benchmark because it is among the most desirable, least sulphorus and easiest to access oil.Pumping oil is not free. Some percentage of each price of a barrel of oil is used just to pump the oil out of the ground. On average, it costs about 25 dollars a barrel to produce a barrel. The costs remain the same regardless of the number of barrels produced. That’s why oil companies shut down wells when oil price collapse. The nation with the highest cost to produce (by far) is England which is reaching the end of its reserves. The cheapest is Saudi Arabia at about 10 dollars a barrel. The US is in the middle, about 25 dollars a barrel.The kind of oil, be it sweet, sour, oil sand or whatever determines its cost to produce. Over the past 100 years, the price per barrel of extraction has increased 3 times as oil becomes harder to find and extract. The dirtier an oil is, the more expensive it is, with oil sands among the most expensive to produce. When oil prices fall, the first operations to cease are oil sand operations (unless considered strategic and propped up by government).Fracking had a major impact on oil and gas production because it is so cheap to produce that a separate category had to be made to keep it from affecting the average price. The US is the world leader in fracking.SummaryAmerica is the 3rd largest producer of oil in the world. Oil is the biggest industry in the world. The cost of producing oil is about 1/4 the price. America imports as much oil and gas as it exports. Oil is a commodity priced based on what the future is expected to hold for demand and fear.","1,135 followers",TANKER JOHN,1.6K,505,6.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-the-United-States-drilled-for-its-own-oil-would-it-possibly-have-enough-to-last-for-a-few-hundred-years-especially-in-Alaska
