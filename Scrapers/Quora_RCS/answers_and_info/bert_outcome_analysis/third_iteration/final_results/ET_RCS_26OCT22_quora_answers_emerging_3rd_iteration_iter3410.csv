If not then have a look at these pictures.If you are thinking that these images have been edited, then let me tell you one thing: that these are real.Crown shynessThe effect usually occurs between trees of the same species and sometimes between different species.One theory assumes a tree's leaves can feel when they are approaching another tree. Once they sense a nearing neighbor, the growing process halts, ensuring that light can penetrate the canopy and photosynthesis continue.Another possible explanation is that this is a defense mechanism against leaf-eating insects. The gaps mean bugs wouldn't be able to reach other trees, impeding their spread.The next time you're out walking through the forest, take a moment to look above you and you might be pleasantly surprised by what you find.Edit 1: Thanks Robert Taylor for the correction.Edit 2: Thank you all for your love, affection, and kind comments.",241 followers,Sonali Kerketta,22.4K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-lesser-known-new-and-highly-advanced-technologies-in-online-shopping

I have lived in Dubai for 5 years, and these stores were on sale all 365 days a year. Even after their so called “discount”, the items on display can cost you more than, what your hotel stay might.If you want to shop for electronics, keep an eye out for GITEX, which is an electronics fair where you get double value for money for everything you shop (Eg, when you buy a DSLR camera, you get one or 2 lenses, tripod, memory cards and a camera bag free) This event happens twice a year, and one in Autumn had better deals when I compared(I could be wrong, after all I’m not a market research analyst). It’s not necessary to attend the fair itself, but you can visit the show rooms of participating retailers to get similar deals.Gold is cheaper in Dubai, one of the important notes for Indian shoppers :)You get pretty real looking knock offs of Designer bags and even perfumes for a much cheaper price in Karama, Meena Bazaar and at Dragon Mart. Meena Bazaar is also the pit stop for spices and all things indigenous to this region.Talking about Dragon Mart, it’s your one stop shopping destination for all things beautiful and budget friendly. Furniture/home decor/car furnishing/clothes/accessories/party stuff/stuff you didn’t know you needed - you name it, I’m sure Dragon Mart has it. It’s kinda like the street vendors in Hong Kong, put together in a gigantic shopping mall.Huge stores named “Day to Day”, has items priced AED 10 or below, and makes a good place to buy travel souvenirs and again little little things that you didn’t know you needed. I once bought a flower shaped dye to make eggs sunny side up in and multicolored pens. I don’t like my eggs sunny side up. Neither do I use colored pens at work. So avoid “Day to Day”, if you are an impulsive shopper like me :)","68,791 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-lesser-known-new-and-highly-advanced-technologies-in-online-shopping

Our helicopters fly in the worst weather, making rescues from boats or water while waves are higher than the choppers. We have lost choppers making rescues. Our Rescue swimmers are in the water making the rescues in 50 foot waves in 30° temps. If the chopper is filled the swimmer stays behind until they come back. If a smallboat goes out in the same weather the rescues become harrowing. We do boardings in this weather. If a ship comes in and is suspect for weapons or bombs, we have teams that board at sea by helicopter or small boat, usually 50 miles out. We have harbor protection teams, we have SRT teams, Sea Marshals and people sent to Camp LeJune to be trained by Marines. We have people that are SEAL qualified. We also have snipers that fly by helicopter to shoot out boat engines on fast boats, and submarines that drug dealers use. The Coast Guard has more Special Forces units than any other branch. They fall under our DOG team (Deployable Operations Group). This includes our MSRT Team, our MSST Team, PSO's, our NSF or National Strike Force, TAClet and HITRON, our mobilized Helicopter sniper units. All of these units require 12 hour deployment times. They work hand in hand with all of the military's Spec. Forces. They require Tier 1 physical fitness tests. Being that we can work with civilian law enforcement and we are Homeland Security, we can deploy with either military or civilian special teams. The physical fitness tests are mostly the equivalent to the FBI tests with much more swimming. These people are some of the best in the world at what they do and are very selective. As with the rest of the Coast Guard. These are some of the teams that nobody knows about. People forget that we are 24/7 even when there is no war.Yes, we are overseas any place foreign national ships that are headed to the US. If we feel that they have drugs, weapons, drugs or bombs and they have to be boarded, we have special boarding teams on board the Navy ship. We “take over the ship,”temporarily because anybody boarding the ship other than the Coast Guard can constitute an act of war. We run up the Coast Guard Ensign on the Coast Guard ensign. Then we take a smallboat filled with a CG Boarding Party and board. We also have CG inspectors in ports around the world that check items packed to come to the US. They do safety inspections on gear being sent back to the US on freighters. Military equipment, explosives, vehicles etc all have to be checked. This is only part of it. We send Coasties to other countries to train their Coast Guards. That includes Greece and other Mediterranean countries, even ports in Russia. We have people living on oil rigs in the middle east protecting them. We also have small boats that patrol those harbors to protect our Navy ships. We had a Coastie on board a smallboat that intercepted a smallboat that would not stop. He managed to get between it and the Navy boat before it exploded. He was killed with everybody on board the encroaching boat. This is part of what we do around the world and at home. I hope I have helped give you a partial idea of what we do.

It’s probably about as close as anyone has done it. His name is Jesus Yanez (photo below) and various life events took him on this unusual path.

In 1999, he then joined the Navy and served as a Master at Arms.Fast forward a couple years to 2001 after the September 11th attacks he really wanted to deploy and do his part so he requested a transfer to the Army. However, he was trained as a wheeled vehicle mechanic and his unit did not deploy during this time. Still having the deployment itch, Jesus requested another transfer to the Air Force in 2006 and joined the 204th Security Forces Squadron.

On January 17, 1966, while carrying out one of these missions, a U.S. B-52 plane containing four hydrogen bombs exploded and its cargo rained down on the Spanish village of Palomares. Each bomb was capable of producing an explosion 70 times that of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.The explosion occurred while the plane was performing a mid-air refueling with a KC-135. The nozzle of the refueling boom struck the B-52 fuselage sparking the blast. All four men on the KC-135, and three of the seven men on the B-52 were killed.Debris rained down on Palomares, but no person or building was struck. The conventional explosives of two of the hydrogen bombs had detonated and released a cloud of plutonium that spread over residential and farm land. Locals were the first to locate the bombs, and without knowledge of what they actually were, approached the bombs without fear. One resident even kicked one of the bombs, and when military officials arrived, their Geiger counters went nuts when they tested his shoe.To reassure fears of a nuclear holocaust, the Spanish Minister of Tourism and the U.S. ambassador, Angier Biddle Duke, swam in waters around Palomares in front of the press. I personally would have liked to have seen them eat a tomato, but apparently people were satisfied with seeing these guys swim in an area that had not been contaminated.The third bomb landed in a riverbed but did not explode. The fourth bomb was missing for the next 80 days, causing international uproar. The possession of a U.S. atomic bomb would have been, um,After the accident, a portion of the missing bomb's parachute was located, and it was determined the bomb had washed out to sea. Twenty-eight U.S. Navy ships and 150 divers were deployed to help in the search. The UK’s RAF provided aerial surveillance of the suspected retrieval site, all while Soviet ships and subs watched close by.The bomb was located about 2,500 feet below the surface on the slope of an undersea canyon. In March, the Navy recovered the bomb, but they dropped it and it landed 3,000 feet below surface. On April 7th, an unmanned sub was sent to retrieve the slippery bomb, but it became entangled in the bomb's parachute. In the end, it was decided to rescue the sub, which would then pull up the bomb by its tether.The United States’ recovery efforts were successful due to a local fisherman who saw the bomb enter the water and assisted the Navy in locating it. When the bomb was returned to America the fisherman sued the U.S. for salvage rights. Under maritime law, salvage rights entitle the finder to a small percentage of the item's worth. The hydrogen bomb was valued at several billion dollars so the fisherman could expect millions of dollars. The Air Force settled the suit for an undisclosed amount, but the poor fisherman claimed to have never received compensation.The clean-up was extensive but even today repercussions are apparent. Radioactivity is still measured in some animals, and there has been a slight (so slight it might not be related) rise in cancer among the local population. However, among clean-up personnel there has been a marked rise in cancer.Today a fence surrounds the site where one of the damaged bombs fell.

19,"I suppose it is possible. It is difficult, maybe impossible, to prove anything is impossible. I think it is more likely that the Flying Spahetti Monster is using his noodly appendages to interfere with research at CERN to deny us new physics, because he would rather our efforts were directed to creating new pasta recipes. Actually I dislike the term new physics, just because we have not yet discovered something yet does not make it new.","220,602 followers",Franklin Veaux,679,47.3K,782.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-lesser-known-new-and-highly-advanced-technologies-in-online-shopping

23,"There is actually zero credible evidence of highly advanced ancient technologies.There is massively overwhelming evidence of ancient technologies…but, not highly advanced technologies such as implied.Much of the misinterpretation of ancient “technology”, stems from seeing an antiquity, and, interpreting in light of modern technology.A good example of that is finding a jar that could be made into a battery…because it had a shape and holes in the right place…and CONCLUDING that the ancient civilization had electricity…using that battery.When these ancient “batteries” were analyzed, to see if theThere is actually zero credible evidence of highly advanced ancient technologies.There is massively overwhelming evidence of ancient technologies…but, not highly advanced technologies such as implied.Much of the misinterpretation of ancient “technology”, stems from seeing an antiquity, and, interpreting in light of modern technology.A good example of that is finding a jar that could be made into a battery…because it had a shape and holes in the right place…and CONCLUDING that the ancient civilization had electricity…using that battery.When these ancient “batteries” were analyzed, to see if they HAD contained battery acid or other evidence of actual use as a battery, it was found they did not…they were used for foods, and, we could tell which foods, and, why the holes and shape made sense for THAT usage, etc.So, some people ignored the evidence that did not support their worldview…and, kept spreading the false information about ancient technologies.Other people fell for it for the same reasons, and, a population of misinformed people grew…further unintentionally propagating the misinformation.And, finally, evolution is the RESULT of the influences…as it doesn't exist as a force or entity…it is just the result of the selection pressures that the environment represented.:D","220,602 followers",Franklin Veaux,7.8K,47.3K,782.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-lesser-known-new-and-highly-advanced-technologies-in-online-shopping
