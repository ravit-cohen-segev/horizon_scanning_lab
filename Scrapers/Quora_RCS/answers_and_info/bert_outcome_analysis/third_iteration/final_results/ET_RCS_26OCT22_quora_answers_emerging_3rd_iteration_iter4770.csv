That alone should makes the US light-years ahead in military development, right?Well, not quite. Just like any bodily institution on Earth, the US Armed Forces has its own budgeting problem.Usually, it’s a foreign policy problem though.See, the budget for the US military doesn’t just go to tech-development inside the country. It has to go to maintain their global military presence as well. Such case isn’t the case with Russia where they only have small overseas presence in countries such as Central African Republic and Syria.What’s more to add is head-to-head military confrontation between major power is a thing of the past and it will probably be nothing to be concerned of.Let me ask you something. When was the last time you saw Russian Mig-29 having a dogfight with American F-15 in real life? Pretty sure even if you do, it was a mock dogfight in an airshow.Why is that the case? Because a war between Russia and USA is a war that will never come. Thus making an arms race pointless.Like i said, it’s kind of useless to compare Russian and US military because it’s they’re the same on the surface only.The US who seek to be the dominant power on the global stage will always be ahead with its aircraft carrier fleet to which is in line with its gargantuan budget.On the other hand, Russia who has smaller money to spend always prefer to go with nuclear submarine which is while not as impressive, will still makes any foreign forces think twice before having a conflict with Russia.That’s all i can say for now.

9,"TL;DR:Many parts for Russian high-tech weapons just became unavailable.TL;DR:Many parts for Russian high-tech weapons just became unavailable.Now let's look at what's available today.Start with the Air Forces.The US has over 170 fifth-generation fighters (F-22) deployed, for many years, whereas Russia just reduced their purchase order for PAK FA from 56 to 12, over the next few years (total, not each year). PAK FA is the first Russian stealth fighter, and was designed for frontal stealth, whereas F-22 has all-around stealth. Apparently, PAK FA radars and engine have not been finalized yet.Russia does not have carrier-based fighters with stealth, and no plans for them. The US designed a carrier-based variant of F-35, which is in production (other variants are already dropping bombs). In addition to this F-35C fighter (the Navy version), there is F-35B with vertical take-off and landing (the Marine version). Russia never had such fighters and has no plans for them.Heat-seekers for all of Russia's air-to-air missiles were produced in Ukraine (the Arsenal factory in Kyiv) and won't be delivered in the foreseeable future.Russia has no strategic stealth bombers and none are planned for production, whereas the US has over a dozen B-2 bombers whose radar cross-section is comparable to that of a small bird.To see which planes and helos Russia is flying and how reliable the Russian Air Force is, we list the recent crashes, many with the loss of lives.Except for Su-34 and Mi-28, these birds are old to very old (Mi-28 crashed during a demonstration flight at a show). The crashes are apparently due to the lack of trained pilots and technicians, lack of reliable service, as well as Russian-made parts. There is no war in those regions, and usually not even a forest fire. Those planes were not attacked. With so many crashes in peacetime, can you imagine what the losses would be in wartime?How many crashes did the much larger US Air Force have during the same period? One - a single-seat F-16 in South Carolina collided with a Cessna (not clear whose fault it was, but the F-16 pilot ejected successfully). Even during a much longer period, the US Air Force did not have so many crashes, despite having many more airplanes.​​Apparently, the last Russian Tu-95 crashed because of insufficient fuel after failed aerial refueling. The pilots thought they'd make it back, but miscalculated their fuel needs. Here's a Tu-95 for you, designed in the 1950s.​Russia has experienced a number of missile failures in 2015 - including air-defense and ballistic missiles that crashed or blew up on launch.Russia's transport aviation is largely outdated and too small to deploy large forces quickly. The heavy IL-76 can land in very few places, but the bulk of the planes are old An-26s that have not been upgraded in the last 20 years. Russia failed to produce mid-size transports. The delivery of new An-140 planes in 2015 was cancelled because Ukraine halted the supply of critical components.Russia's helicopter manufacturing was in a great shape until 2014, when the engines supplied from Ukraine became unavailable. Russia can produce helicopter engines, but not nearly as many as Ukraine and not at the same cost. So, now Russia has to redesign the most popular helicopters (such as the old Soviet-designed Mi-8). Moreover, it was just announced (On to the Navies.The US has ten aircraft carrier strike groups, while Russia has none (and only one aircraft carrier, with no construction in progress). The US is about to launch a new carrier class with many technological innovations:Russia's Navy ships are very specialized (and there are relatively few of them). For example, current anti-submarine ships carry only torpedos and air-defense equipment, but cannot target surface ships and on-shore installations. In contrast, most US Navy ships support a variety of functions and perform them well. The main difference is that for many years Russia did not allocate sufficient funds for Navy upgrades.At the 2015 Navy day, a missile cruiser failed to launch a missile in front of Putin in Baltiysk, while in Sevastopol a similar launch has gone haywire, as seen in these two videosOther high-tech military hardwareRussia's semiconductor industry is far behind the US, Taiwan, Japan, Western Europe, Israel, China, Malaysia and Singapore (especially in digital electronics).

A Fighter variant, a “Bomber” variant (higher bomb payload) and a VTOL/ carrier variant. This program got a boatload of flak for costing something in the $15Bn range I think and taking many many delays. But ultimately it’s a very capable fighter. It is stealthy, has new avionics and systems that help pilots fly and fight better and has networking capabilities which would allow manned unmanned teaming.F-18 Growler an electronic warfare version of the F-18. It can jam comms, Jam Radar suppress enemy electronics and can takeoff and land on an aircraft carrier.The P-8 Poseidon here is a modified 737 that is used for submarine hunting and maritime reconnaissance.^Bell V-280 Valor future troop transport aircraftit will have a longer range than the V-22 and will be fasterThis is stuff that is already more or less available.

We just know it exists and that it has been tested.I will close with this^Ford class carrier.Bigger, more efficient, better aircraft launch systems, which use electromagnetic current instead of steam, smaller crews, and modular so it can add future tech as it comes out. The ship will be capable of projecting power for decades and is expected to be produced into 2058….So yeah the US has been advancing a lot in the last 20 years and this is just the surface of the aviation aspect of flight.

If they do not have the tech that they claim, then it would take totally different plans, strategies, and tactics to beat them.You might say “Just make the plan assuming that they do have that tech, then if they don’t we’ll have extra capabilities that we don’t need, but we will still have our old capabilities also.” But this isn’t true. While the U.S. does give our military a lot of resources, they are still not infinite. If we devote resources to counter-tech abilities, then we will have less basic offensive ability. Troops will have to carry equipment that they end up not needing, which will mean that they either move slower, or carry less ammo and body armor. If we face Russians with AKs and no fancy tech, then we will want every round of ammo and and every plate of body armor that we can get. If we have fancy tech-jamming gear they we don’t use, our troops will really miss that ammo and armor. The same for vehicles. Each vehicle has an engine that can only move so much weight, a suspension that can support only so much weight, a hull which can only contain so much volume. If we cram it full of tech-jamming equipment that we end up not using, that means less armor on the vehicle, less ammo in the vehicle, and the vehicle will be slower.Russia gains a lot of advantage by lying about their technological capabilities. And, in fact, they actuallyThe U.S. is not doing that. When we say that we are working on developing a new technology, we are actually doing that. We might start a development project, and then it fails, but that isn’t a lie, it is an error.When the U.S. develops a new weapon system, or other military technology, we test it extensively, mostly to make sure that it is highly reliable, and we make sure that we can scale up production to equip our entire force. That is slow and difficult, and expensive. But, when complete, it provides our entire force with reliable dependable equipment. Well, most of the time. Ask any veteran, and he or she can tell you about times when this system failed, and really crappy stuff got issued. But at least we’re trying. Is Russia even doing that? Probably not. Extensive testing and redesigning isConsider the program to convert the entire infantry element of the U.S. Marine Corp from the M4 Carbine to the M27 IAR. The IAR is an amazing rifle, on the inside. On the outside, it looks so similar to the M4 that it would be easy to not notice that it is a different gun. But the IAR is designed to be able to maintain sustained fire through multiple mag changes without overheating or fouling. It can absorb much more heat than an M4 without failing. Ok, the M249 SAW can absorb even more heat than the M27 IAR, but the M27 weighs 7.9 lbs empty, and the M249 weighs 17lbs empty. The M27 has about 80% of the sustained-fire ability as an M249, and weighs less than half as much!Previous Marine Corp doctrine is to equip each 8-person infantry squad with 2 M249s, and the rest of the squad with M4s. The new doctrine is to equip the entire squad with M27s. This makes every single Marine in the squad able to lay down suppressive fire like an old M249 operator, and so now they can each take turns doing that job. This is Brilliant! This is the future! This jumps our abilities ahead by more than a decade of advancement!But improved heat absorption/dispersion isn’t fancy. It isn’t exciting to civilians. Its still an infantry rifle. You point it at the enemy, pull the trigger, and it goes “bang”. It isn’t like some fancy space-age power armor. But, despite how boring it appears as an advance, this is a real war-winner. Distributing suppression-fire ability among the whole squad is absolutely going to make our troops more effective, in a real and meaningful way.That is a technological advance worth getting excited about, and while it comes from Germany, it is getting implemented right here in the “good ol’ U.S. of A.”","220,611 followers",Franklin Veaux,2.8K,47.3K,782.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Russia-making-all-these-technological-advances-for-their-military-and-it-seems-like-the-US-isnt-doing-anything

The AK-74 is a perfectly good design, but until recently, you didn’t see Russian troops using optics, lasers/lights, ergonomic furniture, or anything like that to improve the handling capabilities and shooting performance, except among its Spetsnaz units. This is something that the US and Western militaries started doing almost two decades ago as a cheap, effective way to improve Infantry performance.However, there are some weapons systems that the Russians have always had a certain “head start” in, like Air Defense systems. Russia also was the first country to build a dedicated attack helicopter, and its most recent aircraft continue to show excellent performance.The reason that there doesn’t seem like much forward impetus from the United States’ defense industry right now is that they’re looking to find the next big “leap” in battlefield innovation that will keep them ahead of their competitors and enemies. Russia is following in the US’ footsteps on a lot of projects, “catching up,” in some aspects, and in others taking on projects that the US has decided weren’t worth the development costs, or were considered too risky.Take Russia’s ground-based combat drones. The Uran-9 is the size of a car, armored to a certain extent, armed with a 30mm cannon, 7.62 GPMG, and 8 ATGMs. Why is Russia spending money on a heavily-armed, remote-controlled armored car? Because of their experiences in Chechnya, they hope to overcome their deficiencies in their Infantry units and combined arms tactics with remote weapons. The US doesn’t need to do this, because their Infantry are trained to an excellent standard. Therefore, they have no need for a remote-control mini-tank. Well, not yet, anyway.

Texas Instruments, Martin Marietta, Intel, McDonald Douglas, Hughes, The 25th largest defense electronic contractor does 2.2B.It’s always shocking when people assume that a country like Russia is really out pacing the USA in cutting edge technology. Russia used to get the optics for many of it’s systems from the Ukraine and the west but currently they’re in some hot water with both of those groups for their actions in the Crimea so they can’t even build half the designs they talk about. Still people on the internet and sometimes even the press report about Russia’s new capabilities even though have never actually existed and might never exist as more than a prototype. They couldn’t even sail a single aircraft carrier to the Mediterranean without it breaking down. The USA has almost 2 dozen aircraft carriers with 4–7 always at sea, when was the last time you heard about one needing a tow?In the USA we have a much higher degree of accountability and transparency. The stuff we say we’re building, actually gets built.Why would anyone put much credibility in the propaganda of a country that used to set up fake towns along their railroads in order to fool visitors into thinking they were much more prosperous than they are? Somehow people want to believe that Russia is getting more out of their military money than the USA despite lagging behind in virtually every aspect of technology… Really?Military spending is sort of cumulative. The gear/training you buy this year stays around for 5–50 years or longer. The USA has been massively outspending Russia for 70 years.In reality, even if Russia somehow multiplied their military spending by 10–15 times it would likely be 40–50 years before they could catch up to the US and probably because of the HUGE technology gap they would still be behind. They would also be bankrupt. Most of the people reading this would have died of natural causes long before then and there’s no way possible for Russia to even triple the budget.","62,885 followers",Jay Bazzinotti,2.5K,22.2K,179.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Russia-making-all-these-technological-advances-for-their-military-and-it-seems-like-the-US-isnt-doing-anything

17,"Yes, broadly speaking, Russia is decades ahead of the US in missile technology. Russian air defense systems like the S-400, Tor and Pantsir are the best in the world at their respective tasks. The S-400 can handle up to 80 different targets at ranges of up to 250 miles. The only comparable system in the world is America’s AEGIS used in its destroyers and cruisers, however there is no other land-based system capable of matching the S-400. The Tor and Buk are both point defense systems that can be tethered to the S-400 and integrated with it.

The Tor and Buk are both point defense systems that can be tethered to the S-400 and integrated with it. They are designed primarily to defend military installations against cruise missiles and other munitions. There are no comparable systems in the West.Russia’s Iskander missile is by far the most advanced tactical, ballistic missile on the planet. It is capable of striking targets, including moving targets, to within 5 m despite the fact that the missile travels at mach 7 and maneuvers violently in flight to throw off air defenses. Ground-launched variants of the Iskander are believed to have a range of 1000 km, over 3x as much as the US’s equivalent: the ATACMS missile It is also the basis for the Kinzhal air-launched hypersonic missile.Russia is also the first country to deploy an air-breathing, hypersonic cruise missile: the Zircon. The missile is capable of reaching speeds of mach 9, with a range of 1000 km. Although the Zircon has already entered service with the Russian armed forces, the US estimates that it will be about a decade before they deploy a similar missile.Lastly, Russia is about 2 decades ahead of the US in ICBMs. Russia has a mixed fleet of lighter, solid-fuel, road-mobile ICBMs and heavier, liquid-fuel, silo-based ICBMs. Road mobile ICBMs like the RS-24 Yars are far more useful in the event of a nuclear deterrent, because their mobility makes them far more difficult to target than silo-based ICBMs. The Yars can carry up to 6 warheads. However, it’s payload is not just limited to nuclear warheads. It can also carry EMP warheads and precision-guided, conventional warheads, which are designed to replace tactical nuclear weapons for many applications.The SS-18 Satan is the backbone of Russia’s silo-based rocket forces. It’s liquid-fuel design allows it to be far larger and carry a far heavier payload than a solid-fuel rocket. As such, it can carry more warheads. While it is limited to carrying 10 nuclear warheads by treaty, it can carry up to 38 precision-guided, conventional warheads, enough to decimate any air or naval base, anywhere on the planet without going nuclear.Russia is also ahead of the US in unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) technology. Vladimir Putin recently unveiled the Status 6 or Kanyon, a nuclear-powered UUV, capable of carrying a massive nuclear warhead, designed to incinerate coastal cities in the event of a nuclear war.Russia also recently unveiled the Burevestnik, a nuclear-powered cruise missile. The missile is believed to use a liquid flouride thorium reactor (LFTR), which has significant potential for civilian energy production applications. Although more difficult to engineer, LFTR reactors have less potential for a meltdown and could produce energy far more cheaply than conventional nuclear power. The Burevestnik is believed to have virtually unlimited range by virtue of its power plant.",0 followers,Brent Cooper,726,7.9K,409.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Russia-making-all-these-technological-advances-for-their-military-and-it-seems-like-the-US-isnt-doing-anything

Needless to say there are probably a 100 more whiz bang super weapons hidden behind various programs funded with $400 toilet seat purchases.What we know about are the routine weapons that the US exports. Those are top notch and nice but the stuff actually protecting the Continental US is kept quiet.You see Russia likes to show off its newest stuff. They aren’t alone, China, Japan, Poland, Argentina and India do the same. The US however plays it close to the vest with its most cutting edge tech. Whenever the US shows something off, it’s a safe bet that the R&D that day is two or three generations ahead. That means there are functional systems a generation ahead (at least) in use.The Russians have great anti-aircraft abilities. This has long been a focus for them because they’ve long known that the US could overwhelm their skies with aircraft. They also have 1000’s of miles of contested border to protect. This has led to a divergence of military doctrine between the US and Russia when it comes to air defense.The Russians have decentralized their air defense and operate at what would be the battalion level I suppose for AA activities. Their radars are amazing and the latest SA-400 and better systems have enormous coverage areas and fly wicked fast. These are legitimate concerns for American military planers.Is it better though?Hard to say. We have a highly centralized system but also one that can be decoupled and activated remotely but our systems are more concerned with ballistic missiles than deep penetration aircraft. We have the advantage of two oceans as borders, along with the vastness of Canada to the North. No other state operates enough carriers to get in on us and Canada provides an enormous early detection zone.The Soviets had a massive armor compliment and modern Russia still incorporates that doctrine but the US has lots of practical tank busters that have stellar track records.What the Russians have always been better at is rugedizing their equipment. The MiG-21s could operate off dirt roads. The Su-27s were basically flying tanks and so were the Hind Helicopters. The Russians built ejector seats for their Helos even after building them like tanks. It’s a philosophical difference as much as a technological one.Somewhat famously and apocryphally NASA spent a bunch of money developing a ballpoint pen that would work in Micro Gravity. The Russians just used pencils. It was actually the Fisher Pen company who spent a million dollars and the Russians later bought the “Space Pen” from Fisher.EDIT:So while the Russians build it tough the finicky American options require constant upkeep, which will happen no matter what.Its important to note however that the US F-15 has never lost an Air to Air engagement. The F-14s ruled the ocean skies for a generation. The newer F-18s are considered better in pretty much every metric. How do these stack against the Russian 4th gens? We don’t know but the US has always been able to counter what the Russians put up.Jet for Jet, Sub for Sub, Tank for Tank and Boat for Boat the US is generally slightly ahead. Of couse personnel has a lot to do with this and I’m taking nothing away from the Russians here, they are just culturally great at fighting but so too is the US. A real component of US military expenditures is training. These pilots live in the air and train constantly. These Submariners are always operating as if at war. US troops train constantly and diligently and there isn’t a lot of skimping on fuel, ammo or travel.I would think a historical example is apt here. In WW2 the Germans had the absolute best tanks. The Panthers were better than pretty much anything else and the Tigers had no close second unless it was the Panther. The US had the Sherman and tank for tank the Sherman lost every time. But the number of Panthers and especially Tigers was quite limited. So while the Sherman’s would lose the matchup one on one, 20 Shermans against one Tiger was a bad matchup for the Germans. The US had way more Shermans than the Germans had Tigers.Today the US has the modern equivalent of the Tiger, but fields them in Sherman numbers. That’s true of Fighter Jets, strategic bombers, subs and aircraft carriers too. The Russians might have a better weapons system in some category but do they have enough to handle the numerical superiority of the American Counter?The answer is usually no.Putin seems to have highlighted a bunch of super doomsday weapons of late. High speed underwater nuclear drones, the “Satan” missile etc. These aren’t really practical weapons though, they are stand-off platforms to guarantee territorial sovereignty. The new MAD. Were these even necessary? Russia already had a couple of 1000 ICBMs, that’s a pretty good deterrent.We should dispel a myth too. Russian hardware isn’t much cheaper than American hardware. The F-18 costs more than a latest gen MiG but not by much. The Apache Longbow is about the same price as the Russian Tiger helo. The reason the US spends more is it builds more, much more. That total capacity matters. Sherman numbers with Tiger tech.The Russians build good stuff but is it better in an evolutionary sense? No. The Russisn system might be slightly better in some way but is it an entire generation ahead ? Almost never and this has been true for a long time. The Su-27 “SuperFlanker” was long touted asThe Russians might have a leg up in mobile Air Defense systems, right now. That’s the one place I know they might be ahead and that’s a big deal but can these new systems handle an F-22 running two squadrons of drones? Can they handle 50 F-22s running 100 squadrons of drones? 2000 aircraft are gonna eat up a lot of SA-400s.Can these things handle the theoretical challenges of orbital scramjet bombers or Mach 10 drones? How about “supercruise” missiles?The US saves it’s best stuff for last. B-2s have been used in the Middle East but the B-1s do most of the heavy lifting. The F-22s have seen action but this was likely just a practical test. The US has essentially fought these latest wars with 30 year old weapons platforms. There’s newer stuff, we know about, but they aren’t even mentioned most of the time.What don’t we know about?Now maybe Russia has some super secret stuff of it’s own but Russia has never really played the secret squirrel game with hardware because they’ve always felt the pressure of NATO states on the perimeter and the US Navy just offshore so the propaganda value of “latest and greatest” has been much more valuable. That could change but that is not what I’m seeing from Vladimir Putin, he wants to show the West what he can do and some of it is pretty intimidating.","43,428 followers",Misha Firer,2.5K,1.3K,133.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Russia-making-all-these-technological-advances-for-their-military-and-it-seems-like-the-US-isnt-doing-anything

Now wakanda is not a big country, as that white guy made clear close to the end of the movie where he said it was a country of farmers.Since it's a small country, and the city is simply camouflaged to the background of the remaining area, don't you think someone would've discovered it?

Part of that is the costuming that favors an African tribal ceremonial clothes and adornments vibe . . .for combat.And for all that technological advancement their warfighting ability is slightly above caveman.That might be considered racist if not for the fact that Asgard is every bit as stupid and politically regressive.

I think all these criticisms, while not without merit, miss an important point. This was a comic-book, super-hero movie, first and foremost. The movie makers didn’t set out to tell a story about Africans in the vein of “Beasts of No Nation.” They were out to tell the story of the Black Panther, a man who dresses in a high-tech body suit who can win wrestling matches with cars and rhinos. Once they decided they wanted to make a movie about this character, part of their job was to create a background and setting for the character. And since it was a fantastical story about a fantastical character, it fits that he comes from the fantastical land of Wakanda. Black Panther is no more representative of any real African nation than Spider-Man is of New York. It’s a fantasy movie, and should be simply enjoyed or dismissed on that basis. I personally enjoyed it.",21 followers,Henry Chun,686,3.9K,32.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Russia-making-all-these-technological-advances-for-their-military-and-it-seems-like-the-US-isnt-doing-anything

So glad you can join us progressives here on the left! Where have you been for theWith regards to their politics, I can see why people might be sensitive about it, but I don’t think it’s justified. The movie is clearly critical of Wakanda’s culture and politics. The dichotomy of Wakanda’s Afro-fururism and adherence to tradition is supposed to present their greatest strength as well as their greatest weakness. What people have chosen to be offended by is a supposed implication that I don’t think the movie is trying to make. People are basically reading the movie as trying to say, “Even if Black people developed technology advanced enough to make them the most technologically capable nation on earth, they would still do barbaric things like have potential monarchs fight with spears to determine who becomes king.”Here, the movie is not making a statement about Black people’s ability to run a nation, it’s making a statement about Wakanda, a fictional nation in the Marvel cinematic universe that has an almost pathological commitment to preserving ancient traditions. My biggest disappointment with Black Panther is that it wasn’t about ‘Black Panther’ enough. It was about Wakanda. And the movie treats Wakanda as the super-hero of the film. It has great power and a great weakness (and great responsibility :-o), that weakness being a ludicrous commitment to preserving their traditions. And like all good super-hero movies that weakness becomes their downfall when Killmonger exploits it to take over. Admittedly, I think this could have been done better. All the interesting stuff with Killmonger seems stuffed into the end when it should have been developed for more of the movie.Had they removed these jarring and negative aspects of Wakanda from the movie, I think Black Panther would have fallen into some version of the ‘magical negro’ trope. Namely, in trying to avoid offending people, the movie would have painted an unrealistic picture of their black characters, Wakanda being a character in its own right. You don’t want your characters to be too perfect and the more flaws they have the more interesting they are. Wakanda is flawed and the movie has to lean into that. The particular flaws in the movie are fun to watch. I like watching muscle bound guys fight each other with spears. I didn’t know spear combat was missing from Hollywood until Black Panther. Thank you Ryan Coogler.Some people say it would be more empowering if they excluded these negative elements of Wakandan culture from the movie. I disagree. It wouldn’t be empowering, it would be boring. They could have made Wakanda the Mary Sue of Marvel worlds but they chose instead to criticize something that we see present to some extent in all nations. It’s asking important questions that I actually apply to the United States more than to the African diaspora. The questions are:1. What are we trying to protect when we preserve old traditions?2. Who gets to decide what parts of a culture and its traditions work and who decides which parts need to be discarded?3. How does a rigid adherence to tradition affect how we view others with different traditions?And most importantly:4. If we stop protecting our culture, are we at risk of losing it entirely as African Americans have over the course of the last 400 years?I’m going to go ahead and say this is brilliant. There is a lot of nuance here and a lot of themes that say something about the African American experience but also about America as a country. I think the movie would have been a lot more offensive if it portrayed Wakanda as a perfect society. In fact, the movie could have fallen into the trap of making Wakanda perfect in all the ways we think Western societies are perfect.Perhaps I’m reading too much into the movie, but as a kind of proxy for the United States, the appointment of a ruler by combat made me reflect on democracy in the modern world. A handful of wealthy individuals spend the better part of a year getting funding from their wealthy friends so they can lie to the public and rule over us for some prescribed period of time. During this time we’re largely at their mercy and if you’re a minority, the majority could vote you into subjugation. I did ask myself, rhetorically of course, if election by combat is that much worse?If you’ll allow me a gentle rebuke of people who found the movie offensive, both black people and white people, I’ll say this: I think we can only find this movie offensive to Black people if we have internalized certain racist ideas. I think there’s a knee-jerk reaction that anything African is primitive and the movie has been accused of showing stereotypes of African people.I don’t think Black Panther shows ‘stereotypes’ as much as it shows tropes and imagery that we associate with ‘Africa’. I think the movie faces a bigger challenge than people realize. What makes a city ‘African’? For the most part modern African cities look like... well …. cities.Nairobi Kenya.Lagos Nigeria.I guess you might look at those and say, they’re probably not American or European cities, but it’s not obvious. Black Panther is a fantasy/sci-fi movie. It wouldn’t do to just present a modern African city or any kind of futuristic city. It had to be distinctive in a whacky, ‘Marvel’ kind of way. Crazy, colourful armour, spears that shoot lasers, rhinos instead of horses, spaceships that look like African masks. They’ve also apparently built their metropolis in some kind of lush valley or canyon. I imagine in real life, most of those mountains would have been stripped bare of any kind of vegetation. But the effect is cool to look at.It’s mostly for fun and to make Wakanda stand out. Is it all kind of silly? Maybe . . . But it takes place in the same universe as Asgard and Ant-man and Rocket Racoon. . . It’s all silly and it all requires some suspension of disbelief. Marvel movies are not hard sci-fi, they’re fantasy.At the end of the day, Wakanda is supposed to be teaching us lessons about America more than it is teaching us lessons about the entire continent of Africa and it’s entire history and prehistory. I think being offended by this shows how much we’ve internalized racist ideas about Africa and accepted the fact that most of what exists in that continent is backward and primitive. No one bats an eye when people start using martial arts in a movie where everyone has guns, do they? Because we’ve accepted Asian culture in our movies and Black Panther is trying to do the same for African culture.Presenting a perfect, African utopia would have been more offensive and quite frankly boring. I like crazy Wakanda and look forward to how they deal with its flaws going forward in the MCU.","3,451 followers",Olisa Efobi,1.5K,838,25.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Russia-making-all-these-technological-advances-for-their-military-and-it-seems-like-the-US-isnt-doing-anything

I can of course separate a fantasy film from a critical analysis but it’s impact means that it is open to critical analysis and why Black Americans, who have paid $500 million dollars to repeatedly view a product made ostensibly to them, with majority people who look like them would be so blindly supportive of an enterprise that doesn’t support them or their communities.A 90% Black cast set in Africa—-okay, it was filmed a lot in Georgia—-some at Tyler Perry’s studios so it must be a boon to Black people., Black people went in droves, the estimates are that of the near $2 billion dollar take, $500 million of that was from Black Americans who went….multiple times. At an average of $10 a pop.Marvel Studios isn’t Black owned, nor is it a major underwriter of Black owned businesses within the non-existent Black business community. (There are all kinds of Black businesses but they’re spread out.)Disney is the parent organization/owner of Marvel Studios. Again not a big underwriter of Black interests towards wealth building.BUTMarvel Studios/Disney will have Black Panther books, videos, comics, toys and future films ad infinitum—-this is a good 10 year project where the insertion of Black Panther will bring in Black audiences—-at $10 a pop.To theaters that are not Black owned. Increasing the stock value of Disney—-it’s dipped and dived but it’s maintained at over $100 a share since the movie came out.Netflix is not Black owned. It’s at $256 a share.Now, here’s where that Black dark, dark secret comes in. A micro percentage of Black people, probably most of the cast and director of BP, own Disney and Netflix stock—-because they’ve had practice in managing larger and larger sums of money so they get paid in cash, stock options, back end points, etc..Most Black people went, and voluntarily gave $10, $20, $100 to BP but that money won’t recirculate back into their neighborhoods, schools, stores because Black people as a bloc don’t produce or control manufacturing nor as a mass regularly buy stock/invest. Now some Chinese families got fed because they made the dolls and toys and such in factories (not a lot but more than Black people did on the return profit.)Also if you trace the dollars purchasing tickets supports a White owned theater, concessions are from White owned companies, film/digital materials and equipment White engineers, the majority of the technical people working on the movie, White and then they take the monies that makes it’s way to them through ticket purchases, cable and streaming rights and they pay for mortgages, children’s education, car payments and those mortgage companies are White owned and the supermarkets they buy food in and so on.Now, yes, logically if you trace this a multitude of companies from a multitude of White, Asian, European descent ethnicities profit from such an enterprise. The counterpoint is that Black companies, people, communities don’t profit to as great a percentage as White and perhaps Asian and “others” do from a Black “product” or a Black aimed product. So Black people put in $500 million to something that perhaps if we were to pool salaries is maybe $10–20 million directly to Black and those Black people, the cast, will then take their money and put it into a White system, an Asian system, perhaps even an African system but not a Black one.The simple point of the vicious cycle is that we, Black people, invest in things that garner no returns because they don’t invest back into us as Black people.The current measurement is that Jewish, White, Asian dollars circulate 6 to 14 times, meaning that of every dollar spent $6 to $14 dollars stays within those ethnic communities to enhance that ethnic group.Because there's a mass hating of reading/education and math Black people don’t know how toOf the $2 billion that the movie has generated so far, there’s been a donation of $1 million dollars to the Boys & Girls Club.$1 million.Off of $2 billion.A whole $1 million.Oprah gave the Ron Clark Academy $5 million and no one had to put on a spandex suit in front of a green screen…..ijs.Racialized Masturbation FantasyThe movie itself is the Black American wet dream of Africa Heaven that has never existed, will never exist and could only exist when articulated through the manufactured lens of White power, patriarchy, privilege and misogyny.Negative Portrayal of African Americans and a Stereotypical Perception of Them by AfricansIt’s a good fantasy movie but it paints American Blacks as psychotic, impoverished thugs (Killmonger)—-which may or may not be true from an African (White infused) perspective. And also is how Africans see African Americans coupled with the shame of having been a kidnapped people and unlike other people have their home country come for them physically or legally in retribution. Killmonger represents the Black feeling of betrayal at being left in, sold into, forgotten about into slavery.Is Wakanda Really Advanced?Wakanda is shown to be a conglomeration of 5 tribes who’ve existed both peacefully and to the advancement of their secret level of wealth for generations. Okay, that’s fine and perhaps even understandable. It’s also shown to have spies throughout the world, which is fine and understandable as a plot point.However to some of Killmonger’s argument—-why haven’t they helped other Africans and the world? That question is never answered. Now a way to answer the question could be that over all these tens of generations Wakanda has—-taken over the world. Would that be so impossible if you had unlimited resources, people and centuries? But such an idea would not float in a movie.Wakanda is so advanced that it has women as warriors and generals with the Dora Milaje. Okay. But when presented with the idea that a woman rise up as the Black Panther (or challenge for the throne)—-none can or will.Which is problematic.Most African tribes are matrilineal. So women are the sovereign leaders with male chieftains. But okay, that’s a sticky plot point that circles around misogyny. Though it could answer why Killmonger was left behind as a child.Why does no one else step up to challenge Killmonger after he defeats T’Challa? He is clearly insane to their way of life.Imagine this: he defeats T’Challa….and everyone steps up—-millions to challenge Killmonger. Men, women, children, the old woman. They force him to face his own barbarity and refuse to allow their own system to be perverted against them.You will have to kill us all to rule us.Or…The presence of White Patriarchy—-which is what Evan Ross represents. He is the only one in the film, the White man, to suggest to the advanced Wakandans, “diplomacy” in dealing with matters. (We’re not even going to touch on the fact that when injured we immediately break the code for centuries to save the life of a White man.)Is Wakanda truly advanced or are they just tribal, ready to go savage at the drop of a hat Africans——with advanced science and powers that are based in vibranium….Can the African only be enhanced from the external?African Slave Mentality…after one Tribal FightI was also disappointed in how fast they switched up not only on who would be/the mantel of Kings but also how they went to civil war with each other, the four tribes that got along—-so fast after living thousands of years living in harmony. It suggested a narrowTo be so advanced and yet so socially limited said something dissonant.In many ways both fictionally and in reality, I think, it sold Black people (in America and worldwide) on some things that are within the social consciousness already which is why it’s so wildly successful—-it’s not suggesting something new, it’s ringing the bell of lots of old stuff (racism, misogyny, patriarchy, African/African American separation, inferiority of African descended people, immediate savagery, etc.)—-just in new packaging.It used Black people to get us as a ticket paying bloc now (for Marvel/Disney—-who I’m sure have no plans at all to make anymore superhero movies or TV shows. Ever. Never ever. Never ever. Uh huh.), much as we are a voting Democratic bloc,But can anyone say anything against it or analyze it? No. Why?Often the biggest problem with Black people as a mass is when we adopt something, it could be vile and ignorant and demoralizing (shout out to Cardi B!), but we will fight to the death for it—-much like the Wakandans immediately do for Killmonger.Perhaps the film is truly saying something about Blacks as Americans and Africans?#KylePhoenix",UNKNOWN,Chris O'Leary,1.2K,4.1K,89.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Russia-making-all-these-technological-advances-for-their-military-and-it-seems-like-the-US-isnt-doing-anything

Yeah, your “fellow” Africans get exploited, colonised, oppressed while you play dumb all along. I think being the moral spectator is much easier here right?I have no problem with T'Challa or his father or Zuri. My problem is more with Erik Killmonger and Shuri, T'Challa's sister. Killmonger is pretty much a grieving terrorist with somewhat understandable moral excuse. In Marvel Universe where everything passes by lightly with jokes and little thoughts, Killmonger simply stands out. Ultron's failed attempt at justifying his villainous logic simply fails, he punched above his intellectual weight. Likewise, Thanos too has too little brain and too much jaw in justifying his “random genocide” solution that conveniently excused his. Marvel Cinema become Marvel comics at this point. It is therefore little wonder why people are easily impressed by Killmonger. But still, attacking non-Europeans to make them “respect” African Americans? Isn't that reinforcing the thug stereotype?Now, Shuri?To be fair Shuri's edgy teeny demeanor with arrogance flair isn't unique in this world. We have Tony Stark, Stephen Strange, and other characters too are becoming more and more smart-mouthed. Hawkeye, Ant-Man, Thor, are made to be likeable douches kind of like Starlord. But why not Shuri's though?Unlike all these problematic men, an alcoholic with panic attack, a broken man, a troubled family man, a divorcee and ex-convict, a guy who has lost his entire kingdom, and a guy who is basically a traumatic orphan, Shuri is spoiled privileged brat. Without her “attitude”, it is already too easy to hate her. Being black or woman has nothing to do with it. We like Okoye bring stiff and has the propensity to start a brawl, it is because she is a tough and gruff military soldier, it has nothing to do with her being black or woman too. Okoye could be the one uttering those demeaning lines towards agent Ross, but Shuri just makes it much more difficult to accept.",27 followers,Michael Collins,1.2K,1.4K,15.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Russia-making-all-these-technological-advances-for-their-military-and-it-seems-like-the-US-isnt-doing-anything

How can you go about accomplishing a goal that you’ve always wanted to accomplish?Well, in the past, if you’ve set some goals and you didn’t follow through, there’s a reason for that. There’s a reason that we throw up our hands in silent resignation. Most of us simply want something and we want it now; we don’t want to have to work tirelessly for it.So, how do we go from simply saying we want something, to actually following through and achievinWe all want to achieve something in our lives. We all have goals that we set, yet oftentimes forget. But what does it take to really achieve anything? How can you go about accomplishing a goal that you’ve always wanted to accomplish?Well, in the past, if you’ve set some goals and you didn’t follow through, there’s a reason for that. There’s a reason that we throw up our hands in silent resignation. Most of us simply want something and we want it now; we don’t want to have to work tirelessly for it.So, how do we go from simply saying we want something, to actually following through and achieving anything we put our minds to? How do we push through when all we want to do is give up?No matter how big or small that goal is, it can be achieved. It’s just a change in your technique that is needed.Don't Let Others Set The Goals For YouWhen you let others set your goals or modify them for you, this can have several damaging effects on your ability to achieve them.First, it's now no longer your goal, and you have no sense of ownership or commitment to this new goal, as its now someone else's goal.Second, people can look to make you more aggressive and look to set the goal to be bigger than you believe possible, and when you lack belief, this can cause you to quit at the first sign of difficulty.If people want to be involved, then let them help you define how you will achieve your goal, but don't let them set a new goal for you.Be Clear What Success Looks LookIf you don't know what success looks like, how will you know when you have achieved it. If you don't have a clear goal, then you cannot put a clear plan in place to achieve it.One of my clients was looking to increase their revenue by 50-100 percent in the upcoming year. They were very happy that they were setting a big bold goal, but the challenge is the plan to increase by 50 percent is not the same as the plan to increase by 100 percent.So which plan are you going to going to implement?Clear goals allow you to create clear plans, which increase your probability of success. Hope is not a strategy!Understand Why This Goal Is ImportantIf you don't know why the goal is important to you, then it's just random. Understanding why will give you a stronger sense of purpose, and this sense of purpose will keep you motivated during the difficult times. When you lack a sense of purpose if things do start to go awry, there is nothing stopping you from downgrading your goal and lowering the bar.To achieve big bold goals, you need to be firm on the goal, but flexible on the approach, and having a strong ‘why’ will help you keep your eyes on the prize and keep going in the tough times.Track Your PerformanceI'm a big believer in the adage what gets measured gets done, but I am an even bigger believer in the power of motivation.When we slice the elephant and know what the small interim goals are, as we start to achieve them, this will increase both belief in the approach and also confidence that success is achievable.If you're leading a team, then make sure that not only do you track performance, but that you also share the progress with your teams.When the going gets tough, it's great to hear that progress is being made. Sometimes when you have your head down and are charging towards the finishing line, it can be difficult to know just how close you are and hearing the progress can encourage you to make that final push to get over the line.If you want to set your self a big bold goal, then to increase your chance of success, be clear about what success looks like, make sure it's your goal and understand why it's important to you, break it down to small goals, track your performance and celebrate each small success. If you can do that then you will significantly increase your chance of being in that small group of 8 percent who achieve their goals.",29 followers,Kale Hyder,1.6K,708,26.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Russia-making-all-these-technological-advances-for-their-military-and-it-seems-like-the-US-isnt-doing-anything
