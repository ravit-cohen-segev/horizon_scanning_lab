0,"A space elevator will need a cable made with a super high strength to weight ratio. A current candidate material is carbon nanotubes. In 2019, carbon nanotubes are available in the 1 cm range of length. For a space elevator to Earth, lengths of 37,000 km are needed. We are a factor of 10^9 away from that today.","35,158 followers",C Stuart Hardwick,1.4K,12.3K,143M,2019,https://www.quora.com/When-do-you-think-we-as-humans-will-develop-a-Space-Elevator
1,"For the Moon or Mars, we basically have it now (albeit at a low TRL, or readiness level).For the Earth, we need at least an order of magnitude improvement in tether tensile strength, and that means more basic research, and that puts a terrestrial space elevator at least several decades behind a lunar one.","35,158 followers",C Stuart Hardwick,1.4K,12.3K,143M,2019,https://www.quora.com/When-do-you-think-we-as-humans-will-develop-a-Space-Elevator

Space elevators for the Moon or Mars are a LOT easier.Several problems seem to dominate:It’s starting to look like it may be impossible - at least for an Earth-to-space elevator. Space elevators for the Moon or Mars are a LOT easier.Several problems seem to dominate:There are enough problems here that even if not all of them are really problems - the space elevator is a bust.Add to that the indisputable fact that re-usable rockets are going to be a heck of a lot cheaper - and more available - and with things like the SpaceX Super-Heavy launcher - single payloads of 150 tonnes could be put into orbit routinely. It’s doubtful that a space elevator could take more than a few tonnes at a time.Sadly (because it’s a very cool idea) - I don’t think we’ll ever see a Space Elevator from Earth.HOWEVER:Space Elevators for the Moon or Mars are VERY practical…they are much shorter, gravity is less and you don’t need exotic materials and with only the smallest amount of aerodynamic drag - most of the stability issues go away.But the need to transfer vast amounts of cargo to and from Mars/Moon orbit seems a very long way away.","28,174 followers",Garrett Reisman,9.2K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/When-do-you-think-we-as-humans-will-develop-a-Space-Elevator

Obamacare was a really light program that affected things only at the margins. And yet there was a huge backlash against that. Imagine the backlash against something more transformative. It would have to work flawlessly, which is unlikely.The easiest and least disruptive thing would be to make Medicare or Medicaid available to anyone who doesn’t currently have access to health insurance. But when you do that, lots of people will still lose the private insurance they like, because employers would have an incentive to stop paying for healthcare for their workers. That kind of change is scary for a lot of people.It will also require a massive increase in taxes, especially if it is as generous as some of my fellow liberals want to make it. Even with that, you’re still going to have some level of rationing—this is inescapable. This rationing will result in some things that are better. But some things will be worse than the current system for a lot of people. And those people are going to focus on the things that are worse and get angry.I’m not saying we shouldn’t go for universal healthcare.

Consequently the scale has to be huge, generating a higher need for IT specialists & data scientists, which are currently hard to find & thus afford, in developing countries like Egypt.With ever rising national debt the economy will shrink & a great barrier for domestic emerging investments will arise.With greater control & monopoly of well established global businesses like Macdonalds in fastfood, Adidas in sports wear... you will hardly ever find a domestic business or startup.Unlike what's widely believed most of the entry level jobs that's needed in banks, multinationals & other companies will expand & more opportunities are created, however it's going to be much less rewarding.Jobs won't disappear but it will be much less rewarding to the extent that it won't appeal to you.Over the next decades we will see a trend of people studying & specializing in technology,AI, data science which is exactly what's needed to decline the cost of running the systems, including accounting systems.When it finally meets economies of scale, it becomes cheaper than hiring an entire accounting staff that's when it's going to be automated.Only then a new era of multilayered society will exist, the extremely wealthy & extremely poor, no middle class.That's when what we will pursue becomes bottom line of human needs.A roof over your head, food for the day & dude pray you never get sick.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,4.2K,996,156.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/When-do-you-think-we-as-humans-will-develop-a-Space-Elevator

Missiles are pretty much the best we can do for an offensive weapon, while ballistics are a better pick for defensive purposes.It all comes down to engagement ranges. In space, spotting a target at absurd ranges is trivial. Unfortunately, so is dodging enemy fire. Any kind of unguided weapon is going to struggle to hit a target that still has fuel to maneuver at anything less than point blank range, at which point the most likely outcome is that both ships will be pouring enough rounds into one another to make sure both of them are either destroyed or disabled.Missiles, while admittedly complex and heavy enough to represent a problem for an armed space ship, are pretty much the only weapon we've got that can adjust its course in flight to keep up with an evading target. It's still unlikely that one would be able to hit an enemy ship, given that it will almost certainly have just a fraction of the edurance of the ship it's being fired at, but the beauty is that it doesn't need to. It just needs to present a threat too serious for it to ignore. Every time the target needs to adjust its course to avoid getting caught in the missile's cross hairs, it's using up the fuel it needs to remain mobile. If you can get their fuel reserves low enough, then eventually they are going to be faced with a scenario where their only options are to disengage while they still have enough fuel to get back home or risk the nearly certain death that would come from letting the tank run dry in open space.And this is where ballistic weapons come into play. They're not the greatest standoff weapons because a single small engine burn is more than enough to dodge a bullet in flight. But since bullets have masses that are just a small fraction of a fully fueled missile, you can afford to carry a lot more of them. And at short ranges, they can do a lot of damage very quickly. If you find yourself on the receiving end of a missle's attack run and don't want to use up fuel trying to dodge it, you might be able to use a fast firing gun for point defense and shoot the missile down before it gets close enough to be a danger. And if the enemy ship was stupid enough to exhaust its own fuel supplies rather than run, you could exploit their inability to maneuver to shoot them down from a safe distance.That said, neither of these options are going to do you much good if you don't have the single most important weapon a ship can have:Your engine plays a part in determining how quickly your ship can accelerate, how much mass you can afford to devote to munitions, and how long you can go before running out of fuel. The chemical rockets we employ for space travel today are great for shipping things over long distances, but their fuel consumption rates and mass requirements make the prospect of building a battleship around one problematic at best. If we were ever forced to seriously look at building a space based warfighting platform we'd likely need to focus more on developing experimental propulsion technologies like plasma thrusters or NERVA than figuring out what kind of weapons to mount.","14,900 followers",Krister Sundelin,508,23.8K,89.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/When-do-you-think-we-as-humans-will-develop-a-Space-Elevator
