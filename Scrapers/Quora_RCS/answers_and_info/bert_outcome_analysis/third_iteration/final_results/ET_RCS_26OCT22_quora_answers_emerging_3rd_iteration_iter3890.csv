1,"I would not really know, but with the word “peak” in that sentence, I assume you are referring similarly to “peak oil” whereas there would be a future deficit of hydrocarbons and fossil-fuels.

Combine that with sword making skills of both modern types, as well as reproductions of older types, but using modern materials, and you get the inevitable: a superior pThere are a number of companies nowadays making European-style, Far East Asian-style, and all sorts of other swords in between that produce swords of superior quality and durability to those produced during the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and every other time period in history.

No. Were all historical swords made to the most exacting standards available at that time? No. There have always been and will always be makers of cheap products. However, if a historical swordsmith were presented with even reasonable quality modern steel, he would be amazed at how uniform it was in quality, and if he were given the best we have available now, he just might have an infarct.",842 followers,Dave Rickey,8.2K,534,6.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-such-a-thing-as-peak-technology
3,"Making a better sword with modern technology should be feasible, as long as you can define what “better” is. More ergonomic? Possibly. More resisant? Sure. Sharper? Definitely, though there's a limit before more sharpness becomes redundant. Lighter? Yes, but that's not necessarily an improvement.I disagree that swords reached their peak potential in the Renaissance. “Swords” is a very large category of tools which are designed for specific uses; in fact, the design of “swords” continued to be tweaked well into the 1900s. Compare that to hammers - the general idea of a hammer has existed for miMaking a better sword with modern technology should be feasible, as long as you can define what “better” is. More ergonomic?

4,"With todays advances in chemistry, metallurgy, and the other sciences I think that we can and do make blades that surpass what was available even at the height of the Renaissance.

6,"In Europe, sword tech actually peaked just before the Renaissance. Much of the time we forget what was lost then (there was quite a bit). And yes, modern swords can be better than (most of) the best medieval ones. Steel is just better than ever before.","3,244 followers",Lim Kagen,703,2.1K,31M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Did-swords-reach-their-peak-technological-potential-in-the-Renaissance-or-could-we-make-a-better-sword-today-using-modern-technology

8,"They weren’t.There is a very Victorian view of history that persists to this day, that history is a steady march of progress. That what exists now is the best that it could ever be in all ways, and that each new thing is an evolution of the previous.This is not so.In point of fact, evolution branches, sometimes wildly, with some branches progressing forward and others dying out.A greatsword, ie a sword as big as the man using it, was always a specialist weapon.

That what exists now is the best that it could ever be in all ways, and that each new thing is an evolution of the previous.This is not so.In point of fact, evolution branches, sometimes wildly, with some branches progressing forward and others dying out.A greatsword, ie a sword as big as the man using it, was always a specialist weapon. It existed primarily for two contexts. On the field of battle it was one method by which an opening could be forced in an enemy pike wall. Other methods included shield-bearers, firearms, or just slamming more pikes into the enemy. The greatsword worked as well as it didn’t, and thus never became the one way to force a gap, nor fell out of use until pike walls themselves fell away to the weight of guns.The other reason to use a greatsword is body guarding. A man with a greatsword can create a great deal of space around himself, and thus cover his principle well, but even there the greatsword was never the only option.Eventually other weapons, to include firearms, became the favored weapons of body-guarding, and thus the two principle uses for the greatsword died out. The greatsword ended up being an evolutionary dead end, much like an anti-tank rifle.At the same time, while the specific form changed, one-handed swords never went out of fashion. It’s not like swords got long and then short again.Now longswords were popular sidearms for fighting in armor on foot, and to some extend for self defense. As time wore on, as guns got better and more popular and the use of armor waned, the length of the longsword got sort of recombined with the evolving guards of one-handed swords, into the espada ropera, eventually bastardized into “rapier”. Now this wasn’t a clean evolution, it’s not simply that the longswordSide-swords, on the other hand, are the natural evolution of arming swords.Arming swordSide swordNow we can debate, purely for academic purposes, if only a knucle-bow, only a side ring, only a finger ring, are enough to distinguish an arming sword from a side-sword, though certainly all of those features make a side-sword. It’s sort of when does red become orange question.But the difference between arming swords and side swords is only one of form. They served the same purpose and were used in basically the same way.The reason that military officers preferred swords or sabers to longswords is fairly straightforward. Guns eventually came to dominate the battlefield, and so personal combat waned somewhat. And remember, an officer’s primary weapon is hisBut since the sword or saber would spend most of it’s time living in a scabbard, officers were quite interested in blades that were easy and comfortable toMost of the hand rests on the outside of the grip, and thus the outside of the guard is more developed, while the inside is slighter, striking the balance between protection and comfort, as that’s the side that will rest against the officer while worn.In point of fact from 1822 to the around 1850 it was popular with British officers to have a folding guard.However this isn’t as strong as a solid guard, and throughout the period examples of both could be found, with folding guards falling almost completely out of use around 1850 or so.But again, even the development of complex hilts was not a smooth march of progress. Guards such as the one displayed above are usually called “half-basket”.Yet full basket swords, such as the Mortuary hilt, were seen in the early 1600s.In essence, the swords changed for the same reason any weapon or tool does. Needs and preferences changed.Original question-","1,666 followers",Michael Orick,1.6K,1.3K,13.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Did-swords-reach-their-peak-technological-potential-in-the-Renaissance-or-could-we-make-a-better-sword-today-using-modern-technology
9,"The answers to this can now be given a little more clearly.Thunderbolt (formerly LightPeak) certainly has a speed advantage over USB 3. Jan's speeds above are correct.The copper implementation of Thunderbolt can not sustain a cable run of ""over 100 meters"" but only 5 metres, the same as USB 3. The optical implementation (which nobody is yet using) can sustain runs of ""tens of meters"" according to Intel.Second, ThunderboltThe answers to this can now be given a little more clearly.Thunderbolt (formerly LightPeak) certainly has a speed advantage over USB 3.

The optical implementation (which nobody is yet using) can sustain runs of ""tens of meters"" according to Intel.Second, ThunderboltThunderbolt doesn't so much concentrate other protocols and physical links as piggyback them on top. The exception is that the current copper implementation used by Intel/Apple does concentrate Thunderbolt and Displayport into the one wire, this is done so that Thunderbolt can use the Displayport connector on the Mac. The piggybacking means that Thunderbolt can theoretically piggyback a diverse set of, and large number of, other protocols on top and then break them out into converter boxes.Thunderbolts other point of difference with USB 3 is that it allows daisychaining of up to 7 devices.Given all this Thunderbolt is better for extremely high speed links. I will personally probably end up using it as a lower cost alternative to Fibre Channel when building storage for servers - already Promise have announced a 4 and 6 bay array that connects via Thunderbolt.USB 3, on the other hand, is cheaper to implement and, as Justin says above, consumes less power so is better for medium speed connections such as SSD drives and mid speed drive arrays.I would expect Thunderbolt ports to start arriving in premium desktops and laptops soon and server boxes not long after when rack mounted native Thunderbolt drive arrays come out. Low end consumer models will stick with USB 3.","31,157 followers",Phillip Remaker,503,11K,78.8M,2011,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-such-a-thing-as-peak-technology
