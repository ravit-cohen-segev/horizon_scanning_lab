The Tesla always turns heads. There is no safer car than the Model 3. I assume the range of the $35K Tesla will be on par with the 60kWh Leaf coming next year, but the difference is Tesla’s Supercharging network. You can drive a Tesla Model 3 all over the U.S. without issues, but try that with the meager Level 3 “Chademo” charging network the Leaf uses and you’ll have to wait for a long time, and in much of the U.S., the chargers have not yet been installed. That’s because, unlike Tesla, Nissan, et al decided not to fund the charging network. They had their chance. I was in the room when the pitch was made, but they opted not to go that direction.Now let’s look at corporate vision. Tesla, under the leadership of Elon Musk, has set as its goal nothing less than electrifying everything and cleaning the grid. They are vertically integrated with their own world-leading battery factory, a solar PV factory that will upend the utility industry in the coming decade, and an unsurmountable lead in electrifying ground transport. All patriotic Americans should applaud this company’s goals, and if you have the ability, buy their products.Nissan has a good car, as does GM with its Bolt. Others will follow and that is a good thing since Tesla cannot begin to satisfy their demand and we need to get millions of people out of their ICE vehicles ASAP. If you can’t get a Tesla, do get a Leaf or Bolt.",UNKNOWN,Lance Pickup,842,2.5K,6.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-would-you-buy-Nissan-Leaf-if-Tesla-3-is-almost-the-same-price-and-more-advanced-technology
2,"Mostly it comes down to personal preference. A lot of people seem to think that the giant touch screen in the Tesla is “advanced technology” and therefore good.

Driving feel is also something highly subjective - the Accord, Civic, Camry, and Altima are the best selling sedans in America, I personally wouldn’t pay a dime for any of them because there are alternatives I so vastly prefer the feel and ergonomics of, alternatives that maybe don’t get as good of general reviews and maybe don’t have as good of numbers on a spec sheet.There’s the issue of logistics. I can go to a Nissan or Chevy dealer almost anywhere in the world and go home that day with a Leaf or Bolt. As an aside, I think the Bolt is the better comparison for the Leaf than the Model 3. If you don’t live in the U.S, Canada, or Norway forget ever getting a Model 3 before the replacement comes out. Even if you do live in one of the aforementioned countries you’ll be waiting several months if not years.Perhaps not convincing, but a lot of people don’t want to be associated with the brand image that Tesla has. Being seen in a Leaf says you care about the environment and also have to drive places - the same as driving a Civic or Fusion Hybrid. Being seen in a Bolt says you have to drive places and like the performance characteristics of electric motors. Much like driving a Prius, being seen in a Tesla is a way of virtue signaling, that you care more about either looking cool or telling the world that you care about the environment than you do about the car itself or actually helping the environment. Yes, this is a generalization, if you make a comment saying something like “I drive a Tesla, but I’m not like that”, you’re worse than that kind of person.And the most convincing case in my opinion, maintenance and reliability. It’s true that electric cars don’t require as much maintenance as those with gasoline engines, but things still break. There are Nissan and GM dealers everywhere in the world to provide service, or even if you go to a third party garage or do the work yourself it’s still helpful to be able to get factory parts quickly. It’s not difficult to find a place to work on a Tesla, but it’s going to be more expensive and take longer to get parts. Tesla has also had issues with quality control out of the factory with the Model X and Model 3 for things like body panel fitment and pieces of the interior just missing. GM and Nissan have never had such issues - and despite GM’s reputation hangover from the 70s and 80s they are now better than industry average for mechanical reliability.",UNKNOWN,Kevin Davidson,1.7K,29.3K,57.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-would-you-buy-Nissan-Leaf-if-Tesla-3-is-almost-the-same-price-and-more-advanced-technology

The Tesla on the other hand gives you the stated range (maybe a small 5–10% drop).Also, I expect my Tesla to still have 95% range in 10 years, but the Leaf and VW will likely be <70% (if not even lower).",UNKNOWN,Waleed Kadous,511,1.8K,10.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-would-you-buy-Nissan-Leaf-if-Tesla-3-is-almost-the-same-price-and-more-advanced-technology

The watchtower was built at a time when advanced British material technology was becoming available. Namely, large pieces of cast iron could be made, more cheaply than wrought iron. So, the contractor for the system of watchtowers went that way. Unfortunately the engineers at the time didn’t entirely understand the properties of this advanced material and the cast iron bits were sometimes subjected to tensile stress. Cast iron is splendid for compressive stress but under tension it is much weaker than wrought iron. So, after a decade or two various bits started to break and fall off, and the towers had to be repaired at great expense.Meanwhile, a couple miles north, the Aqueduct Bridge over the Harlem River was performing reasonably well despite some difficulties. That was a case where the engineers shied away from advanced technology. The river had to be crossed, and the choices were tunnel or bridge. Tunnel would be cheaper, require less maintenance, and not impede river traffic. It would be built of reinforced concrete, a bit of advanced French technology recently perfected by the famous Coignet. Reinforced concrete, said the French, was strong enough to withstand the internal pressure caused by a low loop under the river. It was used to make an aqueduct tunnel under the Manhattan Valley further south, but that was on dry land and if it went bad, it could be repaired more easily. So, for the river they built a bridge, a tried and true method, thus dodging this technical risk. As it happened, the concrete Manhattan Valley tunnel gave no trouble and the Harlem River tunnel would have been okay, but the bridge indeed took several hits from errant barges, and half a century later another advanced technlogy, a big steel arch, replaced the small central stone arches that caused the problem. So, this was a case where fear of technical risk backfired and advanced technolgy would have been safer.But you just don’t know, when the technology is advanced. With the tried and true, the problems are already known. Incidentally, the bicycle tour was on Brompton folding bikes, which were advanced technology back in the 1980s when I was working on other advanced technology. They are tried and true in the 21st century.","246,850 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-would-you-buy-Nissan-Leaf-if-Tesla-3-is-almost-the-same-price-and-more-advanced-technology

It seems simple, but there are specific types of wood you need, they have to be carved in very specific shapes, glued together with horn and sinew, some bows took over a year to manufacture and we don't even know for sure how it was done. Roman roads are several times superior to modern concrete which breaks down and needs constant repair while WWII tanks were driving on Roman roads without problem. We've even examined the composition in many forms of our analytical technology and we still don't know. They built bridges for their horses and caravans and today, 2,000 years later, we drive automobiles on some of those bridges.So one of the main issues was simply knowing. Understanding the existence of germs and viruses cause the spread of disease helps keep us healthy. But since there were no microscopes or intricate means of observation to know these things exist, you have to go on your best guesses and assumptions.The other problem is time.Technology has allowed us to become a uniquely time-conscious society, a concept that didn't exist 150 years ago or any period before. More time means more ability to spend on tinkering, testing, experimenting, and logical deduction. Even in the late Renaissance period, if you wanted investments on inventions or theories, you had to convince the royalty to find justification for it, or else very early forms of corporations, where whole groups of people would put together little bits in good faith to your efforts.As inventions increased the ease of time and effort of living, now we have time to write, keep records, and pay scribes as investments in the future to give the value of information permanency..If given time and ability to read the knowledge of our current discoveries, history, and all back, ancient Egyptians would have cannons and guns and Romans would probably be flying aircraft. Instead, early man had to rely on the slow progress of trial and error, and survive long enough to tell someone else who could benefit and further the efforts.","62,882 followers",Jay Bazzinotti,3.9K,22.2K,179.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-would-you-buy-Nissan-Leaf-if-Tesla-3-is-almost-the-same-price-and-more-advanced-technology
