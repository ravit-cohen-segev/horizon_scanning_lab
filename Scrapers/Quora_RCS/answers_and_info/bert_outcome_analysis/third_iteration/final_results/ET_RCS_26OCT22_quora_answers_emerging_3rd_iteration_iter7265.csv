Let’s just skip ahead to some kind of holographic television. The basic technology is there. A pretty cool holographic effect can be had simply by projecting an image onto a controlled stream of fog.There was a demonstration of that set up a couple of years ago during a race at the Daytona Speedway.

And radiated water has a very short half-life, minutes I think.  If you surround your shelter with your drinking water, you will be safe indefinitely.To prevent muscular atrophy and bone loss, it would be necessary to create a ship that spins.  To prevent nausea and to offset other physiological issues*, it needs to have a diameter of at least a half mile.  That doesn't mean that it has to be a half-mile wide donut though.  Think bola, you know that weapon with two balls attached to each other with a chain.  Attach the crew compartment to supplies and equipment via a half mile long tether or truss.Hibernation chambers.  I don't know much about these but I suspect we aren't far along in the research.Since we currently don't have hibernation chambers it would probably be necessary to create a biosphere where the inhabitants farm their own food.  They would be awake for most of the journey.Recent advancements in fabrics indicate that the future space ships might not be made of thin shells of metal, but rather a series of various fabrics, each serving a different purpose.  The outermost layers will be self healing layers to protect the inhabitants from micrometeorites.Propulsion would HAVE to be a warp drive, which is the only feasible way to approach the speed of light.  It doesn't have to exceed the light barrier to be useful in this case.  They are only traveling 16 light years.Power for propulsion would have to be fusion or matter/anti-matter explosions.Since the astronauts would be awake for most of the journey, emotional and psychological considerations would have to be made.  Romance is an important part of long-term survival, and not knowing which singles will pair up could create tension and fighting.  It's quite likely that only married couples would be allowed to go, at least for the first few missions.Really, the only technological things holding us back is the warp drive, the power for the warp drive, and the money of course.  This ship would probably be hundreds of billions of dollars, depending on the cost of the drive.  Anti-matter right now is the most expensive product we've ever produced, costing tens of billions of dollars per gram.The biggest problem though is the relativistic effect of traveling near the speed of light.  No matter how we slice it, their journey for us would be hundreds of years, even if it's only 30-50 years for them.When can we expect this?  Not any time soon.  Developing a working warp drive will take hundreds of years.  Perhaps a thousand or more.  If we choose to use other means like beams, ion engines, or solar sails, the majority of the journey will be acceleration and deceleration.  It will take decades to accelerate the spacecraft to near the speed of light and the craft will then have to be decelerated back to zero.  The entire journey for the crew will have to be well over 100 years.  That would require hibernation chambers, or multi-generational crews.Multi-generational crews would necessitate making the crew into a small society and that makes the engineering of the craft MUCH more extreme.  Earth society is also not at an ethical stage where it will allow for multi-generational crews.  That means we can't expect this to occur within 200 or 300 years.Therefore, the only feasible alternatives to warp-drive would require hibernation chambers.  Those might be feasible within 100 years.  But, while the journey for the inhabitants might be 100 years, the journey for those people left behind on Earth would be much longer, perhaps 1000 years, or more.  The crew of the first ion-thrust spacecraft might arrive at alpha-centauri only to meet the crew of the warp-drive craft that left Earth 1000 years later.  It would be better to just wait for the warp drive.*If your spinning spaceship is small and you run in one direction, then make a 180° turn, you will fall down.

This limits current space travel to tiny fractions of the speed of light.

That means if we could use such methods to reach out 10 or 15 light years it would take perhaps a thousand years or more to get there.  That just isn't interesting.There are a few propulsion methods that use light to push the craft along.  These include ion drive and solar sails.  Both have the potential to accelerate a craft to near light speed but in a practical sense they just can't get there today.  Solar sails might work nicely when close to a star but in the vast interstellar spaces they won't do much of anything.  Ion drives have a little more potential but still the need for massive amounts of energy to generate even small amounts of thrust make interstellar travel impractical.  Even planetary travel is impractical with this method.I personally think there is potential for faster than light travel.  I don't know how to do it, but I think Einstein made a mistake in his development of his theory of relativity to claim nothing can exceed the speed of light.  I read his book and considered his development of this part of the theory.  I think he misinterpreted his own ""Thought experiment"" and should have concluded there is no way we can ever SEE something go faster than the speed of light.  It is the problem with seeing this phenomenon that I think is the limit rather than actually not being able perform FTL travel.So until we get some super duper drive system that is orders of magnitude better than anything we can even put on a drawing board today we just won't be traveling to the stars.Sorry.",10 followers,Andrew Forrest,1.6K,6.2K,16.8M,2012,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-technology-development-in-a-state-of-stagnation

Identifying the genes in our blueprint is probably a step in the right direction. Also, hibernation just lowers metabolic rate, so people would also need to periodically wake up and there is no evidence that hibernation will extend a person's lifespan, so it would be purely a food/water conservation strategy. Extending a human's lifespan may make such long trips more appealing to more people.- The mean velocity your ship will travel through space will be a function of many factors, including:Further notes on stages as per above:Stage one:Stage two:Large 3D printers print more 3D printers, mining equipment H2O to Oxygen, etc. There are over one million 1km+ asteroids in the inner asteroid belt.The asteroid space base/craft solves a number of problems:- build substantial manufacturing facilities in stable near earth orbits - ie sun-earth, earth-moon Lagrangian points (near earth stable gravity points in resonance with earth's orbit). 2010 TK7 (300m diameter Trogan asteroid) precedes earth at L4 and should be our leading contender for a large scale space base.- Propulsion, you would probably need an atomic source of energy to convert water to liquid hydrogen and oxygen. It would depend on resources were available on the selected asteroid, and what would need to be 'imported'.

These ships would initially handle the trade routes between Earth and Venus etc, but their size and self-sufficieny means they aren't bound to any one solar system. Journeys of centuries become less problematic if you are in a city; most people never leave their home city anyway.Preparing humanity for space can only be done by living there. Our planet's gravity is unforgiving, as the elderly learn the hard way: I would expect research to be gained after we turn the Moon into a retirement home. The lower gravity will enable the elderly to move around and make falls less dangerous. Autopsies on retirees (who will mostly die of old age) will reveal the warning signs of the medical conditions caused by long term life in space, providing the information with no real consequences to the people who get them.Acquiring food etc will be made easier by micro-evolution - adaptions that help a plant/animal survive in space will encourage their survival/breeding prospects and so spread quickly.
