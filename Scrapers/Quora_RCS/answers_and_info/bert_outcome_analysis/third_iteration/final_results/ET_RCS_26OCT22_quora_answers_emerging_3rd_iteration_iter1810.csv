2,"From what I have read, they have said that the first human to love to 150 years old is alive today so that could be you. Technology wise, I would say nano tech will likely be the best big thing. It is likely to extend life a lot along with genetherapies that are being developed as well. There is a study being done on earthworms that is helping them live 5x their average lifespan.","246,825 followers",Dushka Zapata,2.9K,8.5K,232.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/I-was-born-in-the-year-2005-how-likely-is-it-that-I-will-see-the-year-2100-with-the-help-of-upcoming-technologies
3,Quite likely I would imagine. But you would have a better quality of life by relying on a healthy life style rather than depending on technology to attain your goal.,"84,234 followers",Igor Markov,3.3K,3.9K,49.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/I-was-born-in-the-year-2005-how-likely-is-it-that-I-will-see-the-year-2100-with-the-help-of-upcoming-technologies
4,"It is highly unlikely I will be alive in 2100 as I would be 126 years old at that point.That being said it is difficult to ascertain exactly where science will bring us in the next 80 years. There are scientists studying the process of aging and cell death and deterioration which may eventually develop treatments which extend human life expectancy well beyond what is possible at the moment.There are also a number of people exploring the possibility of uploading a person’s consciousness to a computerized matrix which theoretically would allow people to exist in perpetuity disembodied.These formIt is highly unlikely I will be alive in 2100 as I would be 126 years old at that point.That being said it is difficult to ascertain exactly where science will bring us in the next 80 years.

I am as bothered and baffled by the knowledge of my own finite existence as any one else and so am certainly curious about the prospect of “living” forever, or for a very long time.I do wonder though what that existence would be like, what it might feel like to know I will live to be 200 or my consciousness will never die. I wonder how I might live my life knowing it can be extended beyond what is possible at this moment. I wonder if it would be even remotely enjoyable, or meaningful, or joyful to live without a body at all. I wonder how a disembodied consciousness would interact with the embodied world or the artificial world of other disembodied persons. I wonder what my human rights as a disembodied person might be and what my consciousness might be used for. Would anyone even care that I continued to exist within a network of electronically mitigated nodes? I am certainly concerned about the prospect of taking efforts to extend my life by some length only to discover that extension is a miserable existence. Will there be a way to pull the proverbial plug and will that be up to me?","4,692 followers",Michael Forrest Jones,547,1.1K,6.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/I-was-born-in-the-year-2005-how-likely-is-it-that-I-will-see-the-year-2100-with-the-help-of-upcoming-technologies
