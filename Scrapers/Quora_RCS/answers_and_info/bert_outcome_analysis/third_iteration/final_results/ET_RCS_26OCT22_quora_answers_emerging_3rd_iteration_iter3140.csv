Sadly for the paddlers of this quick fix, there’s easier ways to reduce excess, extraneous applicants: Add another step that actually requires more than a click to apply. The biggest problem we have as recruiters: ApathyApathy means that candidates will click with their carefully structured cover letter, their CV that “helpful” websites tell them are optimised for Applicant Tracking Systems” and then move to the next advert.We then have hundreds of applications to review before we can narrow down a list to call. In most cases.To be honest, I’d rather technology step back out of this very human process. We are humans selecting humans based on their capability to be successful in a role. Technology has enabled volumes of applications formerly unheard of and is now offering a technology solution to solving that problem.In some roles, I’ve stopped advertising and just network and headhunt, it’s much easier. I TALK to people. In person.The best and most interesting technology? Do not disturb.

Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party. Because radiation from nuclear accidents is apparently scarier than way more people dying of regular pollution constantly and the total annihilation of all life on Earth as the oceans boil away.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Where-could-I-post-an-ad-online-to-hire-someone-to-create-new-advanced-technologies

That means knowing who you're marketing to, what they want, what they currently have, and how your product fits in.Once you understand that you need to know your audience, you need to consider how you can get to know it. There are plenty of professional tools available, but good old-fashioned research still does the trick. A simple excel sheet with desirable traits, demographics, etc, can provide the basis for you to start going more in-depth, talking to potential targets, and defining your audience more sharply.The next step is to figure out how to reach your audience. You choose based on the behavior of your audience and the nature of the product/business you're promoting. You wouldn't want to advertise diamond rings in a Youtube ad at the beginning of a documentary about blood diamonds. The algorithm might put you precisely there but the reason you have a job is because you're smarter than algorithms. There are several channels to consider, each with its onw set of challenges.First up is SEO. SEO is a never-ending source of frustration for digital marketers and, simultaneously, the love of our lives. SEO can make you feel like Sisyphus pushing that boulder up a hill or it can make you like Zeus raining lightning from Mount Olympus. Good SEO means organic traffic and organic traffic means revenue with no spending which is always great. Assuming your website is monetized - but that's a different story.The second thing you need to master are ads. Ads have been the very basis of marketing since the advent of marketing. Ad targeting, ad placement, even ad design, must be in your arsenal as a digital marketer.The next thing to master is social media. To a digital marketer, social media isn't just another place to upload ads. It's an invaluable opportunity to gather feedback, interact with the audience, and fine-tune your presence. You might even win some long-term contracts if you play your cards right.Last but not least, always remember that your target audience is not a monolith. Every person has their own quirks and desires and passions and you can't 100% match all of them. Your goal is to connect to that one part of them that can improve itself by investing in whatever you're selling.Answered with the help of:",175 followers,Sanya Malhotra,597,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-popular-digital-marketing-methods-of-our-advanced-technology
