This is alluded to when Luke says “If there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.”Plus, over half of the locations we see in the Original Trilogy are mostly uninhabited. Yavin is hidden, secret base, as is Hoth. Endor is inhabited by teddy bears, and Dagobah has a ketamine-fueled frog with terrible grammar. Do you expect these places to have skyscrapers like Coruscant?Finally on our planets list, we have Bespin. Bespin is very technologically advanced. It's literally a massive city hanging in the clouds that’s 400 stories high. Making that is pretty impressive, and is arguably more impressive than anything in the prequels.When it comes to ships, remember that the Rebel Alliance used anything they could find. They stole their Y-Wings bombers and made their X-Wings in suboptimal conditions. The Empire, on the other hand, emphasized fear. Their ships emulated this, by using strong shapes and dark designs instead of sleek edges like on the Naboo fighter.It's also important to remember, when discussing the droid army, that in the Original Trilogy, that it wouldn’t make sense for either faction to use droids. The droid army terrorized the galaxy, and so whoever used them would be villainized in the public eye.The prequels, on the other hand, spend much of their time in the Galactic Core. Here is where most of the credits in the galaxy wind up, and so it is more technologically advanced. The times we do leave we often go to wealthy planets, such as Naboo (whose plasma deposits made them rich) or planets with massive populations (like Geonosis) whose population has the ability to make massive catacombs.Furthermore. The ships we see in the prequels are often direct predecessors of ships in the Original Trilogy. The ARC-170 evolves into the X-Wing, the Venator-class Star Destroyer evolves into the Imperial-class Star Destroyer, and the AT-RT evolves into the AT-ST.In conclusion, the technology of the Prequels often is behind that shown in the Original Trilogy- and when it's not, it makes sense.Stay safe,-Ben*Another answer also noted that Luke’s Prosthetic hand is much advanced than Anakin’s",0 followers,Ben Choucroun,4.1K,1.2K,40.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-long-has-advanced-technology-been-around-in-the-Star-Wars-universe-It-seems-to-have-existed-forever

The Chinese just can't do the same because China is just a manufacturing hub, although the government now blackmails western firms into transferring essential technology before manufacturing in China, but that still doesn't make them more technologically advanced. The Chinese are just more open to new things, so they tend to field newer tech which most times lack quality. The Russian industries on the other hand can build anything, but they are owned and controlled by the government. This makes them modernise or adapt newer techniques at a speed the government dictates instead of the open market.Still, the Chinese are not behind in everything, they have been doing great in telecommunications, but their equipments still use western IPs.In the grand scheme, the Chinese have a better future technologically. This is because they are much more open to the West than Russia. If Russia stays closed in 100 years time like it is today, the Chinese will for sure overtake them.
