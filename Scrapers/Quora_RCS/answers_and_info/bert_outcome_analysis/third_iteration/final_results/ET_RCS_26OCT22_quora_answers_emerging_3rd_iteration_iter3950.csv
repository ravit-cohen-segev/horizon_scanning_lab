0,There is a variation in PHP framework. In Some countries laravel and codeigniter is using mostly and in some countries Core PHP is using.

It’s still fairly crude, and limited by the physical size of the device.I think when we see a way to virtualize the input and output—say by projecting images into ordinary glasses (or better yet, contact lenses), and can give the mobile devices a better idea of what’s around them, we’re going to start seeing an explosion of new uses for the technology that’s as unimaginable to us right now as smartphones were in, say, 1965.Virtualizing the input and output allows the device itself to get as small as the power sourcA2A: No, I don’t think so.

2,"My therapist told me I was asking existential questions a few months ago. She said the questions I asked most people avoided. She was smiling when she said. It felt a little like she was amused. And I remember telling her I couldn’t not ask the questions.The questions were there regardless of what I did. So I might as well face them.Repeatedly she has commented on my honesty.I am beginning to think people don’t go to therapy to be honest.I’m 23.The only future I see right now is the destruction of my earth. I foresee all the things I love, my cats, the trees, flowers, disintegrating because ofMy therapist told me I was asking existential questions a few months ago. She said the questions I asked most people avoided. She was smiling when she said. It felt a little like she was amused. And I remember telling her I couldn’t not ask the questions.The questions were there regardless of what I did. So I might as well face them.Repeatedly she has commented on my honesty.I am beginning to think people don’t go to therapy to be honest.I’m 23.The only future I see right now is the destruction of my earth. I foresee all the things I love, my cats, the trees, flowers, disintegrating because of our greed.My Ivy, small, tiny, fierce as she may be, will die.All cats, tiny, big, domestic, wild, are going to die.At first that thought was okay because it was a natural progression of life to me. You live. You die. Okay, got it.But now, now, we’re draining the world of its greenness. This strange complicated paradise we have is being murdered before me. I know at 23 the feline species won’t survive long past my death. They can’t.Humans can’t either. I care oddly less about humans than I do about the cats. Do with that what you will.So I have this weight, a literal world, on my shoulders.Then, then, you add in the earth as it is now. You add in the pandemic. You add in politics. You add in children in cages. You learn about men being suffocated on camera. You discover a birthday party set fire in a state and the sky itself went orange.And everything shifts toward this all consuming grayness.Not only are we murdering all species slowly but surely, we’re also being horrible and miserable to each other while doing it - a “pull your neighbor into the flames with you” mentality.It isn’t like I am somehow exempt, or better, from this mindset. I may try to be.I can vote. I will vote of course. I can actively work on bettering myself. Fighting my innate racism, my unhealthy responses. I can love those around me and be there for them. Give back to the world to the best of my ability.But the entire time, the recurring thought that surfaces: all our cats will be dead in a few centuries because of my species.I don’t know what to do with that reality.I don’t have any real hope within me. Just mourning.So I ask my therapist my questions. I read my books. I try to do what I can. But at 23, I don’t think I should be here yet. Is everyone here? Are we all locked in this train and seeing the crash looming ahead of us?I am not some hero with a story who can force the world to change. I am one woman among millions and I’m trying.But I’m tired.I’m scared of what is going to happen. I grieve it. And I suppose I too want to pull my neighbor into the flames and at least inquire if you feel the heat as well or if I am alone.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Can-novel-technologies-oscillate-between-the-trough-of-disillusionment-and-the-peak-of-inflated-expectations
3,People are going to have very different roles. We will pose questions for AIs to solve and mankind reaps the benifits. For example deep learning is able to produce amazing results beyond all expectations and as the main tool in the AIs program the progress is going to be rapid and amazing.If you understand a topic well enough to layout a problem then you are going to contribute to society exponentially.The other side of the problem is many jobs that require labour are going to disappear. People are going to have hobbies and lots of free time but earnings are going to drop world wide.DevelopedPeople are going to have very different roles.

People are going to have hobbies and lots of free time but earnings are going to drop world wide.Developed countries are now looking to how social security can be changed to be a universal wage. The socialist countries are better poised to examine this kind of question . Some are considering complex economic changes to accommodate this situation sooner rather than later as the progress in deep learning and AIs in just the last twelve months have left experimenters dumbfounded at the performance of these types of coding.So we may soon have our lives layed out for us study hobbies and a universal basic wage to compensate for the lack of work available.,"284,850 followers",James Altucher,992,878,91.7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Which-framework-is-currently-at-its-peak-in-web-development
4,"Hopefully. It certain did before. In the 19th century the majority of Americans worked on farms. Today it is like 2%. So, the majority of jobs from, say, 1850, were eliminated. We’re all better off for this. Working on a farm sucks. It is grueling, smelly work. I know. My grandfather had a dairy farm and I spent a summer on it when I ...",36 followers,Adam Ambrozy,579,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Can-novel-technologies-oscillate-between-the-trough-of-disillusionment-and-the-peak-of-inflated-expectations
