0,As of the current market and trends in for the Flutter future is bright but if you think that flutter technology only for the future it's not that much good to think.

3,"Yes and no. Already confused? OK, let me explain.A very simple technology can be revolutionary. And it could be fairly easy to build. You wouldn’t need a wizard of a genius to build it. Example: Facebook.A very complex piece of technology, poised to replace a major piece of the Internet, like, for example, Email, can take a lot of smart people, building an extremily complex product, with amazing features, but it could flop. Example: Google Wave.Why? Because the “revolutionary” part has nothing to do with the “revolution”. The “revolutionary” part has to do with how well you provide a solutionYes and no.

The hardest thing is to make up a revolutionary new idea, to invent something that is wasn’t made before or something that has been developed but it’s not just as cool as we want to.","20,847 followers",Alan Mellor,727,12.3K,63.8M,2016,https://www.quora.com/How-significant-and-or-revolutionary-is-Flutter-as-a-software-development-technology

6,"Because it gets difficult.Simple amateur coding is trivial and most people can do it. Making an Excel spreadsheet, probably making ten or twenty lines of code in a programming language is something most people could do I think.As a job, two factors mess that up:Because it gets difficult.Simple amateur coding is trivial and most people can do it. Making an Excel spreadsheet, probably making ten or twenty lines of code in a programming language is something most people could do I think.As a job, two factors mess that up:That bit is hard.And then, we want to do better as professionals.We want our code to have automated tests, which changes how you design it a bit.We want it to be easy to deploy to computers, so you have to design that in.We want it free from security holes, to keep data safe.We want to never corrupt any data.We want our colleagues to easily read and easily change our code, which needs designing in.We want our code to be robust and correctly handle bad data, bad user input and anything else ‘unexpected’. We have to learn to expect that.Those bits are pretty hard, too.Then, our bosses want to know when all that is going to be ready, so they can plan around it. Once the TV advert goes live, that software better be running.That’s hard.We have to juggle competing priorities of adding features, managing tech debt and fixing bugs.There’s no right answer for that. Somebody is always disappointed.We have to cope with floods of new users and feature requests that are difficult to build. The whole ‘scalability’ piece is hard.The code needs to stay running 24/7 or close to it - even if half the computers, disk drives, cooling systems, internet switches and electrical power fails.That adds a bit of trickyness for sure.We need to use existing libraries wherever we can, so we need to understand code we’ve not written. Tricky. But trickier still, we need to be part-time lawyers, because we have to check we are legally allowed to use that code without it affecting the business.We need to remember somebody pays for all the computing our code runs on, so we have to make it play nice.We have to work for and with people who range from fantastic humans to the sort you’d rather not spend time with. And with all ranges of skill levels.That’s a real mixed bag.We have to know so much about computing, engineering, the problem area we are solving, testing.Coding isn’t hard - if you are left alone to code what you want, when you want, how you want and keep the option to just give up when it gets too hard.That’s the really hard bit: we can’t do that.",UNKNOWN,J.

Just the simulation of sunlight in the GTA-V ‘world’ is an astoundingly complex thing.And that’s just the SOFTWARE complexity.Add in all of the crazy number of 3D models that have to be built, the number of sound effects, voice acting sessions, music!I read somewhere that getting all of the music used in the game licensed was so hard that there were more Intellectual Property lawyers employed in the making of the game than there were programmers!So I think it’s safe to say that video games are",96 followers,Kevin Hongtongsak,5.6K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-hard-is-it-to-program-create-a-revolutionary-new-software-technology

9,In my opinion the most revolutionary event in the World should be how the electric energy can be created from out of space. I read that some military experiments are being done which is perhaps fiction for the time being where immense amount of satelites will “circulate” around the Earth all of them equipped with huge solat panels that produce electric energy in a much more efficient way than at the surface of the Earth. Each satelite also has a emitter of ultrasounds that sends the waves to receptors located at the surface of the Earth which convert the ultrasounds into electricity again andIn my opinion the most revolutionary event in the World should be how the electric energy can be created from out of space.
