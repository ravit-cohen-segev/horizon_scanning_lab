1,The plant would continue to produce power. The only problem is if the reactor is shut down during this period in which case they will simply use their on-site diesel generators to power their cool down systems. No problem.These generators have on the order of a weeks worth of fuel. Then they simply bring in more.,"29,975 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,528,7.7K,249.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-there-were-a-long-term-power-outage-at-a-nuclear-reactor

Simpler uranium fission designs (maybe 1st and 2nd gen?) require ""active cooling"" (by inserting neutron-absorbing control rods between the fuel rods) and would proceed to an uncontrolled meltdown, like Three Mile Island and Fukushima. The movie ""The China syndrome"" explores this scenario.Note: Not sure if this was the exact mechanism in Chernobyl, it was possibly rather a steam explosion due to a failed experiment with changing the operating parameters outside the safe values, causing more or less similar outcomes as a so-called ""dirty bomb"" across large parts of Northern and Eastern Europe.Such steam explosions also happened (in the cooling ponds for spent fuel rods I believe?) at Fukushima, by the way, again causing ""dirty bomb"" effects of spreading radioactive material which polluted the surrounding areas.2. More modern uranium fission designs (maybe 3rd and 4th gen?) will have fail-safes in place that shut down the fission reactions (e.g. control rods slide down between fuel rods by gravity, unless held up by a powered mechanism).3. Also modern designs have additional safety mechanisms for stopping and encasing the products of an uncontrolled meltdown in case it should happen, to avoid the results of Chernobyl and Fukushima.4. Fission ""breeder"" reactors using ""spent fuel rods"" from regular fission designs (containing plutonium and other elements resulting from the fission process in addition to unaffected uranium) are probably similar to modern designs above, but I mention them separately due to this distinction. Reusing fuel rods a second time gets more energy out of them before being treated as nuclear easte, but the associated risks and costs of handling highly radioactive material makes the concept of breeder reactors less attractive.5. Proposed fission designs using thorium instead of uranium depend on lots of power to maintain a high operating temperature (often using molten sodium at 900 degrees Celsius), and will immediately shut down in case of power loss.6. Proposed hydrogen fusion designs would also require a lot of power input in order to maintain and contain the plasma (e.g. in the famous tokamak or ""donut"" geometry employed by the ITER project), and would shut down immediately in case of power failure.Not sure how much damage would be done to the tokamak chamber by the uncontrolled plasma when the magnetic fields holding it in place dissappear, though. The plasma has to be levitated during regular operations as not to touch the chamber walls, since it needs to have a temperature of millions of degrees, similar to the core of the sun, in order to run the fusion reaction.","29,975 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.7K,249.9M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-there-were-a-long-term-power-outage-at-a-nuclear-reactor
3,"It comes down to surface area/volume ratio.The energy produced depends upon the volume of the plasma contained and undergoing fusion.The continuous supply of energy is to replace the energy lost from the plasma- it loses this through the surface. So a greater surface area means more energy is lost so more needs to be put in to maintain the temperature.If a reactor produces as much energy as it produces ie at breakeven point energetically, then:-If you double the dimensions of the reactor, the surface area goes up by x 4 and the volume increases by x8.If you go 10x the size then area goes up byIt comes down to surface area/volume ratio.The energy produced depends upon the volume of the plasma contained and undergoing fusion.The continuous supply of energy is to replace the energy lost from the plasma- it loses this through the surface.

Making a bigger reactor increases the enegy demand a bit but increases the output a lot.The JET fusion reactor was known to be too small to break even, it was designed as a piece of kit to carry out expeiments. The results of the experiments have informed the design of the larger ITER being built in France.

4,"Fusion does not want to occur: All atomic nuclei possess a positive charge bias due to containing protons; the resulting mutual repulsion separating nuclei must be overcome in order to fuse them.When humans attempt to perform thermonuclear fusion, we lack the energy advantage which stars possess in abundance: Reliably intense heat resultant from crushing pressures generated by the intense gravity of vast stellar mass.

With the exception of hydrogen bombs which are triggered via atomic fission explosives, all viable fusion devices currently consume electricity, either to power electromagnets (Tokamak's) or lasers (ICF's). At the scale of current testbeds, these mechanisms simply consume more electrical energy than they produce.Fortunately, this is a technological challenge moreso than a natural one, and there are experimental reactors on the horizon which may be large enough to break the energy deficit via economy of scale (research ITER). At the same time, cleverly elegant designs intended to convert inertial energy of quickly moving ions into augmented containment and bonus reaction energy are currently being tested (research “The Stellarator”).Depicted below, the HSX Fusion Stellarator experiment.","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-there-were-a-long-term-power-outage-at-a-nuclear-reactor

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but itThere’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), andI hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be. It should be considered like the Manhattan project or Apollo programme but way,It should be awe inspiring, and I hope I’ve conveyed a little of that awe.Here’s a photo of the pit in which they’re building the core at ITER. For scale, there is a person standing on the extreme left of the image about halfway down (9 o’clock position). The pressure vessel (the first section of which is complete and slowly making its way into this pit) will contain more steel than the Eiffel tower. Once running, the core will be the hottest place in the solar system, in fact it’ll be hotter than anywhere within around 100 light years of Earth as only blue supergiant stars get this hot at their cores.And ITER is just the small scale prototype. A final generating power plant will be significantly larger.I hope that blows your mind at least a little.",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,202.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-there-were-a-long-term-power-outage-at-a-nuclear-reactor

The tortuous process of getting energy out of the core transforms that energy so that the overall energy output allows life to thrive here on Earth.Thermonuclear bombsWe play a few tricks to get “hydrogen” bombs to work.Even with all that, we have a reaction that lasts only for milliseconds. We can’t control the energy output, and we just get a massive explosion.Fusion reactions in the labWe can make fusion reactions happen in labs [1], and we’ve been doing it for about a century. We need conditions of enormous temperature and enormous pressure, but if we simply want to do experiments, we can do that for a short time. Maintaining those conditions for prolonged times is difficult, but it’s doable. Unfortunately, it takes a lot of energy to keep a plasma both hot and contained.“Hydrogen fusion” (actually D-D or D-T reactions) releases an incredible amount of energy. In principle, there should be enough to keep the reaction going, along with more energy we can use. The problem is that we lose enormous amounts of energy in our reactors. As soon as the plasma comes close to the reactor enclosure, it will cool. We’ve tried a few ways to handle that problem. The most well known type of fusion reactor, theSo far, we’ve been able achieve, and even go beyond, the break-even point, where energy output equals energy input. We haven’t been able to do that for longer than fractions of a second. It’s been too difficult to keep energy losses from ruining the necessary conditions.The obvious question is: can we build a fusion power generator? It’s more of an engineering problem than an scientific one, but it’s turning out to be a difficult one.

8,"Fusion of two hydrogen nuclei into helium releases large amount of energy. The issue is how to cause two hydrogen nuclei to collide and fuse. Each nucleus in a typical fusion reactor contains one positively charge proton and two or three neutrons. Two nuclei of the same electric charge repel each other thus they tend to miss each other and not fuse. The way to overcome this repulsion is to shoot them at each other at high speed. This is actually quite easy to demonstrate as it is possible to use high voltage (20,000 volts will do) to accelerate the hydrogen nucleus to fusion speed.

This is actually quite easy to demonstrate as it is possible to use high voltage (20,000 volts will do) to accelerate the hydrogen nucleus to fusion speed. If 20,000 volts seems high, this is the voltage that a regular car spark plug requires thus it is easy to achieve. The catch is the extremely low yield. Each nucleus consumes energy (20,000 electron-volt in our example) yet only a small fraction of them hit and fuse. although each nucleus that does fuse outputs 7 million electron-volt of energy, the small percentage of successes keeps the yield very low with that acceleration technique.The challenge is to overcome the low yield with a series of tricks. First, put those hydrogen nuclei in pellets and shine them with ultra high power lasers that will cause them to implode . As the pellet get smaller and more dense the chance of hitting and fusing increases. The lasers also produce intense heat that accelerates the nuclei into the fusion. That works but the yield is still insufficient although approaching 100%.We have just skimmed the surface of this tremendous subject. There are issue with controlling the exploded pellets (“plasma stabilization”) and once the heat is produced it is not that simple to convert it to electricity in an efficient way.When will they crack the puzzle? In the last twenty years it has always been “just behind the corner”. The success time is unpredictable as new challenges are discovered whenever the previous one are overcome. Some governments are about to give up however the promise of huge amounts of clean energy keeps the competition to be the first with efficient reactors ongoing.",0 followers,John Holmes,826,1.2K,784.1K,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-there-were-a-long-term-power-outage-at-a-nuclear-reactor
9,"They usually don’t. A reactor experiences a meltdown when it loses cooling.

It would not make it out of the containment building. In all likelihood it would not leave the reactor vessel itself.Here is a brief list of actual commercial power reactor core meltdowns (some may disagree on the list):• The 1966 Enrico Fermi meltdown killed no one. No one was displaced.• The 1967 Windscale meltdown killed no one. No one was displaced.• The 1977 KS 150 meltdown killed no one.

No one was displaced.• The 1986 Chernobyl meltdown killed dozens; eventually thousands may die. Many thousands of people were permanently displaced.• The 2011 Fukushima meltdown killed no one due to radiation. Thousands of people were temporarily displaced; many were displaced permanently.Note that Chernobyl really is no longer relevant because its main problem was poor design that no one would build today.

Lets look at the mass of the reactants and products.Deuterium:Tritium:Helium-4:Neutron:Lets sum the mass of the reactants and the mass of the products.ΣΣThe difference in those values isSo what happened to that mass? We all know that conservation of mass is a thing, so what gives? Well mass has still been conserved, but we must look at things through the eyes of relativity. UsingNow lets look at splitting Uranium-235 (U-235) by shooting a free neutron into its nuclei; the nuclei splits and one of the outcomes that is possible which we will be exploring further with is Krypton 92 (Kr-92), Barium 141 (Ba-141), and 3 free neutrons.mmmmΣΣThe difference isSo already we can see that fusion has its advantages in energy production, but what else is advantageous about fusion reactors? The most heavily pursued type right now uses superconducting magnets to confine a hot plasma of the hydrogen isotopes allowing them to fuse together into helium. If the reaction gets out of hand and can no longer be contained the hot plasma will damage the superconducting magnets causing the inwards acting pressure to cease. The hot plasma can then diffuse, expanding and cooling rapidly; in an instant it is no longer hot enough for the hydrogen nuclei to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between them meaning they cannot fuse. In short, a runaway nuclear reaction causing a meltdown has no where near the catastrophic consequences of a fission reactor meltdown like Chernobyl.Tokamak fusion reactor. The hollowed out chamber houses the plasma and is surrounded by superconducting magnetsChernobylOne last final point worth mentioning. The radioactivity of the products. U-235 has a half life of 703.8 million years. A one kilogram block of U-235 takes 703.8 million years to decay to the point that only half a kilogram of the material remaining is U-235, with the other half kilogram having decayed into lighter elements.Decay curve of U-235; y=mass x=time in yearsSame graph but looking at just the first 100 years. Notice how there is negligible change in mass. I could have a kilogram of nuclear reactor fuel sitting next to me for my entire lifespan and receive a negligible amount of radiation.The products of this reaction are Kr-92 and Ba-141, which have half lives of 210ms and 18.27mins respectively. These further break down into other radioactive isotopes with varying decay rates. For example, Cesium-137 has a half life of about 30 years. After a hundred years a kilogram sample of the products of nuclear fission will have decayed into ridiculously small amounts (calculate it if you want, but the specifics aren't relevant for this) with me receiving an incredibly lethal dose of radiation.The threat determined by half life figures goes contrary to the usual rule of thumb as a safer value will be in one of the extremes but anywhere in the middle and the threat posed is far higher. Extremely short half life (e.g. 210ms for Kr-92) isotopes release radiation at a high rate but decay so quickly that after the material is kept safely stored for a short duration of time so little of it remains that the emission rate will have dropped to a far more acceptable level. Extremely long half lives (e.g. 700 million years for U-235) release radiation at such a slow rate at any given point its effects are negligible. If the half life is neither extremely long or short (e.g. 12 years for tritium), its going to emit radiation at a dangerous rate and continue to do so for a not so insignificant amount of time.Deuterium is a stable isotope and Tritium has a half life of 12.32 years. The products are Helium-4 which is a stable isotope and a free neutron which decays into energy (photons) in about 10 mins, at which point its products can no longer undergo further radioactive decay. In other words, fission reactors take an isotope that isn't very dangerous and produces highly dangerous waste while fusion reactors would take a highly dangerous fuel and produce relatively safe products.I’ll let you decide which is better.","220,640 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,783.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-there-were-a-long-term-power-outage-at-a-nuclear-reactor
