0,"The short answer is, in my opinion, no.Someday we may, in theory, approach a limit to our knowledge of physics, biology and other sciences (should we ever reach such an advanced level of civilization). I don’t know if we will, but let’s assume such a point exists.All of our technology certainly depends on our knowledge of science, but is not strictly limited by it. It’s limited only by how we have applied that knowledge. Many of our recent advances are a result of simply doing more with the basics which we’ve known for quite a while. Recent advances in many technologies came about only becauseThe short answer is, in my opinion, no.Someday we may, in theory, approach a limit to our knowledge of physics, biology and other sciences (should we ever reach such an advanced level of civilization).

It’s limited only by how we have applied that knowledge. Many of our recent advances are a result of simply doing more with the basics which we’ve known for quite a while. Recent advances in many technologies came about only because of advances in other technologies; they didn’t depend on fundamental breakthroughs in things like theoretical physics.For example, recent developments in artificial intelligence are due to the existence of large amounts of data and more powerful computers, which resulted from the growth of the internet and incremental progress in computing hardware. The basic software techniques existed a few decades ago.The advance of technology has always been an uneven and unpredictable process, steadily building upon its ever changing self. Humans have always been ingenious inventors, so I don’t see us ever running into a limit.",336 followers,Gustaf Broman,3.8K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-limit-to-technological-progress
1,"Meet David Goggins:* Goggins has completed over 60 ultra-marathons, triathlons, and ultra-triathlonsBut he wasn’t always callMeet David Goggins:* Goggins has completed over 60 ultra-marathons, triathlons, and ultra-triathlonsBut he wasn’t always called “the toughest man alive”.In fact, he used to look like this:Here’s what he says:> 17 yrs ago I joined the Navy. I had no money, no self-esteem, lacked confidence, was insecure, afraid of the water, unsure, uncertain and, by the way, 100 pounds overweight. [2]Getting beat down is a part of life, so you better learn how to pick yourself up. To fail and recommit, each time a little bit easier than the last. As Goggins would have said; hardships callouses the mind.In his book, Can't Hurt Me (read it), he talks about how he's learned to be brutally honest with himself. He has this exercise he calls the “accountability mirror”, which he began as a teenager growing up in an abusive family.You simply stare into a mirror and brutally CALL YOURSELF OUT. Goggins would look at his reflection and say,> You’re fat, you’re lazy, and you’re a liar. What are you going to do about it?And when he couldn't pass any of his reading classes in the military he would somewhat comically tell himself:> Goggins, you're a dumb motherfucker.Roger that. Read it again.To be brutally honest about your weaknesses and then get to work.But can't this become a dangerous, toxic game to play? Can't this self-honesty turn into self-loathing? Being too hard on youreself?Yes....",1 follower,Chukwuebuka Sunday,953,266,85.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-limit-to-technological-progress
2,"Technology will continue to improve. I would ask what will be the next focus of innovation?Over the past 30 years the focus of innovation has continually shifted: personal computers, desktop publishing, the Internet, digital life-style accessories (cameras, iPods, GPS), and now mobile computing.At each transition, technology has played a role in enabling what’s next, but there’s also choice and a killer app that addresses some real need or desire. It’s not easy to tell what’s next until something truly innovative and disruptive appears. There seems to be some interest in Augmented Reality (AR)Technology will continue to improve.

It’s not easy to tell what’s next until something truly innovative and disruptive appears. There seems to be some interest in Augmented Reality (AR), Home Automation (HA), a maker revolution, and computer assisted health care. As the iPhone gains in compute power and specialized silicon (neural engine for example), there could be another killer app lurking.Personally, I don’t see any of these as big enough. The problems that need to be solved are safe clean energy, clean water, food, compassion, bringing people together, and peace.",652 followers,Al Barleta,3.4K,219,1.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-limit-to-technological-progress

At the very least, we can expect improvements to CPU’s and GPU’s every year.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-limit-to-technological-progress

5,"Assuming our civilization populated by individuals is ongoing, the inventions have barely started.Conversely, if tribal-group think norms gain more and more penetration into the psyche of Sapiens (think progressive education), expect the retrograde of technology.Reality is unforgiving and political strong men waving weapons in order to gain power over peoples’ lives does not bode well for the future.Carver Wrightmanalias",269 followers,Karthik Reddy L,16K,0,0,2022,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-limit-to-technological-progress
6,"There is no upper limit to the invention of humans…The invention of nuclear weapons has been probably the “destruction limit” although the destruction of the entire planet by pollution may be an even worse “invention.”As social creatures, we have “invented” laws, and laws were supposed to safeguard us from what is going on: too much useless gadgetry, too many smartphones, etc.There is no peak. There is no chance for any a cap. Money-making has taken over common sense.Pollution is only a side product of money-making by all means possible…","9,587 followers",Max Searle,2.1K,82,6.7M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-limit-to-technological-progress
