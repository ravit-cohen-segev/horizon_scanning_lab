Have a look at the following image (BTC in blue and ETH in black).You’ll notice that during the crash there (March 2020) ETH fell more than BTC, but ultimately bounced a lot higher. If you compare them a little more closely, you’ll see that BTC bounced back first and started running up first.How much sooner?About 1 - 2 weeks. And yes, we are presently in a market where BTC is moving up, so that if history repeats itself, then this will strategy probably will too.You can find similar phenomena everywhere. Here’s oil (in black) and APA oil’s stock price (in blue).(Oil is easy to understand. Price per barrel up = oil stock prices up. That’s why I’ve been bubble trading it for quite a while.Cryptos are the same, and BTC has traditionally been the lead indicator. In the Green Energy space, that indicator is probably Tesla. With cannabis, it’s probably Canopy Growth Company (this industry is more complex).You get the idea.What I’m calling the down chain strategy just develops this point.#2 Conceptual ImplicationHere’s an image of Ethereum (in colored bars) and Uniswap in black.Uniswap is the main decentralized exchange on Ethereum. What you’ll notice is that ETH moved up first, then UNI moved up about 2 weeks later with a far more massive upswing.So, it’s like using lead indicators, but a little different. UniswapIn short, if you are going to buy ETH a conceptual implication of that bet is on Uniswap. The only difference is that UNI is going to move more (because smaller) and a little later (because ETH’s success is primary).Concluding ThoughtsI’ve just walked through the basic idea: if you are committed to a main platform coin like Ethereum, then you are committed to theThose down chain coins are far more volatile and can easily 2x your returns in the same conceptual bet. I got 11x on UNI before the May crash during a period where I got only 5x on ETH.You can do this for LUNA - SPEC, Orion Money.You can do this for SOL - RAYYou can do this for AVAX - PNGYou get the idea. In each case, your safer buy is the main chain coin, but adding the down chain coin makes sense if you’re committed to that project.In fact, with my coaching clients, this sort of optimization analysis is usually where we start. No changes in any main bets, just better optimization of those bets. (No I’m not linking my coaching services, you can just look up The Art of The Bubble on Patreon. I only link free stuff here on Quora).Hope that helps.Happy Trading!!Edit: this question seems to have changed from when I wrote it originally.

Given the inherent volatility of crypto assets, most involve a high degree of risk while others require domain knowledge or expertise.InvestingInvesting is usually associated with taking a long-term view by buying and holding assets for some time. Crypto assets are generally well suited to a buy and hold strategy. They are extremely volatile in the short term but have tremendous long-term potential. Research by investment firm Fundstrat shows that the majority of Bitcoin gains come in the 10 best trading days of the year. In fact, missing these days every year between 2013 and 2018 would result in a negative 44 per cent annual return.Because of this inherent volatility, long-term investing is one of the better approaches to make money through cryptocurrency. As with any investment, crypto should be considered in the portfolio context based on your investment goals and risk tolerance.Trading cryptocurrency for profitThe main difference between trading and investing is the time horizon. While investing is a long-term endeavour, trading is meant to exploit short-term opportunities. Trading cryptocurrencies requires certain skills and experience. Specifically, the ability to read charts and understand technical indicators. Having an in-depth knowledge of blockchain and different projects, however, is not required. This way of making money is more about understanding the price action in the historical context and using that to predict future prices, often on a short-term basis.To make money online trading cryptocurrency, investors can either buy and sell actual crypto coins or use derivatives instead, such as a contract for difference (CFD). When you trade crypto using CFDs , you speculate on the direction of the underlying asset’s prices without actually owning it.You can either take a long or short position, depending on whether you expect the price of an asset to rise or fall. Therefore, CFDs give you an opportunity to profit from both bullish and bearish price movements in underlying securities.Trade Bitcoin to US Dollar - BTC/USD CFDCFDs allow trading on margin, providing you with greater liquidity and easier execution. However, note that CFDs are a leveraged product; therefore, profits, as well as losses, are magnified.Get more info:",114 followers,Hemant Sharma,16.7K,151,2.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-do-individuals-make-money-from-the-cryptocurrency-industry

Mostly they will only trade fiat for BTC/ETH (and occasionally NEO and Monero). So to buy an altcoin like WAN, the vast majority of people will buy BTC with real money, and then exchange that BTC for WAN. The door in, and the door out of crypto is mostly through BTC (and to a lesser extent ETH).There are many pretenders to the “ecosystem” throne currently occupied by Ethereum, (NEO, Tron, Stellar, EOS to name but a few) and the eventual winner is uncertain.

16,"There are many different benefits to these digital currencies. In this section, we'll give a high-level overview of some of the most significant advantages of cryptocurrencies.SecureOne of the most substantial benefits of cryptocurrency is the security of the digital currencies. The reason that they are so safe is thanks to the cryptography system that is utilized. Think of cryptography like a massive digital puzzle system that's impossible to crack. Unless you have a private key for your cryptocurrencies, you won't be able to sell it or send them elsewhere.FastCryptocurrencies are also extremThere are many different benefits to these digital currencies.

Unless you have a private key for your cryptocurrencies, you won't be able to sell it or send them elsewhere.FastCryptocurrencies are also extremely fast. Unlike some payment methods like bank transfers and checks that can take days or weeks to clear, the majority of crypto transactions are concluded within a matter of minutes. Thanks to this, cryptocurrency can be an excellent choice when you need to send or receive money in a flash.Global CurrencyWhen you take a trip to England, you'll have to deal in their local currency, the Great British Pound (GBP). While there, that currency will get you everything you need. However, if you head back to the United States, the money isn't useful for much other than exchange. If you try to go into your local grocery shop to buy groceries with GBP funds, you'll get a funny look from the cashier. The same is true for all global currencies out there. Unless you're in a region that accepts that currency, you can't purchase anything with it.However, with cryptocurrencies, that's not the case. Cryptocurrency is a global currency that can be sent and spent around the globe. There are all kinds of different places around the world that will accept digital currency. We'll cover some of the more popular ones in a later question below.In-Person and Remote CapableMuch like credit cards and PayPal, cryptocurrencies can be used both for in-person transactions as well as remote ones. The beauty of these digital currencies is that they will work just as well for you at a local restaurant as they would sending funds to someone on the other side of the globe. Thanks to these properties, cryptocurrencies are very versatile banking options.DecentralizedOne of the main properties of traditional money is that it is tied to some form of government. US dollars fall under the US government, while the Euro currency falls under the European Union. Because of the relation to countries or unions, these standard currencies are overseen by the governments. That means that the governing bodies are in control of things like supply and rates.However, cryptocurrencies are decentralized. One of the best perks of these digital currencies is that no governments have a say in what's happening with them. Instead, cryptos are overseen through a peer-to-peer internet-based protocol.Firstly I will recommend CryptoExchangeFX Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www.cryptoexchangefx,com) as it is relatively new (launched at mid-summer 2017) but has become the largest cryptocurrency Investment Platform there is right now (total volume over 1.2 billion dollars) where you get 20% profit of your invested cryptocurrency after 10 days.

It supports variety of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin and other Altcoins. I find that it has a really nice UI and support.Better SecurityUnlike traditional payments, like cash and credit cards, cryptocurrencies are digital and encrypted; you cannot be ripped off in a transaction like you can be with legacy payment systems, and it is much harder to steal cryptocurrency compared to a wallet full cash. In a world where so many of our transactions are online, and our savings and credit rating are at stake at all times, anything that provides increased transactional security is a plus. And there is currently no transaction mechanism that is currently more safe and secure than those that use cryptocurrency.Cut Out the MiddlemanAnother great benefit of using cryptocurrency, especially when purchasing real property, is that digital currency can help eliminate expensive brokers, lawyers, and other typical “middlemen” who inevitably raise the costs of already expensive transactions. Cryptocurrency can essentially act like “a large property rights database”, according to one financial expert, and can be used to execute and enforce two-party contracts on items like real estate and automobiles, thus eliminating expensive brokerage and legal fees.Access to Everyone in Every MarketAs more people, including billions of people in the developing world, increasingly use mobile devices linked to the Internet to conduct financial transactions, cryptocurrency is truly going to come into its own. All cryptocurrency is designed for low cost, no-fee transactions, so undoubtedly these digital currencies will become increasingly popular as more people have access to mobile devices to conduct financial transactions. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, mobile phone technology spread rapidly through the developing world, and saturated markets where standard landline telephones had never been established; cryptocurrency is poised to do the same exact thing.Universal RecognitionIf you do business globally, or travel frequently, you are often exposed to exchange rate risk; that is, the transaction can be affected by currency exchange rates. You may also be subject to fees associated with exchanging one currency for another, or find challenges in exchanging currency altogether. Fortunately, with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, that is a non-issue, as the digital currency is universally recognized at a given value. This helps to save time in determining a price for a transaction, as well as any fees associated with exchanging money from one form to another. As cryptocurrency is increasingly adopted around the world, it is going to make financial transactions faster and simpler, which is a great thing for everyone involved.You Are in the Driver’s SeatOne of the best things about cryptocurrency is that, unlike virtually any other type of money retaining system (save for a wall safe or your wallet) you totally own it. Think about it: most traditional liquid asset systems – banks, credit unions, brokerage houses, or even high tech ones like PayPal – take control of your funds and leave you subject to their terms of service. If they decide that you have violated those terms, they can suspend your account. They can change their terms of service, and cause you to have to pay more or receive fewer funds for important transactions. With cryptocurrency, you retain all of the funds on hand, so to speak, digitally, with no third party involvement; the only one who can change the terms of your cryptocurrency use is YOU.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,1.4K,996,156.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-do-individuals-make-money-from-the-cryptocurrency-industry

I almost gave up too until I came across {1. Easier International TradeThough largely unrecognized as legal tender on national levels at present, cryptocurrencies by their very nature are not subject to the exchange rates, interest rates, transactions charges, or other levies imposed by a specific country.And using the peer-to-peer mechanism of the blockchain technology, cross-border transfers and transactions may be conducted without complications over currency exchange fluctuations, and the like.2. Individual OwnershipIn a traditional banking or credit card system, you effectively turn stewardship of your funds over to a third party that can exercise the power of life or death over your assets. Accounts may be closed without notice for infringements of a financial institution’s Terms of Service – requiring you as the account holder to jump through hoops in order to get yourself back into the system.3. AdaptabilityThere are currently over 1200 unique cryptocurrencies or altcoins in circulation worldwide. Many are quite ephemeral, but a significant proportion have been createdFor example, there are “privacy coins” which help mask your identity on the blockchain, and supply chain tokens which can facilitate supply chain operations for various types of industries.4. Strong SecurityOnce a cryptocurrency transfer has been authorized, it can’t be reversed as in the case of the “charge-back” transactions allowed by credit card companies. This is a hedge against fraud which requires a specific agreement to be made between a buyer and seller regarding refunds in the event of a mistake or returns policy.Finally, the strong encryption techniques employed throughout the distributed ledger (blockchain) and cryptocurrency transaction processes are a safeguard against fraud and account tampering, and guarantors of consumer privacy.","55,750 followers",Loy Machedo,582,5.7K,66.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-do-individuals-make-money-from-the-cryptocurrency-industry

Therefore, some experts believe crypto poses a threat to central banks and national security.So, why should someone risk investing in a currency unregulated by the government and that is subject to potential digital threats?""The benefits of cryptocurrencyWhat are the benefits of cryptocurrency?Cryptocurrency is slowly but surely becoming an popular form of payment.Despite the growing curiosity in crypto, however, governments are cracking down on the digital currency because it is decentralized, meaning it has no central authority in the way the U.S. government holds authority over the dollar. Therefore, some experts believe crypto poses a threat to central banks and national security.So, why should someone risk investing in a currency unregulated by the government and that is subject to potential digital threats?""The benefits of cryptocurrency are many and profound,"" cryptocurrency education company Luno CEO Marcus Swanepoel told FOX Business in a statement. ""We’ve heard how it’s going to solve problems across the current financial system that nothing else could – everything from the truly significant, such as banking the unbanked, to the seemingly trivial, such as providing a more efficient way to buy a car.""No middle manCryptocurrencies don't use middlemen, so transactions are usually easier, faster and require less or no additional transaction fees.Some experts believe, however, that taking out the middle man goes beyond these simple benefits. cryptocurrency has the ability to ""give power back to the people. To eliminate current social structures and systems that disenfranchise individuals. To provide the foundations of a system that’s transparent yet secure. Where corruption is exposed and rampant inflation ended.""More confidentialEach cryptocurrency transaction is a unique exchange between two parties, which protects users from issues like identity theft.""Cryptocurrencies can do this because of the technology that underpins them – blockchain,"" Swanepoel said. ""Blockchain technology is decentralized. This means that no one person, institution or government has central control. Rather, it is the network that is in control. Policies are hardcoded in, and it cannot be manipulated to suit agendas.""This is another reason why governments feel threatened by digital currency. Crypto is more confidential and therefore a favored form of payment among criminals trading illegal goods and services.""The financial system as it exists today is built on trust. But people no longer trust that it exists to help them – that it helps only people working in the industry,"" he said. ""Cryptocurrency removes this need to trust people’s motivations.""Easier international exchangesCryptocurrency offers an opportunity for international business people or parties to make one-on-one exchanges online without the complications and added fees that traditionally come with international currency exchanges that involve third parties.Final thoughtsCryptocurrency is happening now. The currency became a topic of interest when the world witnessed the sudden drastic rise and subsequent fall and steady rise again with Bitcoin between 2017 and 2019. It sparked interest and education. Now, cryptocurrency is becoming more a part of the everyday norm than some people realize.",27 followers,Benjamin Price,1.2K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-do-individuals-make-money-from-the-cryptocurrency-industry
