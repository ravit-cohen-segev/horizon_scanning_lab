0,"Many so called “primitives” don’t want to be “uplifted” to an advanced technological level. One example the Sentinelese.Most remaining hunter-gatherers would rather stay the way the are. They do not see any advantage for “an advanced technological level”. For them it would be a step down to lose their freedom and their cultural integrity, not a ‘step up”.The ethical situation is the lack of respect for an indigenous culture to expose it to the destruction of the modern world.Many so called “primitives” don’t want to be “uplifted” to an advanced technological level.

1,The main ethical problem is designating a group of people as primitives. This designation is unethical and the assumptions that it embodies of themselves generate practical difficulties. In any educational process the assumption has to be that the process id feasible. The designation primitive implies that the questioner does not believe this to be the case.

6,"Sure.The Canadian Army uses the Coleman stove and lanterns based on a design first sold in the 1950s. They could switch to battey powered lanterns and other fuel sources for stoves, but then they would not have heat sources for tents.The Canadian Army uses snowshoes and toboggans. The tech predates European settlement in North America. While there are snowmobiles and ATVs in service nothing competes with the absolute mobility and stealth of snowshoes.Artic tents used by the Canadian Army are at least a 50 years old design.

While there are tents you can use to climb a mountain, non are as rugged as an Army artic tent (you pay for it in weight).Army field ration packaging has not changed much since the 1980s. There are dehydrated foods, but they don’t taste as good and they are a lot more expensive.They still have field phones with hand cranks. You can run out of batteries.Our machetes, axes, and shovels can not be replaced chainsaws and backhoes (we use them), there are not enough chainsaws and backhoes, the require fuel and maintance and there are not as mobile.Airborne forces still use static line parachute systems instead of free fall systems. The basic design dates to WW2.The Canadian engineer knife dates atleast the 1970’s. It is a great design.While we use GPS, I can not imagine a Canadian Infantry Senior NCO or officer leaving his house without a compass based on design from the 1950s.Like wise the Canadian Army will still issue whistles to infantry leaders who want them for signalling. Though most use a Fox40. At least a twenty year old design. Pen flares, about the size of a close pin, that use a spring mech to fire date back to at least to the early 80’s but maybe back to the 1950’s.Canadian assault boats look they same as they did in the early 1970’s.Some units still take manual typewiters into the field. They don’t need power and they secure from intercept.We still teach some of our soldiers to canoe.We use thirty and forty year old cross country skis.The M72 light anti-tank rocket (no ones uses it on tanks, but it is ok on light skinned vehicles near it is great for blowing holes through walls was used in Vietnam. It ain’t leaving the system anytime soon.The 50cal MG used by the Canadain Army dates to atleast the 1960’s. It is an awesome weapon.The Canadian Army uses a 50 year old thermos, a sixty year old 1 quart water bottle, a 30 year 2 quarter water bottle, and a 15 year old camelback.They use a forty year fresh food container system (metal not plastic) supplied by a fifty year field kitchen.They use the same stretchers they used during the Korean War.I am sure I can think of more if I took the time.There are, as others pointed out, three reasons for this. They are:There is a lot of equipment. It is very expensive to replace it. Armies focus on the biggest bang for the buck which usually means weapons systems, optics, radars, camouflage and things that will save lives (helmets, vests, medical equipment) before things that will make life more comfortable.Sometimes, primitive is better. It may be more reliable and stronger than the new tech.Third, sometimes, an Army designs the perfect piece of kit or adopts the perfect of piece of kit and nothing new can compete with it (assault boats, pen flares, army rations, hand crank field phones, and knives come to mind).","62,870 followers",Jay Bazzinotti,2.5K,22.2K,179.7M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-military-training-physically-so-challenging-even-in-the-21st-century-despite-having-so-much-advanced-technology-to-do-the-fight

You had to let the tank roll near you, then touch its track with your hand and roll away from it. This was meant to let you get used to being near an armored vehicle.In addition to this, there was a lot of anti-tank training for the infantry. You let a tank roll over you, then got up, climbed on it, and activated a (training) mine. Or, you learned how to make an effective hollow-charge with a champagne bottle and some plastic explosives.My badges from the French Commando course.We also did a lot of hand-to-hand combat training and many, many obstacle courses. Every day, there was a new obstacle course where you had to climb up walls, rappel down with a rope, climb up again, and so on.

Human consciencness is a pattern of information, that changes continually over time.The human body is both an actuator and sensory network attached to the brain. It provides for the input of information to the brain, by means of the five senses. It can act, based on the processed and calculated result of the input data, or based on the processed results of internally stored data.So, there is no arbitrary limit that technically precludes the construction of a more durable apparatus, that the information that constitutes a human consciencness could be transferred to. The form of the apparatus that would serve as a platform that hosts the information that constitutes a consciencness could be a mechanical hardbody, that resembles a human body, or some other shape. It could also be softbody, where the consciencness would exist within a diffuse cloud of subatomic particles with varying energy potentials.Basically, the sky's the limit, and the universe is your friend.
