1,"A2A: No, I don’t think so. In fact, it has a long, long way yet to go, I think. It’s still fairly crude, and limited by the physical size of the device.I think when we see a way to virtualize the input and output—say by projecting images into ordinary glasses (or better yet, contact lenses), and can give the mobile devices a better idea of what’s around them, we’re going to start seeing an explosion of new uses for the technology that’s as unimaginable to us right now as smartphones were in, say, 1965.Virtualizing the input and output allows the device itself to get as small as the power sourcA2A: No, I don’t think so.

2,In that case we are almost certainly all doomed to extinction in the near future.Our long-term survival depends on developing new technology to dig ourselves out of the environmental holes we have dug for ourselves.,0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-technology-that-peaked-quickly-and-didnt-last-as-long-as-people-expected
3,"Yes. Technology would include any tool that has been produced to support human activity. Tools have been produced from the stone age. A stone cutting or scrapping tool is technology and it is surprising how much work is involved to produce these tools. Consider a flint cutting tool. Humans needed to find a source of flint or obsidian, they need to learn how to knap flint to shape. Often they need to attach the stone tool to a handle (this often required other tools or components, such as resin and organic material like twine to keep the cutting tool in place).

This is a complex process. It is technology. We have been producing tools ever since and these have become more and more sophisticated with time.Technology according to the defination is the mechanical arts and application of science. Early people did not have any understanding of modern science, they do however show a sufficient understanding of the mechanical arts to make tools which are MOST definitely technology.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-technology-that-peaked-quickly-and-didnt-last-as-long-as-people-expected
4,"While the industry is progressing rapidly, and we are getting more lumens per watt consumed. This does not include incandescent lamps as they rely on a very old principle and no further progress can be made. I am not sure of LED lamps can be made more efficient, but they can be made better for sure. The main problem LED lamps have is the converter they include. The electronics in LED lamps produces a lot of harmonic emission, which can be removed by installing better filter. But the costs will go up. So while they may be more efficient, they aren’t quite good for the power grid.","17,413 followers",Loring Chien,1.2K,54.9K,129.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-technology-that-peaked-quickly-and-didnt-last-as-long-as-people-expected
5,"The latest generations of LED’s are far better than anything that came before.You can get them in various colours, or even in variable versions.They last far longer.They use much less energyThey don’t heat up the place in the summer","3,671 followers",William Mook,1K,9.3K,12.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-technology-that-peaked-quickly-and-didnt-last-as-long-as-people-expected
6,"No.There may be reputable chemists, mechanical engineers, and such who believe in technologically advanced (that is, equivalent or more sophisticated than our own) ancient civilizations. However, these would necessarily be people operating outside of their field and are speaking with no greater authority than an archaeologist or historian on string theory. No reputable archaeologist or historian believes in such things.",0 followers,Mike Xie,617,1.2K,6.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-technology-that-peaked-quickly-and-didnt-last-as-long-as-people-expected
