At that point their game wouldn’t know how to handle continued refinement.

Everything that humankind invented came from pottery. That’s why archaeologists and palaeontologists get so excited when they find potsherds. They indicate how advanced and how early certain tribes began firing clay. They can also tell the difference between tribes based on the pot design and adornments.A single person alone would have neither time nor energy to start firing, decorating and glazing clay, let alone develop a theory that allows you to make atomic bombs. They won’t design, develop or invent something that isn’t germane to their day-to-day survival.",UNKNOWN,Devin O'Keefe,21.8K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-technologies-that-can-be-recommended-to-build-a-mobile-application

However, I’ll make an effort to get the main points across without delving into the finer details too much. Feel free to leave a comment, or message me directly, if you’re interested in more specific details; including links to relevant research.Firstly, there’s a lot of misinformation surrounding the link between intelligence and IQ. I suspect that you’re primarily interested in intelligence rather than how well people score on an intelligence test, and that you’re also interested in more than the fluid intelligence that IQ assessments measure (which is further limited by what’s useful to know in relation to our education system and employment sector).While I could argue that IQ scores are standardised, and will always have an average of 100 (regardless of changing intelligence levels over time), we can still track trends; by (eg) measuring differences between subsequent pools used when re-standardising individual intelligence assessments.To cover as large a base as possible, I’m going to assume we don’t really care about IQ so much as overall intelligence, which includes the various ways it can be classified; fluid, crystallised, social, emotional, creative, etc.Firstly;There isn’t (as) much of natural selection happening at the moment, particularly when we consider intelligence as a determining factor or catalyst. Outside of inconsistent moments of foolishness, such as someone forgetting to switch off mains power before installing a power socket, the genes for low (or high) intelligence aren’t disappearing from our gene pool in sufficient numbers to have any real effect.The range of genes that contribute to intelligence is largely set, and is unlikely to change in the short to medium term. However, advancing technology (which could include eugenics, designer babies, DNA manipulation, and similar) will eventually have an effect on human intellectual capabilities… but this is still a long way off.The potential benefits of gene manipulation are not likely to be overly dramatic in the beginning. We’re limited by how much of the gene pool we’ve mapped, and our understanding of how associations of genes contribute to intelligence (which is shamefully low at the moment). Even when these steps have been completed, we’re still limited by the genes currently available to us; the majority of beneficial genes (for intelligence) are likely to originate from humans.Meaning, we only have a certain number of ‘lego blocks’ to use when designing a smart human. But placing these strategically is far better than the random allocation we currently rely on.However, I have seen some fascinating research into creating a new type of DNA. Our DNA is comprised of four chemical letters - A T C G which join in various differing combinations to create a linear sequence of nucleotides. Some brilliant (and crazy) bastards have discovered a way to utilise an additional 12 chemical letters which can function in the same way as DNA.Importantly, it would be a mistake to assume this means we can add additional chemical letters to our DNA. But it would eventually be possible toComputers, electronics, and AI:There’s a great deal of potential in utilising artificial components to supplement human intelligence. Granted, this isn’t a direct improvement on our actual intelligence, but it would be an increase in performance; which amounts to the same thing - and we’re not going to debate the semantics here.Elon Musk, as much as I dislike liking the guy, is making some important steps towards computer - brain interfaces. There are a phenomenal number of hurdles that need to be overcome before we’re able to comfortably and seamlessly make use of our brains as a ‘computer peripheral’. One of these is the staggeringly vast array of interconnections between neurons in our brains, and how these can be safely and accurately accessed (which is complicated by non-static nature of neural connections).As an example, when we’re looking at a car engine and have a spare part in our hand, we want the computer to correctly recognise the parts and our intention, and then collect and provide the details necessary to repair the car. Without the use of intuitive and creative AI, we’re going to be limited to the specific tasks that programmers have seen benefit in creating systems for.Despite these, and many other challenges, it’s possible that people will have infinite memory (short, working, and long), along with access to accurate information on any topic. We’d all be similarly intelligent and capable. And this doesn’t factor in additional capabilities, such as (and certainly not limited to) seeing and hearing wavelengths that exceed human limits, being able to communicate ‘telepathically’ with other people, knowing how to perform any job or task, and being able to ‘hear’ music, ‘see’ a movie, and ‘play’ a game at any time.AI, Robotics, and Automation:Currently, nearly everyone needs to work to survive in our world. Our intellectual capabilities are influenced by our society, education system, diet, and theAlso, despite improvements in technology, the number of jobs we have available for people has remained relatively stable over time. Each time AI, automation, and/or robotics have take a job away from us, another (typically more complicated) job has been created, allowing people to participate and earn a living.While we’re not sure if there’s a limit to this, we do know that simple and repetitive jobs are consistently being outsourced to non-human hands. Consequently, there’s an ever increasing need for humans to be educated in order to fill the jobs that are left for us. We need a higher level of knowledge and skills to find a place in the world.I suspect that one of two things will occur, maybe both…Previously, we’ve seen a gradual increase in intelligence over the years, known as the Flynn Effect. This has helped people participate in employment despite the rising intellectual demands of the available jobs. However, we’re no longer seeing a rise in intelligence in developed countries. We’ve achieved the conditions that allow humans to reach our intellectual peak; set by our genes.We’re no longer able to improve our diet, community services, education system, etc in a way that will further increase our intelligence. Something else needs to change.Universal Basic Income:An option that many governments are looking into is a universal basic income, part of which is hoped to reduce the divide between the upper and lower class citizens. However, we’re more focused on this being necessary because we’re anticipating a time where not everyone will be able to find work; through no fault of their own.If such a system is implemented, it will give people more flexibility in what they do with their time. Contrary to what most people believe, humans don’t easily tolerate being ‘worthless’. They need purpose in life to feel like there is meaning in their existence. Many of us go through a mid-life crisis for this reason, despite being successfully employed, married, having raised kids, etc.Take away the option to find meaning in paid employment, and people will strive to find other ways to have influence in the world and interact with others in positive ways.I expect that this will usher in a period of enlightenment… one that utilises the various other forms of intelligence that are so often overlooked by society. We’ll see people creating artwork and entertainment, delving more deeply into ethics and morality, refining spiritual and religious teachings to guide others in more beneficial ways, we’ll see people being more active in supporting the less fortunate and in protesting inequality and corruption, and we’ll see a greater appreciation for the beauty and wonder of human existence.Given the technological advances we’re currently seeing, it wouldn’t be surprising to see people creating, producing, and informing other people ‘at no charge’, with the aid of computers (and potentially AI). Many open source products are already available, which supports the idea that this habit will continue and proliferate when people don’t need to be employed to have some form of income.While I’m not confident that this will equate to a change in people’s intelligence, it will improve on the knowledge, tools, and strategies we have available that are facilitated by forms of intelligence other than crystallised and fluid intelligence. We’ve spent a comparatively long time dedicated to concrete sciences, and there’s a great deal of room for improvement in art, culture, spirituality, ethics, and social interactions.","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,566,6.8K,91.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/We-have-a-guy-alone-on-Earth-with-an-IQ-of-about-98-He-must-still-provide-food-and-shelter-but-you-may-assume-hes-immortal-Sooner-or-later-he-will-develop-tools-and-slowly-technology-Given-enough-time-will-he-ever
