Stable models are genetically modified on-the-fly, mid-course through an invasion. They quickly learn the specifics of others technology and deploy various means to specifically destroy the technology of the enemy. Humanity is finally learning Eldar grav tech, or relearning a tech that has been lost for over 10 thousand years.And don't forget the rariest technology of them all: Psykers. Most races have to use complicated selection processes to guide mating that can result in suitable psykers. They are often a rare and precious gift that is filled with danger and possible destruction, Psykers are a blessing on the battlefield, but an unstable blessing that usually means someone always has a gun ready in case the psyker needs to be ended quickly. For Tyranids, Psykers are plentiful and are unlikely to do anything that would negatively impact the long term goals of the Tyranids. There control of the underlying universemanipulated by psychics is so strong, that they can create a wall that prevents psychic communication through thr barrier from occuring AND causes a low level psychic buzz that is annoying at best, destructively distracting at worst.Their technology has moved beyond the simple and mundane contraptions of steel, to the various essence of life, DNA.Sorry for my spelling, it is midnight and my drowsy meds kicked in halfway through the post.",40 followers,Stephen James Hand,561,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Besides-the-necrons-what-Warhammer-40k-race-has-the-most-advanced-technology

The knowledge used to create the Imperium’s tech is long lost. The only reason the Ad Mech can build more of it is that they have plans printed from STCs which they follow without understanding. In fact, the manufacture and maintenance of this tech is now bound up in religious rituals, some parts of the ritual are essential steps in the process, some are just pointless nonsense, but the Ad Mech priests believe it’s all required.Even worse, culturally, the Imperium and Ad Mech are now suspicious of original scientific and technological research. They believe that humanity achieved technological perfection in the distant past, and the key to advancement is recovering this knowledge, not making new discoveries and advancements. They think original research will lead to heretical and ‘abominable’ technologies. So it is unlikely that they will ever recover the scientific and technical understanding required to advance their current tech.The T’au are a forward looking species that fully understand their own tech, so have none of these problems.Also, the T’au are much more willing to cooperate with other Xenos species and learn from them to accelerate their scientific and technical advancements, whereas in the xenophobic Imperium, even looking too closely at Xenos technology will bring the Inquisition to your door.Basically the T’au are advancing quickly by grimdark standards because they are acting in a way that real 21st century humans would consider normal.

Everyone is dumb in 40k and that’s on purpose.Except the Tau.The Tau are still dumb in some areas, make no mistake. But they appear to have been among the first races which got the more serious treatment that Games Workshop is slowly converting 40k into in order to make it more main stream and easier to accept by the masses. The Tau no longer resemble their initial entry into the franchise (though the Tyranids could be argued to be contenders on seeing the most change I think).The Tau advertise themselves on being a thinking man’s faction. They don’t do stupid shit except in the very few instances where the Imperium does well against them and even then I wonder if the Imperium was actually fighting automated tanks and the like.The Tau use modern tactics and modern thinking of not having front lines, but rather war zones where mobile teams are more interested in completing objectives, taking out key targets, disrupting enemy logistics, etc.. The kind of thinking that we saw transform how warfare was fought when we shifted from WW1 to WW2 and then on to modern wars.By the time the Imperium realizes it needs to take them seriously.. it’s too late. The Tau are prepared, and the Taros Campaign ends in tragedy for the Imperium, seeing ten thousand Imperial Guard dead, thousands more wounded and again so captured. To have lost so many, to have killed so few, and to have gained literally nothing.. the Imperium was thoroughly embarrassed, and this was all just one fight over a single planet. Even with the Tau’s vastly inferior territory size and population, the differences were clear. The Imperium would need to dedicate such a bulk of their forces to any dedicated campaign that unless they could catch the Tau with their pants down there was no way they could muster that kind of force while dealing with the rest of the galaxy’s threats as well. And given the Tau so rarely expand, and when they do they take so little from the Imperium, it means they never dedicate the kind of forces they really need to in order to defeat the Tau when they do play on the defensive.In fact, right now it looks like they aren’t even going to send anyone to try to stop the current expansion at all, sadly. There’s also a time-lost crusade trapped in Tau space and it doesn’t look like they’re going to send them any help either.The Imperium just doesn’t want to deal with the Tau because their tactics and strategies make them so incredibly annoying to deal with and right now the entire galaxy is ripped in half by a warp storm that I think is just constantly vomiting out demons.So there’s your issue. The Imperium is technologically stagnated and tactically and strategically trapped in the 1910’s. The Tau are innovating constantly, and will experiment with new ideas to find novel solutions to easily take down normally serious threats like Imperium Titans. They focus on protecting their lives rather than protecting their territory, and will abandon a point of territory at the drop of a hat so as to tactically reposition, regroup, and then counter strike while you’re vulnerable. If at any point in time you stop to hold your ground instead of pressing aggressively against them, you lose, because you gave them the rest they needed to recollect, and now you’re sitting in a zone they know like the back of their hand. It’s just not feasible for the Imperium to see serious or long standing victories over the Tau as they’re the perfect thematic counter.",81 followers,Bailey Tuttiett,616,176,377.4K,2022,https://www.quora.com/Besides-the-necrons-what-Warhammer-40k-race-has-the-most-advanced-technology

The section below is approximately 10mm in view size.No, these optical lenses…Similar dating, Mount Ida, Crete, ca 1400 BCE, however, this may be when the lenses were stored in the Caves of Minos.

The reinforcement is shown inside and out, if the hull is compromised on rocks, it will delaminate, keeping the hull watertight to make landfall and repair, saving the crew, ship and cargo.

The Athenians kept the white hull ship Theseus returned in, it was on display for centuries as a trophy of Athens increasing power. According to myth, Theseus tried to secure magnetite and got thrown off a cliff on Skyros, a source of Magnetite! Athens didn’t know how to make another white-hull, they fell out of use, it is sufficiently advanced that they were unable to reproduce it.A communication network across the Aegean? Well, they had one according to Homer, the fall of Troy was reported to Argos in a few hours using island fire beacons (Peak Sanctuaries which have line-of-sight between them and are present throughout the entire Aegean), e.g. a message relayed at a few hundred miles per hour using long-distance signals, fires at night, gravity cast flat mirrors called Labyrs (double-axe) in the day.Peak sanctuary above.

Just like iron (and mild steel) rusts, any metal can oxidize. However, aluminum oxide is impenetrable to oxygen. Which means, if you make a thing out of aluminum, and then the surface of it oxidizes, the inside will remain completely pure. There will be only a thin layer of aluminum oxide over an interior that is pure aluminum.I chose aluminum because (unlike iron) heat, gravity, and pressure, are not enough to purify aluminum.Frank Duncan's answer to How is the aluminium purified?To summarize: the ore (called bauxite, for some reason; which is a mixture of aluminum oxide and iron oxide, and sometimes other stuff mixed in) is dissolved in sodium hydroxide. The aluminum oxide dissolves, but the other stuff doesn’t. Then some chemical stuff is done to make the aluminum oxide precipitate out of the solution. Then the aluminum oxide is put into a chamber with two carbon electrodes, and a very strong DC current is run between them. The electricity causes the oxygen in the aluminum oxide to move and bond to carbon from one of the electrodes, forming CO, which is then further oxidized into CO2.I go into all of this detail to show that it is absolutely, completely, totally impossible for any combination of lightning, volcanic activity, or anything else, to make pure aluminum. If we dig up even one single aluminum item, that would prove that ancient people were as advanced as us.“But what if they just didn’t use aluminum?”. Nope. Sorry, any advanced society would ALWAYS use aluminum. How many aluminum items have you been within 20 feet of in the past week (even in Coronavirus quarantine)? I would guess over 1,000. Because aluminum is REALLY useful. Immensely, unbearably, accept-no-substitutes useful. I would risk saying that any society which does not use aluminum is not actually advanced at all.And, as I said above, aluminum does not rust away. If there were advanced ancients, there is 100% certainty that they would have made things out of aluminum, and those things would still exist. We would be digging them up.But, even with all of the lots of digging that modern humans have done, for mines, for building foundations, for tunnels, for underground utilities, etc, we have never found a single piece of ancient aluminum.Now lets talk about plastic. If aluminum is useful, plastic is 10x more useful. Think about how many plastic items you have in your house right now. That isn’t an accident. They are there because you needed a tool to accomplish a certain job, and plastic was the best material anyone could make that tool out of. (Don’t think that an Aquafina water-bottle is a tool? Storing and transporting water is a job, and it is impossible for a human being to do without some type of container, like a clay jug, or an iron pot, or a plastic bottle. Why do you think we are no longer using clay jugs or iron pots?)And, if aluminum is durable, plastic is 10x more durable.If ancient societies were advanced, they would have left piles like this behind, for us to find. Not a bottle here and there, huge mounds like this.Plastic is just too useful to not use.People have been using bio-plastic for for over a thousand years. The three major sources are sumac lacquer, beetle lacquer, and cow horn.Of the three, cow horn was the most easily available, and decently useful, but not good enough. If you boil a cow’s horn in water, it become soft, and you can bend and shape it, and then it will harden again when it cools. But you can’t pour it into a mold.Sumac lacquer is made by boiling down the sap of the sumac tree, the problem is that this releases a horrible neuro-toxic gas. The technicians who did this suffered from horrible chronic pain, and gradually increasing paralysis, until they eventually died young. But the material was so valuable that people did that job anyway! Once you have boiled the sap down enough, you have a type of plastic which can be used to make all kinds of useful things, and reheating it to melt it after initial boiling is way less poisonous.Beetle lacquer, also called shellac, is made from the egg nests of the female lac beetle. She secrets this substance to lay her eggs in. The nests can be scrapped off of the trees that they are laid on, and melted with heat, to make a useful plastic. If you wait until the baby beetles hatch before you scrape up their nest and melt it down, you will have a limited amount of shellac for an unlimited amount of time. But in the 18th and 19th century, global demand for plastics grew so great, the people started harvesting lac nests before the baby beetles had hatched! The species was almost driven to extinction.Then petroleum plastic was invented, and the poor beetles were spared. Today their numbers have fully rebounded. Some amount of shellac is still harvested, for restoration work, and historical reproductions, and for people who just really like making things in the old style. Almost all of what is now harvested is used as finish for wood furniture.But there was a time when it was used for hundreds of different applications.An object made from any of these types of bio-plastic can last for 1,000 years… if you keep it dry, and out of direct sunlight, and don’t cook it. But if you bury such an object in the ground, or let it sit out in a yard, or try to store it anywhere in a tropical climate, then it will rot away in a few years.But petroleum plastic is forever. The plastic bottle that you just drank 20oz of Pepsi out of could still be in existence when the sun explodes. You think that “diamonds are forever”? Ha! A diamond is a mere blooming flower, fading before the frost, compared to a plastic gateraid bottle. Or electrical wire insulation, or pair of cheap sunglasses, or… the list could go on and on. If your romantic partner wants you to get them something that will last “forever, just like our love”, do go for a diamond, go to Home Depot and pick up 6″ of insulated electrical wire. If your partner actually appreciates the joke, they’re a keeper.All of this is to say, if ancient cultures had been advanced, they would have made a lot of stuff out of plastic, and most of it would still exist. But not only have we never dug up a single piece of ancient aluminum, we have also never dug up a single piece of ancient petro-plastic. Not one.This answer has already gotten REALLY long, and I haven’t even talked about concrete (Advanced civilizations make things that last forever. We can be certain that there never was one on this planet before, because if there had been, they would have left some of that stuff behind.",22 followers,Spencer McDaniel,936,2.1K,61.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-a-new-nation-with-advanced-technologies-emerges

15,"1. Ancient Steam Engine​​1. Ancient Steam Engine​​2. Oldest Telescope​​The Nimrud lens is a 3,000-year-old piece of rock crystal, which was unearthed by Sir John Layard in 1850 at the Assyrian palace of Nimrud, in modern-day Iraq.  The Nimrud lens (also called the Layard lens) is made from natural rock crystal and is a slightly oval in shape.  It was roughly ground, perhaps on a lapidary wheel. It has a focal point about 11 centimetres from the flat side, and a focal length of about 12 cm.  This would make it equivalent to a 3× magnifying glass (combined with another lens, it could achieve much greater magnification). The surface of the lens has twelve cavities that were opened during grinding, which would have contained naptha or some other fluid trapped in the raw crystal.  Since its discovery over a century ago, scientists and historians have debated its use, with some suggesting it was used as a magnifying glass, and others maintaining it was a burning-glass used to start fires by concentrating sunlight. However, prominent Italian professor Giovanni Pettinato proposed the lens was used by the ancient Assyrians as part of a telescope, which would explain how the Assyrians knew so much about astronomy. According to conventional perspectives, the telescope was invented by Dutch spectacle maker, Hans Lippershey in 1608 AD, and Galileo was the first to point it to the sky and use it to study the cosmos. But even Galileo himself noted that the 'ancients' were aware of telescopes long before him. While lenses were around before the Nimrud lens, Pettinato believes this was one of the first to be used in a telescope.3. Oldest Calendar​​Research carried out last year on an ancient site excavated by the National Trust for Scotland in 2004 revealed that it contained a sophisticated calendar system that is approximately 10,000 years old, making it the oldest calendar ever discovered in the world. The site – at Warren Field, Crathes, Aberdeenshire – contains a 50 metre long row of twelve pits which were created by Stone Age Britons and which were in use from around 8000 BC (the early Mesolithic period) to around 4,000 BC (the early Neolithic). The pits represent the months of the year as well as the lunar phases of the moon. They were formed in a complex arc design in which each lunar month was divided into three roughly ten day weeks – representing the waxing moon, the full moon and the waning moon. It also allowed the observation of the mid-winter sunrise so that the lunar calendar could be recalibrated each year to bring it back in line with the solar year. The entire arc represents a whole year and may also reflect the movements of the moon across the sky.Source: http://www.ancient-origins.net/ancient-technology/ten-amazing-inventions-ancient-times-001539",UNKNOWN,DurgaPrasad (దుర్గా ప్రసాద్),546,183,3.5M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Besides-the-necrons-what-Warhammer-40k-race-has-the-most-advanced-technology

Would-be poisoners could easily obtain the requisite materials from the shops of apothecaries or chemists, under the guise of using them in small doses for a cosmetic or medical purpose.Mithridates VI of Pontus: The Poison King of Pontus and Aggravation to RomeKing Mithradates VI had a good reason to become obsessed with poison. The previous ruler, king and his father, Mithridates V, had been assassinated by poison at aMithridates's mother, Laodice VI, held regency over Pontus until a male heir was of age.“He, however, being on his guard against such treachery, frequently took antidotes, and so fortified himself, by exquisite preventives, against their malice, that when he was an old man, and wished to die by poison, he was unable."" Justin,mithridates vi - Google SearchSupposedly during his youth he began to suspect plots against him at his mother's orders and was aware of her likely connection with his father's death.Living in times when slipping poison into food or drink was a reality that had been one of the choice methods of assassination for thousands of years, Mithradates VI began a rigid program to educate himself on every form of poison and that knowledge would later become his greatest enemy.While in the wild it is said that he began consuming non-lethal levels of poisons and mixing many into a remedy to make him immune to many poisons. The Roman natural historian Pliny the Elder called him, “with his brilliant intellect and wide interests … an especially diligent student of medicine, [who] collected detailed knowledge from all his subjects.”Scythians & CannabisMithradates VI fled into exile and returned in triumph to become a ruler of superb intelligence and fierce ambition. Sometime between 116 and 113 B.C., Mithridates VI returned to his home of Sinope and seized throne, having Laodice VI arrested and eventually executed.Once he secured the throne, Mithridates consulted physicians, scientists, and shamans in the hopes of creating a foolproof remedy to toxins.Inspiration forImage: folio 3v of the Vienna Dioscorides MS (produced around 500 CE). Clockwise from left: Apollonius (unclear which one); Krateus; Galen; Dioscorides; Nicander.

Which of the gods, in the name of Truth, fixed these absurd proportions? No human brain could have been sharp enough. It is plainly a showy parade of the art, and a colossal boast of science.""

(In 88 BC, in a measure of the hatred felt for the Romans in Asia, Mithradates ""wrote secretly to all his satraps and city governors that on the thirtieth day thereafter they should set upon all Romans and Italians in their towns, and upon their wives and children and their freedmen of Italian birth, kill them and throw their bodies out unburied, and share their goods with King Mithridates"" (III.22). Tens of thousands were massacred: Valerius Maximus (XI.2.4) records 80,000 deaths, Plutarch (Mithradates’ wars against Rome lasted four decades, engulfing three continents. He survived at least two assassination attempts during his 57-year reign.In the end, Rome was victorious and King Mithradates VI lost his kingdom and his life, butAfter his defeat at the hands of Pompey, Mithridates VI fled to the lands north of the Black Sea in the winter of 66 BC in the hope that he could raise a new army and carry on the war through invading Italy by way of the Danube.In 63 B.C.E., when the Romans were about to capture him, he withdrew to the citadel in Panticapaeum, where he was surrounded by his enemies who sought to overthrow him.Pompey - WikipediaIn the end, ironically, it would be a representative of Rome, the champion Pompey Magnus, who would take the body of Mithridates VI, and bury him in the rock-cut tombs of his ancestors in Amasya, which had been the old capital of the kingdom of Pontus, and the heart of Mithridates VI Eupator Dionysius’ kingdom.""Mithridates had tried to make away with himself, and after first removing his wives and remaining children by poison, he had swallowed all that was left; yet neither by that means nor by the sword was he able to perish by his own hands. For the poison, although deadly, did not prevail over him, since he had inured his constitution to it, taking precautionary antidotes in large doses every day; and the force of the sword blow was lessened on account of the weakness of his hand, caused by his age and present misfortunes, and as a result of taking the poison, whatever it was. When, therefore, he failed to take his life through his own efforts and seemed to linger beyond the proper time, those whom he had sent against his son fell upon him and hastened his end with their swords and spears. Thus Mithridates, who had experienced the most varied and remarkable fortune, had not even an ordinary end to his life. For he desired to die, albeit unwillingly, and though eager to kill himself was unable to do so; but partly by poison and partly by the sword he was at once self-slain and murdered by his foes.""Cassius Dio (Florus, too, has Mithridates ending his life by the sword, one ""which he had in vain tried to destroy with poison"" (When Mithridates was defeated by Pompey, a notebook was found in the king's own hand with a prescription for an antidote which consisted of only two dried walnuts, two figs, and twenty leaves of rue pounded together with a pinch of salt (Poisoning was already becoming widespread in Rome by the end of the Republic. This made the Romans “very keen to acquire … [this] universal antidote.” They claimed to possess his original recipe and to improve upon it.For the next 2000 years, an antidote called “mithridatum” or “mithridatium” was included inIn Mithridates’s day, “poison” and “antidote” had somewhat different connotations than they do today. A “poison” commonly referred to an extract of plants containing alkaloids such as henbane (hyoscyamine), wolf’s bane (aconitine), or poison hemlock (coniine). Venoms of poisonous animals were also included. “Antidotes” were sweet-smelling lotions and potions believed to antagonize poisons. A “poison” could also develop inside a person without exposure to poisonous plants or animals. Thus, it was thought that “systemic poisons” were present in illnesses and these could be ameliorated by the same antidotes.CelsusA hundred years after the death of Mithridates, Celsus recorded the formulation, which comprised thirty-six ingredients, all of which are derived from plants, except for honey to mix them and castor to enhance the aroma.""But the most famous antidote is that of Mithridates, which that king is said to have taken daily and by it to have rendered his body safe against danger from poison. It contains costmary 1.66 grams, sweet flag 20 grams, hypericum, gum, -tears and parsley, 17 grams each, casia, saxifrage, darnel, long pepper, 20.66 grams each, storax 21 grams, castoreum, frankincense, hypocistis juice, myrrh and opopanax, 24 grams each, malabathrum leaves 24 grams, flower of round rush, turpentine-resin, galbanum, Cretan carrot seeds, 24.66 grams each, nard and opobalsam, 25 grams each, shepherd's purse 25 grams, rhubarb root 28 grams, saffron, ginger, cinnamon, 29 grams each. These are pounded and taken up in honey. Against poisoning, a piece the size of an almond is given in wine. In other affections an amount corresponding in size to an Egyptian bean is sufficient.""Celsus,Pliny (XXIX.24-25) was skeptical of theriacs such as Mithridatum, with their countless ingredients.""The Mithridatic antidote is composed of fifty-four ingredients, no two of them having the same weight, while of some is prescribed one sixtieth part of one denarius. Which of the gods, in the name of Truth, fixed these absurd proportions? No human brain could have been sharp enough. It is plainly a showy parade of the art, and a colossal boast of science.""And yet an examination of the pharmacology of Mithridates' original formulation shows a conscious effort to select plants thought to be useful, many of which have a strong scent and are from the familyEighteenth-century portrait by Georg Paul BuschGalen, physician to Marcus Aurelius, also created his own antidote, which he calledWhen it came to medicines, Romans held that more expensive and “exotic” ingredients were higher quality and more effective. (Plus, medicine-makers would earn more money selling a more expensive remedy). Physicians were well aware of the attraction that such an expensive drug could have on a wealthy clientele,.Mithridates Vi Eupator Stock ImagesWhile many have sought to unearth Mithridates’ cure-all potion, few have actually taken the time to doubt the veracity of Mithridates and the ancient authors’ assertions. What if Mithridates’ panacea was an elaborate ruse meant to persuade his enemies that all poisoning attempts were futile?It seems that Mithridates’ personal theriac must have either been inadequate or a hoax because he always kept a fatal helping of poison in his sword’s hilt in case he decided to kill himself.There are still other deficiencies in the Mithridatium myth. In order to build immunity against certain poisons, it has been asserted that Mithridates consumed small amounts of arsenic and possibly venoms, which may have been included in his chewable tablets, and while this could work in theory, the results would probably have been disastrous.Over the next few centuries, recipes for universal antidotes proliferated worldwide. In the eighth century, theriacs appeared in Islamic medical texts as poison-repellants and cure-alls. While some theriacs survived in European writingsThroughout the Renaissance and early industrial eras, major centers of trade from London to Cairo had flourishing antidote industries. Often, the jars the remedies came in were as expensive and ornate as what was inside them. Venice’s 60-ingredient theriac (dubbed “Venetian treacle” by the English) became the most famous, but pharmacies across the world popularized different versions.Theriac was perennially popular because it was thought to cure every ailment, no longer just poison.To make sure everyone was making medicines properly, doctors began to circulate pharmacopeias—manuals outlining official drug preparation.

The Minoan are very good at both disciples as you’ll see.There is a lot of technology on display in this fresco! Firstly, those ships over 10 oars are white with one exception that seems to be copper coming from the inner caldera port. A team reproduced a half-scale model of one of these ships, constructed the hull from wooden planks using strong mortise and tenon joints. This construction method was used by the later Phoenicians but fell largely out of use and there is evidence of technology transfer to Phoenicia forThe hull is then sealed by overlaying a linen cloth and heated pine resin (a natural polymer) infused with limestone powder to make the hull white. This is the first example of a composite which would not be seen again until 1950CE with the introduction of glass-reinforced plastic (GRP). Technically linen cloth is almost as strong in tension as glass-fibre! Close inspection of the interior shows that in at least one case this was applied internally (to the copper ship), in blue, which suggests lapis lazuli powder used instead (expensive, no expense spared on what may be the rulers ship in the precession to Delos, which seems to be implied by the lion figure).Copper fillings may have been applied externally, the significance of this is that barnacles will not attach, it’s copper-bottomed. A technique the Royal Navy used much later in history, it dramatically improves hydrodynamic performance by reducing drag as the hull doesn’t have barnacles. Fishing vessels to this day, anchor in the Theran Caldara to clean the hull as there is copper in the rock formations.This reinforcement would allow for a lighter stronger hull and have had a huge benefit if the ship is caught on an outcrop of rocks just below the waterline (a risk at this time, note that a staff protrudes from the rear of ships to release a lead weight on a line to identify depth at sea to the sea floor), although the timbers will be compromised the inner linen will delaminate from the hull and keep the hull sufficiently watertight to make landfall and repair, saving the ship, crew and cargo. The artist really goes out of his way to point all this out, there is a sense of look at this and this, it is superb teaching aid, they are explaining the theory to their children. A half-scale modern-day reproduction (N.B. the fresco suggest freestanding mast).The technology doesn't just stop there, these ships are pack with simple and effective technology. Anemometers for winds speed and direction: devices on the bow on wires that deflect in the wind, bells to give an audible indication of wind intensity to the entire crew. We know from archaeology and written accounts that they had lodestones likely from magnetite (iron) from Skyros struck by lightning, Minoan buildings are aligned to magnetic North from around 1800BCE. Landbased compass, Crete 1650BCE, the sub markings give the fractional (1/total to express the angle) and therefor the declination to true North. When this compass was made there is a large change in the magnetic field and it appears that the Palace are studying this, likely to inform the merchant fleet of the changes in declination. This is ‘Earth science’.Labrys eventually lead to the Jacob’s staff (a marine sextant), the transfer to Phoenicia can be shown, with this one can establish latitude for passage across the high sea without hugging the coastline.Caged natural birds are likely being used to estimate longitude as they face towards their home port. Minoan iconography shows them on the Labrys tips and represents the West and East cardinal directions and longitudinal, the four minoan deities almost certainly represent seasons and cardinal directions. Hunting birds for those associated with Autumn (West) and doves for the Spring (east) sailing seasons. All of these technologies are not centuries ahead of their time but Millenium! It is the reason birds are often shown on on maritime iconography and bow and stern posts, longitude is hard, birds have mastered it to migrate with the seasons (they explain a quantum effect of light as a wave and a particle), I’m not suggesting they understood Quantum physics, rather they understood that birds have this ability to hone to their home port and exploit it.This is one technology that may be lost in Antiquity. Minoan technology is superbly simple and hugely capable: reverse stroke weight assisted propulsion.Not even Leonardo realised this, who was specifically trying to harness human power for flight and realised that human strength is the opposite to that of birds, human power is in the leg with the most muscle mass. The apparatus shown above uses alternative push strokes (only) for each leg, not push AND pull for both. How to harness human power…Consider the oar arrangement. It's unusual, two lines are shown to each oar which is shown mid-hulled. For completeness, I should flag up that some have speculated that the oarsman are paddling. I think this unlikely as pottery models of Minoan vessels survive and have oars protruding mid-hull.This would suggest the ships are larger than once thought and the oarsman are sat entirely within the hull. Then what are these two lines? The artists goes to some lengths to point out all the technology. Ropes being set forward of the oarsman may be shown that could be connected to weights. In this way, the oarsman which face rear, pull up the weight upon the return stroke, which they enjoy on the pull stroke for additional propulsive force. Continous work being performed and temporarily stored as by the weight. This also counterbalances the weight of the oar itself. Minoan dynamics are likely very good, they are accounts of early machines, those that ‘walk’ down the street - lacking the vocabulary for locomotion, statues that move using mechanical arrangements (pulleys) to the fascination of the audience and a door that opened by fire (steam).There seems to be an undulating raised section between oars and the oars protrude through the hull. This is quite an important principle to establish, if the oars are set below the line of the hull, the ships are larger than thought and more seaworthy.This arrangement would give maximum intercept speed when required. It is difficult to say conclusively that this arrangement is being used, however what maybe ropes are possibly being employing, the question is how and why? To maximise propulsive force seems like it would be something they would wish to do. The oar arrangements are curious and more archaeological evidence needs to be established for how the Minoans were undertaking such long voyages at this time, the issue is there no complete example of a Minoan ship which survives.Why would they wish to realise higher speed? Minoans may wish to identify any non-Minoan vessel over ten oars in their waters to levy duty. Peak Sanctuaries are on mountain tops throughout the Cyclades have a commanding view of the coastal approaches and their waters (Minos is accredited with the first Navy and suppressing piracy in the region). Peak sanctuaries typically have greater than 100kms line of sight to the horizon, from a ship's deck only 3kms by comparison. They have labrys which are huge copper mirrors that could have been used to signal fleet to intercept (which requires dash speed), board, inspect cargo and potentially levy duty. The Iliad explains that the news of the fall of Troy was communicated by island beacon fires from Troy (right) to Argos (far left) within hours using fires (signals) and seems to be a mature technology.Carian marines are shown on point on merchant ships and all the passengers have helmets to hand, as shown in another fresco in the same room! Which also shows Carians being paid in head of herd by the islands at a festival to Apollo, as per the legendary founding of Delos, build a temple to mighty Apollo and they will bring hecatomb (hundreds) of head of herd.This technology is not slightly better, it is hugely ahead of its time. The Minoans are so very organised. If the Minoans are policing the shipping lanes using peak sanctuaries to co-ordinate the fleet, there isn’t anything this well co-ordinated untilWhy did this technology fall out of use you may ask? The Minoans didn’t give away their advantages, they had a practical monopoly on the metal trade in the Mediterranean, no other civilisation could undertake high sea navigation at this time. The Minoan civilisation suffered many disasters, first the eruption of Thera that took out the entire Minoan fleet (1628BCE), then a civil war with the Carians (that provided soldiers and crew to Minos, shown above, around 1500BCE but were driven out of the islands, their name comes from where they settled, Caria in Anatolia), then Myceanea gained control of the islands (1400BCE) and finally, bronze age collapse, ca. 1200BCE. Death by a thousand cuts gradually weakening this trading thalassocracy, it did rebuild but was a shadow of its former self, producing huge surplus being a low priority when feeding the island population will have become the priority.In their heyday, they must have held sway as many city-states required metals (such as copper and tin) to develop and make tools. There is a sense of this in some of the later Greek text. Minoan ships brought to port the metals and exchange surplus for the other things they needed to develop. The Phoenicians largely pickup and eventually re-established the trade network after bronze age collapse, but it may have been Minoan technology (labrys and lodestones for high sea navigation and murex purple dye production, which was developed on Crete), the later gave them a valuable commodity to trade for metals that allowed the Phoenicians to expand. The legend of Theseus (founder of Athens) is telling, the 30 oar ship he returned from Crete in took pride of place, it was on display as a trophy for many generations until it eventually rotted away. It doesn’t appear Athens knew how to build these ships (they were likely made by Minoan Palace controlled shipyards) or understood what the significants of equipment on-board was, it does not appear to be adopted or could be reproduced.What can be inferred is that the ruling family of Athens wanted to learn how the Minoans were acquiring such wealth, on his return Theseus went to Skyros where magnetite is available (iron, the most valuable metal of the Bronze age and if struct by lightning giving a lodestone to navigate at sea), his negotiations were not successful with the islanders, he was thrown off a cliff.How good was Minoan technology? I think likely exceptional. No Minoan papyrus survive, that will have likely included codex on Astronomy, Nature (physics), instrumentation and engineering practice. The archaeology record, suggests it could have been superlative, we see the outputs of astronomy (accurate astronomical periods shown in jewellery and frescos); Newton is accredited with the development of the prism but precision ground rock-crystals prisms are found in aThis seal shows compass dividers are being used with grinding bits of 60 micrometres (0.06mm) and placement precision of within 15 micrometres (0.015mm), comparable to that of many CNC machine steps of today (but not specialist precision machines).Zoomed in section of hairline, 1mm sq, note the milling bit holes not worked out with literally a needle file used elsewhere. I think we can forgive them this oversight, you can’t even see it without optical magnification.A thought experiment, could Daedulus have pulled off a glider to outrun a white-hull? They had no other choice if they want to leave Crete and passage at ports is denied, the peak sanctuaries can send ships to intercept and nothing moves from the port without a palace seal! They need something fast and ideally a platform that cannot be stopped. Necessity is the mother of invention. I have built experimental aircraft for the Ministry of Defence, I could build a glider easily with known Minoan technology.It’s not so difficult if you build models and study nature (griffon vulture show how to circle on the sunny side of a hill with their fixed position top wings), a wicker frame is easy (this is used for composite shields which are fabously light weight) and Icarus invented the sail or more likely the coating to preserve the sail, he got as far as Icaria according to mythology and where he had his mishap, 200kms from Crete by island-hopping around 50 kms to obtain the next thermal around 3kms altitude is needed with a 20:1 sink rate, Daedalus seems to have made it to Troy to obtain passage elsewhere. Minos setting a challenge that only he could solve to find him.A bronze from Samos ca 700BCE, sometime after Daedulus but may be much closer to what was used for airwork, an elliptical 7m span wicker fixed-wing frame with underslung wicker handrails, skinned with linen sailcloth and sealed and a linen fantail the legs being splade. The most simple airframe it could possibly be.Just maybe…Minoan technology is so very simple but hugely capable, they study nature, model before scaling up (and if they produce hand launch models that glide straight and true, then scaled up and started on the side of a hill until they learn flight control, they stood a very good chance of pulling this off), a 50:50 chance according to mythology. By keeping it simple you produce an elliptical fixed-wing with wicker frame (like birds), have both weight shift control and control surfaces using the leg, it could not be simpler and will hugely outperform the sink rate of a modern-day handglider! They have no less than what Sir George Cayley had and arguably more practical experience of building lightweight structures (shields), sails used for flight surfaces and fluid dynamics generally from ships. Flight in ca 1450BCE is as significant as putting a man on the moon, if they had not, maybe the accepted early flight pioneers would have never attempted this and without that there is no moon landing, no satellites or international travel. I wonder…Are we as advanced as we think we are or could be?","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-a-new-nation-with-advanced-technologies-emerges
