4,"For regular conventional military force? It’s kind of a meaningless question. One type of weapon won’t be of any use, no matter its technological sophistication, if used in the wrong type of warfare. A lightsaber would be completely useless at fighting in ranged warfare against enemies with kinetic weapons, for example. Likewise, we can’t know for certain what ranged combat will be in the future, much as no-one could have predicted that gunpowder would exist and dominate warfare before firearms became the dominant ranged weapon.However, since your question involves “nuclear weapons”, nuclear wFor regular conventional military force? It’s kind of a meaningless question. One type of weapon won’t be of any use, no matter its technological sophistication, if used in the wrong type of warfare. A lightsaber would be completely useless at fighting in ranged warfare against enemies with kinetic weapons, for example. Likewise, we can’t know for certain what ranged combat will be in the future, much as no-one could have predicted that gunpowder would exist and dominate warfare before firearms became the dominant ranged weapon.However, since your question involves “nuclear weapons”, nuclear weapons in the realm of currently possible weapons of mass destruction are actually pretty much child’s play. A nuclear weapon only converts maybe a few percent of its mass into energy. Sure, that’s enough to destroy a city. But what if I told you there was a nuclear weapon that converts all of its mass into raw energy?Enter antimatter. On contact with ANY matter, antimatter will annihilate both itself and the matter that it touched. What’s an antimatter annihilation? Well, when a particle and antiparticle collide, they get converted 100% into energy. This means that an antimatter bomb would release unimaginable amounts of energy. As in, 1 gram involved in the annihilation would be 89,875,518 MJ (89.875,518 terajoules) of energy. The largest mass-produced American strategic nuclear bomb averaged 13.5MT, or 14,640TJ, for a weight of 18,600KG of weight. We’ll say our typical antimatter bomb is about the mass of an RPG-7 rocket (for all the added parts required for it to go off when it’s supposed to). That means an antimatter bomb (we’ll assume the 1G payload) would way ~2.6KG in total, so if we scaled the nuclear weapon (including its bait and tackle and payload) to the same mass (ignoring the critical mass problem, this is an explanation of how stupid efficient antimatter is, you’d probably get about 2.04TJ.So a plausible antimatter weapon is almost 45 times more powerful than a nuclear weapon of a similar weight.If an antimatter weapon was developed with similar weight as a strategic nuclear bomb, going with that sort of rough comparison, a strategic antimatter bomb would release 607.5MT. That makes Tsar Bomba look like a firework, at “only” 57MT, and this would be a weapon that is the size and mass of a standard production strategic nuclear bomb.This wouldn’t be a city-killer. This would be a weapon that Nukemap can’t even BEGIN to comprehend, as it only goes up to 100MT.Just to put in perspective how absurd 100MT is, these are the stats.And our strategic antimatter weapon has SIX TIMES the yield of this weapon that ALREADY reunites the city of Vancouver with the sea and wipes out every nearby city!",UNKNOWN,Common Sense,7.5K,483,3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-peak-and-demand-field-in-the-information-technology-world
5,"During the mid 32nd Millennium the Imperium became complacent in patrolling what was considered it's territory. After the destruction of the Horus Heresy, The traitor Legions were thought to be a greater threat than any other faction and the Eye of Terror was the focus of much of the Imperium's millitary might. Rebuilding rather than colonisation had taken many centuries so conquered worlds that should have been developed, remained undeveloped and forgotten.This neglect allowed a new and powerful Ork empire to rise around Ullanor, previous seat of power of Urrlak Urrak and thought to be secureDuring the mid 32nd Millennium the Imperium became complacent in patrolling what was considered it's territory. After the destruction of the Horus Heresy, The traitor Legions were thought to be a greater threat than any other faction and the Eye of Terror was the focus of much of the Imperium's millitary might. Rebuilding rather than colonisation had taken many centuries so conquered worlds that should have been developed, remained undeveloped and forgotten.This neglect allowed a new and powerful Ork empire to rise around Ullanor, previous seat of power of Urrlak Urrak and thought to be secure after the Ullanor Crusade.These Orks had over a thousand years to fight amongst each other, getting stronger and expanding until one ‘Prime Ork’ united the empire by securing alliances with five other massive but intelligent Prime Orks. Each one corresponded to the major Ork Tribes seen in the 41st Millennium. The Beast of Beasts seems to have been of the Goff Clan but was as cunning as it was brutal.The Galaxy wide WAAAGH! was heralded by a number of planeroid sized craft appearing in orbit of planets throughout the Imperium inflicting devastating tidal forces to these worlds.The Attack Moons as they came to be called were agglomerations of rock and metal, most often resembling a great Ork skull. Capable of altering it's surface by the shifting of metal plates the size of mountains and even opening it's massive ‘jaw’ to release swarms of Ork warships.They were armed with gravity weapons that could swat aside squadrons of eacort ships or even crushing capitol ships in a single strike. Once the system was subdued, these weapons would tear the planet apart, pulling chunks to the moon to feed the Ork war machine. The shields the Attack Moons possessed made them invulnerable to most attacks and even caused Imperial Void shields to detonate on contact.But these were not the greatest technological achievements the Orks were capable of. The Moons themselves were not conventional starships, they were actually the end point of subspace corridors the Orks dubbed “Waagh! Gates”. With this technology, Orks could instantaneously travel anywhere in the galaxy, attacking with little warning other than a brief gravitational anomaly just before the moon appears.The Orks were finally defeated at a terrible cost before they could apply this subspace technology to the their homeworld Ullanor, which they were to use against Terra itself.",327 followers,Anh Le,8.9K,85,384.9K,2020,https://www.quora.com/Has-innovation-in-web-technology-and-business-peaked-Why
