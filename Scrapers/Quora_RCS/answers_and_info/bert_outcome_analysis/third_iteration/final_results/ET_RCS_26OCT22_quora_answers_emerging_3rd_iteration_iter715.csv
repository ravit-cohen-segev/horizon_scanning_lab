They’re a $400 million dollar watch company.I thought this meeting would give me all the answers.It took me six months to land this meeting.When we met, I felt like a idiot.Looking back on it, I was asking him the most basic questions about ecommerce.I really had no clue what I was doing.He probably left thinking my company would remain an idea.(We met before I had my first sample).Flash forward a year and my company was doing just over six figures in sales.I then heard of a talk Andy was giving.I went to the talk and stayed after, eager to catch up with him.As I approached, he said, man you look familiar!He was stoked that I had actually turned my idea into my own business.Andy gets requests to meet with hundreds of entrepreneurs a year. Most don’t go forward with the next steps of starting a company.Most first time entrepreneurs get caught up and don’t actually grow.They expect a mentor or coach to do the work for them.First time entrepreneurs need to know that there isn’t a magic box or person with all the answers.Your path to success will be different than someone else’s.Finding your own way is part of the journey.Though having a great mentor can help, you can’t expect them to do the work for you.The watch strap I invented!",1 follower,Nathan Resnick,32.7K,219,4.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-can-a-new-killer-technology-startup-gain-access-to-the-top-advisors

They jump from one idea to the next, and never stick to something long enough to reap the rewards. To make things worse, they are constantly looking for the next great thing and want to start too many companies at once.And even if they did stick to one idea, most entrepreneurs give up on it as soon as things get hard. A few months go by, and then they move onto the next shiny object. It’s a never-ending cycle. They lose focus and never stick it out.What’s the greatest advice for a young entrepreneur?Stick to one idea long enough with insane focus, and you will ultimately win.",5 followers,Joel Kaplan,3K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-can-a-new-killer-technology-startup-gain-access-to-the-top-advisors

Uber pitched 523 times before someone said “Yes”. I passed on both Uber and Lyft.

No docs or negotiations.If things go well, then you can make the mentor a formal adviser.Thing go well is if the adviser meets or exceeds your reasonable expectations. For example, you hope that your mentor can get you an introduction to a top ecommerce executive and the mentor delivers when no one else can. Or the mentor does some good market research and shares the findings - good and bad - with you.And don't have too many advisers or mentors.

I also, very rarely, (if ever) meet a hispanic engineer. I’ve known a few black engineers, but they were literally from Africa, and for reasons I don’t get, african blacks are never considered “real blacks” by african-americans (often Africans are excluded from affirmative action programs).Let me tell you one thing for sure: that list above all have one thing in common - they won the ovarian lottery. All of them come from accomplished families. All of them.The one barrier that is often insurmountable is an education. Blacks and hispanics could easily be hired, there is no more intense meritocracy than software engineering, and with the tech elite falling over themselves to virtue signal, there is no better time. All it takes though is some education - almost any. A few computer classes at a community college, and you’re hired into IT for desktop support or helpdesk. This would pay 30–60,000 a year and could easily cover expenses while one learned software engineering. You definitely do not need a degree, only some competency and a willingness to learn.*white women, apparently, all work in public education. This is fascinating -Know why? Theres no money in it. These white women are, to great degree, shaping the minds of all children this second. This is OK by everyone. Partly because people get that white women are nice, and partly because people don’t give a shit about any profession where there's no money to be made.So. Let me ask you - how do white women afford such a low paying career? How do they pursue a life of what is, in California, almost totally volunteer charity work?Their husbands!

16,"Scott Adams once wrote that, when an engineer tells you that something is physically impossible, it generally means they don't feel like doing it. By the same token, when a company claims there aren't enough of any kind of worker, what they mean is they can't get enough of that worker to apply for the jobs they have open, for the pay and conditions that they're offering.In cases like that, if the work is there and profitable, and they need more workers, basic free-market capitalism would suggest that they'd start offering higher salaries, better benefits and better conditions, in order to lureScott Adams once wrote that, when an engineer tells you that something is physically impossible, it generally means they don't feel like doing it.

Thing is, those companies don't want to rock the boat by changing their price scale. If they offer new workers more money, their existing engineers will want more money, too. If they hire away their competitors' workers with higher salaries, their competitors could do the same to them. Eventually, that would drive their cost up labor up until they could no longer raise salaries and still be profitable. That's the natural equilibrium point when there's a shortage of workers.In other words, if a business says there's a shortage of some kind of worker, what they really mean is that hiring people for those positions is harder and takes more money than they want to spend. My heart goes out to them, but that's the way business works.For all the shortcomings of capitalism, it works better than any other economic system, precisely because it's so resilient. The money tends to flow to where it's really needed. I'm sure all businesses would love it if they could get highly qualified people in exchange for peanuts and breadcrumbs, but running an actual business means you have to pay what it costs to hire people.",256 followers,Priyal Gupta,9.7K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-can-a-new-killer-technology-startup-gain-access-to-the-top-advisors
