0,"Will time traveling be possible in the next 50 years?Almost certainly not. Our current understanding of the laws of physics tells us that time only moves in one direction, and there is no serious scientific theory regarding time travel, nor any scientific research pursuing the objective of time travel. As such, in 50 years time, time travel will almost certainly remain the province of science fiction. However, it would be the ultimate in scientific hubris to say that time time travel will always remain a theoretical and practical impossibility.Will time traveling be possible in the next 50 years?Almost certainly not.

1,No. Beyond that we all travel in time all the time.Time is not a something - it is a concept used to describe the period between one event and another.We live in the present: this moment is now past and the next moment just arrived and is now past.,UNKNOWN,Jess H.

All you need is a wormholeThey’ve already been invented. We call them clocks.But you probably meant machines forBut you probably meant machines for exotic time travel as depicted in science fiction.People say that Einstein’s relativity equationsTheoretically, there is a time travel scenario that won’t incur temporal paradoxes. All you need is a wormhole (if wormholes exist) within travel distance of Earth without destroying Earth (currently undiscovered) that is a shortcut to a distant point in space (assuming extreme cosmic curvature in the shape of the universe). Then you simply generate a repulsive type of gravitation you can control (as yet undiscovered) inside the wormhole to keep it open (this would take the energy of several suns). Then you just move one end of the wormhole (no method for manipulating large wormholes is yet imagined) to the proximity of a huge black hole (without falling in).Now you wait while time passes at different rates for the various reference frames in your time machine’s system. After waiting long enough to make the difference in time interesting, you travel through the wormhole, past the black hole, and back to Earth. Voilà, your watch will be later than Earth clocks. So, based on your watch, and perhaps your hairdo, it would appear to people who have not traveled through your machine as if you arrived from the future.However, the wormhole method would never take a traveler quite as far back as the point in time when the time machine was configured. This is an annoying limitation, but it makes causal loop paradoxes impossible. And, despite all the effort and energy involved, and the high risk of failure, your time machine would hardly measure up to expectations set by science fiction stories. It would be more of aSo, my guess is, considering its limitations and expense, that such a time machine would not be commercially viable and therefore will not be built before the sun expands into a red giant and fries Earth.",0 followers,Ashok Bishnoi,12.8K,314,7.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-possibility-of-time-travel-in-2050-by-technology-advancement

But those who say China can only copy, not invent, has somehow forgotten that the Chinese has always been great inventors, or probably they have never heard anything about “Four Great Inventions of China” or “John Bull”.Truthfully, forced technology transfer and reverse engineering is not new. What’s new in China is, they can manufacture it at half the time, and a quarter of the cost..China has infrastructure like no otherIn simplest analogy possible : 4,000 years ago someone owned 500 goats, because, well that’s as much goat milk he can sell to his village. Then someone invented the wheel, enabling him to sell 10x as much goat milk to 10 other villages.If technology is the height of the sky scrapper, infrastructure is the foundation upon which wealth is build. In this part i will let pictures speak for themselves with as little explanation about the building as possible.55 kilometers sea crossing bridgeActually, 41 out of 50 highest bridges in the world are in China.19 Gigawatts dam (Great Brittain’s power capacity is 97 Gigawatts)Largest port in the world. 7 out of 10 largest ports in the world belongs to China + Taiwan + HK.Due to treacherous mountainous terrain, as of 2019, China build 4,000+ km of expressway like this just in Gansu province so Chinese can drive 120km/h on it. 350km/h high speed railway will be build after that..China has lifted poverty like no otherNo country has lifted half poverty in less than 50 years. Except… China, who lift 88% people out of poverty from 1981… To 0.7% in 2015.Again, simple analogy works here. GDP growth is defined as follows :Growth = Consumption + Exports - Imports + Government SpendingWith the exception of few economies, consumption isAny country that takes the lead must have the power to redistribute its wealth to citizens, increasing their welfare, and resulting in higher consumption. Poverty is a trap, and is severely hard to escape from. So in most cases, the responsibility relies on the government. Poverty is a very chronic sign of a country’s lack of ability or interest to increase consumption..China’s leaders works for the best interest of ChineseWhile Donald John Trump spends his youth in penthouse with golden-coated marble toilet, Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, spends his youth in 1970s here.Xi’s father is a political elite, yet he lives in a cave without electricity, water, or network connection. With fleas and bug beds.In a village with 20$ GDP per capita, young Xi dug out village excrement to make fertilizer, sold his motorbike (which is a luxury back then) to buy water pump, developed agriculture, made the village prosperous, and made his career as the village’s party secretary.Xi is not unique. China hasAnd if officials willingly dug shit for their village, will they sit idly while poverty and inequality runs through China?.Edited (1) : why not America?Since so many people mentioned about the USA, i decided to elaborate this part further.USA needs to deal with the elephant in the room. Actually, the elephant has been shoved aside by the ultracollosal stWhy the silly name? WhyAmericans spending almostOn top of it,Politicians blame China for loss of manufacturing jobs, India for outsourcing, and illegal immigrants for everything else.However, why no one is blaming the Bermuda, Ireland, and Switzerland for gobbling up half of Americans multinational profits? And those profits stored in Ireland were worthCan you see theIf i fail to convince you, this picture probably can. Otherwise, I’ll just give up.A fruit for thought :But hey, how does this make USA fall from #1 spot?USA has always been high-tech providersAs a matter of fact, if it were not for IBM, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook - USA will not be as superpower as today, economically. However, China is challenging USA’s domination.While USA saddles her future generation with education debt, China nurtures it. Fast forward it to 2050, what do you think will happen to high tech industry in the world?.Edited (2) : China doesn't have democracyI'm surprised at how much people mentioning Chinese having no free speech, is fascist, etc that I've decided to add this part.In the simplest question possible :Democracy is a useful tool if used properly. However useful as any tool would be, anyone can use it at the cost of everyone else.In all honesty, will you vote for this?And live with the consequences of this? (Iraq)China has billions of people, and most of them has no idea on how to run a country, what’s best for the economy, foreign relations, etc. If they were given the power of democracy, it could backfire if not used properly. So China created a system upon the belief thatBut people has concerns, and they need to voice their concerns, so China have representatives. Those volunteers aren’t paid either, and not even a politician. 1/3 of them are farmers, shepherds, fishermen. Since they are common folk like you and I, they are willing to listen, and pass it all the way upwards to Xi Jinping, if necessary.More importantly, if Chinese not having right to vote is a huge concern for you, shouldn’t you be more concerned to the innocent citizens living in war-torn hell Libya and Iraq? Or shouldn’t you be more concerned at how much you have contributed for your country? If your country has same system like China, have you earned your right to vote?.End of the answerThe entire answer absolutely does not imply that China is superior as a country neither does it imply other countries as inferior.

The fact that the United States has both is why most international investors feel safe exchanging goods and services via the US Dollar.This wasn’t always the case. The British Pound was the reserve currency prior to the World Wars. The British Empire’s Pound was secured by an elaborate network of Imperial supply chains and backed by the might of the Royal Navy. This made the Pound an attractive currency to conduct international trade. It was almost guaranteed that if you did business through the British Pound, that your transactions would safely reach their foreign destination.World War I and II changed everything. The Germans employed a U-Boat strategy that quite effectively sunk more British ships than they could manufacture. Combined with the amount of money the British Empire borrowed to win the wars, they were forced to essentially sell their rights as a reserve currency to those damned Yanks, in exchange for supplies (and eventually an alliance).This handover of reserve currency status was solidified in the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement. Much less known about this agreement was the brutal disagreements occurring behind closed doors between the Americans and British. British Economist, John Maynard Keynes, and American Economist, Henry Morgenthau, had yelling matches about how to transition the postwar economic system. But the Americans had all the leverage in the negotiations, and they ultimately pushed their agenda forward.This became known as theThe Bretton Woods system is built on 4 pillars:2. Bribing up an alliance - The United States then offers3. Sanctions - Sanctions are when the United States is mad at someone, but doesn’t want to go to war with them. This is how the Soviet Union was dealt with, and a tactic used aggressively by the Trump administration. The US can choose to bribe all the other countries of the world to stop trading with a rival, under the threat they will cut their access off too. They do this by preventing all USD transactions to a specific country, and using their Navy to block direct supply routes to that nation. It effectively isolates the nation’s economy, making their economy extremely fragile. The Soviet Union only survived as long as they did because they had sufficient food, water and oil resources for self sustainability. Not everyone has that luxury. Which brings us to the last weapon the US has used, and was used, to bring down the Soviet Union.4. The PetroDollar - When China opened up its market to the US network in 1974, this allowed the United States to withdraw from Vietnam. The US then turned it’s focus to the Middle East, where massive oil fields were churning out enough energy for the entire global consumption. The US then established an agreement with the Saudis in the 1970s to exclusively trade their oil exclusively for US Dollars. In exchange, the United States promised to use its military to protect their interests. It was this agreement that allowed the US to drown the Soviet economy into submission (by flooding the global market with cheap Saudi oil). But the Catch 22, was that it was this agreement that has dragged the US to fighting a religious war they have no idea how to fight.Global reserve currencies are historically rare. Throughout history, currency domination was usually established by regional powers, such as the Roman, Persian, and Han Empires. It wasn’t until the British that one national currency went global. And their currency domination lasted for only 2 centuries (essentially from the Seven Years War to the end of World War II). This forced the British throughout this 200 year period (1763 to 1945) to get involved in just about every global conflict, since every global conflict affected the stability of their currency network.The British learned the hard way that while controlling the global currency was strategically expedient, it was ultimately unsustainable. They found themselves being forced to fight conflicts that weren’t directly in the interest of their own nation. In other words, they were forced to increasingly deploy their military when there wasn’t exactly a threat to their national security, but instead a threat to their currency stability. This was expensive, costly, and eventually dragged them into bankruptcy once Japan, Germany and Italy forced them to cash out on all their protection guarantees.While it is doubtful a foreign currency, or Bitcoin for that matter, will ever challenge the supremacy of the US Dollar (at least in the near future), it is possible that the responsibility of maintaining a global currency could jeopardize the financial well-being of the United States. It is an exhausting responsibility, with global headaches and annoyances. It is why since 1945 we’ve had soldiers fighting in rice paddies in Indochina, cocaine fields in Colombia, oil compounds in the Islamic world and the jungles of sub-Saharan Africa.Sometimes I think the British conned us in 1944 when they turned over the reserve currency.Those tricky bastards.",UNKNOWN,Md.
