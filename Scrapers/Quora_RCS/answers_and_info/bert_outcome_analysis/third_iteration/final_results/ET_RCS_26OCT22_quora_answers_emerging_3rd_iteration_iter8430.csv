All these add complexity to the algorithm at the pretext of offering the advantages of a normal BST.HeapsTreapsA treap combines the best of both heaps and binary search trees. When you construct a heap, you basically build an ordered binary tree AND make it satisfy the “heap” property. However, if done with a single element, it will look like a line (because in a BST, the left child must be less than its parent and the right child must be greater than or equal to its parent, but for a heap, each parent should either be all bigger than its children or all smaller than its children). So we introduce another key (See picture).The numbers indicate the heap arrangement of the data structure (arranged in max heap order), and the alphabets indicate the tree part of things (left child < parent <= right child). So now you have a treeNow, here’s theNow to make that second key a little more useful for us, we use a random heap weight. So now, the structure (shape) of the tree will depend entirely on the randomized weight we gave the heap values. By making sure we assign these randomly (one way is by hashing the keys themselves), we get randomized heap priorities.To insert a new key, you generate the priority and do a regular BST insertion and then rotate it up the tree (to maintain the heap). To delete a key, you make its weight infinite, and rotate it down the tree (again, in heap order) until it becomes a leaf, and then remove it.So it’s a tree with regards to the keys and a heap with regards to the priorities.A treap is therefore a good platform to build a randomized binary search tree.Why is it remarkable?1. It’s a2. It is also a randomized data structure3. It’s a binary search tree essentially, so to print a sorted order of keys, just traverse it in order like you would regular BSTs. Searching a treap is like searching a tree4. Regardless of the order of how you add, delete, etc, because of the randomized weights, there is a high probability that the tree will be balanced (a random binary search tree has logarithmic height)5. A treap basically combines probability, randomization, two popular CS data structures, etc to make a highly useful data structure. From a CS student’s point of view, try to learn about Treaps first, and you get to learn BSTs, traversals, hashing, tree rotations, heaps, recursion, sorting, etc, all in one go :)","21,484 followers",Vladislav Zorov,1.7K,16.1K,64M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-were-you-good-at-that-nobody-cares-about-now

In Las Vegas, the Enron Broadband network re-transmission node had to provide parking spaces for 185 people, because based on the square footage of the building, that's what the building code said we had to do, as it was presumed there would be lots of people in there, versus the 8 that were in fact.Infrastructure and WiringModular containerized data centers have changed all this, but you still need to get power and cooling to every place you have servers and routers.Modular containerized data centers have changed all this, but you still need to get power and cooling to every place you have servers and routers.In the old school way of doing things, with rows of racks in cages, this was hellishly expensive to build out, and took forever.Security and Access ControlState of the art is a moving topic on this, but if you are providing 24/7 access to the building to customers, you have to have super good security.Contrary to the picture, retina scans suck.

They break down, when you look at things which are either, too small, or too big, or going too fast.So the laws of physics drastically change when things are extremely small, to when things are extremely big. (which is why, we still do not have the theory of everything). Now when I say, the laws of physics change, I don't really mean that nature acts differently at different scales, but what I mean is, the 'averaged out laws' are different.At sub atomic level, things are uncertain, concept like position, speed, break their meaning. Concept like path taken, and motion itself breaks down. However at macroscopic levels like the world we are living in, things appear very calm. Things don't just pop in and out of existence (like they do at the quantum level), and at the other extreme, when things are too massive or too fast, clocks tick very much different for different people (as shown quite accurately in the move Interstellar).

Furthermore, there are HUGE problems in the current formulations of physical theory, IE the Standard Model and General Relativity. I would not rule out any metaphysical possibilities personally unless there are clear concise proofs of impossibility.I did a fascinating calculation with the help of professor/astrophysicist Scott Hughes while I was a Physics undergrad at MIT: so certain molecules can act as magnetic dipoles, which want to stay aligned with any external magnetic field, and if you irradiate a magnetic dipole with RF waves at the right frequency you can perturb these dipoles and force them out of alignment with their external magnetic field. Once the RF pulse ends, the misaligned dipole begins to precess and irradiate it’s potential energy away in the form of RF waves until the dipole is again aligned with the external magnetic field. This precession rate can be calculated from the magnetic dipole strength as well as the external magnetuc field strength. This phenomenon is how Pulsed NMR (IE MRI brain scan technology) works.well it turns out you can do a similar calculaition on astrophysical scales! In GR, you can approximmate one of the terms to be an equivalent “gravito magnetic” force which arises when you have a rotation of mass. This rotation of mass creates a gravito magnetic field, and in turn any rotating mass within this field will feel a force analagous to a magnetic force.So a giant spinning disk of mass (such as a galaxy) would create a fairly strong external gravito-magnetic field.Then consider a planetary system such as the earth orbiting the sun: this circular orbital motion creates a gravito-magnetic dipole, which is immersed in an external gravitoamagnetic field due to the rotation of the galaxy. This means that if our planetary orbit is misaligned with the disk of the galaxy, then the gravito magnetic dipole (aka planetary system) will seek to be aligned with the external field, and thus will begin to precess and irradiate energy. Running the numbers, for an earth-like planet in a galaxy like ours, the precession period is about 100 times the current life of the universe.So when our verse is 100 times its current age, our planet’s orbital gravito magnetic dipole will cause the orbit to have precessed just once.So with that in mind, just imagine how much could be going on inside of an electron…",22 followers,Kevin Chen,7.5K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-were-you-good-at-that-nobody-cares-about-now
