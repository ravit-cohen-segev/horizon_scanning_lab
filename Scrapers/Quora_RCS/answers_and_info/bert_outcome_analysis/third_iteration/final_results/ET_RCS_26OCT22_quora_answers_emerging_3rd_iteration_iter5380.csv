Computer based cognitive technology has developed in an exponential speed that many scientists or experts in the field now say things we had heard in the movie - “Matrix”.Inand inComputers from being a Human tool to design and test, has evolved to Generate and solve issues. Its now heading to intuitive stage where it will serve as a wish granter Genie. But it wont stop there. Soon it will design itself to be more optimised and super intelligent than Human brain.Lets not get emotional and sceptic with this. This could help us solve our problems through inventions AI would make. May be ‘Star Trek’ and ‘Time Machine’ are realistic!For more curious minds, please watch the following TalksMy old answer is given below - It’s focusing on the hardware part of the same storyOne single answer -The computers we know today work withQuantum computing usesInstead of decimal, it may use hexadecimal (base 16, or hex) or even higher base number systems (or analogue). That brings us (humans) depend more on Artificial Intelligence (AI) to write programs that can work on these quantum computers.The result will be unimaginable future. May be we could have vehicles designed to travel at the speed of light! or yourSo, where we stand now?Its only in its infancy. We are like in the 1950’s with respect to Digital computing. Many institutions (like NASA), universities and corporates (including GoogleThere is no doubt that this will change the phase of human existence. Human cognisance tried to give its best to Digital computing and develop Artificial Intelligence. With Quantum computing the movie ‘MATRIX’ might be more realistic than ever.
