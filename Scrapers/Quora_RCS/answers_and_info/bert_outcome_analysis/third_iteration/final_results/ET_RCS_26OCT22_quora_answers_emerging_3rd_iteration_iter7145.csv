There are Rocket Scientists all around the world, and drawing up the specs for a rocket isn’t the hard part.The hard part is the infrastructure: You need the ability to construct thousands of custom and intricate parts, each of which require engineers to tediously check for the slightest of flaws. You need supercomputers and mathematicians to calculate every inch of movement, every tug of gravity or tiny asteroid. You need the ability to put them all together in a giant rocket and have it break planetary orbit, reach a celestial body, land, and come back while keeping some delicate sacks of carbon alive.India has the desire, it has the technology, but right now it needs the infrastructure. It needs to be able to build flawless rockets. You can’t just build an F-35 without first inventing a Cessna. The same logic applies here.But India will soon.

USA and Russia are both rich brats who have accomplished quite a lot in their respective fields of academics and sports. The come to school everyday via their dad's limousine and bring fancy food for lunch to avoid the school cafeteria. One fine day, both these superkids decide that they already have a lot in life and it's now time for a girlfriend. So Russia goes ahead and asks out Sputnik. This makes the USA furious, since they were supposed to be brothers and now Russia seems to be winning the contest by leaps and bounds. So, the ever overcompensating USA decides to take it a step further, and does something which would gather a lot of media coverage and appraisal, although being totally useless from a strategic point of view. He asks out a teacher, Mrs. Moon. After years of trying, spending lavishly on her, she finally agrees, and satisfies USA's desperate need to stay at the top of everything, every time.Now the background story to this analogy.USA and Russia had already proved to the world that they were capable, that they were the superpowers. They surpassed most other countries in technological, social and almost every other aspect. Communication satellites were crucial for development. Russia made an attempt, succeeded. But that was that. It was absolutely unnecessary for anyone to go to the moon, except for proving USA's point that they are better than the Russians. USA took this one way to far ahead to be useful to any end. Just to prove a point, they used their surplus of resources on a project that had no humanitarian value. Just because, ""they can"".To sum up,No, we Indians aren't incapable of sending men to the moon, or in that case to any other planet. There are team members at NASA from India who are still sending men to the moon. Indian physicists worked on the CERN supercollider. There are Indians working at Facebook, Amazon and Google who are just as capable of starting a new company of their own. But we are too tired. After struggling 20 years for an engineering or equivalent degree and trying to keep ourselves in the sun with a population of 1.2 billion, we Indians prefer to enjoy a little of our time cherishing the position we scratched and clawed to achieve. We don't see a point of sending men to the moon just to fulfil our surreal need for approval, when people at home are dying everyday. So, we read some story about some guy who quit his job and created a startup which is now a multi-billion dollar company and wonder, whether Indians are incapable of doing so. That's not the case. We worked too hard to get that job, and we just can't take the risk of quitting and finding another if our startup doesn't work out. We are incapable by force, not by choice.",533 followers,Kushal Sharma,11.8K,100,665.2K,2014,https://www.quora.com/Why-couldnt-India-make-it-to-the-moon-while-countries-like-the-USA-and-Russia-succeeded-almost-50-years-ago-Does-that-mean-Indias-science-and-technology-is-50-years-behind-the-developed-countries-like-USA

8,"Yes, to some extent it is true.

Everyone one knows how British drained the vast economic resources of India and how the native industry was destroyed with its policies.

Everyone one knows how British drained the vast economic resources of India and how the native industry was destroyed with its policies. Every technological development that took place during British rule was done with the future of Britain in mind rather for Indian advancement.World wars, even though created bloodshed in the world, helped these countries to advance technologically, these wars left some important spinoffs for these nations.We have to keep in mind, two events benefited some of these developed nations to advance technologically, they are Colonialism and cold war.Everyone knows how the desire to colonise more and more countries led some nations like Britain to develop technologically.When India was struggling to cope up with after affects of British rule, US and USSR are deeply engaged in cold war struggling to become a world power. They selected space as the best platform to show their technological capabilities, instead of producing some beneficial results for greater good of the world, they indulged completely in space race. They spent lot and lots of money in proving their space capabilities, in the process they developed a great infrastructure which helped them to take space explorations in their future projects.India on the other hand with the help of great visionaries like Vikram Sarabhai took the space mission to solve the problems of a common man. It started the space research with a zeal for scientific development, it all started from scratch with the efforts of some dedicated and enthusiastic scientists like Satish dhawan, UR Rao, Abdul Kalam etc., who strived to place Indian space research on top. Also, with the help of some of these developed countries, India slowly developed its space infrastructure on its own and became a major space power and established a commercial wing to transport some of the satellites of these developed nations in to the space.The main objective of Indian space research is to develop space projects with minimum budget and make sure those projects have spinoffs for common man.These developed nations also faced many failures while launching their space projects and they learned a lot in the process, for example, recently, a lunar lander of Israel which is technologically superior crashed landed on lunar space.Right from independence, India is trying to transfer the technology from other countries in many of the sectors except in defence where the technological transfer has been rather slow.Finally, we have to remember that India successfully launched Mangalyan orbitor mission with least budget and succeeded in its first attempt where these developed nations failed to launch in their first attempt.Thank you.","113,623 followers",Anuradha Tiwari,4.2K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-couldnt-India-make-it-to-the-moon-while-countries-like-the-USA-and-Russia-succeeded-almost-50-years-ago-Does-that-mean-Indias-science-and-technology-is-50-years-behind-the-developed-countries-like-USA

No, it's like throwing away an Empire State Building at the end of every trip, or crashing a jumbo jet into two more sitting on the ground.IT'S EXPENSIVE.The Soviet Union aborted their own manned lunar program after their rocket, almost as big as ours but substantially less capable, blew itself and its launchpad straight to Hell. They were planning a mission that would have sent one cosmonaut down to the surface alone, something that with the technology of the time, NASA considered unacceptably dangerous.No one has been back because it's expensive and dangerous. It's the boldest, most adventursome, most HUMAN accomplishment in the history of our species, but to move beyond it to the true, economic exploitation of the next frontier, we have to change the economics.Technology has improved in the decades since Apollo, but not as much as you might think. Other than its computers, most of the technology used on Apollo remains essentially state-of-the-art. To open up space, we need ships that don't have to carry all their oxidizer with them and that aren't fated to burn up after one use.

A famous Full-stack developer quotes the lines of Thomas Henry Huxley, “Try to learn something about everything and everything about something” I was super-impressed about his ideology. This is so true even in our lives, to go the extra mile, we indeed ought to learn something about everything and everything about something. This strategy makes us independent, and so does it work for software developers and entrepreneurs. As Full-stack development is a quintessential knowledge balance of both front-end and back-end technologies, in today’s post, I am going to share with you which Front-end + Back-end combinations have proved to be result-worthy.Top 03 Front-end + Back-end Full-stack Combinations for DevelopmentThe top three full-stack combinations that we are going to discuss are: 1. AngularJs in frontend + Rails framework in the back-end 2. ReactJS for front-end + RoR in back-end 3. VueJS in front-end + Rails for back-end.AngularJS + Rails: Google developed this open-source Javascript MVC framework known as AngularJS. It is a client-side framework that is ideally suited for Single Page Applications (SPA). Some advantages of using Angular include responsive and speedy apps, ease of development with its structured and DRY (do not repeat yourself) nature, and dynamic data binding. As you consider using Angular JS in the front-end development of your Rails application, bookmark on these benefits that you’re going to achieve:Front-end and Back-end Layers SeparateAngular with Rails is a perfect match if you want an interactive client-side framework for your browser and a CRUD REST API for your front-end development. Full-stack development is all about understanding the requirements of your client and then building their application from scratch. Owing to the Model View Controller MVC architecture of Angular, developers keep their front-end and back-end layers separate. They need not bother about linking and synchronization, which also makes their application extensive and reusable. One of the ways of achieving independent working of the separate layers is by using Rails views in the manner of empty shells where the Angular directives display asynchronous data.Purpose-built Tools :The Angular and Rails pair can work wonders together because Rails is famous for providing powerful server APIs, and AngularJS is a master tool for developing client-side applications. Rails will take care of all your back-end chores like cache, ORM, database connectivity, etc. along with the business logic, whereas Angular is customarily dedicated to building the User Interface. You might need API end-points to access data from the database, unlike Rails Core, where you can access directly. However, as your API remains unchanged, you have the freedom to use them independently.Reduced Development Time: Rails framework owns the convention over configuration nature, which eases the tasks of a developer. Code development is simple, straightforward, and secure with Rails. Rails pipeline helps you get concatenation, organization, and minification of JavaScript. Overall, Angular reduces your app response time by click and waiting, and the Rails API back-end supports all your compelling business logic. I’ve got a tutorial for you to build an AngularJS app on the Rails framework.VueJS + Rails:The third and final pair of front-end + back-end in this blog is the deadly combination of Vue.js with the Rails framework. A progressive JS framework for developing web applications is Vue.js, using which developers can create a manageable and testable code. Vue facilitates two-way communication, offers high-flexibility, has got detailed documentation, has a simple structure, and is highly reactive. Rails is the most suitable back-end for your VueJS application because it provides everything you might need in your application like ORM, web-sockets, email, etc. When using Vue.js with RoR, go check out this gem on GitHub for Vue Rails. Also, the webpack gem is the best-fit for Rails 5 release. You might want to know when you should use Vue.js frontend for which types of your projects.

14,"Honestly? Anyone you like. And that is the hard part. I won't tell you pick Node or Python or Ruby on Rails, but I can tell you what all to look for before deciding and where all to look for it. Here goes.The word ""web technologies"" encompasses a large number of technologies spanning the 'front-end' and 'back-end' of the technology stack. So where do you start:HTML/CSS:Honestly? Anyone you like. And that is the hard part. I won't tell you pick Node or Python or Ruby on Rails, but I can tell you what all to look for before deciding and where all to look for it. Here goes.The word ""web technologies"" encompasses a large number of technologies spanning the 'front-end' and 'back-end' of the technology stack. So where do you start:HTML/CSS:Now, the backend is a separate beast altogether. It's not just about a programming language. It's about framework(s). Note the plural. There are things like micro frameworks and full stack frameworks. They have their advantages/disadvantages. I suggest going micro since you're learning web application development. There will be more to learn but more valuable in the long term and you'll better know what is the value-add that a full stack framework gives you and you'll be able to debug problems with them better, IMHO. For a detailed view on that have a look at my answer to this question:So what all do you have to learn on the backend? Database APIs - i.e., understanding the low level data access APIs in the language of choice. For example, JDBC if using Java. Finding it cumbersome and then moving onto something else or adopting ORM frameworks like SQLAlchemy (Python) or DataMapper (Ruby) or Hibernate/Spring-JDBC (Java) or NHibernate (.Net). You may also land up learning dependency injection (DI) frameworks like Spring and understanding their need/value (or overkill?).It doesn't stop here. There is a resurgence of MVC on the server side so you'll also have templating languages/frameworks to dynamically generate/populate the HTMLs. In Java you have Freemarker/Velocity and many others in different languages. So at the very least here's what you'll need to learn:Front end - HTML/CSS/JSFront-end should be easy. Start Googling tutorials, join StackOveflow and feel free to ask questions on Quora. For the backend it depends which language you like and then you can take it from there. Feel free to ask a question here or StackOveflow for that choice and I'll help you make a decision in any way I can, with the support of rest of the folks who pitch in. I suggest writing ""hello world"" web apps in the various/languages you select to decide which one you like. Preferably try storing/retrieving the ""Hello World"" string from the DB to get a feel of the DB access APIs.Some suggestions: Restlet or JAX-RS for Java or Play! for full stack. Bottle/Flask (micro) or Django/Pyramid for Python, Rails (full stack, lot of magic) for Ruby or go with Sinatra.Hope this helps! Best of luck and welcome to web development.
