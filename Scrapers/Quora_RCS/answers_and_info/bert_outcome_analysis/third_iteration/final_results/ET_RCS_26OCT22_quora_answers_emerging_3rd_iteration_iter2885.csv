Oftentimes, the upfront capital expenditure can be so huge and the margins are small enough (and shrink over time as the component is rapidly commoditized) that the companies who would build these factories cannot raise sufficient investment capital to cover the costs.What Apple does is use its cash hoard to pay for the construction cost (or a significant fraction of it) of the factory in exchange for exclusive rights to the output production of the factory for a set period of time (maybe 6 - 36 months), and then for a discounted rate afterwards.  This yields two advantages:Apple has access to new component technology months or years before its rivals.  This allows it to release groundbreaking products that are actuallyApple is not just crushing its rivals through superiority in design, Steve Jobs's deep experience in hardware mass production (early Apple, NeXT) has been brought to bear in creating an unrivaled exclusive supply chain of advanced technology literally years ahead of anyone else on the planet.  If it feels like new Apple products appear futuristic, it is because Apple really is sending back technology from the future.Once those technologies (or more accurately, their mass production techniques) become sufficiently commoditized, Apple is then able to compete effectively on cost and undercut rivals.  It's a myth that Apple only makes premium products - it makes them all right, but that is because they are literally more advanced than anything else (i.e. the price premium is not just for design), and once the product line is no longer premium, they are produced",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,4.8K,0,0,2011,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-GT-Advanced-Technologies-turn-to-Apple-to-finance-expansion-instead-of-going-to-a-bank

So Apple's iPhone 6 was launched with no sapphire. (Actually we do not know for sure if apple wanted to launch with sapphire or planned more models for a later launch date, but we do know that GT did not meet some of the expectations).Apple cancelled the fourth 140m payment to GT and GT is also missing the revenue from the iPhone 6 screens (or at least that revenue is delayed, if Apple is still thinking of using sapphire for phones). GT also will eventually have to start paying back the loan. And they may (or may not) have lost their largest customer. Not to mention that the equipment in Apple's factory will stay as collateral.GT then filed for bankruptcy in order to get the protections that this allows them while handling the huge cash-flow and balance sheet fuckup they currently have.

Clearly if the Apple contract was still in place and in full force, GT Advanced Technologies could have found other credit facilities.Perhaps the company will recover under reorganization but I think an asset sale to Apple is far more likely.

There is fake documentary footage using actors that are old enough that they could be talking about the dust bowl that ravaged the Great Plains in the 1930s, but they aren’t, they are describing the events of the film. The film conveys a message that means a lot to me - that we’re a society drifting away from our roots as explorers. McConaughey’s character, Cooper, says “So far, so good. It’s dramatic, well produced, the cast is good. Then Michael Caine appears and Michael Caine makes everything better. Anne Hathaway shows up with the weird kid fromCooper was apparently a great pilot, but to his own admission only “stratospheric”, and yet somehow he is the best person they can find and super qualified to pilot a spaceship. He, Anne,Sorry, back toPlanet one is ""on the cusp"" of the black hole. We don't know where the star is that is providing the bright daylight on the planet. The visit to planet one doesn’t go so well. So it’s time for a staff meeting to discuss whether to go on to planet two or planet three. It turns out Anne has a boyfriend on planet three, so she wants that one. She delivers a rambling, incoherent pseudoscience stretch of dialogue that might have been written by Deepak Chopra on a bender.Interstellar has some wonderful scenes where the cinematography, lighting, music, and action convey emotions like desperation and hope, brilliantly. Unfortunately the movie’s communication skills plummet when characters actually talk. If it isn’t Anne Hathaway channeling Deepak Chopra, it’s Michael Caine repeatedly reciting Dylan Thomas, or it’s Matthew McConaughey rehearsing his Lincoln car commercials.Shortly thereafter, the movie does actually surprise with the appearance of a rather famous actor that I didn’t know was in the film. Unfortunately, the role he’s playing is a little similar to the role he was to play in a (then) upcoming film that I was excited about. Planet two, by the way, sucks.And now we come to a cliche as big as the black hole. Science fiction filmmakers seem incapable of filming a docking sequence that doesn’t involve one of the ships spinning out of control and the pilot of the other ship doing something their vehicle can’t do and they were never trained to do, to compensate. Sigh.Oh, and I know this is nitpicking, but it drove me nuts to see the petals on the docking mechanism always opening at the last second.All is alright, though, because Mathew McConaughey can simulate trajectories and perform complex calculations in his head, without any data, and come up with a one in a million chance plan that involves falling into Gargantua, which will be fine because it is a ""gentle"" black hole.And this is where it gets really weird and falls apart. It involves falling into a black hole and hiding behind a bookcase. And then while floating behind the bookcase, coming up with wild-assed theories that sound like ad-libs from Matthew McConaughey’s tripped out role inThe film goes all exposition at this point. Cooper, without seeing anything we can't see, suddenly figures it all out and explains it because the director and special effects team couldn't figure out how to show it.Apparently, in the last 15 minutes of the movie, Nolan and crew remembered they were telling a humanistic story and having alien beings provide the deus ex machina would be too ironic. We get the 2001 monoliths everywhere, but on each one is a video screen showing a human being. Nolan is saying ""If that madness doesn’t make you want to run screaming from the theater, stick around and watch Nolan’s take on the 13 endings ofI find this film disappointing not because of the science, but because I find it to be a poorly told story.This is kinda how I felt, watching the film...",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,737,9.4K,195.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-GT-Advanced-Technologies-turn-to-Apple-to-finance-expansion-instead-of-going-to-a-bank

Then again, we don’t get out very often. We probably could have sat through ‘Gigli’ and loved it.As for myself, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, but there were a few things that struck me as inaccurate. First and foremost – the casting.  I mean, is it really necessary to fill every astronaut movie with actors like Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, George Clooney, Sandra Bullock, Tom Hanks, and Kevin Bacon? How am I supposed to live up to that? I’m only 5 foot 5 inches tall, for crying out loud! Once, just once, can’t someone make a blockbuster space action-adventure movie starring Paul Giamatti or Wallace Shawn? Please?There were lesser flaws worth noting. (Spoilers follow!) For example, there is no way a big government bureaucracy like NASA has a meeting with less than a dozen participants. Secondly, as with many movies that depict artificial gravity achieved through a rotating spacecraft structure, the Endurance’s diameter was much too small to create a non-nauseating equivalent of Earth’s gravity. Finally, if an advanced civilization can create a time-space bookshelf tesseract, why can’t they equip it with a whiteboard? I know that using flying books, misbehaving watches, and binary dust patterns are much more dramatic means of communication, but explaining a completely new unified theory of gravitational force would be much easier with equations and diagrams than with a seemingly random set of binary data.But there were a lot of things that ‘Interstellar’ gets right. Many of the relativistic effects were spot on. (Or at least so I am told by some of my old Caltech buddies.) It was interesting to see many examples of space hardware that were familiar. The deep freezer that holds the frozen embryos of our progeny looks just like the one we have on the International Space Station. (Although we don’t have genetic material to populate a planet in there, yet perhaps that would be a good idea…) The hemispherical windows on Endurance look just like the Cupola on the International Space Station and many of the switch panels would have seemed at home on Endeavour. And as we all know, Love truly transcends time and space.It was particularly interesting for me to note how often Cooper takes manual control of his spacecraft. Bucking the real-world trend toward ever-increasing automation, it seemed like every 5 minutes he was grabbing the stick and taking manual control. As metaphor, clearly this represents the characters’ desperate attempts to control their own destiny, and the destiny of their species. ‘Interstellar’ is an expression of our very strong American notion of free will – that we are all free agents able to make choices that shape our destiny. With this free agency comes a heavy burden of responsibility; witness the crushing defeat in Professor Brand’s vain struggle to enact the destiny he so desires for the human race. But free will is an essential ingredient of the quintessential American hero archetype – the explorer, the pioneer – the lone individual who rises to the challenge and saves the day through skill, grit, and initiative - Cooper. While other cultures place value in collective group effort or trust in fate rather than cherish individual achievement, we do not. We accept the burden of our choices as well as their rewards. This archetype is part and parcel of our national character and it is important to hold fast to this mythology to inspire our next generation of Coopers as we confront the new frontier of space.Of course, the other main theme of ‘Interstellar’ is the relationship between fathers and their children. This aspect of the movie definitely rang true to me too.A short while ago, I returned from a speaking engagement wearing my blue NASA astronaut flight jacket. When I arrived at home to tuck my 4-year old son into bed for the night, he looked up at me and asked if I had just been to space again. When I told him no, he asked, “Well, are you going to space again soon?”“Not without you,” I replied sincerely.At first a look of reassured contentment came over his face only to be followed by the furrowed brow of concern and worry.“But I don’t have a flight jacket,” he said.I love that kid. I’d definitely fly into a black hole in order to save him.You can follow Garrett on Quora and @astro_g_dogg on Twitter.","28,175 followers",Garrett Reisman,16.2K,0,0,2015,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-GT-Advanced-Technologies-turn-to-Apple-to-finance-expansion-instead-of-going-to-a-bank

Not millions of years?Yes. Provided that we continue (a) existing and (b) advancing in technology, by the middle of this century, we will have access to our entire genome, nano-technology (or at the very least, micro-robotics) and AI. Those technologies, if we try really hard to extrapolate their logical course, mean that at some point in the next few centuries, there will be no more homo sapiens. Perhaps a few “museum humans” will choose to remain in their old form, but those beings will live on Earth or space stations, too frail and ephemeral; too needy to package into dense vessels for interstellar travel.If our descendants survive, they will adjust their genome. Maybe it won’t become prosaic until 2125, but at some point very soon, the temptation to remove all “negative” traits will be overwhelming. The temptation to enhance with some genetic coding from other beasts will become overwhelming. The temptation to enhance with artificial bits —that connect us to instant information, right to the brain— will be overwhelming. The temptation to create new biological features un-imagined by “Mother Nature” wholly invented by us and our super-advanced computer technology (maybe a new cell wall, completely re-engineered mitochondria, or a cell part that we cannot imagine today) will become overwhelming.At some point, after sufficient changes, we won’t be human any longer. We certainly won’t be homo sapiens. We’ll be something else … IF “we” survive that long and continue advancing technologically. A global disaster could destroy our civilization but leave a few hundred thousand of us thrown back the equivalent of five millennia. But if we survive and continue advancing, then homo sapiens is done in a few centuries at the longest; a century at the shortest.At some point in time, the advancing technology will unlock self-assembling, self-making robotics that leverage exponential growth that will either be our end or our elevation to the pinnacle of abilities in this cosmos. With lives extended to the many millennia, with intelligences in VR and AI’s meandering about the solar system, “time” won’t have the same cachet as it does today. A journey at .01c, taking 1,000–1,500 years to cross the gulf between stars will be meaningless in the lives of those beings — beings that are effectively immortal who see time as a non-obstacle.Those beings, if they end up coming into existence, will achieve interstellar travel.

Obviously this would make for a less exciting action sequence.Not a “flaw” exactly, but the nature of the hibernation chambers used on the Endurance is never gone into, probably because any explanation would have to use science fiction stuff to make it work.The single stage to orbit lander craft don’t look like they have much room to carry fuel, but seem to use fairly conventional propulsion, which would need large booster tanks to give them enough thrust to get into orbit. The wiki page suggests some kind of magnetic plasma engine whose workings are not elaborated upon as a way of explaining how it can fly into orbit.The cargo carrying lander doesn’t have the aerodynamic lifting body shape of the rangers, and yet seems to fly just like an aeroplane, I fear in reality it would fall like a brick.The idea that the blight would kill off all food crops and humanity would starve is a bit far fetched, it doesn’t look like anyone us investigating using fish or seaweed as a food source, or farming insects for their protein.

13,"Here's an interesting bit about Time Relativity as seen in Interstellar.""The concept is outright exemplified in the first planet that the Endurance team visits. In general, time onHere's an interesting bit about Time Relativity as seen in Interstellar.""The concept is outright exemplified in the first planet that the Endurance team visits. In general, time on our side of the wormhole moves faster than time in the uncharted side. Due to close proximity with gravitational anomalies from a nearby black hole (Gargantua), time on the other side is exponentially slower – relative to the distance between an object and the black hole’s gravitational pull. As a result, time on Miller’s planet moves significantly slower: for every hour that the team spends on the water planet, seven years pass back home – a primary reason that Cooper is motivated to get off the planet as soon as possible (even before they realize it’s a death trap). Cooper knows that three hours on planet’s surface will cost him decades of time with his family.As Amelia suggests, the effect of gravity from the black hole on time was to blame for the Endurance team’s unfortunate visit to Miller’s planet in the first place – since what they perceived as years of positive beacon readings were actually mere minutes for Miller (who was killed by a wave moments after she landed).The concept is further hammered home when, following the mission, Amelia and Cooper reunite with Romilly, who stayed behind on the Endurance to gather data (far from Gargantua) – and, in the three hours his team was gone, has lived twenty-three full years alone without them. Similarly, the crew receives video messages from back home and we see that Cooper’s children, Tom and Murph have also aged – now full grown adults (played by Casey Affleck and Jessica Chastain, respectively).As the team moves farther from the black hole, the disproportion in spacetime reduces – meaning that when they arrive at Mann’s planet, there’s significantly less urgency (though the once brave astronaut has been twisted by his longer stretch of time alone).A tangible effect of gravity on spacetime is also responsible for Cooper’s ability to communicate with young Murph when inside the Tesseract. Inside the machine, gravity bleeds through to other dimensions in time and space, allowing Cooper to spell out a message (“S-T-A-Y”) by pushing books off of Murph’s shelf – or communicate map coordinates to the past version of himself by spreading dust across the floor (in binary language). Most importantly, the fifth-dimensional communication through gravity (made visible by three-dimensional objects back on Earth) enables Cooper to gently manipulate the hands on Murph’s watch – transferring the data that TARS acquired with morse coded watch ticks. Subsequently, translating that coded data gives Murph all the information she needs to drastically advance humanity’s understanding of space and time – as well as complete Plan A.As for how Cooper survives his time inside the Tesseract, and how he intends to reunite with Amelia? Nolan simply reapplies the same theory that has been present the entire film. Given that time moves slower near the gravity pull of the black hole, Cooper’s ejection from the Tesseract is only seconds for him, but over half a century for the rest of humanity. Keep in mind, if the ratio of time on Miller’s planet was 1 hour for every 7 years on Earth, the proportion would be skewed exponentially at the absolute center of the Tesseract singularity. As a result, while it appears to Earthbound humans that TARS and Cooper have been floating out in space for nearly ninety years, they were actually only out there for mere seconds as they perceived it.The disproportionate relativity allows Cooper to survive and reunite with Murph – who, living on the faster moving side of the wormhole, is now over one-hundred years old. Knowing that Cooper has nothing left to live for in a post-Earth existence (since his son Tom is presumed dead and Murph will soon join him), Murph reminds her father that, through the wormhole, Amelia is just beginning to set-up Plan B on Edmonds’ planet. At the same time, it is revealed that even though Edmonds’ planet is actually habitable, the astronaut himself did not survive the landing – leaving Amelia alone at the colonization site.Using a reversal of the film’s primary relativity theory, Cooper hops into a ship, with the knowledge that even though nearly one hundred years have passed since the Endurance first set out, time on the other side of the wormhole is moving much slower – meaning that a second trip should allow him to reunite with Amelia on Edmonds’ planet only a short time after Cooper first sacrificed himself and dropped into the singularity. We don’t actually see the reunion, so Cooper’s actual fate is left up to some interpretation, but there’s reason to be optimistic that he reaches Amelia and helps ready the colony for humankind.","30,865 followers",Ken Miyamoto,1.7K,5.8K,91.3M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-that-no-advanced-technology-gadgets-are-not-shown-in-the-movie-Interstellar

They lose 51 years in their manoeuvre around the black hole, after which Amelia goes towards Edmund as planned. But Cooper sacrifices to reduce weight and goes into the singularity (think as core of black hole), where he lands in a tessaract (4D version of cube) which has been designed as a control centre by future humans/alien beings for Cooper to interact with Earth in space time coordinate-set as space being Murph's room and time being her childhood.TARS gets quantumCooper and Amelia made their journey towards Edmund, and Tars was to get ejected into the black hole to gather quantum data.

After this Cooper gets ejected from the tessaract and reaches near Saturn through the wormhole.Data is taken by Murph and used to build advanced space stations that carry the entire human race to space. Years pass in doing this. This is those 51-years which they lose in moving around the black hole. To keep it simple assume Cooper was born in 2000 and leaves in 2042 when Murph was 10 years old. When Prof. Brand dies, it is about 2074 and Cooper and Amelia leaves Mann's planet.They lose 51 years and when he is in the tessaract it is 2125, but connected with Earth of 2042. Then he transfers data and falls through wormhole back near Saturn. Murph gets data when she comes back to the room in 2074 and then they start constructing a space station and after this progress in the next 51 years till 2125 they are well settled on the space station and moving towards Edmunds. This is when Cooper is found. He meets his daughter, but on her advise decides to leave for Edmunds to join Amelia who had also lost years just like Cooper at Millers planet and in black hole manoeuvre and is still young. It is obvious that in some time everyone will move to Edmunds.

However, a clerical mistake disallowed him from joining on time. After the issue was resolved, he finally joined 20 days late.However after joining, he started feeling like he was a pig at a rooster party. He tried very hard to get used to his surroundings. He would show Josh during the cross country practice, he would try to keep his cabin clean whenever he could, try his level best in PT. However, he never thought he could fit in. Joining late, he had no time to actually settle down. He got injured once, he also failed some of his tests. His parents would come to him and ask him to leave, and appear for JEE afresh. He also participated in the public speaking competition, being told to take part just 2 days before the competition, he gave it all he had but received very little appreciation. All these thoughts constantly kept nagging him. The endless PT and punishments made him question if this is what he really wanted. One particular day, he woke up, it was a Holiday. In his sleep deprived state, he asked God to show him a direction. His parents were coming to meet him that day and he decided that whatever they said, he would follow. They came and asked him to leave. Despite protesting briefly, he decided to accept their proposal. And so he filled for a resignation, deciding to give up his childhood dream and passion.After he left, he thought he was happy. But just a few days later, he realized the mistake he had made. All he required at that time was a break from the routine. But he had instead left the academy. He tried to concentrate on his studies. But the bitter sweet memories of the past would haunt him day and night. He cursed every one around him. He would look at the posters on the wall of his room and would be transported back to the time he wanted to join NDA. He just couldn't take it anymore. He called himself a coward for chickening out, for listening to his parents. He cursed fate, luck and God for not guiding him properly, for destroying his one dream which he had worked extremely hard on.He tried to live normal again, and one day decided to climb up a mountain behind his house. And when he did, he sped up the incline. At the top, he smiled and said–“Yeh toh Para ke mafik hai yaar.”The picture on the motivational corner of his squadron building was that of Capt. R Harshan from 2 Para SF.And that's when he decided. He will go back to the forces.
