Probably not, because, in this incredibly risk-adverse Hollywood environment, the studios haven't been shown that VR can be successful (or a good pitch to investors) yet. They definitely won’t allocate their resources towards big budget blockbuster experiences in VR until it's been very heavily tested, improved, and popularized.","45,622 followers",David Seidman,1.2K,3.6K,85.1M,2016,https://www.quora.com/How-is-technology-going-to-impact-the-moviegoing-experience-over-the-next-5-10-years

As I've upgraded my house with IoT devices, I've always been pleased with the quality of life improvements I've gotten. But I'm less cost sensitive than average, and many things still aren't available in a WiFi version. That's highly likely to change over the next 5 years as WiFi devices and components become even more highly commodized and integrated into the manufacturing pipeline. As a result, software will be able to control much more of the physical world and will thus be more useful.Meanwhile, AI will allow software to do more things only humans can currently do. That ability will make everything with software much more valuable. It's hard to project exactly how, but it will be huge.On the supply side, we see at most modest increases in the number of CS majors. Boot camps may provide a more significant bump, but we're taking 10–20% increases in supply of developers compared to 10x increases in the value of software.

3,"This question requires a book-length answer.Here’s the TL;DR version: In the past 30 years, there’s been a major technological shift towards digitization. At first, this affected just production — CGI almost completely replaced hand-drawn animation and, in live-action movies, analog special effects. Pretty much anything a filmmaker imagined could now be realized on screen, even in live-action movies. Of course, movies became so digitized that the term “live-action” became problematic.

At first, this affected just production — CGI almost completely replaced hand-drawn animation and, in live-action movies, analog special effects. Pretty much anything a filmmaker imagined could now be realized on screen, even in live-action movies. Of course, movies became so digitized that the term “live-action” became problematic. So did the term “film.” Bottom line, it’s not really the same medium anymore that Edison and a century of artists explored, a medium dependent on light passing through a strip of celluloid at 24 frames per second.The shift to digitization also greatly affected distribution. Theaters were forced to convert their projection systems, at considerable cost, which bankrupted many of them. But that was only the half of it, as studios began to realize their dream of streaming content into homes and bypassing the theaters altogether (and, therefore, not having to share the grosses with them.) With the onset of the pandemic, many in the industry expected this long-simmering change to accelerate, but the dwindling of the pandemic has actually shown that people still appreciate the theatrical experience, the thrill of gathering in a darkened auditorium among a large group of strangers and immersing oneself in the spectacle of a movie. Nonetheless, the streaming trend appears unstoppable.What these changes in production and distribution mean for the industry and the medium are huge, profound questions to which no one yet has a satisfactory answer. Is a movie still a movie if you watch it on your tiny phone screen? Is a limited TV series more like a movie if it’s meant to be binge-watched in a single sitting? Is a movie a cartoon if it was made entirely inside a computer, with the characters’ movements created by replicating the actions of actors in motion-capture suits acting in front of green screens? Do we even need actors anymore, or can we just digitally create new ones or resurrect the dead legends of the golden age? Is there a ceiling on how much a movie can earn if it’s only streaming to subscribers and not available to one and all at the box office? And if so, what defines a blockbuster? Is it still a movie if we’re all experiencing it in an atomized way, on our own screens and at our own convenience, instead of over a single weekend in mass groups at the multiplex? Now that anyone can make a professional-looking video, why should the official culture production industry carry any more weight than the creations of random people on YouTube or TikTok? What, if anything, are we losing if the two-hour feature film shown on a 40-foot screen ceases to exist? What does it mean for our common culture if the last vestiges of shared experience vanish?Shifting technology may ultimately answer these questions, since it continues to evolve inexorably in certain directions, whether anyone wants it to or not.","246,826 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-is-technology-going-to-impact-the-moviegoing-experience-over-the-next-5-10-years

I imagine everyone with the right equipment would start sending all kinds of messages to the aliens. Companies would be formed to make better transceivers for the public that are guaranteed to reach the aliens. One could write countless books on all the shenanigans that might happen, from government cover ups and government regulations about the communications to forming global committees in charge of all communication with the aliens. People will fake messages from the aliens, claim they have special knowledge. All kinds of crazy things would probably happen.Most likely basic communication would start by sharing history and culture and within 20 years or so a large sharing of basic technology and physics knowledge would probably occur.At first I imagine it would also increase the enthusiasm for space flight. No doubt funding would come out of the woodwork and increase by a factor of 100 or more. New space companies would pop up over night. There would be a resurgance in STEM education and more students would go into physics, engineering, and biology. Wild new theories about faster than light travel will be fads that come and go every other month with a new theory.Investment into research for advanced energy production will also probably increase by 10 times or more, as well as investment into research of space drives that have a chance to accelerate ships to significantly faster speeds than we have today. Investments into all kinds of tech would probably increase.This would good us a great reason to reach the nearest star system and there would be a ton of money and energy thrown into it. Starting the project of building ships to traverse the gulf between our stars would no doubt be a hit topic. Goals would be set and new tech slowly developed. At first most goals would probably be wild estimates with some claiming we could build a ship to travel to Alpha Centauri, within 10 years, and travel there within 50 years.Plans will be formed with the aliens to have joint projects where we both build interstellar ships that meet in the middle and set up a space station where our cultures can interact in peace.Exploration of our solar system will no doubt also be amped up.
