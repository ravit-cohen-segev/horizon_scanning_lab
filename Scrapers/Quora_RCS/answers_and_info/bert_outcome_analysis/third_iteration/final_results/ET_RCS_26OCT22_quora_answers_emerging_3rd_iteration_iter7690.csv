This is the Ford Nucleon…it wasn’t exactly a “concept car” in the modern sense because they never built one - but it wasn’t exactly a wild idea either.The car would have had a small nuclear reactor providing power. Instead of refueling it - you’d just take your car to the Ford dealer who would simply replace the entire reactor after some ungodly large number of miles.NASA came up with this nuclear powered Mars vehicle:Again, just a concept - but a reactor small enough to do the job is possible.Doing this on Mars is a better bet though - there is unlikely ever to be a collFord once thought so.

So if the reactor produces 3 kW, the car would be limited to a 9mph top speed!However, if the car still had a decent battery pack, the nuclear reactor could recharge it overnight by about 90 miles in 10 hours - which is enough for most people’s commute.Failing that - fitting 10 bowling balls into the trunk of the car would get you a 90mph car without needing batteries…and the reactors would last longer than the car itself, so it would never need refueling or recharging.[[UPDATE]] :But it would take 7 tonnes of fuel rods (which are insanely radioactive) to get enough Americium for ONE of those reactors.

Beryllium is a pretty good reflector in that is has a low absorption cross section for neutrons and even has a (n, 2n) reaction such that I believe, that at least some neutron energies, that it actually contributes some neutrons to the chain reaction.Consequently you have less than a critical mass of plutonium, that is less than is critical as a bare sphere, going critical due to having a reflector of neutrons. The principle here is that the reflector reflects some of the neutrons that would other be lost to the chain reaction.As spheres have the largest volume to surface ratio, they are the best configuration for criticality.Beryllium is also a low atomic mass nucleus. This means that a neutron can lose a lot of energy in a collision with beryllium - the beryllium will act as a moderator. This means that the reflected neutrons will be at an energy that is more likely to cause fission in the plutonium.Wherever I said plutonium in the above, I was thinking Pu239. I assume that the sphere was nearly pure Pu239.All of these facts point to the probability that this was close to the smallest reactor possible.A sphere of a substance made of Pu239 and a moderator, say zirc hydride, perhaps could be smaller but I don’t know of a reactor made this way.",UNKNOWN,Kirk,744,1.9K,17.7M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-smallest-nuclear-reactor-ever-built-Would-it-be-possible-to-ever-make-one-small-enough-to-power-a-car

As mankind explores the outer solar system (Mars) there is a chance that nuclear powered vehicles could emerge.It is possible to make some truly small heterogeneous fission reactors out of exotic fission fuels. The smallest true Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor is probably around 1 MWt, but using Americium isotopes as a fission fuel, it is possible to build functioning fluid fueled reactors three orders of magnitude smaller. Researchers in Israel (Dr. Yigal Ronen) designed a thermal aqueous homogeneous reactor [1] that was designed to weigh 4.95 kgs and had a radius of 9.6 cm (<4"" radius) and a power output of a few kilowatts. This small Israeli reactor design was spherical in shape and was powered by a solution of Am-242m(NO3)3 in water. When a fission reactor is very small in size (<10 cm radius sphere) it requires relatively little total lead shielding to fully enclose the reactor with 11"" of lead to provide protection from penetrating gamma radiation for the vehicle operator. Really small fission reactors can become more practical to consider for that reason.Fusion reactors for mobile application tend to be discounted because no one has recently produced a fusion reactor that actually generates net power.Fusion has many significant advantages for directly powering cars, planes, trains, and rockets to go to the stars.1) Fusion has no critical mass requirement, all that a fusion reaction requires is the right conditions be met (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) to support fusion. As a result, very tiny fusion power plants can potentially be built.While pure fusion experiments have so far not produced any net energy, impure fusion produced from fission-fusion assemblies works routinely (and has since 1952) producing fusion power on demand [3]. Modern Small fission-fusion assemblies that use Fusion->Fission->Fusion have been designed that use as little as 0.25 grams of fissile and less than 10 grams of cryo-Deuterium-Tritium fluid to produce fusion bursts of 100 GJ (the approximate energy produced when burning 779 gallons of gasoline). Hybrid Fission-Fusion or pure He3-He3 inertial confinement fusion power plants in mobile applications like vehicles or tools could use periodic bursts of fusion energy to produce electricity through magneto-hydrodynamic power conversion (no moving parts - near 100% Carnot cycle energy conversion efficiency) to recharge batteries which propel the vehicle across the surface of a remote planet [2].Will there ever be a nuclear powered car?[1] - Y.

9,"This is an easy one. To create hydrogen fusion you start with two individual Protons. You then ram these two protons together fairly hard to overcome their electrostatic repulsion so they fuse together Into a Helium-2 nucleus. That isn't too difficult, any simple cyclotron or linear accelerator could manage that all the way back in 1940. The problem is Helium-2 is incredibly unstable and in one-one billionth of a second it breaks back into two single protons. If that was the only possibility fusion would end right there and the universe would be very cold and very dark. However one time out ofThis is an easy one.

The problem is Helium-2 is incredibly unstable and in one-one billionth of a second it breaks back into two single protons. If that was the only possibility fusion would end right there and the universe would be very cold and very dark. However one time out of ten thousand before the Helium-2 decays one of the Protons emits a positron and a neutrino converting into a neutron. This makes the Helium-2 into Hydrogen-2 which is very stable and releases energy. So the chances of two protons becoming a Hydrogen-2 is 1/10000 or one in ten thousand.Now lets look at fission. The most common types of fission in current nuclear reactors is for Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239 to be struck by a neutron and break apart. In the case of Uranium-235 when a thermal neutron strikes the nucleus it creates Uranium-236* which is unstable. About 80% of the time, or eighty of one hundred times this is resolved by the Uranium-236* fissioning into two smaller nuclei releasing energy and one or more neutrons that can go on to cause the next Uranium-236* to form. In the other 20% of events the Uranium-236* releases a gamma ray photon instead and becomes Uranium-236 without the * representing trapped energy.So to cause Uranium-235 fission a neutron has an 80% chance but to cause fusion two protons have only a 0.01% chance. This makes the fission reaction 8,000 times more likely to occur than a fusion reaction. For Plutonium-239 the disparity is around 7,400 times more likely to succeed at fission than at fusion of two protons.","220,640 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,783.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-smallest-nuclear-reactor-ever-built-Would-it-be-possible-to-ever-make-one-small-enough-to-power-a-car

We all know that conservation of mass is a thing, so what gives? Well mass has still been conserved, but we must look at things through the eyes of relativity. UsingNow lets look at splitting Uranium-235 (U-235) by shooting a free neutron into its nuclei; the nuclei splits and one of the outcomes that is possible which we will be exploring further with is Krypton 92 (Kr-92), Barium 141 (Ba-141), and 3 free neutrons.mmmmΣΣThe difference isSo already we can see that fusion has its advantages in energy production, but what else is advantageous about fusion reactors? The most heavily pursued type right now uses superconducting magnets to confine a hot plasma of the hydrogen isotopes allowing them to fuse together into helium. If the reaction gets out of hand and can no longer be contained the hot plasma will damage the superconducting magnets causing the inwards acting pressure to cease. The hot plasma can then diffuse, expanding and cooling rapidly; in an instant it is no longer hot enough for the hydrogen nuclei to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between them meaning they cannot fuse. In short, a runaway nuclear reaction causing a meltdown has no where near the catastrophic consequences of a fission reactor meltdown like Chernobyl.Tokamak fusion reactor. The hollowed out chamber houses the plasma and is surrounded by superconducting magnetsChernobylOne last final point worth mentioning. The radioactivity of the products. U-235 has a half life of 703.8 million years. A one kilogram block of U-235 takes 703.8 million years to decay to the point that only half a kilogram of the material remaining is U-235, with the other half kilogram having decayed into lighter elements.Decay curve of U-235; y=mass x=time in yearsSame graph but looking at just the first 100 years. Notice how there is negligible change in mass. I could have a kilogram of nuclear reactor fuel sitting next to me for my entire lifespan and receive a negligible amount of radiation.The products of this reaction are Kr-92 and Ba-141, which have half lives of 210ms and 18.27mins respectively. These further break down into other radioactive isotopes with varying decay rates. For example, Cesium-137 has a half life of about 30 years. After a hundred years a kilogram sample of the products of nuclear fission will have decayed into ridiculously small amounts (calculate it if you want, but the specifics aren't relevant for this) with me receiving an incredibly lethal dose of radiation.The threat determined by half life figures goes contrary to the usual rule of thumb as a safer value will be in one of the extremes but anywhere in the middle and the threat posed is far higher. Extremely short half life (e.g. 210ms for Kr-92) isotopes release radiation at a high rate but decay so quickly that after the material is kept safely stored for a short duration of time so little of it remains that the emission rate will have dropped to a far more acceptable level. Extremely long half lives (e.g. 700 million years for U-235) release radiation at such a slow rate at any given point its effects are negligible. If the half life is neither extremely long or short (e.g. 12 years for tritium), its going to emit radiation at a dangerous rate and continue to do so for a not so insignificant amount of time.Deuterium is a stable isotope and Tritium has a half life of 12.32 years. The products are Helium-4 which is a stable isotope and a free neutron which decays into energy (photons) in about 10 mins, at which point its products can no longer undergo further radioactive decay. In other words, fission reactors take an isotope that isn't very dangerous and produces highly dangerous waste while fusion reactors would take a highly dangerous fuel and produce relatively safe products.I’ll let you decide which is better.","220,640 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,783.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-smallest-nuclear-reactor-ever-built-Would-it-be-possible-to-ever-make-one-small-enough-to-power-a-car
