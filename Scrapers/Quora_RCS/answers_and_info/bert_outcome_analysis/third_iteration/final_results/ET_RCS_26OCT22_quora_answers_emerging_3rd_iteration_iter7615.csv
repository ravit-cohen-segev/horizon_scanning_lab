0,"I will answer you as follows. My main goal is to direct you to an interesting project, and then it's up to you to decide. I learned a lot from developers or people close to them. I know the history of the project and significant news that you will either search for a long time, and if you find it, you may not understand or understand it incorrectly. Focus your attention on the Ideaology project. Its native cryptocurrency has the very potential you are talking about. The platform is both a marketplace for developers, a place to find professional freelancers and a crowdfunding environment.","3,398 followers",Raymond Scottman,1.1K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-green-technology-cryptocurrencies-with-real-potential

2,"No. Not in the slightest. IF this were to happen (and that is a huge if) it would have more of an impact on the credit card space than the cryptocurrency space.To begin with, you are totally wrong in your assumption. First, you say “since the US is looking to make…” This is patently untrue. They are simply doing an investigation. Your statement sounds as though this is going to happen, but they are only investigating the feasibility, so you need to cool your jets here, they only want to know if this is worth pursuing.

Secondly, they are not investigating a cryptocurrency, they are investigating a digital dollar. This might seem to be the same thing to you, but your statement starts to imply that there is a move to crypto that somehow legitimizes crypto. The huge difference is that a digital dollar would be a currency used for purchases. Cryptocurrency is really only a speculative instrument, the reality of crypto being a medium for purchase never came to be because crypto is too risky and volatile.A digital US dollar would simply be another manifestation of the US dollar, no different than PayPal or Venmo. It would not legitimize bitcoin and in reality it would probably hurt bitcoin more because all of the bitcoin advocates that believe bitcoin will somehow become the de facto world currency would see their hopes slip away.Those that believe somehow an anonymous third party crypto is going to become legitimate and become the new currency simply do not understand the true function of currency in an economy. It is so much more than just purchasing. And crypto fills none of those core functions.",6 followers,Ryan Burner,735,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-green-technology-cryptocurrencies-with-real-potential
3,"It can't.Bitcoin remains highly speculative, meaning not stable enough to base a currency upon. It is not backed by anything at all besides what the next person wants to pay for it unlike the US dollar that is at least backed by the good faith and credit of the government…whatever that should mean to anyone.","99,918 followers",Alcatraz Dey,9K,1.4K,68.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-legal-to-make-your-own-cryptocurrencies-Is-it-expensive-What-would-it-take
4,"For the same reason that Facebook is good when anyone can make another social network. I mean, Google made Google+, and what happened? Nothing. People just continued using Facebook.It’s the same with cryptocurrencies, they are also governed by network effects - when deciding which cryptocurrency to use, it’s best to go with the one that other people use, so that you can make transactions with them. Which means Bitcoin, not some other cryptocurrency.",27 followers,Benjamin Price,1.2K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Since-the-US-is-looking-to-make-a-cryptocurrency-does-it-legitimize-Bitcoin
