However as an engineer, I think we have most of the technology already available. The first thing is to define what you mean by terraform.1. If you mean can we make it so it can support human life,Now the first one is fairly easy as that one can be done with enclosed habitats, domes, or sealed underground caves/tunnels. We would still need to work on maintaining a viable ecosystem but with the right resources applied it can be done even now. The overall cost for putting such a habitat on Mars would be high but all the technology pretty much exists right now.The second scenario would require more effort and some technology that I will describe later in the paragraph. One of the biggest issues is creating an atmosphere of high enough partial pressure of O2 and an overall temperature that a person could walk around and be able to survive. The initial consideration is that the current Mars atmospheric pressure is about 0.087 psi. Meanwhile the minimum pressure that a human can survive without their blood starting to boil at body temperature is called the Armstrong Limit (after Henry Armstrong) and is around 1 psi (or 0.906 psi to be more exact). Also the surface temperature of Mars varies from 68F (at noon on the equator) down to -243F (at the poles) with an avg of about -80F. The low atmosphere is due to a lower gravity and ablation of the atmosphere from the solar winds over a period of billions of years.So we wouldn’t need to fix the ablation issue right away, but we would need to basically release massive amounts of O2 to get the pressure higher. Along with that, we would need to consider adding some CO2 to help hold in more heat along with numerous solar reflectors put in orbit around Mars to help with adding more heat to the surface. Fortunately we have a planet with loads of O2 (in the form of CO2) and CO2 available. Venus also has a very dense atmosphere so it has some to spare for our little Mars experiment (and at the same time it would help to start terraforming Venus). So just how much atmosphere would we need to get? Well the surface area of Mars is about 56 million miles (I am rounding up a bit). The air pressure is based on how much mass is pushing down so if we need 1 psi, than ever inch needs the equivalent of 1 lb (under Mars gravity) pushing down. The current Mars atmosphere has almost no pure O2 so we will bring in the whole amount. The number of square inches per square mile is about 4E9 (a four with 9 zeros behind it) inches per square mile. So the weight pounds of O2 is 5.7E7x4E9 = 2.3E17 lbs or about 1.2E14 Tons of O2. No matter how you look at it, 1.2E14 tons of O2 is a lot. An example, the Earths atmosphere is about 5E15 tons at 1 G or under Mars 0.38G that would be equivalent to 1.9 E15 tons. So to restate that, if you moved all Earth’s atmosphere to Mars, the air pressure would be less on Mars because the gravity pulling it towards the planet’s surface would be less so that 14.7 psi on Earth would now be about 5.6 psi (or almost near the top of Mount Everest).That means we would need almost 100% O2 or a lot more mass added to Mars to get the atmosphere up to where we want it to even survive. Venus meanwhile has an atmospheric mass of 4.8E17 tons of atmosphere (or about 93 times that of Earth’s). So it has a lot of mass and O2 to borrow from.Now we are down to what technology would need to be developed and how to use it. First we would need an automated system on Venus to build floating O2 extractors that are self-replicating. So once built, the scrubber would build two more scrubbers and a rocket system then start scrubbing the CO2 into O2 along with using the extracted carbon and solar wind to make various hydrocarbon (plasitic) chains and graphite/nano tubes/etc structures to hold the O2 and fuel systems. We would also need some self-replicating structures to build solar panels for energy to be beamed down to the CO2 scrubbers for energy. Then based on exponential growth, the number of scrubbers, solar panels, and rockets would continue to double every cycle. It is like having a penny at the beginning of the month and doubling it everyday for two months. At the end of 2 months (or 60 cycles), you would have 1E18 pennies (or in the terraformer process it would be scrubbers, rockets, and solar panels).Then using some of the O2 from Venus and H2 from the solar winds, you can use that as a rocket propulsion system along with the gravity assist from both Mercury and Venus to propel the payload into the Mars orbit. The biggest cost and development would be designing and building the initial self-replicating platforms. After that it would only require waiting the appropriate number of cycles and now you have a Mars with a survivable atmosphere.Okay, the next stage would be to get Mars to be Earth like. The biggest issues with that is getting more mass and surface water and generating a magnetic field to decrease the atmospheric ablation issue. The biggest technology needed would be better calculations and mass thrusters to move various asteroids from the asteroid belt or heavy metal comets to crash into Mars. If you broke them down into small enough masses, you wouldn’t even damage your new atmosphere very much. Some of the water could be obtained from Venus’ O2 and the solar wind or some could be obtained from the gas giants (like Jupiter and Saturn) or their moons and shipped to Mars. It would again require a self-replicating system but would also need the added complexity of coordination of all the moving units to improve the efficiency. Again, none of it is out of the realm of our technology with a few breakthroughs.The last piece would be replicating a similar moon around Mars for tides (if that is what was wanted) Again, just start smashing them together to get a larger and larger moon with the impacts to help slowly push it into the orbit you desire.One of the interesting things is after you have terraformed Mars (and possibly Venus) you would have a large number of remotely controllable machines that...",826 followers,George Dowson,754,527,3.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-5G-network-smartphone-will-be-release-next
2,"No.EDIT:ThNo.EDIT:The atmosphere of Mars is almost entirely CO2. Plants metabolize CO2 and emit O2. That’s a good thing for humans, because humans need O2 in order to survive, so the notion is that we’ll seed Mars with plants that will ultimately produce a breathable atmosphere for humans.One problem, though, is that plantsThe cold is a serious problem for plants. Sure, at the Mars equator it might reach a balmy 60F occasionally, or even a little higher, but that is not an average daytime temperature, and at night it dips back down to -80F to -100F. If you want to see how well plants cope with -100F temperatures, have a look at the forests of Antarctica…The atmosphere on the surface of Mars has the same average pressure as Earth’s atmosphere at 100,000 feet. The average treeline on Earth is at about 10,000 feet. Nothing much grows above that altitude, let alone at 100,000 feet. The summit of the tallest mountain on Earth (Everest) is just 29,029 feet high. Nothing lives there, aside from humans who routinely die if they spend more than a few minutes there (even if they’re breathing canned oxygen).Good luck growing plants at a hundred degrees below zero at the equivalent of 100,000 feet of Earth altitude. I’m not seeing it.Oh, plus the soil of Mars is poisonous to plants.Sure, we can set up a lab experiment to make oxygen out of water (easy, it just takes electricity). That same operation is going to produce a lot of hydrogen. If you dump the hydrogen and the oxygen into the atmosphere, there is a fire hazard. One big fire could turn all of the oxygen back into water. You make water by burning hydrogen. Humans can’t breathe water. So that’s back to square 1.There’s also the problem of scaling the lab experiment up to a planetary scale. How is that going to happen? Are we going to cover half the Martian surface with solar panels to produce the necessary electricity? Are we going to build nuclear power plants all over the planet to produce the electricity? If anybody really believes that we can produce an atmosphere on Mars in 50 years, then they should also believe that we can control the atmosphere on Earth within 50 years. If we can do that, then what’s the big deal about terraforming Mars?So let’s say most of the water on Mars is split into oxygen and hydrogen. Let’s further presume that a) the hydrogen is safely sequestered for use as fuel, or b) the hydrogen floats up and escapes into space.That eventually solves the fire problem, I suppose, but either way you still have the problem that Mars has very little water. Converting the water into oxygen reduces the already small amount of water, and human life isn’t any more possible without water than it is without oxygen. Granted, without oxygen you’ll die in minutes, while without water you’ll die in about three days. But neither alternative gives you a lot of time, and dead is dead. I’d cut that death from lack of water figure down dramatically in a hyper-arid environment like Mars. Without water, you probably wouldn’t last a day because the environment would parch you like a mummy.Even so, let’s say we can convert massive quantities of Mars water into oxygen. Let’s say we convert all of the water on the poles (scant as it is). What is our water source then? What do we water the plants with, that we intend to plant all over the surface of the planet? Plants need water just as much as humans do. Let’s say we drill wells and pull water from Martian aquifers, presuming they exist. How do we store the water we pull from the aquifers? If we irrigate plants with it, how do we keep it on the surface? On earth, it is estimated that there is three times as much water in the mantle as there is on the surface. The mantle may well be saturated, and that may well be one of the primary reasons that so much water stays above ground. But that underground water on Mars (which is a supposition—we really don’tMars is a cold, dead little world for a variety of reasons that are far beyond human technology to affect on the scale of an entire planet.Even taking all of that into account, we have to consider the lack of a magnetosphere again.The radiation bombarding the surface of Mars is going to do its best to kill anything that’s trying to live there.The solar wind and GCR’s are going to blow away whatever extra atmosphere is created. Not immediately, but inexorably. The planet just isn’t equipped to hang on to an atmosphere.And so on…Maybe, if we could redirect a Mars’s mass of asteroids and comets from the asteroid belt and beyond to collide with Mars, the spectacular collisions and increased mass of the planet would melt it into a new primal world, restart the electromagnetic dynamo to give it a magnetic shield again, provide it with enough raw material to eventually produce a real atmosphere and enough water to blanket a large percentage of the planet, and make a garden out of it. But I’d expect that process to take at least several hundred million years. Patience would be required.Mars, indeed the universe, is a harsh, beautiful mistress… ;-)",207 followers,Daniel Bamberger,803,961,2.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-humans-could-have-the-technology-within-the-next-fifty-to-hundred-years-to-possibly-terraform-a-planet-like-Mars

We've been together ever since.But now, now that she has an expiration date, I just don't know what to do — I'm scared and lost.Monday morning at work I was telling my best friend and supervisor, Timmy, about my wife's condition. Timmy told me that I.T. or Intelligent Terrestrial just came out with their latest models.These models are different than those of yesteryear because they are 52% mechanical and 48% biological.Timmy said all you have to do is mail a sample of DNA to I.T. and upload a digital copy of your consciousness through an app. You can then purchase a custom made clone at an age of your choice. When the clone arrives it will turn on, study it's surroundings and await a consciousness download.“Oh my God Timmy, what's the catch?”“The price, Leon.”When I got home from work, Jess and I plugged in and uploaded a digital copy of our entire conscious catalog to I.T. and then mailed off DNA samples.Jess asked me what age I wanted her to be. It felt awkward to say “twenty”, but I did it — I was honest. I miss her smooth, youthful skin and I want her to be young and healthy — especially if I have to cash my entire 401K in to afford it.We told her parents that we were going to basically bring her back from the dead and her father threatened to shoot any abomination that we brought into this world.One month later, on a day that Jess was particularly ill, the doorbell rang.Jess and I dragged the box through the door and laid it on the living room floor. I gently cut along the lines and when I opened the flaps, there,she,was.The last time my heart fluttered like this was the day I met her.Jess helped me lift I.T. out of the box and sit I.T. up.I.T. was warm and soft. I.T. was mine. I paid for I.T. I own I.T.Machines like this don't have rights — even though they are part biological, the governments recognize them in the same way they would a lawnmower — so, as I said, I.T. is my possession.The science behind uploading a digital consciousness is so cutting edge, that the laws just haven't caught up yet.Jess turned I.T. on and I.T. looked right into my eyes. I was in love — with two women, but, it was the same woman. We hadn't uploaded Jess' consciousness yet, so, I.T. was running on basic programming, but I.T. was gorgeous.Jess asked me what I wanted to do, and for the first time in a very long time — I lied to her.I told her we should go shopping and buy I.T. some clothes.I.T. doesn't seem to have a personality yet.“Hello…. Smile…”Jess picked outfits for both of them and we went for a walk through the park together. It was amazing — I was so happy.We walked down a cozy little trail and found a tuck away to sit and talk.I.T. watched and studied every move Jess and I made. I.T. was learning and adapting.I.T. was becoming aware.At one point Jess and I got distracted and I.T. wandered off. When we found I.T., I.T. was gazing at the sky.I asked I.T. what it was doing. I.T. said, “Where do I come from?”“You come from Heaven. You are my angel.”That answer seemed to work for I.T. We all walked back to the car and headed home.When we got home, Jess immediately started coughing. She fell to the ground and I tried to help her, but I didn't know what to do.Jess passed away right then. It was finally over.I called her family and the police. It took an hour for them to remove the body. I had Jess 2.0 sitting in my back room waiting for them to leave.After the police left, I plugged I.T. into my laptop and downloaded Jess' consciousness.After the download was complete, we walked outside and I looked into her gigantic brown eyes. I asked her, “Is it you, Jess?”She smiled and said, “It is, silly — now kiss me.”Her head slammed back. I didn't know if she was glitching or what and then I heard a bang and saw a hole above her left eye.My beautiful Jessica died twice today. I was crushed.Over the next two decades, I fell into a deep, dark, alcohol-fueled depression. Although I had developed a serious alcohol problem, I was able to work and save every single penny I earned.After twenty years of saving, I decided I wanted both of them back — the twenty-year-old Jess and the forty-year-old Jess.I sent my entire life savings off to I.T. and in one month, my doorbell rang.I cut the box open and wept when I saw my angel(s).I turned them on.I also clothed them. The younger version of me may have left them in the nude, but at this age, I just want my companion(s) back.The ladies helped me back to my room to lay down. I was so tired from all the excitement.I've waited and worked an entire lifetime to be with the woman I love. And now, at long last — she is beside me.I died, on that very night as a happy man.One day later, the doorbell rang. It seems my beautiful Jessicas used my direct deposit life insurance benefit to make a purchase.They gently cut the box open.And turned me on.You ask where technology will be in 2050?We will be everywhere.LeonSpecial thanks:Cameron — Dear friend.

A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one. It's hypothesized that the reason humans learn so quicklyTransfer learning in ML models.Humans are really good at generalizing. We only have to see a few dogs before we can recognize a dog when we see one.Machines are not.

A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one. It's hypothesized that the reason humans learn so quickly is that we are fitting new examples into our existing knowledge rather than forming entirely new categories. If we could teach machines to do the same, they would learn exponentially faster and apply that learning more effectively.Transfer learning is a very hot topic in AI research right now, so I expect major breakthroughs in the next few years. I think this may be sufficient to achieve artificial general intelligence, but even if not, it will dramatically extend the range of tasks that machines can accomplish.","135,532 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-5G-network-smartphone-will-be-release-next
