0,Many. Most of the companies with revolutionary products were indeed startups only.Very rarely do we look back and introspect.Today’s startups are mostly software based services or aggregators. Very few are product based.There is a hype created around startups and their founders. Most of them are out for making a quick buck at the cost of VCs. Very few are passionate about their firms.Hope this helps.,73 followers,Hrithik Kaul,34.5K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Were-there-any-startups-back-than-2003-in-India

Dockless means that the scooters would be parked on a public parking or a road which doesn't have much traffic, and a person who needs one can find it on the Bounce app and start it with an OTP.He can then park it wherever he wants and the next person would pick it up from there.So, as there's no checking being done on who has rented the scooter and is it parked safely or not this is what we have done to the scooters.A bounce scooter tThis startup hasn't failed yet, but it may if we Indians don't change our mind set.Bounce, a startup which runs in Bangalore provides dockless scooters on rent.

Leave this, I've once seen a Bounce parked on the Hosur Road flyover!This is a bounce parked in a private property. People have started parking in their apartments and the others cannot take them because the apartment security doesn't allow to. I literally had to fight with the security of an apartment to let me take the scooter even though it was the fault of someone in their building.Moreover, people ruthlessly steal helmets provided by Bounce for free which you can use and keep it back in the boot after you've finished the ride.Sorry to the owners of Bounce, but this business model is surely not gonna work in India. We Indians don't deserve something like this.The idea is amazing though. It should be tried in other countries like Japan where this could be managed much better!Image source - Google.Edit -In these scooters supposedly the battery and GPS system is removed so the company probably can't track it (Not sure, if anyone knows they can tell me in comments)How much does a helmet cost? Free in Bangalore :) (This guy stole the Bounce helmet and using for his own bike)Why just the tires and battery?

3,"long story short - we spend the most creative years of our lives acquiring academic degrees rather than real knowledge which saps away our brainpower when it comes to creative thinking coupled with the Indian mindset of playing it safe as 90% of Indian kids are under family pressure from childhood to adulthood to make choices that are 'safe' rather than based on instinct. We are book smart and hard working, but we channelize our energies in finding that elusive safe haven while quietly regretting the things we didn't do somewhere in the recesses of our minds.

We are book smart and hard working, but we channelize our energies in finding that elusive safe haven while quietly regretting the things we didn't do somewhere in the recesses of our minds. And then we just hope that someday our kids would do what we couldn't do, and then when we have kids, unknowingly, we press them again on the path to a safe haven rather than free expression.Also, failure in India is a black spot. There is a stigma attached to it. You just cannot afford to fail. Your failure marks you as the lowest among the low in the social hierarchy no matter how good you are at what you do.Governance is responsible to an extent yes since there is no social security in India. In the west, the government pays you if you are jobless. And people are honorable enough that they try to avoid taking that route. The stigma in the west is to be on government support and not failure to do well in business. Try implementing that in India and half the country will sit at home and do nothing.Another important point is that every economy needs to reach a certain critical mass to be able to support the next generation of businesses. In the Indian context, there is more hype than substance. The reason why ticketing sites do well and go to IPO while others simply shutdown or languish in mediocrity is the nature of the Indian consumer. Keep it simple and you will sell! The market has to be ready first for the next big thing. How many of you remember Apple Newton? It was the first PDA and it flopped massively because the market simply wasn't ready for it. Then later came the Palm Pilot and it made history.Another point is the number of people who actually use the internet for transactions in India as well as the overall consumption in the economy. We are still a nation of savers and not spenders. I live in London and the population of UK is 50 million (Bombay+Delhi+Bangalore+Chennai+Kolkata) and yet the economy is over a trillion USD, simply because of consumption. Even a construction worker in UK carries the latest iPhone and this is not an exaggeration! India has a tax payer base of 31 million and first mover advantage in any category is very important because every other startup in the same space seems like a me-too. Look around you and you will see that trend in online retailing. The sites that do well in online retail are clothing and accessories.The simple funda behind building any global scale business is this (except IT as the model itself is different) - you need to stoke internal consumption before you can build global scale. If TCS and Infy were purely product companies, then a large part of their success would have depended on the adoption of their products in India.A very close friend of mine runs a startup in Bangalore and he has no grand illusions about the scale his company will attain in the next five years. He makes a hard core product which is extremely difficult to fabricate and needs a lot of specialized knowledge, not exactly one-night-in-the-dorm-room-with-a-beer kinda stuff. Even then, his focus is on the domestic market first and he knows he will never reach a billion dollars because that is not the size of the market.The motive for entrepreneurship should not be solely about money which is the most common angle Indians take when they look at this. Entrepreneurship is about happiness. It is one way to achieve happiness - simply because if you are going to spend the majority of your life working, then why not spend it doing something you love? How many happy Indian entrepreneurs have you seen from the previous generation? Entrepreneurship was a compulsion and not an option for the previous generations because lack of good education rendered you unsuitable for a nice government job.To add to Anon's post below, getting married is not really a problem till you find the right partner who is willing to support you in every way. What bogs down is the burden of family expectations and the bells and whistles attached to a relationship. In India, marriages are not about the couple, ever! There are too many stakeholders and too little accountability for those stakeholders except the 2 protagonists.Try looking at the matrimonial section of ToI. In the 'Looking for a Groom' section, the only desirable candidates are IIT/IIM/IAS grads. That means everyone else is a fool and if the girl ends up with a dork out of one of these places, she can take solace in the financial security and prestige provided by the acquisition of such coveted qualifications. Then turn to look at the other side in the 'Looking for a Bride' section and you will find a multitude of people shamelessly publicizing the size of their paychecks since it's accepted wisdom in India that plenty of money is the best substitute for lack of everything else required to live a happy life.Hope this answers the question.","12,052 followers",Noah Kagan,10.1K,103,3.4M,2013,https://www.quora.com/Were-there-any-startups-back-than-2003-in-India

Big companies in the US are little more helpful to the ecosystem (Microsoft, Google, Intel all have their own startup ventures that invest & share technologies). Can you imagine a Tata or Reliance doing this?10. There is very little trust here. Angels fear the founders will run away with their money anytime. Given the weak law enforcement & no SSN equivalent identification, it is easy for the angels to be sideswiped.11. Weak university system. Valley has the likes of Berkeley and Stanford to feed the startups with smart engineers & marketers, while also organizing a number of networking events. What does BLR have? IIMB & other institutes in BLR are very weak when it comes to entrepreneurship (compared with Stanford).12. In US people are cool with failures. It is ok to fail as a startup founder.

Many of them were unable to find bodies. Even after a little bit of time has been explained, even after a little bit of way, we can not really develop any new technology beyond bamboo in the face of the open Manhole, we should be really shocked.

You were with us when you were with us. They had seen such a great generation, some of them ended up looking at them.'It was expensive to live and die cheap', this pain was also very painful for generations before. The new wounds that are going on in such a state of pain such as these generations, are now in the mind of the person with the help of this pain. If a person is born and enjoys the world's pleasant colors, he will take the message of the world, and if someone does not even have the chance to enjoy life, then he will end up living easily.

But, while exercising to adapt to the era of moving forward, every living creature does not have to constantly tears in the eye. To move ahead and follow the footsteps of time, tears must be erased from the eyes, and the one who has grown up in front of the newly released day has to face it.

The Number 12 CV was 1000 times more powerful than the existing American apparatus.The cargo was taken to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for development and evaluation and this gave MIT its leap foreward to become one of the powers in the world of technology.The Merlin engine, built under licence in America by Packard was used on the Mustang fighter, replacing the Allison engine originally proposed and making one of the best fighters ever produced.The Tizard Mission was followed up in 1941 by another mission led by Howard Florey and Norman Heatley who carried data on the effectiveness of Penicillin in treating infections and samples of the culture. Until then, Penicillin had been casually looked at rather than studied in America and no effort had been made to produce it, despite it being discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming. The American choice for open wound infections was Sulphanilamide powder, discovered in Germany. Due to the presentations by Florey and Heatley, American scientists realised the potential of Penicillin as a lifesaver; it didn't have to be sprinkled into open wounds, it could be injected to treat all bacterial infections. Penicillin production was started in America at the Northern Regional Research Laboratory in Peoria, Illinois and by the end of the War in 1945, US facilities were producing Penicillin in 10,000 gallon tanks and it saved thousands of wounded military personnel.The backroom contribution of British scientists, combined with American production capacity was just as important as the military contribution of both nations to the War effort. I would rate the contributions as equal.Sir Henry Tizard.The Number 12 Cavity Magnetron, the key to making RADAR small enough to fit in an aircraft.Howard Florey.Norman Heatley.A Wartime poster extolling the benefits of Penicillin.

The US fought two wars simultaneously and was victorious in both in what seems like a short space of time.If we take away the date of entry to the war and look at it from the point their soldiers actually started fighting crucial land battles then it was 14 months before their first serious engagement against the Germans at Kasserine Pass and their victory over the Japanese on Guadalcanal.

Larger nation, bigger economy, more population, hence the ability to field a larger and better equipped army. The US fought two wars simultaneously and was victorious in both in what seems like a short space of time.If we take away the date of entry to the war and look at it from the point their soldiers actually started fighting crucial land battles then it was 14 months before their first serious engagement against the Germans at Kasserine Pass and their victory over the Japanese on Guadalcanal. That leaves just under two and a half years to the defeat of Nazi Germany and a little longer for Japan, so it’s a mightily impressive feat.But they didn’t do it alone. Britain had been fighting (hard) since the war started, with some downtime during the Phoney War. Even then they were involved in land fighting in Norway and crucial battles at sea.After the fall of France, Britain took on the role as leader of the free world, enduring the threat of invasion, more setbacks in Greece and Crete and constant fighting against some of the beat Wehrmacht units in Africa.British forces were involved in the invasion of Italy, D-Day, Arnhem, Monte Cassino, the Battle of the Bulge (in fact every major battle in the west). They bombed Germany relentlessly. They fought large Japanese forces to a standstill in Burma and eventually defeated them comprehensively. And they sent a huge fleet to assist the US forces in the Pacific, most notably in the Battle of Okinawa.This, of course, was all backed up by Commonwealth and other forces.Germany was already fatally weakened by the time the US entered the war, mainly by the failure of Barabarossa and by the time of Kasserine Pass they had also lost at Stalingrad. A previous answer suggested that the UK and her allies could have beaten Germany given time. I’m not sure about that. I don’t know if they would have had the ability to invade Europe without US assistance but I also doubt the US ability to invade Europe and keep a vast army supplied, without having the UK as staging post.In no way am I downplaying the role the US played in the war but I think when you look at the relative contributions and not just money and size of army, then there’s little doubt the UK played a bigger part in the overall victory.",86 followers,Hal MacLean,3.6K,1.2K,1.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Were-there-any-startups-back-than-2003-in-India

20,"“Save” is an overstatement. “Greatly assisted” would be more appropriate. But in fairness to our British cousins, they “greatly assisted” the US as well. We just don’t seem to talk about it much in the United States anymore.Let’s be honest. When our 8th Air Force began to arrive in Britain to take part in the air offensive against the Luftwaffe and our leadership wanted to use two aircraft completely inappropriate for high altitude combat, the P39 and P40, the Brits “greatly assisted” by providing Spitfires and Hurricanes. When our merchant ships were being blown out of the water by German sub“Save” is an overstatement. “Greatly assisted” would be more appropriate.

When our forces began to build up in Britain, the Brits “greatly assisted” our forces by feeding and housing our military while their own population were in reduced rations. I can go on and on with this….the RN and RCN providing most of the combat vessels and landing craft at Normandy….the plans for jet engines that were later used in our P80. I can go on and on with the list of “greatly assisting”, but there’s only so much one can write. With over 80% of the naval vessels at Normandy being British or Commonwealth, not even counting the air offensive in that landing, shouldn’t we as Americans state that Britain “saved” the US at Normandy? Fair is fair isn’t it?When I read about WWII, the real WWII, not some nationalistic tripe or cinema, I actually take more pride in that the US and our Allies, worked so well together and covered each others back. I take more pride in that, than some nonsense about us saving the world all alone. If we had to really save the world alone, then we must be shit as a nation because it meant we had no friends or allies in the world.

22,"Yes. Today a website is like a business card. However, for a lot of small businesses sometimes a social media page could also suffice.

Although it is hard to verify, it’s possible, even likely, that his professional website helps build trust, so that people feel comfortable contacting him. But his business being a local business with a physical address and phone number, and his clients being mostly located in a 25km radius from his store, maybe the website wouldn’t even be necessary to build that trust.

Expanding your neighborhood to extend into the 2KM radius “might” help you to increase your bottom line.A website could in a way help you to test the waters beyond the 1 KM radius. However, one must bear in mind, to acquire your customers beyond their usual comfort standard 1 KM radius, your salon must be in a position to offer a unique value. Perhaps, the easiest and efficient way of communicating this value is through a website. Everything- ranging from various styles to discounts on the overall bill could be communicated, with an objective to bring in those customers who would not have tried your services in the first place due to the distance.In a another case, where you have enough customers, you may want to have a quick and reliable way to schedule appointments online together with pre-payments thus doing away with the need of anyone in your team to be on the phone. Every stylist’s calendar is online to pick the available slots. You get to add another touch-point in the user experience window by sending reminders which prevents customers from forgetting their appointments.Successful business are always about High Touch and not High Tech i.e. keeping the customer at the heart of the business. You do whatever it takes to get there, including engaging technology to create meaningful interactions.Technology - at the end of the day is to help a business perspective. A lot of business get low-touch with high-tech.
