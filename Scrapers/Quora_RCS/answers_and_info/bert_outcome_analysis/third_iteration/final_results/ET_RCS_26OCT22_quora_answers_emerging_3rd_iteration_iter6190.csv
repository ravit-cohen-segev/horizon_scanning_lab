1,"I’m not upset with the use of Emergency Use Authorization. I’m upset at how the specific implementation of Emergency Authorization here in the US created perverse incentives. No company or regulatory body should ever have a 100% liability shield as a part of an EUA because you have removed all incentives to properly report, recall, and remove bad products. The entire healthcare system breaks when the report/ recall system does not work properly.Have the government offer to pay 99% of the resulting liabilities if you must, but never, ever,",UNKNOWN,Chris O'Leary,1.8K,4.1K,89.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Would-it-have-been-more-prudent-to-not-authorize-emergency-use-of-Covid-19-vaccines-take-as-many-years-Or-decades-as-needed-to-throughly-examine-the-technologies-and-imposed-a-world-wide-lockdown-until-such-vaccines

You can survive a cold or the flu. Full-on COVID? That’s a crapshoot.Why risk that?And, let’s remember that the healthcare system in the U.S. is terribly expensive. If you catch COVID and you are admitted to the hospital, your bill is going to be astronomical. It could easily total $300–400K. If you survive, you will be saddled with that bill and potentially, a reduced capacity to earn money due to your new permanent disabilities. If you don’t survive, your family will be saddled with that debt.The shot is free.Get the shot.Update Omicron. 2/3/22. CDC reports that unvaccinated hospitalized persons are 97% more likely to die of this disease. The shots are still free.Swallow your bile and roll up your sleeve.Well, my friends, the time has come to disable comments. We’ve had a lot of good discussion but most of the comments now are rambling conspiracies by people claiming they personally know hundreds or thousands of people who died from the vaccine. These claims are, of course utter bullshit.

Ask your doctor, the one who's been taking care of you for years. Ask them any question you want to about it, even if you think it sounds stupid. My wife has been fielding questions for months now, she's happy to answer.Getting COVID from a vaccine is a 100% impossibility because the vaccines do not use whole, live viruses. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in fact, don’t use Covid Virus at all.Most of the vaccines being administered right now are a relatively new technology called mRNA that we started studying in the early 1990s.One of the most prolific categories of misinformation about the COVID vaccines relates to mRNA, how it works, and how thoroughly tested the technology is.First, it's important to know that this is a relatively new technology, not brand new. We didn't just suddenly decide to try mRNA last year when COVID-19 started running wild. The idea has been around for almost 30 years and has been used in human trials for a number of vaccines, such as Zika, and previous coronavirus threats, like the 2003 SARS outbreak. In fact, much of the reason we were able to get a vaccine so quickly was because of the nearly 20-year head start SARS gave us.It is true that the Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines are the first mass-produced mRNA vaccines authorized for use with the general public.The other big category of disinformation is about how mRNA vaccines work, specifically, the idea that they “change your DNA.""Let's be clear. That is completely, categorically, 100% false. The mRNA never even comes near the nucleus of the cell where the DNA is.The way it works is “mRNA"" or ""messenger” RNA is injected into the arm with exactly that. A message. The message is an instruction.Here is what the instruction tells our cells that it encounters:“IOur immune system sees that spike protein and knows it doesn't belong, so it builds antibodies to attack it, just like if you had actually been infected. In doing so, it learns how to destroy that protein. And most importantly, it REMEMBERS. So the next time it sees that same protein, this time on an actual virus, it knows exactly what to do.The reason you get 2 doses is that researchers learned during clinical trials that your body does ok with one lesson, but 2 lessons REALLY sets it in stone.It learns the lesson so well that 9 out of 10 times, it will be able to take out the virus before it infects your body, and in the VAST majority of cases where the virus does manage to infect an immunized individual, it will fail to cause serious illness, even in the more at-risk portions of the population.The final category of disinformation is about how thoroughly tested the vaccines are. And this one worries a lot of reasonable people and fairly.What it is important to know is that these vaccines have been tested just as thoroughly as any other that hit the market. How then did they get it done so quickly?It wasWhat Operation Warp speed allowed the pharmaceutical companies to do by removing bureaucratic roadblocks was instead of being forced to do Step A first, then Step B, then Step C, it allowed for a lot of multi-tasking. In other words, we still needed to complete steps A through I, but we didn't have to wait for step A to be done while we worked on step D or G which had no need for information from Step A. We were able to test a number of factors simultaneously, and in doing so accomplish 3 years of work in less than one.It wasn't that we didn't run all four laps of the relay race. It's that all four runners were allowed to start at the same time.This allowed for complete and thorough testing to be done in record time allowing for human trials WAY faster than we had ever been able to get to human trials before. And in the case of Pfizer and Moderna, those human trials proved the safety and efficacy of their Vaccines sufficiently to gain emergency use authorizations from the FDA.That's it. Years from now, we will look back at this as a massive achievement. And years from now the success of this effort will probably lead to problems, as people use the success of this effort to try to cut corners with the development of other drugs or therapies.But the bottom line is that the development of this vaccine is a massive success story. The vaccines are safe, they are effective, and the sooner we get to herd immunity by vaccinating the vast majority of the population, the sooner we can get back to normal.The one thing I'll tell you, from my experience having had both doses of Pfizer.I have one major side effect to report.A MASSIVE weight off my shoulders.",78 followers,Jennifer Larson,1.3K,11.9K,36.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Would-it-have-been-more-prudent-to-not-authorize-emergency-use-of-Covid-19-vaccines-take-as-many-years-Or-decades-as-needed-to-throughly-examine-the-technologies-and-imposed-a-world-wide-lockdown-until-such-vaccines

However, if you were a day laborer with no theoretical backing of how plants work, and you are hired to weed the same garden, then there is a lot more things that you will miss.For knowledge to be internalized, you need to understand the foundations, as well get your hands dirty. If all you do is read about how plants work, you do not have an intimate understanding of plants. If all you do is read about computers, then all you have done is see what people who are not you have done with computers. If all you do is weed gardens, then all you have is dirty hands (and a decent paycheck and pride in your work, I hope). If all you do is code, then all you have is your hands in code, and a decent paycheck and pride in your work, but you are building what other people tell you to, not creating new things.I have said it before on other answers: A lot of programmers think that their job is to write code. THis is a myth. A programmer’s job is not to write code, but to understand human problems and find technical solutions. The solution might be borrowing something that is already available, or buying software, or creating something new, or some combination of the 3. The idea that programmer’s job is to write code leads to the idea that programmers should always write code to solve problems, which leads to reinvention of wheels. In the long run, this is harmful to the industry.But, as a new programmer, what does all this mean to you? How does learning the fundamentals help you personally? You aren’t in it to understand computers at a deeper level, or to make the industry that is feeding you better, right? You are there to get a paycheck, and if banging out code gets you the paycheck, then well, you sure don’t want to be the one who says no, right? I hear ya.Let me tell you what’s coming, and then you make the choice. What’s coming is your next job, and the next job after that. We are far away from the era where employers would take care of their employees for life. Employers used to provide housing, education, a good enough salary, and pension. Basically, if you got a job at a good employer, and you worked honestly, you were set for life. We don’t live in that world. We don’t want to live in that world. In our world, we change jobs every 3–5 years. This means that we move to new tech stacks every 3–5 years. This might mean that you have to learn about new business domains while you are learning new tech stacks. In between these tech stack changes, you are learning new frameworks, ANd now, everyone has to be a full stack engineer, which used to mean being able to write a front end and a back end, but now means being able to write front-end, back-end, test automation, dev ops and build a CI/CD pipeline.So, how do we survive this constant change, and being able to learn new things? Frameworks change. Tech stacks change. Completely new languages get invented. Completely new ways of programming get invented. Your employer might train you, but only until your training helps them meet their goal. If you want to keep yourself employable, you need to learn all this on your own.The thing is in 2016, it’s very easy to criticize people who stuck to traditional databases. For people who didn’t understand computer science, it was a lot harder to do that in 2008. So, the question is do you want to be behind the curve or ahead of it? A “programmer” who just knows how to code and nothing else is usually behind the curve. A programmer who knows the science behind computing is generally going to be ahead.",17 followers,Kruti Naik,1K,361,5.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Would-it-have-been-more-prudent-to-not-authorize-emergency-use-of-Covid-19-vaccines-take-as-many-years-Or-decades-as-needed-to-throughly-examine-the-technologies-and-imposed-a-world-wide-lockdown-until-such-vaccines
