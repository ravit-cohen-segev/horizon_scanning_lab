Trump had signed an Executive Order declaring Huawei and its affiliates as “foreign adversaries” and as a consequence, American hi-tech companies and their foreign-based partners are forbidden to conduct business dealings with Huawei.Due to the blacklisting, Huawei had faced serious disruptions in its supply chains, since they had to integrate separate parts from foreign companies into their mobile devices and telecom equipment.If the ban goes into full effect that would result in US-based Google blocking its Android system, Facebook won’t allow its App on new Huawei smartphones, UK-based ARM has halted chip licensing for the Chinese company, while Germany chipmaker Infineon has halted deliveries to China, as well as Japan-based Toshiba and Panasonic would not send electronic parts to Huawei. US-based Intel, Qualcomm and Microsoft will stop working with the Shenzhen company too.The bad news has pounded Huawei hard, but the company could either make adjustments and push ahead or surrender and go bankrupt. As we can see for ourselves, Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei has no intention of quitting.But Ren has disclosed that he forecasts his company to lose over US$30 billion in overseas sales for this year and 2020 on account of the blacklisting. He had also confessed that he had underestimated President Trump.He did not expect to get struck so hard by the White House ban. Yet when confronting challenges, it’s essential to take a realistic approach. Don’t just assume you can overcome difficulties without making true assessment of your current conditions.Huawei will likely be required to push ahead on an alternative strategy, which is better known as localization. The methodology being that the Chinese hi-tech firm must expand its R&D (research and development) domestically, re-route supply chains locally and focus on selling to Chinese consumers.That’s another ways of saying, “self reliant” and let’s see if Huawei is already forging ahead on it. You can read more about Huawei’s conundrum in an article posted by EurasiaFuture. The link is here:https://eurasiafuture.com/2019/06/17/huawei-helps-guide-china-to-important-and-realistic-realisation-that-inter-dependence-is-different-than-connectivity/As reported by Eurasia Future:“The silver lining however is that as China pivots its erstwhile mass production manufacturing base to an economy predicated on high quality development in pursuit of forming a moderately prosperous society in all respects, there will be no further delusions about reality. The lesson derived from an objective examination of reality is that Chinese companies should never again place themselves at the mercy of foreign entities under the false assumption that win-win conclusions will be as desired by a foreign entity as they are by Chinese companies.In this sense, Donald Trump has taught China a valuable lesson. In a world in which nations are capable of being turned towards the largely irrational policy of hyper-protectionism, it is wrong to assume that such nations will avoid protectionist policies even if logic dictates that they are not sustainable. As such, the nation that seeks ever more open and ever freer trade must simultaneously prepare for times when self-reliance will become necessary due to developments beyond the borders of one’s country and hence beyond one’s control.”Some very good insights here and should raise alarm bells. The concept of globalization seems lovely and few would oppose it. But globalization has a fatal flaw: Countries have to cooperate with each other and failure to do so could lead to massive disruptions in supply chains and the international economy.When sovereign nations engage in fierce diplomatic disputes, they stand likely to announce punitive measures, such as imposing economic sanctions and raising tariff rates on rival countries. Hence, globalism becomes dysfunctional in the process.An effective counter measure would be for companies to act more self-reliant, so they don’t suffer the consequences when trade wars among nations do ensue. Huawei will adapt and start to localize with more vigorous efforts.","84,369 followers",Paul Denlinger,553,11.5K,55.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Has-the-Huawei-ban-sparked-Chinese-self-reliance

Sometimes called “spitting the dummy”.China has simply discovered that one nation in a world of hundreds of nations wants to play stupid games rather than getting on with free trade, with negotiations to cover unintended consequences.So China will look to find other suppliers of stuff it wants (but cannot be bothered making), in return for stuff their customers want (but cannot be bothered making). They will develop”self-reliance” as necessary (for stuff they think is important), and end up making stuff that the USA currently makes (such as airplanes and chips) and selling it to the USA’s customers in due course, at equivalent or better quality, for less than the USA’s price.Thus, the Huawei ban, based on nonsense and lies, will spur all sorts of actions by all nations, with an immediate impact on the USA, and an on-going contribution to its decline.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,9.1K,5.6K,427.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Has-the-Huawei-ban-sparked-Chinese-self-reliance

5,"It depends on the computer.If you write a C program for a simple computer like an Arduino - which has no operating system or anything - then for sure, you can access any byte of memory you want:unsigned char *x = (unsigned char *) 0x1234 ;printf ( “The byte at address %p is %d\n”, x, *x ) ;…prints the contents of the byte at address 0x1234 - or any other address you might choose to access.So the C language certainly makes it possible.HOWEVER:On more sophisticated computers, with an operating system and a special piece of hardware called a “Memory Management Unit” (MMU) - then you can’t do thatIt depends on the computer.If you write a C program for a simple computer like an Arduino - which has no operating system or anything - then for sure, you can access any byte of memory you want:unsigned char *x = (unsigned char *) 0x1234 ;printf ( “The byte at address %p is %d\n”, x, *x ) ;…prints the contents of the byte at address 0x1234 - or any other address you might choose to access.So the C language certainly makes it possible.HOWEVER:On more sophisticated computers, with an operating system and a special piece of hardware called a “Memory Management Unit” (MMU) - then you can’t do that.HOW AN MMU WORKS:What the MMU does is to map any block of physical RAM memory to be at any address you like from the CPU’s perspective. It can also raise an error to the operating system if the program reads or writes to an address that it doesn’t have mapped.So the operating system decides where in physical RAM space the program will be loaded and when the program is set running, it’ll use the MMU to map that memory into the addresses starting at 0x0000 up to as much memory as it asked for when loaded.So once the MMU is turned on, the C program THINKS it can see all of memory - but because the blocks it accesses are only the ones that the operating system has assigned to it, it cannot overwrite the space being used by other programs - or by the operating system itself without causing the MMU to flag an error to the operating system…which will typically cause it to “crash” the program.The result is that every program on the computer THINKS it’s seeing memory running from address zero upwards - but in fact it’ll be accessing some blocks of physical RAM that could be anywhere within the RAM of the computer.This also allows some additional tricks.SHARING PROGRAM SPACE:The MMU also allows the operating system to flag certain blocks of RAM as being “read only” - and then the MMU will flag an error if the program tries to write to it.This allows you to do things like running multiple copies of the same program - but with the parts of the program’s RAM that are machine code instructions being set “read only”. You can then have the two copies of the program share the program’s code - while each has it’s own copy of the data.SHARED DATA SPACE:There are yet cleverer tricks where two copies of a program can even share RAM space for variables and such - with the MMU detecting if one copy of the program changes a “shared” RAM block - then it’ll make a copy of it and map it back into the right place.SWAPPING:Another trick is that if the operating system runs out of memory, it can copy some of the physical RAM blocks out onto the disk drive - and mark them as blocked in the MMU. Now, another program can use that memory. When the program tries to access the blocked-off RAM, the MMU triggers a message to the operating system which finds a free block of RAM, restores the data from the hard drive and maps that block back into the correct place in the program using the MMU.The program runs perfectly, having no idea that a chunk of the memory it thought it owned has be shunted off onto the hard drive!Since hard drives are VERY large, this enables you to run programs that are bigger than the actual amount of RAM in your machine.The snag is, with all of this copying back and forth to disk, the program will run dog-slow.CONCLUSION:The MMU is the “unsung hero” that really makes sophisticated operating systems possible.But on a super-cheap machine that’s only intended to run one program at a time, then you don’t need an MMU, and C programs can read and write to any byte in memory.",31 followers,Rain Martin,952,1.1K,3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Has-the-Huawei-ban-sparked-Chinese-self-reliance
6,"In theory, yes you can do that in C, and it is not a good thing.Security has a base concept – defining boundaries and enforcement of boundaries.However, in a multiprocessing system, processes are kept separate. That is the data memory which keeps the state of execution of a single process is protected from other processes. Each process has its own logical memory.That is a kind of sandboxing. However, on machines with more enhanced security (even within processes), C must itself be run in a sandbox.Memory should be structured and viewed as structured, but C has a flat system memory model.

7,"Yes, with a C program you can access all memory locations from 0 to the last byte of memory.

It is a 3D render of the car that doesn’t change from vehicle to vehicle. My wife’s car is actually a super dark grey (almost black) color, not the medium grey displayed on the screen. I haven’t looked, but I’d bet that if your car was red, it would still display as grey on the image (though it would be cool if they changed the color of the image to match what is on your car).ADD: I found a great YouTube demonstration of this system, if you read all of this and though ‘What the heck are they going on about?’",393 followers,Aaron Granger,644,1.8K,3.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Has-the-Huawei-ban-sparked-Chinese-self-reliance
