Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party. Because radiation from nuclear accidents is apparently scarier than way more people dying of regular pollution constantly and the total annihilation of all life on Earth as the oceans boil away.","68,777 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-advantages-of-using-advanced-technologies-in-clothing-manufacturing-industries

It won’t unravel reality.In depth:In the 50’s, we had movies about Radiation and the weird things it would do. This was after the Atomic Bomb was debuted to the world.Oh wait, that was aliens. Here we go, 1957:If you get bitten by a radioactive spider, you get super powers (1962):Why? People knew Radiation could do amazing things - win wars, make plentiful power. They didn’t much understand it. It was the Next Big Thing.In the 80’s, when superfund sites were all the talk, we had toxic waste that would do strange and wonderful things:No one thought about toxic waste much, until then. It was the the Next Big Thing. People didn’t understand it much.Now it’s the 21st century and “Quantum” anything does weird things. We have our obligatory super heroes, or villains anyway:It is the Next Big Thing.Now, what does “Quantum” really mean? People don’t really understand it much.It means things can only have certain values, or “Quanta”.Classical physics, which works for everything all around us still, assumed that we lived in an analog world. Things could have any value; if you wanted half of a volt, you just divided it by two resistors, and you’d end up with half of the voltage.It turns out, that doesn’t work at a very, very tiny scale. Certain things can only have one value, or another; nothing in between.That makes it difficult when you HAVE to have something in between. Certain particles (waves) can sort of be in either of two places, which means they can “tunnel” through “walls” among other weird things. It also creates other weird aspects, like the particle wave duality and superposition. It also means that you really can’t measure some things without affecting them.Hey Kid, did you do your homework? (noises of a kid frantically doing homework).All of this happens only at a very, very small scale though.Still, Quantum effects are weird. The fact that you are reading this proves this effect is real; there’s a thing called a Zener diode [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zener_diode ] that wouldn’t work without Quantum tunnelling. [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling ]This doesn’t mean because of “Quantum” you can blip from here inside the bank vault. BAMFSo, what is quantum computing?Most computers work on one’s and zeros. The number seven is:0111Now, people get excited about this. It’s just a number. The number ten in base eight is 12 for example. Eight is 10. Seven is still 7.Quantum computers use quanta of various values (I believe spin states, usually) to represent zeros and ones. From that standpoint, it’s packing more ‘stuff’ into a small space, but the housings to keep the quantum ‘qbit’ (Quantum Bit) at the right conditions (cold) are usually pretty big. It’s also difficult to fiddle with individual atoms and particles, so usually quantum computers work statistically - they’ll do hundreds of atoms and average out their answers.Quantum computers work on two other principals of quantum mechanics, whic...","9,064 followers",Allan Steinhardt,655,2.3K,5.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-advantages-of-using-advanced-technologies-in-clothing-manufacturing-industries

The plug insert has to be a precise fit or it will leak or Caesar up. Ahem sorry,You see, a valve isn't just a valve.If you work back through the reverse butterfly effect of what is required to make a simple device standard across a whole empire that everyone uses, you see it takes a huge amount of collective effort.We have the benefit of fine machine tools, synthetic polymers, stainless steel, a literate population that can read and count, standardized factories. Decades of craftsmen and engineers talking with each other, comparing designs, sharing best practice.You need people to travel to demonstrate to craftsmen what is required. To travel you need efficient transport, or at least roads, and therefor a robust government administration to put that in place.You have to have literacy and numeracy to a degree, otherwise you will have simply a hundred differing artistic interpretations of “valve”, not an empirical design.You need enough of the workforce producing enough of a food surplus that a segment of the population can specialize in making stuff that isn't food. Like valves.All this has to be in place first.Rome, at its heart, was a slave owning economy based on simple agriculture. Human and animal muscle power drove it, and the wind helped blow its ships. In that respect it was little different from the Minoans, Egyptians, Assyrians or any other nameless, ancient culture.And yet the pre-industrial Romans managed to coordinate themselves to such a degree that small groups of craftsmen, as far apart as northern England and Egypt, with hand tools in simple workshops, could produce a standard device that could, literally, plug into a standard plumbing system in different corners of the empire.We picture the great aqueducts sweeping into the cities dumping water into troughs while the eager plebs gather around with their buckets.In actual fact it was a lot more elegant, and indeed modern, than that.",UNKNOWN,Tim O'Neill,673,657,10.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-advantages-of-using-advanced-technologies-in-clothing-manufacturing-industries

8,"It is often claimed that the period between the fall of Rome and ""the Renaissance"" was a benighted dark age and that if Rome had not fallen, we would now be more technologically advanced.  There are many problems with this idea. Firstly, it assumes that the commonly held idea that the Middle Ages were one of stagnation and a lack of technological advancement is actually true.  Secondly, it assumes that technological ""advancement"" is some kind of Whiggish,  inevitably ""onward and upward"" process of constant development and improvement.  So the idea seems to be that if there was no 1000 year lonIt is often claimed that the period between the fall of Rome and ""the Renaissance"" was a benighted dark age and that if Rome had not fallen, we would now be more technologically advanced.  There are many problems with this idea. Firstly, it assumes that the commonly held idea that the Middle Ages were one of stagnation and a lack of technological advancement is actually true.  Secondly, it assumes that technological ""advancement"" is some kind of Whiggish,  inevitably ""onward and upward"" process of constant development and improvement.  So the idea seems to be that if there was no 1000 year long hiatus between the ""advanced"" Roman era and the ""revived"" Renaissance, we we would be much more ""advanced"" today than we are now.There are major problems with all this.To begin with, the idea that the Middle Ages were a technological dark age that were only relieved by the glorious dawning of the ""Renaissance"" is a Nineteenth Century historical caricature, though one still taught by high school history teachers.  We now have a far better understanding of the Medieval period and realise that western Europe recovered from the collapse of the Roman Empire centuries before the so-called ""Renaissance"".There is no doubt that the western half of the Roman Empire never fully recovered from the Empire's near disintegration in the Third Century and, since it was poorer, less populated and less economically robust than the eastern half, it collapsed in the Fifth Century while the Eastern Empire survived.   There is also no doubt that for the next five centuries Europe was wracked by repeated invasions from all directions, the decline of long-distance trade and the fragmentation of political structures.  So it's true that in this period we don't see many large public building programs or much new learning and science.But we actually do see, contrary to the popular myths, is some quite significant technological advances, especially in farming.  The Romans had effective water-wheels and seem to have known of the mouldboard plough.  But it was in the early Middle Ages that people looking to find more efficient ways to farm using less labour adapted and improved these two key pieces of technology.  The invention of horse-shoes, the horse collar and the adoption of the heavy mouldboard plough meant that land which could never have been cultivated in Roman times became highly productive.  Huge tracts of what had been forest and moorland in northern Europe became cultivated, making northern Europe - formerly the poor relation of the Roman world - into a far wealthier place.Water power was harnessed on a scale never seen in the Roman period, with water mills being used not just to grind grain, but also to full cloth, produce leather, drive lathes, pump bellows and power trip hammers.  As a result, metals' technology advanced well beyond what a Roman smith could produce by hand via water-powered industrialisation.  New ways to harness mechanical power were also developed.  Mills harnessing tidal power were developed and the windmill was invented.  Blast furnaces were another Medieval European innovation.So the idea that the ""dark age"" of the Early Medieval Period was one of technological stagnation is simply wrong.  If anything, the political fragmentation  and economic decline that followed the fall of the Roman Empire actually stimulated new technology and drove developments in agrarian and semi-industrial production.Similarly, the idea that the ""Renaissance"" of the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries was the first revival after the fall of Rome is another romantic Nineteenth Century myth.  As the economy of Medieval Europe picked up pace thanks to the innovations and developments described above, there was a corresponding revival in education and scholarship.  Europe was in far more contact with the rest of the Mediterranean due to a revival of trade and the wars of the Crusades and the Reconquista in Spain.  Rumours of lost works of Greek and Roman science and philosophy being preserved by Muslims led scholars such  as Gerald of Cremona to travel to Spain and Sicily to learn Arabic and  work with Muslim and Jewish scholars to translate these works and bring  them back to the west.  This influx of ""new"" learning stimulated a  vigorous revival of scholarship in Europe, helped trigger the rise of  universities and, in the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries, saw a  flowering of science not seen anywhere for centuries.The result was a Europe-wide network of scholars and scholarship that didn't just revive the philosophical and scientific work of the Greeks and Romans but began to build on it and, eventually, correct some of it.  Medieval scientists like Albertus Magnus, Robert Grosseteste, Roger Bacon, John Peckham, Duns  Scotus, Thomas Bradwardine, Walter Burley, William Heytesbury, Richard  Swineshead, John Dumbleton, Richard of Wallingford, Nicholas Oresme,  Jean Buridan and Nicholas of Cusa began to lay the foundations of what would eventually result in the birth of the true scientific method.Medieval scientists were particularly interested in optics and the study of the nature of light using lenses.  It seems to have been this tinkering with lenses that led to another Medieval gift to the world - eye glasses.  The increased demand for books due to the rise of universities also led to experiments with the mass-production of books and, eventually, to another Medieval invention - the printing press.  And experiments with ways to mechanise time keeping paid off in the later Thirteenth Century with the invention of the first mechanical clock.So the idea that the Middle Ages were some kind of scholarly and technical hiatus and that if this hadn't happened we would be more ""advanced"" is based on several false assumptions.  The Renaissance was a movement in art and architecture that produced some very good paintings and buildings.  But it did little to produce anything technological.  Despite their popularity today, Leonardo da Vinci's drawings of flying machines etc were little more than whimsical doodles.  Leonardo's fanciful flying machine would never have flown.  Yet in around 1100 AD a Medieval monk called Eilmer of Malmsbury built a flying machine, launched it from the roof of his abbey and flew several hundred meters.The fact that everyone has heard of Leonardo's doodles and virtually no-one has ever heard of Eilmer's first experiment in manned flight says a great deal about the way the Middle Ages is overlooked and ignored, despite it being a remarkable period of history.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2011,https://www.quora.com/What-course-should-I-take-if-I-am-interested-in-all-fields-of-advanced-technology-like-quantum-computing-5G-IoT-AI-VR-augmented-reality-blockchain-satellite-communication-etc-cttro

In my article, I talk about the Greek historian Thoukydides (lived c. 460 – c.  400 BC), who rejected the idea of an ancient Golden Age. Instead, he believed that humanity was growing steadily more advanced and that the Greeks of very early times must have been exceedingly primitive compared to Greeks of his own era.There were certainly Romans who thought similar things, although I cannot think of any specific examples off the top of my head. Nonetheless, I’m sure that even the ancient Romans who did realize that humans were growing more technologically advanced probably wouldn’t have imagined the kinds of technologies we have today.Back then, technological progress was moving much more slowly than it is today and I’m sure that even most progressive-minded Romans probably would have assumed that it happened at a constant rate. As it turns out, though, technological progress is exponential; every new invention makes the next invention come a little bit faster. Consequently, we have technologies today that few people in ancient times would have even dreamed of.ABOVE: Image of a man dressed in a less-than-historically-accurate Roman soldier costume riding on a Segway poorly disguised as a chariot","68,777 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-New-Zealand-not-develop-their-own-rocket-and-space-programme-in-the-1960s-despite-their-advanced-technology-in-aerospace
