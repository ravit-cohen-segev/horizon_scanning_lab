1,"Robot Calling HumanThe feature that got the most attention on the first day of the I/O developer show was called Duplex.It’s part of the Google Assistant, a voice-controlled system that answers questions and performs an increasing array of tasks on command.Gmail Will Write Your EmailsDuplex relies on AI, a type of software that learns automatically from data, rather than having to be hand-coded.Google has been developing machine learning, computer vision, natural language understanding and other forms of AI for at least a decade and is considered a leader in the field.This technology predictsRobot Calling HumanThe feature that got the most attention on the first day of the I/O developer show was called Duplex.It’s part of the Google Assistant, a voice-controlled system that answers questions and performs an increasing array of tasks on command.Gmail Will Write Your EmailsDuplex relies on AI, a type of software that learns automatically from data, rather than having to be hand-coded.Google has been developing machine learning, computer vision, natural language understanding and other forms of AI for at least a decade and is considered a leader in the field.This technology predicts the next words or phrases as people type an email. It takes Gmail a step further beyond Smart Replies, a feature from a few years ago which suggests appropriate responses to emails.A New AI ChipGoogle introduced version 3.0 of its Tensor Processor Unit, a chipset designed in-house for handling all these data-heavy AI tasks.The new version is eight times more powerful than last year’s and it is water-cooled rather than air-cooled. Older TPUs are available for outside companies to rent through Google’s cloud-computing business. But for now, only Google gets to use the latest version.Maps Gets an AR UpgradeThe company introduced a Visual Positioning System, a new way for people to find their way around with Maps using their phone cameras and Google’s augmented-reality and computer-vision technology.AI-Powered Pic SharingGoogle announced big upgrades to its Photos app, including the ability for AI algorithms to suggest who to share shots with based on who is in the picture. The system will also make editing suggestions and turn black and white photos to color.A New News AppGoogle praised the importance of journalism and announced a new Google News app for Android devices, iPhones, and the web.It comes with a built-in subscriptions tool making it easier for readers to pay for digital magazines and newspapers. It also has a tab for suggested news and can play video. Sound familiar?Robot MannersGoogle said it will begin encouraging children to say “please” to the Google Assistant, to encourage better manners. Amazon announced similar functionality for Alexa a few weeks ago.Tackling Tech AddictionGoogle also wants you to use your phone less. Many tech companies are looking to free people from their devices, but Google is one of the first to show off tools.X-Like GesturesThe latest version of Google’s mobile software, called Android P, was announced a few months ago, but Google held back a big change for Tuesday: A revamped interface that looks like the iPhone X’s new gesture-based system.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-upcoming-IT-technology-related-projects-in-the-next-decade

The attention 5G is getting is similar to the events in the early 1900s and the race to establish the first telephone calls.Once the networks are fully deployed and the world benefits from the new innovations, we'll look back at this time and laugh.Maybe even forget why people were upset in the first place.","9,878 followers",Kenzi Mudge,1.8K,1.3K,8.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-upcoming-IT-technology-related-projects-in-the-next-decade
