0,"Assuming that no change in atmospheric pressure and Oxygen concentration, it is likely that animals could grow to a much larger size.The size of most land and avian animals are checked by gravity and availability if bio materials to support its skeleton. Such constraints are removed in marine animals and hence their animals are much larger. Also insects could be a lot larger.Impact on technology: probably not much. Objects would be lighter, and require less force to move or lift. I don't think humans would be super powerful because evolution does not require that .",3 followers,Samuel Bateman,1.1K,102,56.4K,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-different-do-you-think-our-civilisation-would-be-transport-society-technology-humans-if-the-gravitational-pull-of-Earth-was-a-lot-less-than-we-have-evolved-in

4,"As cosmologists (for instance, Prof. Martin Rees, in his bookAs cosmologists (for instance, Prof. Martin Rees, in his bookHowever, that doesn’t apply if the force of gravity was weaker than it is. Star formation would take place, and stars would live out a decent lifetime. One could imagine an Earth-type planet - roughly our size and composition, roughly our distance from a Sun roughly as luminous as ours, and existing long enough for complex life to evolve. The surface gravity would be weaker than on planet Earth, so it’s not unreasonable to believe that large animals would be a lot larger than the ones we see on Earth. They could get by with spindly legs. Beyond that, it’s hard to say what they’d be like.

I would have expected this to happen at some point because we seem to love novelty (at the expense of common sense at times), but it seems to be primarily a publicity stunt at this stage. Despite this, it’s likely that we’ll eventually see people vouching for AI having similar rights to humans.If these laws are passed, then it’s entirely possible that AI will have their own finances, professions, business operations, and also the leeway to establish buildings for ‘personal and private use’. Once this occurs, it may be difficult to monitor activity and intervene when/if necessary. Although it’s feasible that disrupting power or internet activity would quickly overcome most challenges that AI create for us.However, if AI had nefarious intent (which seems to be the basis of this question), it’s likely that we’ll suffer those consequences before we deal with the legalities of whether humans have the right to ‘influence the code of another being’; which could be likened to DNA manipulation.Any sufficiently evolved AI could infiltrate our transportation system and quickly ruin an economy, even if this is as simple as creating widespread traffic jams by altering traffic signals. There are many simple activities an AI could engage in, to create a butterfly effect, that would result in economic collapse; power disruption, influencing stock market prices, inciting war, releasing toxins into water supplies… the list is virtually endless.I suspect that if we reach the stage where AI are considered to have the right of self direction and self preservation (along with other human rights), then they’ll have demonstrated that there’s minimal risk in the provision of those rights. Consequently, it could be fair to suggest that we shouldn’t have access to their code; in the same way that humans have a right to preserve the structure of their DNA.Returning back to the question, whether events play out in this manner revolves around humans giving AI human rights.

7,"Still very far, in my opinion. Let me explain.Around 50 years ago AI and related problems were thought to be easy and computer scientists were optimistic to solve them within a few years. There was even a famous professor who had said that “computer vision” is an easy problem, which can be solved by a graduate student during a summer internship. In those days computer scientists were doing many far-fetched promises, for example to NASA and to US military. The research in last 50 years showed us that these problems are actually more difficult than scientists thought. All those unfulfilled promiStill very far, in my opinion. Let me explain.Around 50 years ago AI and related problems were thought to be easy and computer scientists were optimistic to solve them within a few years. There was even a famous professor who had said that “computer vision” is an easy problem, which can be solved by a graduate student during a summer internship. In those days computer scientists were doing many far-fetched promises, for example to NASA and to US military. The research in last 50 years showed us that these problems are actually more difficult than scientists thought. All those unfulfilled promises caused a distrust towards the AI field and fundings were decreased for a long period, which is referred to as “AI winter”.Now we have “deep learning” and another period of optimism has emerged. Deep learning really seems to achieve many difficult tasks and already causing revolutionary changes in many different industries. Thousands of start-up companies have emerged that are based on deep learning technologies and big companies have started pouring money into the field. Some are already getting quick return of their investments. Face recognition technology is just one already working example, but there are many others.But I think in the following years a similar kind of enlightenment will occur: we will understand that the AI problem is even more difficult than we think it is today. In the following years I expect people will start to recognize that developing a general AI is one of the most difficult problems in science, along with understanding the brain. And we will understand that some of the current promises are far-fetched.Because, if you look at the problems that deep learning (or in general machine learning) is solving, they are all kinds of problems that brain does automatically. We don’t know how we recognize faces, our brains just do it automatically. And this is only one part of brain function. And it is the most primitive one. The more interesting, and the more complicated side of our intelligence is our reasoning. The things that we are doing consciously, not automatically. Our “thinking” ability. Just an example: we watch a movie and think on it, solve causal relations between events, reason why some character behaved like that, draw conclusions, etc. We have not seen a huge progress at such reasoning part yet in AI.Evolution of animal brain took billions of years, over countless number of trials and errors. Even then, the most advanced brains in nature, such as dogs, or cats, are very limited in capabilities such as reasoning and analyzing. Only humans have reached that level so far, and that is with thousands of years of cultural evolution added to the biological evolution. Now we are trying to mimic the result of all this process of billions of years, just by doing a few decades of research. The bitter fact is, the only example to the intelligence level we aim is the human intelligence, and we are still far from understanding how it works.To sum up, we thought that AI problem was easy 50 years ago, and things proved that we were wrong. Now we start thinking “it is difficult but can be solved soon with some more research”, which will also be proved to be wrong within a few years. Soon we will understand that developing a general AI is an extremely difficult problem, which will require at least (optimistically) several decades of more research, and will probably require understanding the human brain.","20,171 followers",Sriraman Madhavan,4.1K,186,7.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-different-do-you-think-our-civilisation-would-be-transport-society-technology-humans-if-the-gravitational-pull-of-Earth-was-a-lot-less-than-we-have-evolved-in
8,"What is the probability that you understand even a very small fraction of the technology in the smartphone that you use?Now just consider that even someone like me, whose background in electrophysics means that at least I understand almost all of it, because it uses ALL of the technology that developed from the science that I learned, has very little “control” over any of it.If the audio socket or usb port on my old laptop stops working, I “might” be able to repair it myself.If the audio socket or usb port on my current smartphone stops working, or if I try to “root” my phone and make a mistakWhat is the probability that you understand even a very small fraction of the technology in the smartphone that you use?Now just consider that even someone like me, whose background in electrophysics means that at least I understand almost all of it, because it uses ALL of the technology that developed from the science that I learned, has very little “control” over any of it.If the audio socket or usb port on my old laptop stops working, I “might” be able to repair it myself.If the audio socket or usb port on my current smartphone stops working, or if I try to “root” my phone and make a mistake doing so, it either stays defective, or it becomes a “brick”.Not even useful as something that can be recycled other than the battery.So that is the “control” that someone like me, who “understands it”, has over smartphones.But of course we still have “access” to it. The price I paid for my first Texas Instruments “programmable calculator” is a lot more, in relative terms, than what I paid for my smartphone.I spent a lot of money on my first programmable calculator, because it helped me with my study of physics.And then I still used a circular slide rule on my exams, because the exams tested my knowledge of application, not my ability to get a precise answer.And I suggest that you too know of alternative ways of doing things that can now be done with a smartphone.My “Google Pay” app does not mean that the five pound and ten pound note in my wallet is obsolete. What is does mean is that if I am visiting relatives in the US, and I find that all of my credit cards and debit cards have stopped working, I still have a way of accessing my money.But what it also means is that if someone hacks my Google Account, it could theoretically be possible for them to get all of the money they could get from my credit card, just as if someone who steals my credit card can get all of the money that they can get from my “currency” account”, and just as if someone who steals money from my bank account can deprive me of the cash I would need to pay for life essentials.Just as it would mean that someone who steals my cash is in effect stealing anything I could buy with it.My Google Pay app is in effect a complete surrender of “control” over what is ultimately anything I can buy with cash to Google.So to answer your question.You have always given up some control over every aspect of your life to “computers”And only SOME people have “access”Even when I was young I knew that there were “computers” that controlled how I or my parents accessed “currency” - and there are many other things, much more “dangerous” in this sense than Google Pay, that have been controlled by computers for a very long time.But your initial assumption is so very wrong.As artificial intelligence advances and fewer humans understand itI understand it, and I went to school a very long time ago.We will never have that much “control” over it. As you already imply, it has become very complex and interconnected.We will always have USER ACCESS to it. That is why it exists.If you want to be one of the “cybernetic elite” who not only understand it but also help implement the GROUP CONTROL over it, then you can understand it.And not only that, even if you do not want to be one of the “elite”merely by learning enough about it, by asking questions just like this one, you can understand what we all have to do together to ensure that the “elite” do not abuse their privilege, and that you can understand what we need to do to ensure it is as SAFE as it can be.I am asking you this because far too many people USE the technology but do not UNDERSTAND it.Ultimately it is the “cyberpunk” argument taken to its logical conclusion. No one is expecting you to CONTROL what you have already given up on controlling.We just want you to remember what control you have given up when you access the technology, and to understand where the danger is in giving up control.",366 followers,Brett Alder,1.1K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-different-do-you-think-our-civilisation-would-be-transport-society-technology-humans-if-the-gravitational-pull-of-Earth-was-a-lot-less-than-we-have-evolved-in
