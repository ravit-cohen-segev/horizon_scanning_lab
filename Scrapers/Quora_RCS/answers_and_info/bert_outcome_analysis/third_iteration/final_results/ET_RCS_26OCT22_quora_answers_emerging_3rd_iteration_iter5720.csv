Even if the total quantity of oil and gas extracted begins to decline, the physical business of oil and gas extraction will continue for quite some time simply because oil and gas are valuable commodities and will continue to stay that way for quite a while, even if some uses are priced out.While it is correct to note that oil and gas resources are inherently finite, at current rates of extraction there are enough liquid and gaseous hydrocarbon resources to sustain humanity for centuries.  However, barring a radical change in technology, the ongoing trend in hydrocarbon extraction is that incremental oil and gas extraction is becoming more expensive as time goes by.  On average, oil and gas are getting more expensive to produce given that older, easier to find and tap deposits are being depleted and new finds are generally smaller and more complicated to extract than before.  This trend is more-or-less historically robust, and though there are a few (in the United States in particular) that claim that this narrative is flawed due to shale gas or tight oil extraction technology, it's difficult to see how these technologies have really managed to reverse the trend towards increased cost of production.  Since the economics of operations determine the decisions to produce, we will run out of economically extractable oil and gas long before we run out of hydrocarbons.  If you're looking for a soundbyte, this is the somewhat moderate idea that the era of cheap oil will eventually end (it may already have), though this is often misleadingly cast as a comparison to the 1990s and early 2000s, which were a low-price anomaly for oil and gas, historically speaking.In the long run (~20-30 years), though, most observers predict world output can be sustained near current levels but that prices will increase in line with increased costs of production.  In the even longer run, I've seen few predictions but I have no doubts that the oil and gas industry will remain, even in reduced form.Why?The short answer is that we use oil and gas for a lot more things than simply fuel, and these uses will be much more persistent than fuels.  We make oil and gas into chemicals, which find their way into our daily lives in the form of plastics, food additives, paints, electronics, clothing, glue, building materials, pavement materials, fertilizers, and hundreds upon hundreds of other uses that don't involve burning it (well, at least not burning it in a way that makes it otherwise useless).As the price of oil and gas increase, people who use them for lower value uses begin to cut down on consumption.

6,"Unfortunately, there is no right way here. Ever read a short story called “What are “ethics?” Ethics are the rules and guidelines we follow as professionals. Doctors, lawyUnfortunately, there is no right way here. Ever read a short story called “What are “ethics?” Ethics are the rules and guidelines we follow as professionals. Doctors, lawyers, teachers, and every other profession has them. One thing I want to point out about teaching is that while we value equality, our goal is to teach every student as much as we can. We value our students as individuals. Before the current emergency, we had students who just didn’t come school. Some wouldn’t. Some couldn’t. On the day that Johnny doesn’t come to school, should we all just put our heads down? Of course not.Most students don’t really require any extra resources. Most students don’t have learning disabilities. Most students have some kind of device and internet access. I would wager thatIs it ethical to deny all of those students anything?Doesn’t it make more sense to give them what we can and then focus on those students who need more and give them what we can?No, it isn’t perfect. It also isn’t fair. It is, however, the closest we can get to an ethical course of action. We owe each and every one of our kids everything and anything we can do.","1,612 followers",Thanos Papangelis,1.5K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-emerging-technologies-for-future-roads

Our team at Grammarly has compiled a handy list of common grammatical errors to help make your writing accurate, clear, and professional.Ambiguous (“Squinting”) modifiersA squinting modifier is a misplaced modifier that, because of its location in a sentence, could modify either the phrase that precedes it or the one that follows it. In the example sentence, is the subject listening to music slowly or slowly getting a headache? To correct a squinting modifier, move its position in the sentence to clarify to the reader which word you intend to modify.Misuse of lie/layIf you plan to place or put an object somewhere, such as a plate on a table, you should use “lay.” If you intend to stretch out on a bed for a nap, you should use “lie.” The verb “lie” is an intransitive verb, which means it does not need an object. The transitive verb “lay” requires an object.It may take some getting used to this “lay” or “lie” business; after all, misuse of these verbs is common. But if you remember to lay down your fork before you’re full, then you won’t have to lie down later from overeating.Comma splicesHe was very hungry, so he ate a whole pizza.To splice means to connect or join. When a writer joins two independent sentences with a comma instead of separating them with a period or coordinating conjunction, that’s a comma splice.The comma has its jobs to do, but connecting two independent sentences isn’t one of them. Besides, the period gets testy when his sister, the comma, steals his thunder. Periods have their jobs, and so do commas, but never the twain shall meet—unless it’s in the form of a semicolon. Semicolons can also take the place of a coordinating conjunction, such as “and,” “but,” or “so,” among others.Run-on sentencesRun-on sentences, also known as fused sentences, occur when two complete sentences are squashed together without using a coordinating conjunction or proper punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon. Run-on sentences can be short or long. A long sentence isn’t necessarily a run-on sentence.To avoid run-on sentences, see if there is more than one idea communicated by two or more independent clauses. In our examples, there are two complete sentences:Example:Example:Both sentences are complete ideas by themselves; therefore, use a semicolon or a period to indicate that they are separate independent clauses.Using “could of” instead of “could have”“Could have” is always correct; “could of” never is. Writers probably make this grammar gaffe because, when we speak, the contraction “could’ve” sounds an awful lot like “could of.”TautologiesTautologies express the same thing twice with different words. In our example, the word “made” implies that Jack used his own two hands to create the pail. The prepositional phrase “with his own hands” creates a redundancy. Once you know what they are, it’s fun to discover tautologies: dilapidated ruins, close proximity, added bonus, large crowd...The list goes on and on!After reading through this list of common grammatical mistakes, you might be wondering how to remember all these rules as you write.
