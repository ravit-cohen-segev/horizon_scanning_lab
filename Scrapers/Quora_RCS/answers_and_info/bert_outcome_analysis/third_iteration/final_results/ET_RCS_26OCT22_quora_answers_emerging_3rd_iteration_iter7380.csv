Just to make you understand more, the amount of energy consumed by Bitcoin is more than the energy that is required to power all the UK tea kettles for 19 years. But why does Bitcoin consume all this energy?It all comes back to the fact that it is a virtual currency. Basically, this means that it is controlled using a massive computer network. Bitcoin miners operate these computers to get rewarded with Bitcoin. Since these computers process up to five transactions in a second, they need a lot of energy to operate. But does this affect the environment negatively?The answer to this question depends on the energy policies in different countries and not the software architecture of Bitcoin. For instance, Canada uses hydroelectric power to generate a big percentage of its electricity. In fact, one of its provinces, Quebec, generates 95% of it’s electricity from hydroelectric power and the electricity prices there are low. As a result, the country’s carbon footprint low and hence less negative impact on the environment.Another example is Iceland. Bitcoin miners find this place favorable due to its low temperatures and low power costs. This nation generates a great percentage of its electricity from geothermal sources. Compared to gas or coal-fired plants, geothermal sources emit less carbon and hence do not negatively impact the environment.Why Mining Bitcoin Is Environmentally FriendlyFiat currency needs money printing resources, people to oversee its allocations, fraud services, among other things. All this increases the environmental footprint. On the flip side, the increased use of Bitcoin can reduce this footprint. Anyway, you only need computers, the internet, and electricity when using Bitcoin.Also, the increased use of Bitcoin will reduce paper pollution. Think about it this way, when using Bitcoin, you will need a Bitcoin wallet and not a bank branch. You will use this wallet to get all the key information you would get from a bank branch. As a result, you will not need to go to bank branches to get paper statements whenever you need key information. Therefore, less paper will be wasted and hence less environmental pollution.The fact that Bitcoin makes consumerism expensive makes this cryptocurrency environmentally friendly. What does this mean? When you look at a bitcoin chart, you will notice that Bitcoin is a deflationary currency. Therefore, you will be more willing to spend fiat currency since it is inflationary and save Bitcoin. If you are a Bitcoin miner, you will not buy non-essential things due to this. As a result, less energy will be consumed, and the number of things thrown away because they are not essential will reduce.Bitcoin mining also encourages miners to look for renewable energy since the number of computations they make depends on electricity. This is one of the great benefits or bitcoin for the environment. Nowadays, hydroelectric and solar energy are the cheapest methods of producing this electricity. These sources also produce extra electricity, which can reduce the cost of producing renewable energy. Therefore, an increase in Bitcoin will call for an increase in hydroelectric and solar power generation.Bitcoin is doing pretty fine nowadays. Many people are more than willing to invest in this virtual cryptocurrency. However, there have been claims that it harms the environment. This claim is associated with the amount of energy that is consumed when this cryptocurrency is being mined. Well, it all comes down to the source of energy. For instance, countries that use renewable energy sources will not experience this negative impact.","69,843 followers",Marius Kramer,1.5K,2K,193M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Is-Bitcoins-impact-on-the-environment-sustainable

The blockchain sector is no different. Bitcoin, we all know and love, and it is obviously the most popular, time-tested, highest market -cap digital asset in existence. Its ability to scale; however, has been a central issue of debate. Many novel innovations have come into existence that offer interesting solutions, to name a few,One new solution that piques my interest isThis data storage method allows low-power devices to fully participate in the temtum network and confirm transactions without requiring the resources demanded by traditional proof-of-work blockchain networks such as Bitcoin. The combination of the temtum Consensus Algorithm and Temporal technology allows the temtum network to deliver extremely high transaction throughput and short transaction confirmation times with low resource requirements.They have used laboratory tests followed by a live deployment over globally distributed servers to confirm a throughput of up to 120,000 transactions per second (a multiple of the peak capacity of 56,000 TPS on the VISA network).[2]The technology behind temtum is already fully developed, including mobile and web applications, (which are described below). It is already a fully operational form of payment and has already secured Govt contracts. Temtum is also being developed by one of the strongest teams in the Blockchain industry. Here is some more info;- Developed by Dragon Infosec:- Has a live mainnet :https://explorer.temtum.com/- PhD / peer reviewed tech- Contracts with Anguilla and Zimbwawe for their currency - lots of others coming- Private funded - no ICO / IEO - never asked anyone for cash - its all their own- Totally feelessThe NIST Randomness Beacon is novel to temtum, and is a source of truly random numbers that broadcasts full-entropy bit-strings in blocks of 512 bits every 60 seconds, providing three key functions: unpredictability, autonomy and consistency. The unpredictable nature of the NIST Randomness Beacon makes it impossible for any user to predict the bits it generates before they are published by the source. All users accessing the source of the beacon can be confident that they all receive an identical random string, while the beacon remains highly resistant to malicious interference by external parties. The key features of the NIST Randomness Beacon include:- Generated numbers that cannot be predicted before they are published–even by future quantum computing techniques.- The public,time-bound and authenticated nature ofthe NIST Randomness Beacon allows any user application to prove that it used truly random numbers not known before a specific point in time.- Proof of random number generation can be validated offline at any point subsequent to generation. Based on these properties,the NIST beacon has been chosen as a source of randomness for the Temporal network.",639 followers,Said Nusir,572,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-next-billion-dollar-Blockchain-non-cryptocurrency-Idea

This proof of work algorithm is called mining. Miners spend energy, and more importantly money to buy energy, to solve math problems. Because of the nature of the problem, finding a solution proves they did a certain amount of work.Proof of work is the only solution we know of to the problem of byzantine consensus, which is getting random people to agree on what’s true without anyone being able to cheat or lie. Some people are looking into proof of stake as an alternative, but it’s yet to be proven to be secure and fair.How does mining secure the network? Because in Bitcoin, the truth (or who owns what) is whatever the longest valid block chain says. Since finding a valid block for the block chain is very difficult (i.e. expensive), it’s fairly hard for anyone to do. However, if you had a super computer from the future which could mine sufficiently fast, you could rewrite all of Bitcoin history. Since this is unlikely to happen, the amount of mining needs to be distributed and sufficient enough to prevent any one individual or group from controlling more than 51% of the network’s mining power. If one group gets 51%, they can bend the truth as long as they maintain that level of mining power. They’d also be paying the opportunity cost of simply mining on the network fairly and earning bitcoin.The more people securing the network, the hard it is to attack, the more useful Bitcoin is, the more miners are incentivized to continue mining, and so on. Asking what people think of the power costs of Bitcoin is like asking what people think of the power costs to power homes, build ships, run computers, etc. It’s energy being spent to produce a good; in this case, network security.Also, to address one of the points in this article: right now, most bitcoin transactions don’t happen on chain and have virtually zero cost. I.e. most transactions happen on exchanges. If you want to have your transaction written to the bitcoin blockchain, which isn’t just a credit card payment processor, it’s a distributed, peer to peer, permissionless, open, border-less, global, censorship resistant ledger, you pay a market determined fee. Yes, right now, in the first few years of Bitcoin, it’s more expensive to send value to anyone in the world without anyone able to stop you than it is to ask permission to go through a payment processor. Big deal.In the 80s, people said no one would use the internet to shop online. Before that, people said no one would ever use automobiles because they scared the horses and couldn’t work on mud roads. Bitcoin is just the first layer in a new technology. The internet was nearly unusable until layers like DNS and TCP were added. HTTP was a layer on top of that which wasn’t really useful until other layers like Browser technology, HTML, and JavaScript made it usable. It’ll be the same with Bitcoin. Look at lightning networks, which allow for much cheaper transactions at higher scales. Look at drive chains, look at side chains, look at new altcoins with alternative PoW algorithms and governance structures.
