Humans have the delusion that they can control and overcome their instincts, but it takes no more than a quick glance at our society to determine that they definitely can’t. A post-scarcity society must take this into consideration and work around these instincts, rather than opposing them directly, or it will become quickly corrupted and fail.I think that most viable route would be through technocracy, but transitioning to a technocracy would require people to develop companies with very different administrative and social structures from the ones currently in operation today. Policy changes would be needed to allow these businesses to operate the way they need to. As society becomes used to the way those companies do things, and it seems more desirable and less strange, more will follow, until it’s possible to implement that structure on a larger scale.I do not believe the notion of waiting for society to fail or fall, then rebuilding as a technocracy, is realistic or viable. When humans are placed in desperate situations, they fall back on their instincts. They become very cooperative, but only in small tribal groups, and groups clash with each other. It can’t be done that way.I suspect that advancing technology will FORCE the implementation of post-scarcity society in the long run, but only if that technology is not suppressed by those who fear they will be left with nothing prior to the implementation of proper social safety nets.A universal guaranteed income is absolutely a requirement for all of this, in the long run.Note — a real post-scarcity society won’t be extremist. Some things will always be scarce, and that’s okay. There will be barter systems and some sort of monetary system in place for such things. The point of a post-scarcity society is that life’s necessities, and all that is needed for comfort, are provided because they are essentially valueless. No one would pay for them, because they are too cheap. That means power, clean water, waste disposal, food, housing, clothing, and the basics of furniture, electronics, and tools.","105,663 followers",Dave Consiglio,1.3K,6.8K,91.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-best-build-a-post-scarcity-society-Is-it-possible-solely-through-policy-change-i-e-movements-working-to-improve-the-world-or-is-it-necessary-to-change-the-framework-of-society-by-for-example-more-advanced-technology

This lets you bring in cell phones and their access to information, healthcare advice, money transfers.Raising them up a few percentage points a year in GDP by doing this dramatically improves their quality of life (and reduces the birth rate).

You see, the nuclei of atoms don’t like to fuse because they are all positively charged. To get them to fuse, you have to push them togetherWe just don’t have the gravity.So, we squeeze our atoms together in other ways. Lasers, giant magnets…you know, the usual.But we aren’t very good at it.So, until we figure out how to overcome electrostatic repulsion and make scads of energy from ordinary water, we’ll be stuck with some scarcity.Come on nerds, get on this one, will ya?","105,663 followers",Dave Consiglio,1.1K,6.8K,91.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-best-build-a-post-scarcity-society-Is-it-possible-solely-through-policy-change-i-e-movements-working-to-improve-the-world-or-is-it-necessary-to-change-the-framework-of-society-by-for-example-more-advanced-technology

6,"“Humanity” is an abstract concept.

7,"Yes we will, because we have no other option. But it is going to cost us all a lot - both in lives and in money.Let’s be clear. Climate change is already causing considerable economic and human damage already. This is because climate change is making weather events more extreme. The average temperature or rainfall may have only changed a little but those figures are hiding higher and lower extremes. And it is those extremes that are imposing costs.The first and most obvious damage is caused by changing weather patterns. Abnormal rainfall, droughts and more intense storms are inflicting damageYes we will, because we have no other option. But it is going to cost us all a lot - both in lives and in money.Let’s be clear. Climate change is already causing considerable economic and human damage already. This is because climate change is making weather events more extreme. The average temperature or rainfall may have only changed a little but those figures are hiding higher and lower extremes. And it is those extremes that are imposing costs.The first and most obvious damage is caused by changing weather patterns. Abnormal rainfall, droughts and more intense storms are inflicting damage to people and property that wouldn’t be happening if we as a race had taken note of the science and acted accordingly. And to cope with this more extreme weather we have to invest more money in managing the consequences. For example, buying more snow ploughs, spending more on levees and drainage, investing more in disaster relief agencies.Related to that is the damage caused to agriculture. Farmers rely on predictable weather patterns to plan when they sow their crops and when they harvest. Traditionally they knew that spring would normally be wet and summer warm and dry. That is increasingly not the case. Weather patterns are becoming unsettled and unpredictable, resulting in reduced yields and increased costs.Another area is availability of drinking water. Changing rainfall patterns are beginning to affect the water supply in many parts of the world. When it rains it rains a lot, with in some cases a months worth of rain in a day. The normal water management schemes are unable to store all of that rainfall and the priority is to drain it away as efficiently as possible and so it is wasted. This is then followed by days of no rain, leading quickly to worries about falling reservoir levels. To cope with this, we are going to have to spend money on more and bigger reservoirs and other water management projects.Also worrying is those areas that rely on glaciers for their supply of fresh water. Many of these are receding rapidly. When they disappear the fresh water supply for entire communities will dry up. Either that supply will have to be expensively replaced or the communities will have to be expensively relocated.Coastal communities are also going to have to invest more in sea defences and to accept that some property will have to be sacrificed.There are many other effects of climate change that we will be able to deal with, but at a price. However there is one issue that is only now beginning to get some attention. And this is an area that may have the most serious consequences for us.This is because it seems that animal species in general and insects in particular are not as resilient as humans when it comes to more extreme weather. The research into this is still at an early stage but if it turns out that, for example, bee hives can not cope with multiple abnormally hot summer days then the consequences for crops that require pollination could be catastrophic.You see, for thousands of years we have had a reasonably stable climate. And we have settled in those areas where the climate is favourable and avoided those areas where it isn’t. All that is going to change. Eventually new stable climate patterns will emerge. How long that takes and how much change happens depends on what we all do in the next decade or so. But when the new climate pattern do emerge, we will have to abandon those areas that are no longer easily habitable and rebuild in those areas that now have a more favourable climate.
