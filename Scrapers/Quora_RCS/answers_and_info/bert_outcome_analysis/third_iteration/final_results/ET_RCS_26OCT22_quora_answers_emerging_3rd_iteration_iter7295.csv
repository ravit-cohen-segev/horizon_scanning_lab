0,"The reason why mining might not break even is twofold, first you have to buy the equipment and then you have to power it. These costs may never be met by the currency you mine, when done on a small scale.If your electricity is free then you are now at a significant advantage. You will have to cover the costs of the equipment, but let's say you buy it second hand and have a reasonable expectation that you could sell it on for a similar price then this is not going to be a large cost overall.You still are not going to make much money.

1,"I have!I built a purpose built mining shed with three ring mains each on 32 amp MCBs to distribute the power to multiple rigs. From there the roof has 8 x 250 watt solar panels and the main house has 15 x 250 watt solar panels.On a sunny day I am generating about 50% of my consumption.Pretty happy about that, free crypto from the sun, less hardware costs etc.The next upgrade would be to install moI have!I built a purpose built mining shed with three ring mains each on 32 amp MCBs to distribute the power to multiple rigs.

2,"Simple answer?NO!If you don't know, in depth, how crypto currencies work then do not, let me repeat that:JUST DONT DO IT!Don't make me say I told you so.If you do and find out that I was right, come back here and upvote this answer.If you want to use your CPU or graphics card, then go ahead. But for god’s sake do not spend 1000’s of $$$ on mining equipment.Just buy the crypto currency.Simple answer?NO!If you don't know, in depth, how crypto currencies work then do not, let me repeat that:JUST DONT DO IT!Don't make me say I told you so.If you do and find out that I was right, come back here and upvote this answer.If you want to use your CPU or graphics card, then go ahead.

3,"1,500W for 24 hours is about 36kWh per day.Our 6.5kWP grid-tie solar located in Thailand produces about 21kWh per day on average, so for 36kWh you would need around 12kWP of solar.If you can’t do net metering you will need enough batteries to store most of that energy, say 750Ah of 48V LiFePO4.You would also need a suitable MPPT charge controller (probably several) plus either a grid-tie, hybrid or off-grid inverter dependant upon your situation.To be honest I’m not convinced that crypto-mining using solar is really viable. You’d be better off using that solar to power your home and saving on1,500W for 24 hours is about 36kWh per day.Our 6.5kWP grid-tie solar located in Thailand produces about 21kWh per day on average, so for 36kWh you would need around 12kWP of solar.If you can’t do net metering you will need enough batteries to store most of that energy, say 750Ah of 48V LiFePO4.You would also need a suitable MPPT charge controller (probably several) plus either a grid-tie, hybrid or off-grid inverter dependant upon your situation.To be honest I’m not convinced that crypto-mining using solar is really viable.

4,"Probably nothing major, and this is something that’s quite unique to blockchain technology.If I go next to the server farm of some major application and set off an EMP, I will completely destroy their application (unless they’ve been keeping up with their DR practices).However, blockchain applications aren’t run on one server farm or even one location. They are decentralized, literally global, with anyone, anywhere in the world being able to download the software and create a node.Even if I created an EMP that was able to take out an area the size of the United States, the chance of you takingProbably nothing major, and this is something that’s quite unique to blockchain technology.If I go next to the server farm of some major application and set off an EMP, I will completely destroy their application (unless they’ve been keeping up with their DR practices).However, blockchain applications aren’t run on one server farm or even one location. They are decentralized, literally global, with anyone, anywhere in the world being able to download the software and create a node.Even if I created an EMP that was able to take out an area the size of the United States, the chance of you taking out all Ethereum nodes and miners is basically zero. Yes, the network would be hampered for a period of time, but it won’t get destroyed.This is why decentralization is such a powerful concept.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,1.4K,996,156.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/If-I-have-free-electricity-from-solar-power-whats-the-easiest-way-to-mine-cryptocurrency-and-have-it-at-least-break-even

6,"Yes I do, purely by accident, I was into solar and renewables well before I was into crypto-mining.So I have a 4kw array on my house, this can run a couple of mining rigs when the sun is up! My next addition will be a tesla powerwall which could in theory run a rig overnight too, but I need to over-produce enough power to charge up the battery too.I generally find Nvidia rigs are more energy efficient than AMD ones.Good luck with mining, you’ll learn a lot about cryptocurrency and internet 3.0 through playing with these things.",0 followers,Mark Adler,2.5K,755,2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-I-have-free-electricity-from-solar-power-whats-the-easiest-way-to-mine-cryptocurrency-and-have-it-at-least-break-even
7,"That depends on the severity of the solar storm and/or coronal mass ejection (CME). If it would be equal to the Carrington Event (bad one in 1859) it could wipe out or severely damage a lot of our electrical, digital infrastructure. But, the earth’s magnetic field protects us from a lot of the minor stuff that the sun throws at us. Also, if the earth is not in the direct path of an event, that protects us as well. Fortunately for us, our star is relatively calm.","105,675 followers",Dave Consiglio,600,6.8K,91.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-I-have-free-electricity-from-solar-power-whats-the-easiest-way-to-mine-cryptocurrency-and-have-it-at-least-break-even
