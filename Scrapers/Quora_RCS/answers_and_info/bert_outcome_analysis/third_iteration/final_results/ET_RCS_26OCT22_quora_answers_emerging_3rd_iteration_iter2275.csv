Displacement: 15,917 tons, length: 156 meters.Yo-mobil EV concept first unveiled at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor ShowYo-mobil electric vehicleYo-mobil got everybody excited. Finally, we had a domestic Tesla, and in 2011 Putin drove a Yo-mobil for the rolling cameras. Everything looked very bright and promising, but nothing came to fruition. No factory was built. No mass production was launched.The grand total of three Yo-mobils were manufactured. Appropriately, the king court’s jester politician Zhirinovsky bought one and managed to drive 300 miles, at which point the car refused to charge. A Mercedes Benz E-class picked him up.142 millions euro invested in the project had magically disappeared.Looks too good to be true? True.Marussia Sports CarFounded in 2007 by Nikolai Fomenko and partners, Marussia Motors set an ambitious goal of producing the first Russian racing car.They beat Yo-mobil and managed to produce forty four prototypes of varying degrees of (in)completion.Hundreds of millions of dollars went down the pipe, and in 2014 the project was shut down at a loss. The same year, Nikolai Fomenko sailed on his super-yacht into Dubai marina for the yacht-show.His super yacht was neither designed nor manufactured in Russia.Mr. Chubais, the head of Rosnano, a state venture fund, is giving Mr. Putin heads-up on how he’s blowing, sorry, spending budget moneyPlastic Logic 100 eBook ReaderThis e-book reader is based on the developments of the German company PlasticLogic. In 2011, it was on the verge of bankruptcy due to its failed product: the electronic book reader Que.But then Rusnano swooped in and the business of the PlasticLogic went uphill. Until it didn’t.Mr. Chubais paid off $50 million worth of PlasticLogic debts, and another $100 million was offered as a loan guarantee to build a plant in Zelenograd near Moscow. He sold the idea to the government that his eBook readers would be used instead of textbooks in all the schools of Russia. $700 million more were poured into the project.To cut the long story short, in 2012, the construction of the plant and the production of devices were abandoned altogether, citing economic inexpediency.Do you think Mr. Chubais got fired? It’s a rhetorical question.Prime minister Dmitry Medvedev said about YotaPhone, new Russian smartphone: “When Steve Jobs heard about YotaPhone, he was worried.”At the end of 2013, CEO of Rostec, owner of Yota Devices Ltd, ex-KGB general and Mr. Putin’s old friend, Sergei Chemezov presented the highly innovative Russian smartphone YotaPhone with two displays to Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.Observe, they always present their prototypes to the supreme leaders and not to the public.In Russia, government is your investor, your marketer, your consumer, your law, your freedom, your bank, and your career. Public doesn't count for much. They only need to be fed buckwheat and macaroni and entertained with TV fluff and parades.For some unbeknownst reason, all the smartphone components were produced in wealthy Singapore, the E-ink display was from aforementioned PlasticLogic, which explains why sale price was so high.In 2013, YotaPhone was sold for 499 euros. Grand total of 40,000 devices were sold by mid-2014.Riding on the back of their success, in 2014, Yotaphone 2 was released, and 22,760 units were sold.In 2017, Yotaphone 3 was released at the price of $450 with even fewer units sold.Hundreds of consumers await the release of the KGB general’s YotaPhone 4.Meet Boris, a man in Alyosha robot suit passing off as a robotIn December 2018, the story of a Russian cutting-edge life size robot that was the answer to Boston Dynamics’ robot, went on all the federal TV channels.During the nationall forum “Projectors” held in Yaroslavl, the life size robot Boris was showing some cool dance moves to the clapping audience.Turned out it was a human pretending to be a robot by wearing Alyosha robot suit.

No one else has any real developments approaching this. The US is not yet trying to implement such technologies at this level.2.A nuclear power plant that can produce 50,000 tons of fresh water per day and simultaneously supply electricity to a city of 100,000 people. She's mobile. That is, you can bring it to any suitable port - where it is needed.3.This is a new icebreakers. They're bigger than anything before them. Nuclear reactors of a new type are also installed there. No one in the world has one. Only in Russia.4.This is the latest reactor, which makes it possible to organize a waste-free cycle of nuclear fuel. Just imagine - nuclear power plants will no longer require storage for nuclear waste. Only Russia has brought the development of reactors of this type to the industrial design. Tried the USA, France, Japan - at them it didn't turn out.5.It is known that high-power gas turbines are technologies of the highest complexity, and here you see the Russian development of GTD-110m. Siemens is so concerned about the emergence of this technology in Russia that they offer to transfer their technologies for the production of high-power turbines to Russia, building a plant - to preserve the market for their products.6.This is a scientific project of the decade in the field of astrophysics. Immediately after7.Well, how many countries in the world have developed their own line of microprocessors?8.This next-generation platform attack, designed for network-centric wars, contains AI elements.9.And this is also the next generation combat platform.10.Creating an aircraft and an aircraft engine that can compete with such as Boeing and Airbus - is a huge challenge, which can cope with less than a dozen countries in the world.There is also,11.This company occupies 17% of the world market of agricultural machinery. Is high technology enough? Well, they are now preparing to massively robotize harvesters.12.Cars of an exclusive class are also quite high technologies.13.14.Someone here tried to declare that in Russia there are no large IT companies. I laughed. In fact, it exports of IT sector from Russia in 2018 exceeded $ 10 billion. For comparison , the export of weapons from Russia in 2018 amounted to about $ 15 billion, and the export of products of the agro sector amounted to $ 25 billion.15.It is the longest bridge in Europe, and it is built in an unstable tectonic zone, which makes it extremely difficult in terms of technical implementation of the project.However, the bridge was built and is currently in operation, despite numerous statements in the Western press that this project is not feasible.So, I gave only some examples.

That alone should makes the US light-years ahead in military development, right?Well, not quite. Just like any bodily institution on Earth, the US Armed Forces has its own budgeting problem.Usually, it’s a foreign policy problem though.See, the budget for the US military doesn’t just go to tech-development inside the country. It has to go to maintain their global military presence as well. Such case isn’t the case with Russia where they only have small overseas presence in countries such as Central African Republic and Syria.What’s more to add is head-to-head military confrontation between major power is a thing of the past and it will probably be nothing to be concerned of.Let me ask you something. When was the last time you saw Russian Mig-29 having a dogfight with American F-15 in real life? Pretty sure even if you do, it was a mock dogfight in an airshow.Why is that the case? Because a war between Russia and USA is a war that will never come. Thus making an arms race pointless.Like i said, it’s kind of useless to compare Russian and US military because it’s they’re the same on the surface only.The US who seek to be the dominant power on the global stage will always be ahead with its aircraft carrier fleet to which is in line with its gargantuan budget.On the other hand, Russia who has smaller money to spend always prefer to go with nuclear submarine which is while not as impressive, will still makes any foreign forces think twice before having a conflict with Russia.That’s all i can say for now.

Since the beginning of time, the Russian does not like to venture far from home. This actually applies to all Slav nations.The USA like a true Anglo Saxon loves going far and wide, spreading their power far abroad creating “allies” in the same way the British, Dutch,French and Germans did at the ending of the 19th and start of the 20th centuries.For this the U.S. really does not need a very powerful defence system. After all, who is going to invade them? So research goes more into offensive weaponry.Now research, development and purchase of new systems. The US had reached the pinnacle of development for its role of spreading its world dominance. After all, no one the U.S. forces met on the field have anything near that of the Americans. Again there are no plans for fighting Russians. It's a big no no that can quickly reach nuclear.For this reason, majority of the US’s world largest military expenditure is for maintaining the massive military spread out across the world.Russia on the other hand still works to develop weapons to ensure that the west does not think of once again invading. After all, every time they let their guard down, they were invaded from the west.Russia uses a larger percentage of their military expenditure on research and development than the U.S.So here it is. This is not in any way superiorto this.A carrier is only needed by those armies that stray away from home. So the US had invested in them a lot. Russia has no need for them whatsoever,and would probably build any more only as a luxury. They can reach any country in the northern hemisphere from the thousands of airfields at home.So what do the Russians need? They need weaponry that would annihilate a carrier group if it is used against them. They invest and develop coastal defence and antiship missiles that overtime had become superior to anything the U.S. has. And are still working on better ones.TheThey had become masters in hypersonic antiship missiles.TheThis practice of countering faster advancing U.S. surface ships had allowed Russia to balance the playing field at a fraction of the cost. Even during the Soviet era.VA-111 ShkvalThe Russians had always favoured Submarines to a surface navy. They had produced over time some of the most deadly ballistic and attack submarines.The recent reincarnation are among the deadliest in the world.The most important feature of a good attack sub is to be undetectable as to sneak up on its prey. You can not get quieter than the new Kilo class subs, which has been nicknamed “black hole” by the westIt was reported that it successfully shadowed both British and American carriers on test runs. On an NATO attack on Syria, It prevented the British submarine sent into the area for the attack from firing its missiles. By shadowing it.Similarly when it comes to air supremacy, both produce incredible aircraft. We will not go into comparing them here. However, once again the U.S. has the numbers, while Russian has the ability of shooting them down cheaply if ever used against them.Russian air defence works in an interlinked network involving,Long to short range SAM systems like theMedium to short range like theAnd terminal phase interception likeThis allows Russia to provide airspace deniability with the ability to pick and choose what to shoot down with what. While protecting each other.In case of Nuclear deterrence, Russia keeps working to make sure any missile sheild used to try and disable its ability to retaliate and therefore upset MAD is ineffective. As a result, while the Western deterrence has been stagnant for years, Russian ICBMs are at least two generations ahead. TheThey had also developed other alternative delivery systems like theandRussia is certainly not backward on the ground forces department either. Again mastering missile technology. In addition to almost all its missile systems be it coastal and naval, having the capability to be used against ground targets, Russians have theVery effectively used in Georgia and Syria. This is just a snapshot. Having massive budget and massive numbers, does not mean you can match into any where. This is because some other are specializing in neutralizing you at the cheap.Russian combat vehicles and tanks can stand their own in any battle field. TheIs an interesting concept of various fighting vehicles with interchangeable parts.They also take a well tested concept and update it to be comparable to their more modern weapons. Like the T72 of which Russia has thousands still in bubble wraps, and making the T72M3s out of them.As for the smaller and infantry based weapons, well it depends on individual preferenceEdit:I will clarify those points and will not address them in the comments any more.You do not have to do a combat test to know a weapon works. It will work just as well on a test ground. None the less, Russia used its new weapon systems in Syria. From cruise missiles to the tank drones.Even their Electronic warfare weapons. Another field in the military industry that they outdone others. Like theTheWhat was cancelled was theSide note: Stealth in its present form was invented in the USSR in the 60s byTheRussia has thousands of brand new T72 in storage. They had decided to upgrade them to T72M3 which is much cheaper than building a new Tank. The T72M3 has the same features with the T90.In Russia, a term is used “near abroad” and signifies countries very near the Russian borders. That is where the Russian interest lies.

Yes, the military training of the US Marine Corps is aimed at the Soviet Union, not Iraq. Therefore, the actual combat experience brought by Iraq to the US Marine Corps is actually not much, or of little significance.Responding to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, troops of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division deploy across the Saudi desert on November 4, 1990, during preparations prior to the Gulf War.European countries launched airstrikes against Libya. Libya doesn't even have decent air defense weapons. Do you think such actual combat is useful?2011 military intervention in LibyaThe U.S. military fought a long-term public security war in Afghanistan and Iraq. Now the security in Afghanistan and Iraq is still a mess, so is the experience of the US military in the security war important? I think the greatest significance is not to add experience to soldiers, but to tell the US military never to use elite troops in public security warfare!If you do not trust me, let me give you an example to support my opinion,Before 1937, after World War I, Japan did not fight any big wars for more than 20 years. In China, civil wars continue. But what happened after the war broke out in 1937? China has many experienced soldiers but facing Japan, which leads China in an all-round way, these experiences are less important. No amount of experience can stop steel and artillery.Today's military confrontation is not simply a struggle for experience, but an all-round systematic confrontation. Experience is very important, and actual combat is very important, but not the most important. Different levels of military experience are different.But no one can deny actual combat.","29,923 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,3.9K,7.7K,249.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-advanced-technology-in-Russia

Soviet and by extension Russian doctrine calls for planes that work as an infantry unit might, with initiative and orders coming by radio from behind the lines. That calls for significantly less pilot training, less flight hours, but a rugged design that is extremely light on maintenence.Americans on the other hand see aircraft as an elite vanguard that needs highly skilled professionals to do extremely challenging tasks independently of ground control or chain of command. American pilots are given far more leeway in how to accomplish their mission and are expected to take initiative themselves when an opportunity arises. They operate more akin to special forces than regular infantry units. This calls for far more pilot training and planes that require constant care so parts don’t wear out.Engine changes are a great example. The engines of the Su-27 need an overhaul after 500 hours of flight and need to be replaced after 2000 hours. The engines of an F-16 need an overhaul after 2000 hours of flight and last for 8000–10000 hours of flight, albeit with far more maintenence that isn’t a full overhaul in between.The difference therefore isn’t so much in the capabilities of the planes, but pilots. Pilots flying western planes will typically have several times the flight hours of a pilot flying a Russian plane and predictably outperform their counterparts. The difference in the actual capabilities of the plane isn’t that decisive, it’s what you can put behind the controls that creates the lopsided k/d ratios we see every time these birds face each other.Russians are moving in this direction as well, the engines of Su-35 can take 1500 hours of flight between overhauls and last for up to 6000 hours. If those numbers aren’t an exaggaration (Russian claims usually are), then their pilots might begin to approach parity with their Westen collegues within a generation or so.","4,172 followers",Vladimir Andreeff,2.3K,1.3K,14.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-advanced-technology-in-Russia

The fact that they had mechanical computers and steam-powered toys doesn't mean that they had either the other technological precursors or the demand infrastructure to make what you and I think of as steam engines and computers.Everything we think of as ""an invention"" is actually a large series of smaller inventions. For instance, a practical steam engine requires the invention of a reciprocating device, which required the invention of the condenser, which required the invention of a piston and cylinder arrangement of fairly small tolerances, as well as valves and a boiler that could handle significant pressure, all of which required a combination of metallurgical and metalworking technologies that would not come into being until centuries after the fall of Rome. Modern computers need materials and manufacturing technologies that didn't even exist until the mid-20th Century. A team of well-trained engineers in 1899 with the materials list and blueprint for a PC could not come close to building one. Don't even get me started on the precursor technology to modern aircraft and spacecraft.I'm sure some kid a few centuries hence will look at the technological scraps we have today, and wonder what took us so long to build the matter transporter, or the warp drive, or the cure for aging.","29,923 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,2.4K,7.7K,249.7M,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-advanced-technology-in-Russia

English used the steam engine not because it was better than horses, but because it was more economical to use a steam engine that it was to feed a horse. That’s how James Watt sold his invention in the first place. He installed the engine was free and you just paid for theThe early steam engine wasn’t better than a horse. It was good enough to do the work of a horse and cheaper, it took a few decades to create engines that were also universally better than horses. If you need to find and extract hierhito unknown resources to run the thing it will not be cheaper.Even if you handed over to Romans an example of a working steam engine plus a set of detailed plans how to recreate it, plus trained craftsmen in how to make more, they wouldn’t have much use from it.

Defining different energy sources (e.g. the wind, water, heat, fire etc) and find how to use them so that we produce pure energy is another series of such smaller inventions.Combining various energy sources to produce another kind of energy (e.g. electricity) is another series of inventions. Developing mechanics that transform a kind of energy into another also consists a series of inventions. Chemical products are inventions “per se”. And the list is endless….I will now proceed to define high performing devices”. I consider as such all devices that accelerate the potential of human strength and mind. In reality, our physical strength allows us only to communicate with people close to us, perform very simple math, and just being “defensive” to the environment; watch any Survival style TV show around the world to find out more.But how can advanced technology change that? I will use the example of a tablet as a case study. Through its apps and internal technology characteristics, a tablet enables us to access, record, assess and share big data, perform complex mathematical actions in a giffy, communicate with multiple people who live millions of miles away from us simultaneously and in multiple ways and probably arrange to bomb an entire region during wartime or track the way of a device sent in space.Now consider the long row of scientists and topics involved, plus the knowledge lost and found, to reach the creation of a single tablet or smartphone… it is awe-inspiring, going back for three millenia!Now, where do the Greecs and Romans are found here? In theory, everywhere, alongside their predecessors, the Mesopotamians, Indians and Egyptians and their near-contemporary, the Chinese.In practice, we can say that during their Hellenistic period they had reach to the production of advanced technology.

In my article, I talk about the Greek historian Thoukydides (lived c. 460 – c.  400 BC), who rejected the idea of an ancient Golden Age. Instead, he believed that humanity was growing steadily more advanced and that the Greeks of very early times must have been exceedingly primitive compared to Greeks of his own era.There were certainly Romans who thought similar things, although I cannot think of any specific examples off the top of my head. Nonetheless, I’m sure that even the ancient Romans who did realize that humans were growing more technologically advanced probably wouldn’t have imagined the kinds of technologies we have today.Back then, technological progress was moving much more slowly than it is today and I’m sure that even most progressive-minded Romans probably would have assumed that it happened at a constant rate. As it turns out, though, technological progress is exponential; every new invention makes the next invention come a little bit faster. Consequently, we have technologies today that few people in ancient times would have even dreamed of.ABOVE: Image of a man dressed in a less-than-historically-accurate Roman soldier costume riding on a Segway poorly disguised as a chariot","3,600 followers",Giota Detsi,636,2.1K,10.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-advanced-technology-in-Russia
