Let me explain.Most people think of evolution as operating on members of a species with “inferior” traits, thereby reducing their survivability and ultimate contribution to the gene pool. With this understanding, you’d then point to our modern longevity and note that “humans have largely solved the problem of survivability” — which we have.

With this understanding, you’d then point to our modern longevity and note that “humans have largely solved the problem of survivability” — which we have.

And what is it looking for? You might say, “survival of the fittest” or “natural selection”. And that’s where a lot of the confusion comes from. With ever longer lifespans and no natural predators, evolution seems to be way back in the rear view mirror for Homo sapiens.

Knowing the Army, they probably welded the covers onto the one they showed the public.Today? I just checked: if you want an R-390A, there are three of them on eBay. One is a Collins that’s listed for $600; the other two are $1200. If you’re searching in the shortwave bands and the HF ham bands, and you don’t mind that the radio produces a ton of heat because it’s full of tubes, AND you’ve got a spare $1200, the R-390 is about as good a radio as you’re likely to find.THIS, fine folks, is the kind of equipment the government hides.

Steel? Not only do you need steel mills, you need iron ore, which means iron mines, a way to transport the ore, etc etc etc. High-speed computer chips? You’re going to need somebody to grow the big crystals of silicon that get cut into dies, the fabrication facility, companies to make the electron lithography machines (or whatever), and so on.The Apollo program ended up with 400,000 people on the payroll, once you count all the contractors and subcontractors. Running a similar secret program would require either thousands of government employees with security clearances to keep their mouth shut while doing the work, or subcontracting out bits and pieces that will eventually lead somebody to figure out what’s going on.For example, during the 1990s, you could make a pretty good estimate of how much computer power the NSA had by looking at the Top500 computer list, adding up all the SGI Origin systems on it, then looking at SGI’s corporate financials for the income - and make a good guess that the income over and above what showed up on the Top500 list was systems that went to Ft Meade. More recently, you can put an upper limit on their capacity at their new data center in Utah by looking at the square footage and the power/cooling supply.The end result is that the government can’t really develop anything that’s much more than 10–25 years ahead of known technology without it leaking out.","12,898 followers",Bernie Klinder,1.3K,933,11.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Does-the-coevolution-of-advanced-technology-with-human-conflict-reduce-the-possibility-of-war-due-to-enhanced-communication-abilities

We take three leaps forward and are smacked back two of them. This pattern has repeated itself many many times for many many reasons - cultural, political, environmental, you name it…So - speculation …There’s a theory going around out there that had we not lost the Library at Alexandria and had Christianity not run roughshod through the West - we probably would have landed a man on the Moon sometime during the 14th or 15th century. Imagine - we would now be in the 600th year or so after man first took to space. Let’s imagine if Mezzo-America were not ravaged by Spain, or Baghdad never fell to the Great Khan - basically imagine we humans were not so prone to clashing violently when cultures first encounter each other, but rather more prone to collaborations, we might have already merged Gravity and Quantum Mechanics a couple of hundred years ago … we may have thought in our current lifetime of cancer as antiquated a problem as bubonic plague. Then again, we might have already produced sapient machines or hyper weapons and gone extinct, or disappeared into virtual reality by now …Basically - the long and short of it is this we are exactly as “advanced” as we “should be” … Because no matter what, there will always be fits and starts - if it wasn’t one thing it would inevitably be another. Learning and progress is a journey of peaks, valleys, detours, switchbacks, circles, and leaps. And while it would be amazing to know Berrosus’ ancient history in three volumes, or the actual original words of Jesus, or the surgical techniques of the pyramid builders, or seen the steam engines and wind turbines invented by Hero of Alexandria… actually accessing those things doesn’t preclude that history would have produced some other unavoidable correction that would have knocked us down a peg or two … or ten.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Does-the-coevolution-of-advanced-technology-with-human-conflict-reduce-the-possibility-of-war-due-to-enhanced-communication-abilities
