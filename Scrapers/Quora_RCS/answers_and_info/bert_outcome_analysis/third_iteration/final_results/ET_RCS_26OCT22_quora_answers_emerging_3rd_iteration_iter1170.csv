4,"I feel compelled to answer this question, because I disagree with most of the answers here.The common answer here seems to be: yes it will kill jobs, but only the jobs low on the food chain, and it will create more jobs to at least offset the jobs it does kill.I disagree. I think AI will kill jobs, and over time, AI might kill most “jobs” as we know them. I think that people are somewhat complacent in regard to the economic impact of AI, and will likely be ill-prepared for the changes we have to adapt to in the not-so-distant future.First, let's start with the comparisons to machinery and autoI feel compelled to answer this question, because I disagree with most of the answers here.The common answer here seems to be: yes it will kill jobs, but only the jobs low on the food chain, and it will create more jobs to at least offset the jobs it does kill.I disagree. I think AI will kill jobs, and over time, AI might kill most “jobs” as we know them. I think that people are somewhat complacent in regard to the economic impact of AI, and will likely be ill-prepared for the changes we have to adapt to in the not-so-distant future.First, let's start with the comparisons to machinery and automation. They did indeed put factory workers out of work. In that respect, I agree AI today is similar in many applications, replacing workers who have less specialized skills, perhaps call center operators, office assistants (in a limited extent), and maybe soon, taxi drivers and truck drivers. But I would argue that AI is fundamentally different from machinery or most of the other analogies commonly made when answering this question, because AI is growing and is unlikely to stop growing. It's growing in breadth (of applications and industries), in geographic and economic scope, and in power (it's capacity to address increasingly complex tasks). A more fitting analogy would be machinery in an automobile plant that not only made the parts one day, but then learned how to assemble them the week after, and then how to design cars a year later.I think that there is little that is out of reach for advanced AI of the future. Let's leave the question of the AI singularity alone for now. Instead, I think that deep learning efforts at Google and elsewhere are making AI systems learn faster and faster, with a growing rate of acceleration. Advanced AI can now address increasingly complex tasks including medical diagnosis, stock market trading, weather prediction and human behavioral modeling. Very soon, it will be able to take the place of certain types of teachers, and find a role in education. It can already deal with complex systems in software and mathematics, and seems to be only limited in applications that require interactions with the physical world (sensors are still imperfect), and with people.So without projecting too far into the future, we can ask the question, what jobs will NOT be killed by AI? Jobs that involve labor are already (or soon to be) replaced. Jobs that require logical reasoning are being replaced, albeit at a slower rate. What are the qualities that humans have that cannot be captured by AI? Perhaps creativity, emotional responses? So perhaps researchers in academia will survive longer than most, and artists (though AI stylistic mimicry is already quite impressive and their results enjoyable), and counselors/psychologists/case workers, and decision makers like CEOs who cannot be predictable or error prone. And hopefully software engineers and algorithm designers who develop AI systems.This leaves a very, very small portion of today's jobs intact. Many say: we just need to train people to fill higher level jobs created by AI, e.g. Programmers, ML researchers. But this is no easy feat. The US educational system is struggling to meet the demands created by advanced technology today. This failure is in part responsible for the economic divide plaguing the country today. The challenge of educating the public for a job market that is both decreasing in scope and increasing in complexity, is nothing we've ever faced before.I am far from original in this opinion. But if I had to guess, I would say that AI will put far more people out of work than we can (re)train in time. That will have significant economic repercussions as corporations seeking to minimize cost will do so at the cost of rising unemployment. There will need to be dramatic changes in social policies in order to avert large scale economic disaster, first dramatic rises in minimum wage, then eventually some type of universal income/welfare. It's the kind of change that requires significant leadership in our government, something that seems woefully absent today.","68,792 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.5M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-AI-technology-that-will-lead-the-way-in-this-field

Today, the path the Chinese leaders have chosen has unknowingly produced a centripetal force for the world, and it has begun to attract more and more international outstanding scientific talents to come to China to work with the Chinese peers. The future of mankind is exploring the secrets of science. China is willing to invest money to support scientists in scientific research while European and American countries worry about too much information and cumbersome procedures. A large number of scientific talents have begun to flow into China.The United States today has long lost the spirit of hard work that it used to have. The United States, which is now accustomed to the status of the world’s leader, is just like the big belly and deep narcissism eagle in the movie ""Angry Birds"".The American politicians are indulged in all kinds of possibilities. In the trivial matters of showing one's own moral or political superiority, he no longer pursues progress at the overall level of the country. With regard to the rising China, the USA has only used the despicable and shameless practice of a scumbag to bully and suppress.Chinese companies have a great advantage in manufacturing extra large parts in extra large scale. Hydropower and UHV can be cited as the world's best two examples. These are actually not the original creation of Chinese companies, but in those two fields, the Chinese have achieved surpassing and leading.On January 12, 2019, the world's first Baihetan one million kilowatt boutique runner was officially completed at the Baihetan runner processing plant of Dongfang Electric Co., Ltd. of Dongfang Electric Group. The runner is the heart of the hydro-generator unit and is the core component with the most difficult research and development and most manufacturing problems in the unit. Compared with the turbine runners that have been put into operation in the world, the million-kilowatt turbine runner has achieved a historic leap in operating efficiency. China has made the only one such thing in the world.A single Baihetan million hydropower unit is more than 50 meters high and weighs more than 8,000 tons. A unit is equivalent to the weight of an Eiffel Tower. The overall design, hydraulic development, electromagnetic design, high-efficiency cooling technology, thrust bearing technology, high-voltage insulation technology, runner dynamic stress, research and application of high-strength materials, key component manufacturing technology are all world-class difficulty.Just to cite an example-in terms of the hydraulic research and development of the core technology of the unit. For the first time, Dongfang Electric applied the numerical simulation technology of the whole flow channel and the whole working condition to the engineering practice, innovatively developed the hydraulic evaluation standard and the blade thickening technology, and achieve the best match between the strength of the entire flow-through component and the hydraulic performance, the efficiency reaches more than 96%. In the well-known Three Gorges Project, the efficiency of the left bank runner is 94.5%, and the efficiency of the right bank runner is 94.63%.China can build hydropower stations with the largest unit capacity in the world.For human beings to develop, the following three problems: the speed of energy transmission, the speed of material exchange, and the speed of information dissemination must be solved. Why does China have a better future? China is the best in the world in solving those three problems. Compared with developed countries, China’s power grids are not only the largest in scale, but also highly reliable. Both Europe and the United States are regional power grids. Power generation in the region is used in that region only. There is no ultra-large-scale power dispatch like China. Even in Europe and North America, there will also often be large-scale blackouts in their grids.Power outages in Europe and the United States are all technical failures, while power outages in China are due to natural disasters. In addition, China’s population density is much greater than that of Europe and the United States. However, the number of people affected by power grid outages is much lower than that in Europe and the United States. This reflects extremely high technology and management level liabilty. Especially after the heavy snowstorm in 2008, China has further transformed the power grid, which greatly strengthened the monitoring capabilities of the entire network system, which can effectively predict the occurrence of accidents, and can realize that it does not affect other areas after the accident.China’s leadership in power grid technology not only provides a guarantee for the rapid improvement of China’s industry and residents’ living standards, but also created two world-class super companies: State Grid and China Southern Power Grid, which were ranked among the Forbes Global 500 in 2016. In the ranking, China's State Grid Corporation of China ranks second in the world, with revenues of up to 330 billion U.S. dollars and profits of up to 10.2 billion U.S. dollars. It is one of the world's profitable companies. State Grid is not only the second largest company in the world, but also the highest-income company in China. China Southern Power Grid ranks 95th in the world, with revenue of 74.7 billion US dollars and profit of 2.22 billion US dollars.The State Grid has contributed 28 global grid standards, among which the basic technology of the two international standard systems of smart grid and UHV transmission technology comes from the State Grid Corporation. This exceeds Huawei's right to speak in the formulation of communication technology standards.China can design, manufacture and commercialize ±1100 kV converter transformers and converter valves in the world. Among them, the converter transformer comes from TBEA.The distribution of energy resources and power loads in China is extremely uneven. More than 80% of energy resources are distributed in the west and north, while more than 70% of power consumption is concentrated in the east and central. UHV can fundamentally solve the problem of large-capacity and long-distance power transmission. When China Southern Power Grid proposed to study the ±800 kV DC transmission technology, there was a lot of doubt at home and abroad. Even Germany, the United States, South Korea and other power grid technology powers at that time could hardly be concerned about the world-class problem of 800 kV.In June 2006, the Yunnan-Guangdong ±800 kV UHV DC transmission demonstration project was established. It took only four years to get done. In 2010, the world's first UHV project, Yun-Guang UHV DC project was completed and put into production, creating 32 world class number one items.Since then, several large leading multinational companies have gradually faded out of China's high-voltage and UHV DC market, especially system research, development and design completely were withdrawn from the Chinese market. China is the only country in the world that has the technology and experience to build ultra-large-scale power grids under all complex conditions because there is no such high voltage power grid in foreign countries. The UHV transmission system made by State Grid leads the world from system to core components. It not only leads global standards, but is also the only company in the world to achieve large-scale exports. State Grid exports UHV technology and has no competitors in the market. The new ultra-high voltage DC (UHVDC) line built by Beijing-based State Grid Corporation of China can transmit up to 12 gigawatts.At present, China's UHV not only solves the problem of independence, but also is at the forefront of the world. It has been widely used by emerging countries such as India, Brazil, South Africa and other emerging countries to drive transnational power transmission and power trade, and promote the Chinese power equipment manufacturing industry for an annual growth of 500 billions RMB leading the global competition.The world's first 200,000 kilowatt high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear power plant demonstration project will be loaded in April, and the power generation will be officially put into commercial operation by the end of this year, 2021. The high-temperature gas-cooled reactor has the characteristics of good safety and high outlet temperature and has been recognized by the international nuclear energy community as one of the most promising advanced reactor types. The demonstration project adopts the traditional steam cycle, and the power generation efficiency can reach more than 40%, the highest power generation efficiency at present. The 600,000-kilowatt high-temperature gas-cooled reactor improved version project has completed the program design, and the supercritical version of the high-temperature gas-cooled reactor technology research and development is expected to be completed in 2023.The pressure vessel of a nuclear power plant is one of the core components of a nuclear power plant, and the seal is a key component to prevent leakage. The pressure vessel of China's nuclear power plant has been produced nationwide, and the C-shaped seal is designed and manufactured by Zhejiang Tiansheng Sealing Company, one of China's largest static seal production companies.China's coal-to-liquid technology absolutely leads the world. One small part in this huge system is the one-way valve. There was originally only one German company making it. The small valve cost as much as 1.8 million yuan, and the longest life span is only 3 hours.China Hunan Sidi Technology Company developed the one-way valve. The price was only 200,000 yuan, and the life span was more than one year.In the 1990s, aircraft carbon-ceramic brake technology has just emerged in the world, and developed countries have invested heavily in research and development with little success. The development of this product originated from the joint efforts of the preparation technology of ceramic matrix composite materials awarded by Northwestern Polytechnical University National Science and Technology Invention First Prize in 2004 and Xi’an Brake, the core enterprise of the aircraft carbon brakes in China. After 12 years of research and tens of thousands of bench tests, a total of three key technologies have been broken through, 5 major technological inventions have been formed, and 19 nationally authorized invention patents have been obtained. The carbon-ceramic brake disc product jointly developed by Northwestern Polytechnical University and AVIC Xi’an Aviation Brake Technology Co., Ltd. has been equipped in 7 aircraft models in batches recently, making China the first country in the world to use carbon-ceramic brake discs. China's aircraft brake technology now ranks among the world's leading levels.Compared with the previous generation of brake discs, the carbon-ceramic brake disc has a static friction coefficient increased by 1-2 times, wet friction performance attenuation reduced by more than 60%, wear rate reduced by more than 50%, and service life increased by 1-2 times. The production cycle is reduced by 2/3, the production cost is reduced by 1/3, the energy consumption is reduced by 2/3, and the cost performance is increased by 2-3 times. The price is only equivalent to 50%-60% of similar foreign products. It is currently the only material found in the world that can not attenuate various physical properties under a high temperature environment of 1500℃. After the promotion and application, it can save about 300 million yuan in cost for the civil aviation passenger aircraft each year in China. The brake discs have been used in the civil aviation passenger planes such as Xinzhou 60, ARJ21 and C919 in China. ARJ21 has successfully flew 5,000 hours and withstood the initial test of the brake discs made in China.The gongs of symphony orchestras all over the world are hand-made by traditional Chinese craftsmanship. If you look closely, the gongs are crooked and untidy. Such an uneven and bumpy gong sounds the best. Those machine made round and flat ones are not up to the task.The crystal required for high-power ultraviolet lasers has been ahead of the world for about 20 years made in China. It took China 15 years and millions of dollars to develop the world’s first KBe2BO3F2（KBBF） crystal, which was manufactured by a research group led by Academician Chen Chuangtian of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (discovered in 1990). At first, the Chinese researchers were open to provide KBBF crystals worldwide. However, in 2009, China realized the strategic significance of this crystal and immediately stopped exporting.In February, 2016, the United States announced that it had broken through China’s 15-year blockade and produced KBBF crystals. The crystals are used in light emission electron microscopes, ultra-high-power lasers, and are also the core components of lithography machines, the core equipment for the production of CPU chips. The main reason for China's blockade of this technology is its military use. High-power crystals are the core technology of laser directed energy weapons. China is leading foreign countries by a large margin in this field, and its power output exceeds those foreign made by more than one order of magnitude. Because of China’s strict blockade of such technologies and prohibition of export, international research on condensed matter physics has been affected.China becomes the only country in the world that can manufacture practical deep-ultraviolet all-solid-state lasers. However, KBBF contains highly toxic beryllium and its crystal layered growth habit is serious.China has not waited for the United States to catch up in this area. In August, 2015, the Fujian Institute of Physics of China discovered a new type of beryllium-free deep ultraviolet nonlinear optical crystal material LSBO. The newly discovered LSBO crystal is expected to become an excellent candidate material for the next generation of deep ultraviolet nonlinear optical crystals.Rubik's Cube was first invented by a professor in Hungary and later moved to China for production. However, several domestic companies later improved the Rubik’s Cube, such as fully enclosed, track, jamming, anti-flying edge, …, etc., all invented by the Chinese, and re-applied for patents, making the Rubik’s Cube rotate more smoothly and also it is precisely because of these revolutionary innovations that speed-screw players around the world can continuously refresh their fastest results. So far, China's Rubik's Cube industry has successfully counterattacked, and the high, middle and low ends are all controlled by Chinese companies, and there are no related industries abroad.The interactive electronic whiteboard was originally invented by a Canadian company in 1991 and used for classroom teaching. By 2005, there were no related production industries in China nor application. Two foreign companies, SmartBoard and Prometheus were the mainstream. The price was also a sky-high price, requiring tens of thousands of RMB to buy one. At the time, the two technologies used were pressure-sensitive and electromagnetic.Around 2005, Shenzhen Honghe Technology started the development of interactive electronic whiteboards. Unlike the two major international manufacturers, they took the route of infrared technology. Two years later, they launched their products. When it first came out, it could be described in one word, poor, and various failures continue, which is many times more difficult to use than the foreign ones.However, after another one or two years, the product began to stabilize, and more and more manufacturers joined, including iBoard (domestic manufacturers), Xiamen Yintian, Shenzhen Haiya, ...., etc. The prices have been getting cheaper to just more than one thousand yuan. The related industry chain has been becoming more and more complete. The domestic interactive electronic whiteboard technology competition has also kicked off, mainly for the technology of multipoint writing. In just one or two years, it has been overcome by many companies.Due to backward technology, SmartBoard and Prometheus have been in decline, and in the end they all asked the Chinese domestic companies for OEM production. The current interactive electronic whiteboard, technology and production are 100% controlled by the Chinese domestic manufacturers. This industry has also led to the development of two other related industries.The substrate of the infrared electronic whiteboard cannot be deformed and must have a certain degree of hardness. The Chinese domestic manufacturers initially used various materials and processes, such as wood, cardboard, steel, PVC, ..., etc. In the end, the aluminum honeycomb panels are used. The production of this substrate is currently only produced by the Chinese domestic manufacturers. Foreign companies neither need nor produce this kind of product.Companies that can produce infrared tubes are all over the world, but the infrared tubes used on interactive electronic whiteboards can only be produced in China. Unlike other infrared tubes, the infrared tubes on the infrared whiteboard have special requirements for parameters such as emission angles. Foreign infrared tube manufacturers have never had such a demand, and there is no such customer, even the world’s largest LED manufacturer, Taiwan's Everlight Electronics, also does not have an infrared pair of tubes used on electronic whiteboards.This is also due to the rise of the the Chinese domestic electronic whiteboard industry, domestic infrared tube manufacturers have also continued to compete with the development of this industry. In the end, the ones with the best technology and cost control survive. It is understood that these infrared tube manufacturers were small enterprises with only a few employees a few years ago. However, as China's electronic whiteboard industry dominates the world, these small enterprises have also begun to grow. It is precisely because of the development of related industrial chains that there is no foreign electronic whiteboard industry today and in the future.This industry not only provides a large number of low-end assembly positions in China, but also provides tens of thousands of software and electronic engineer positions, creating huge foreign exchange income for China. The most important thing is that the industry does not produce waste gas or water at all, and thus will not cause any negative impact on the environment.If the United States were to block this industry in China, it would not affect China’s interactive whiteboard industry at all. While this industry earns huge foreign exchange for China, it also makes outstanding contributions to the education development of the world, including American classrooms. All the interactive whiteboards made in China are used worldwide!Xuan paper, also known as Jingxian paper, was originally produced in Jing County, Xuancheng, Anhui Province.

Yes, this is what I said, a Chinese, who is regarded by many as an evil Communist Party.I say this not only to Americans but also to China. Don't always think naively that China can challenge and confront the US. That is to beat stone with eggs.I. How powerful is the US?From the political, economic, scientific and technological, military, cultural, diplomatic, and other aspects. China can't compete with the United States in any aspect.A. The US political powerThe US election is the most concerned political event in the world. Any American president who takes office will influence the direction of the world.For example, Trump, an “incredible“man who could not be found for hundreds of years, became the president of the United States. If he is in other fields, it may not have any influence. But he is now the president of the United States. His words can greatly affect people all over the world. For example, he said that COVID-19 pneumonia can disappear on its own, that children can avoid COVID-19 pneumonia, and that the United States controls it well. Even many important figures in the Republican Party did not support Trump's re-election. Because the disaster he brought to the world may be worse than COVID-19 pneumonia.But it is not that he is terrible, but that the global leadership of the United States is terrible!If he is the leader of a very underdeveloped country, I don't think most newspapers will even report it.B. The strength of the US economyThe strength of the US economy can be seen all over the world. The United States has not only influence but control over the global economy! The dollar, which is smaller than the mobile phone, is the most powerful weapon of the United States, not the US aircraft carrier or the US Marine Corps.C. The US science and technologyThe US stands at the forefront of science and technology in the world. Most of the high technology in the world is in the hands of Americans or American laboratories. For example, today's China is developing its aerospace industry, which is an achievement that attracts worldwide attention. However, we all know that compared with the United States, we are inferior to the United States and the former Soviet Union at the beginning of the Cold War.But I think Leonard's genius is that a nerd can have a girlfriend like Penny.D. The US militaryThe US military ranks first in the world, and I believe no one will refute me. The U.S. government has made deep research and practice on maintaining the combat effectiveness of the military, leading military science and technology, military theory, and military treatment.The largest conventional aircraft carrier in the world is the Kitty Hawk of the US Navy. This aircraft carrier has participated in many foreign operations of the US military. Regardless of her glorious history, technically speaking, which country can produce it now? This is an aircraft carrier produced by the United States in 1960.The United States Marine Corps, the firm executor of the national will of the United States, can basically defeat other countries with only one US Marine Corps. The US Marine Corps is not just a bunch of crayon-eating psychopaths. They have the most systematic, scientific, and arduous training, the most efficient and advanced military theory, and the most advanced weapons and equipment.I don't think any country in the world would be stupid enough to challenge the United States militarily.5 steps to reshape the US military: Glean, Engage, Focus, Incentivize, and Share.The Kitty Hawk of the US NavyE. The US cultureAmerican culture is an important manifestation of American soft power. Almost everyone on earth knows Hollywood, and even some people may not know where the capital of the United States is, but they must have heard of Titanic and Rambo, an American hero who can beat hundreds of people by himself. Most written works in the world are written and recorded in English. American music is basically the trend. The American brand is basically the guarantee of quality. It can be said that where there are people, there will be American cultural influence, except for newborns in hospitals.TitanicRamboII. What are the advantages of China?China's greatest advantage is the people. This may be something that Americans can't surpass for years.From the military point of view, the PLA under the leadership of the Communist Party of China has no advantage in weapons and equipment. But the People's Liberation Army has accomplished every military operation task brilliantly. Because Chairman Mao said: ""The decisive factor in war is people, not weapons and equipment."" Is it true that China respects the US military because the US military has the most powerful weapons and equipment? No, it is because the extraordinary courage displayed by the US military on the battlefield deserves China's respect.Let me show you a couple of the examples that the power of people:A. What has the Communist Party of China done in the history of being regarded as a communist devil by the West?The first National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held secretly in this boat, Shanghai on July 23, 1921. The meeting was attended by only 12 people, announcing the founding of the Communist Party of China. Today, China has 90 million Party members.Under the military attack of the Kuomintang, the army led by the Communist Party was forced to move. The journey is more than 20,000 miles, also known as the 25,000-mile Long March. During the journey, it has traveled 25,000 miles through 11 provinces, 18 mountains, 24 rivers, deserted grassland, and rolling snow-capped mountains.After the Long March, there were only 30,000 Communist troops.In 1932, he was commissioned by the CPC Central Committee to organize the Anti-Japanese Coalition Forces in Northeast China and served as the commander and political commissar of the Anti-Japanese Coalition Forces. He led the soldiers and civilians to fight bloody battles with the Japanese aggressors in the northeast. In the extremely cold environment, under the emergency of running out of ammunition, he finally fought alone with a large number of Japanese aggressors for a few days and nights and died heroically. When the Japanese army caught him, they cut open his stomach and found that there were only bark and cotton in his stomach. He kept fighting by eating these. At that time, the Japanese army stood up and saluted, because Yang Jingyu was a very respectable fighting hero of Communist Party members.The Liberation War was a war waged by the Chinese People's Liberation Army under the leadership of the Communist Party of China from June 1946 to September 1949 to overthrow the Kuomintang rule and liberate the whole of China. It is a decisive battle concerning China's future and destiny. On October 1, 1949, the People's Republic of China was proclaimed in Beijing on the way of PLA marching to the whole country. In 1951, the PLA completed the task of liberating the mainland and offshore islands and the Communist Party of China unified the Chinese mainland.The Communist Party of China has done a lot of things. She made China independent, and at the same time, she led the Chinese people to work hard to build the motherland. These examples are to say that a political party that is extremely poor can lead the people to today. It doesn't matter whether she is evil or not. We trust this party, even she is evil.Many overseas Chinese are constantly discrediting the Communist Party. It doesn't matter. More than one billion Chinese people now support the Communist Party of China. Is this party good or bad? If the Communist Party is really an extremely evil party, how can it monitor and control 1.4 billion Chinese people?Is it because China is really sinful that it keeps smearing China? Or something else?B. What are the strange characteristics of the Chinese people?Chinese people's character comes from Chinese culture. It is not deep to get in touch with the Chinese without understanding the Chinese character.1. Attach great importance to educationChina's college entrance examination is the exam with the largest number of participants in the world. The history of examinations in China has exceeded 1400 years. The examination is an important way for Chinese emperors to select officials from civilians. Today's Chinese college entrance examination is an exam that determines the fate of students. No matter you are rich or poor, you must pass the college entrance examination before you can enter the university. In China, every family and every Chinese regard education as a way to change their own destiny. Therefore, every Chinese family will spend a lot of money on their children's education.Every year in the college entrance examination in June, all cars in China will not whistle, so it is necessary to create a quiet environment for the candidatesParents waiting anxiously outside the examination roomExamination in ancient China. In the highest examinations in ancient China, the invigilator was the emperor. At the same time, any candidate who tries to cheat will be decapitated immediately once he is found.2. Chinese people especially like farmingChina's geographical environment determines that the people here will make a living by farming. Until today, as long as Chinese people see a good piece of land, they will not plant flowers, but grow vegetables.The picture above shows Chinese people growing vegetables in the Antarctic scientific research stations, deserts, university campuses, and space.3. Chinese people love saving money and grainWhen Americans were suffering from pneumonia in COVID-19, many people took to the streets. In fact, it is not necessarily opposed to wearing masks, but Americans do not have the habit of saving money. If the United States does not resume its economic activities, the American people will be unable to live because they have no jobs. But at the request of the Communist Party of China, 1.4 billion people stayed at home. Chinese people can stay at home for two months without going to the str...",167 followers,Tim Brown,806,1.4K,1.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-AI-technology-that-will-lead-the-way-in-this-field

With money to be made in China over 4500 American companies set up in China and another 250,000+ from other nations did the same.Those corporations made a fortune and they continue to do so and China rose up the wealth ladder faster than any other nation.China also has another massive advantage and that is that they are ruled by a body that isn’t voted in but that rather are selected based on merit. This allows them to make very rapid decisions that will be implemented very quickly. In the Western democracies there can be numerous agencies, individuals, government oversight committees, etc., etc. that have a right to comment and delay implementation and as you can imagine nations that have to go through these torturous procedures will and do fall behind when you have a nation like China ready, competent, and driven to grow that is leaving the rest of us in their wake.Please watch these and weep for what we seem incapable of doing that China never stops doing.A short stretch of the Karakoram Highway.One of the three guys from Top Gear.
