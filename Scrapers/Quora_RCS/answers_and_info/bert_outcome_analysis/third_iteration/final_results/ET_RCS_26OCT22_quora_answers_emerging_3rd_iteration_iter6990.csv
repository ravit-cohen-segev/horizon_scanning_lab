2,"No. China’s technology will not surpass America’s. Instead, America’s technology will lag behind China’s.It is not the same thing. When one says that China’s technology will surpass that of America’s, it means that the Chinese are working hard to surpass American in the field of technology while America will be making normal/standard technological progress. When it is said that America’s technology will lag behind that of China’s, it means that the Chinese are making standard/normal progress and America is falling behind the standard.In other words, China is not becoming a technological giant.No. China’s technology will not surpass America’s.

When it is said that America’s technology will lag behind that of China’s, it means that the Chinese are making standard/normal progress and America is falling behind the standard.In other words, China is not becoming a technological giant. Instead, America is gradually reducing into a dwarf.This is a matter of preference and priorities. Technological advancement is normal preference for China but it is not the normal preference for America. Let me explain this with examples.This (above) is an aircraft carrier battle group. It is the standard military method of mobilizing a vast number of personnel and weapons across the globe. One such battle group typically consists of:The cost of building the carrier is between 11 and 14 billion USD. The cost of other ships is not public but we can safely assume that the rest of the ships (escorts) cost around 6 billion in total. This makes the cost of building one aircraft carrier around 20 billion dollars.The price of maintaining and operating a carrier group is around 6.5 million dollars per day, or 2.3 billion dollars annually.America currently has 12 aircraft carriers in its naval fleet, burdening the economy 27.6 billion dollars annually. American navy plans on building one super-carrier (an aircraft carrier running on nuclear energy) every 6 years or so.This hints at the American government’s/military’s mindset: project power across the globe and look for trouble. China so far has no aircraft carrier, but it building one for domestic defense purposes.In the last 2 decades alone, America has directly invaded Afghanistan and Iraq, and has meddled in the internal affairs of Syria, Yemen and Venezuela, to name a few. The time which American statesmen should have spent discussing initiatives for science and technology, were lost in debating whether America should “pull out” from Syria and Afghanistan or not.America was destined to lag behind China in technological development ever since the first American construction firm uprooted its production units from American soil and planted them on Chinese. This was a sign American politicians should not have taken lightly. It meant that China was more conductive for business production than America. Ever since then, capital has been escaping American coffers towards China.When your first priority is projecting your military power across the world and to interfere with other countries’ internal affairs, you do gradually start lagging behind other nations not infected with this mentality.",991 followers,Imran Roy,2.2K,841,3.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Who-is-more-technologically-advanced-The-USA-or-China

You may get a first-mover advantage, but you also have to pay the first-mover cost too. You have to eat the cost of failures. It’s debatable which side of the equation is the bargain. Also, the scientific community has long enjoyed open global collaboration. Because it works. Figuring out Nature is hard enough. Figuring out Politics is impossible, because it’s neither logical nor rational.How about if we just let all people with money chip in, if they so wish, and make HUMANS the winner?",0 followers,Steven Henninger,924,512,153.3K,2018,https://www.quora.com/Who-is-more-technologically-advanced-The-USA-or-China

But I work in China’s “silicon valley” and live nearby in the capital city so I’m a bit biased. I know that compared to, say, New York, Beijing eclipses it easily.

I went on a business trip to Hefei a couple weekends ago (lower tier 2 city) and my Chinese colleague asked me at the train station (look at how far Beijing is from Hefei on a map, consider our train tickets cost MORE than flying would have, and then talk to me about technology) and politely asked if I brought any cash. I said yes, I have a few hundred yuan, why? And she said “oh, good, I assumed you would have some, being a foreigner, I didn’t bring any cash or cards”.This is coming from a woman with a rolling suitcase as well as a very expensive purse for a 4 day trip to a “lower 2nd tier city” and she literally just assumed her cellphone would suffice to pay for everything. I asked what she would have done if I didn’t bring some cash/chinese bank cards. Her response “nothing, because we’ll never use them”. She was right, neither of us ever used cash or cards in 4 days. I’ve gotten to used to this it actually surprises ME when I have to get out my wallet. Picture going to….(I’m trying to think of an American city that wouldn’t be insulted by being not just 2nd tier but not even upper or middle 2nd tier but lower 2nd tier and failing) so….if you’re St. Paul and someone showed up with nothing but their phone and was INDIGNANT by the idea you wanted cash or even plastic how would you feel?Probably annoyed and insulted. The Chinese feel the opposite. If my colleague purchased a a bottle of coke for 25 cents from a local merchant on the street and he said “sorry but I don’t take alipay/wechat pay from your phone” HE would be the one to look foolish to everyone. My colleague wouldn’t be seen as snobbish or entitled. The merchant would be viewed as backwards for not taking e-pay for even a small purchase, in a lower 2nd tier city, at a tiny street stand. Like it or not that sounds like the march of technology to me.So why, after all that, would I still dare say America? Well because even “lower tier 2 cities” like Hefei have 8–11 million people depending on how you want to measure it. That would make Hefei ab absolute lock for being “tier 1” if we has such a system in America on it’s population alone. China’s population dwarfs the US, and a lot of that population doesn’t live in walking distance of its countries “silicon valley” or spend its time only in cities important enough to be officially ranked on a tier system. Get off that grid and China is still far behind the US.

Compare to some old infrastructure systems that have been operated for maybe more than a century in the US, like New York City subway (built in 1900s), Chinese cities’ brand new infrastructures could be better in some aspects.

Alpha Go beating the world Go champion was another. China is very serious about competing and US remaining advantages may not last long.

How powerful is the US?From the political, economic, scientific and technological, military, cultural, diplomatic, and other aspects. China can't compete with the United States in any aspect.A. The US political powerThe US election is the most concerned political event in the world. Any American president who takes office will influence the direction of the world.For example, Trump, an “incredible“man who could not be found for hundreds of years, became the president of the United States. If he is in other fields, it may not have any influence. But he is now the president of the United States.But it is not that he is terrible, but that the global leadership of the United States is terrible!If he is the leader of a very underdeveloped country, I don't think most newspapers will even report it.B. The strength of the US economyThe strength of the US economy can be seen all over the world. The United States has not only influence but control over the global economy!C. The US science and technologyThe US stands at the forefront of science and technology in the world. Most of the high technology in the world is in the hands of Americans or American laboratories. For example, today's China is developing its aerospace industry, which is an achievement that attracts worldwide attention. However, we all know that compared with the United States, we are inferior to the United States and the former Soviet Union at the beginning of the Cold War.But I think Leonard's genius is that a nerd can have a girlfriend like Penny.D. The US militaryThe US military ranks first in the world, and I believe no one will refute me.The largest conventional aircraft carrier in the world is the Kitty Hawk of the US Navy. This aircraft carrier has participated in many foreign operations of the US military.The United States Marine Corps, the firm executor of the national will of the United States, can basically defeat other countries with only one US Marine Corps.I don't think any country in the world would be stupid enough to challenge the United States militarily.5 steps to reshape the US military: Glean, Engage, Focus, Incentivize, and Share.The Kitty Hawk of the US NavyE. The US cultureAmerican culture is an important manifestation of American soft power. Almost everyone on earth knows Hollywood, and even some people may not know where the capital of the United States is, but they must have heard of Titanic and Rambo, an American hero who can beat hundreds of people by himself. Most written works in the world are written and recorded in English. American music is basically the trend. The American brand is basically the guarantee of quality. It can be said that where there are people, there will be American cultural influence, except for newborns in hospitals.TitanicRamboII. What are the advantages of China?China's greatest advantage is the people.From the military point of view, the PLA under the leadership of the Communist Party of China has no advantage in weapons and equipment. But the People's Liberation Army has accomplished every military operation task brilliantly. Because Chairman Mao said: ""The decisive factor in war is people, not weapons and equipment."" Is it true that China respects the US military because the US military has the most powerful weapons and equipment? No, it is because the extraordinary courage displayed by the US military on the battlefield deserves China's respect.Let me show you a couple of the examples that the power of people:A. What has the Communist Party of China done in the history of being regarded as a communist devil by the West?The first National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held secretly in this boat, Shanghai on July 23, 1921. The meeting was attended by only 12 people, announcing the founding of the Communist Party of China. Today, China has 90 million Party members.Under the military attack of the Kuomintang, the army led by the Communist Party was forced to move. The journey is more than 20,000 miles, also known as the 25,000-mile Long March. During the journey, it has traveled 25,000 miles through 11 provinces, 18 mountains, 24 rivers, deserted grassland, and rolling snow-capped mountains.After the Long March, there were only 30,000 Communist troops.In 1932, he was commissioned by the CPC Central Committee to organize the Anti-Japanese Coalition Forces in Northeast China and served as the commander and political commissar of the Anti-Japanese Coalition Forces. He led the soldiers and civilians to fight bloody battles with the Japanese aggressors in the northeast. In the extremely cold environment, under the emergency of running out of ammunition, he finally fought alone with a large number of Japanese aggressors for a few days and nights and died heroically. When the Japanese army caught him, they cut open his stomach and found that there were only bark and cotton in his stomach. He kept fighting by eating these. At that time, the Japanese army stood up and saluted, because Yang Jingyu was a very respectable fighting hero of Communist Party members.The Liberation War was a war waged by the Chinese People's Liberation Army under the leadership of the Communist Party of China from June 1946 to September 1949 to overthrow the Kuomintang rule and liberate the whole of China. It is a decisive battle concerning China's future and destiny. On October 1, 1949, the People's Republic of China was proclaimed in Beijing on the way of PLA marching to the whole country. In 1951, the PLA completed the task of liberating the mainland and offshore islands and the Communist Party of China unified the Chinese mainland.The Communist Party of China has done a lot of things. She made China independent, and at the same time, she led the Chinese people to work hard to build the motherland.Many overseas Chinese are constantly discrediting the Communist Party. It doesn't matter. More than one billion Chinese people now support the Communist Party of China. Is this party good or bad? If the Communist Party is really an extremely evil party, how can it monitor and control 1.4 billion Chinese people?Is it because China is really sinful that it keeps smearing China? Or something else?B. What are the strange characteristics of the Chinese people?Chinese people's character comes from Chinese culture. It is not deep to get in touch with the Chinese without understanding the Chinese character.China's college entrance examination is the exam with the largest number of participants in the world. The history of examinations in China has exceeded 1400 years.Every year in the college entrance examination in June, all cars in China will not whistle, so it is necessary to create a quiet environment for the candidatesParents waiting anxiously outside the examination roomExamination in ancient China. In the highest examinations in ancient China, the invigilator was the emperor. At the same time, any candidate who tries to cheat will be decapitated immediately once he is found.2. Chinese people especially like farmingChina's geographical environment determines that the people here will make a living by farming. Until today, as long as Chinese people see a good piece of land, they will not plant flowers, but grow vegetables.The picture above shows Chinese people growing vegetables in the Antarctic scientific research stations, deserts, university campuses, and space.3. Chinese people love saving money and grainWhen Americans were suffering from pneumonia in COVID-19, many people took to the streets. In fact, it is not necessarily opposed to wearing masks, but Americans do not have the habit of saving money. If the United States does not resume its economic activities, the American people will be unable to live because they have no jobs. But at the request of the Communist Party of China, 1.4 billion people stayed at home. Chinese people can stay at home for two months without going to the streets. It is because Chinese people have the habit of saving money. A country that has been poor for hundreds of years will not spend all its money once it has earned it.4. An incomparable yearning for peaceA unified and centralized country, a country with peasants as its main people, needs a peaceful environment most. Because it is impossible to fight there, I still farm here. Chinese people have always hoped to have a peaceful environment for them to cultivate their land, save some money, and then let their children receive a good education.5. Chinese people's deep love for their families and countriesChina attaches great importance to education. Therefore, Chinese culture can be preserved from generation to generation after thousands of years. In education, loyalty and justice are emphasized. This is why Chinese people have a very strong concept of territory and nationality. Every generation of Chinese will tell their children that you are a Chinese, that you are a Chinese who eat with chopsticks, and that you are a Chinese who write Chinese characters.A very famous story in China, Yue Fei, a famous general in Chinese history, had his mother tattooed his back before joining the army. There are four Chinese characters on it,Every Chinese has been fed with chopsticks in this way, which is calledEvery Chinese child will be taught to use chopsticks by his parents.When eating in China, only the elders say they can eat, and the rest can eat. This is called a6. Once oppressed too much, peaceful farmers will become fearless fightersIn Chinese history, all those who rebelled were peasants. As long as farmers have food to eat, they will not rebel. Once they are starving, Chinese farmers will rise to revolt. Therefore, Chinese people are not afraid of power in their genes. Indeed, many emperors in Chinese history were rebellious peasants. The earliest peasant uprising in Chinese history was the uprising of Chen Sheng and Wu Guang in 209 BC. At that time, the west was still the Roman Republic.What I want to say is that these characteristics of Chinese people come from China's poverty and backwardness, and also from its own understanding. Chinese people may be bullied, but it is impossible to kill all Chinese people.The US is powerful, and the American people are a symbol of freedom and independence. China cannot compete with the United States in any form.III. In the endThe US is the most developed country in the world. The US is ahead of China in every respect. China has been actively learning from the United States. Americans are Chinese teachers.But China does have its advantage, that is, its people.The national anthem of China today was created at the most dangerous time in Chinese history. Her lyrics are like this:起来！不愿做奴隶的人们！把我们的血肉，筑成我们新的长城！中华民族到了最危险的时候，每个人被迫着发出最后的吼声。起来！起来！！起来！！！我们万众一心，冒着敌人的炮火，前进！冒着敌人的炮火，前进！前进！前进进！Get up!People who do not want to be slaves!Build our flesh and blood into our new Great Wall!When the Chinese nation is at its most dangerous time,Everyone was forced to make the final roar.Get up!Get up! !Get up! ! !We are United as one, braved the enemy's fire,Forward! Braving enemy fire,Forward!Forward!Go ahead, and forward!Well, this is what I share with you as a communist devil.

It’s predictable. And they don’t have to worry that years later deals or terms would change because it’s always the same government under the same framework.The US policies with other countries can change in four to eight years and they can be in totally different directions. What Barack Obama promised to other countries can go into total bust when Trump took the office. Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement thrown in the water. Paris Accord out of the way. Nuclear treaties with Iran tossed out. Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty abandoned. Sanctions are everywhere now not just to China, but to allies and foes all around.With China, you don’t have to worry about these changes. With the US, you worry about who is going to win the next election and what would hold in the future for the relations with the US even for US allies.The fact that Belt and Road Initiative is joined by over a hundred countries by now is the living proof that China is widely trusted. They know when China does something, she is committed.For China’s foreign policy, there is another important element. China practices non-aligned foreign policy. That means China doesn’t form allies. The best you get with China is strategic partner. Forming allies means the enemy of your allies also becomes your enemy.China doesn’t form allies because it doesn’t seek enemies. That’s China’s stance on the international stage. She believes any international disputes should prioritize peaceful solutions. For fifty years China has not been involved in any wars because of this non- alliance policy. Even strategic partners of China know that should wars breakout to their country, China is not bound nor obligated to send military assistance.

With money to be made in China over 4500 American companies set up in China and another 250,000+ from other nations did the same.Those corporations made a fortune and they continue to do so and China rose up the wealth ladder faster than any other nation.China also has another massive advantage and that is that they are ruled by a body that isn’t voted in but that rather are selected based on merit. This allows them to make very rapid decisions that will be implemented very quickly. In the Western democracies there can be numerous agencies, individuals, government oversight committees, etc., etc. that have a right to comment and delay implementation and as you can imagine nations that have to go through these torturous procedures will and do fall behind when you have a nation like China ready, competent, and driven to grow that is leaving the rest of us in their wake.Please watch these and weep for what we seem incapable of doing that China never stops doing.A short stretch of the Karakoram Highway.One of the three guys from Top Gear.

It has a 90% market share in the world.In the world of social media, the American champions are Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. China has WeChat and Weibo.For instant messaging applications, China pits WeChat against Facebook Messenger or WhatsAppIn the field of online videos, YouTube is the ultra-dominant champion all over the world. China has Tencent Video or Youku.In the world of short online videos, you have TikTok which is a bit American and a lot ChineseIn the field of navigation applications, Americans have Google Maps. China has Autonavi.Facing Amazon, China puts forward its champion AlibabaIn the world of payments, China is pushing Alipay and WeChat pay, while the United States has solutions such as PayPal, Apple Pay, or Venmo.I'll stop there, but you've understood that China's protectionist strategy has proven to be extremely effectiveBoth countries are now equally advanced in terms of technology.China is now beginning to take the lead over the United States by innovating in areas such as 5G with HuaweiThe battle for the rank of world's leading power will also involve dominating the Tech sector.

A real annoying nanny about how you structure your code, etc. Plus the insane mantra of not having any methods over 5 lines long…????Rust is also annoying for different reasons, as I spend a good chunk of my time making the borrow checker happy. Never had this problem in C++, where I managed such relationships in my head. And the annoying mantra there is “safe code”. I know how to write safe code, having done C and C++ for decades. It’s the greenhorns that need the training wheels on the bicycle of software development. They simply get in my way.Speaking of C++, I am all stoked about modules and concepts. But modules are not properly designed, and are not, as of this writing, fully implemented in clang and gcc. So I find that to be a source of frustration as I am tired of waiting. Because, finally, C++ can grow a repo ecosystem similar to Crates in Rust, Gem in Ruby, Mix in Elixir, etc… someday… but I am not getting any younger.

The purpose of an economy is to provide people the goods and services (and time) they need and want. To which we would ask: and how does that happen? This is economic productivity - the producing of that which would be needed and wanted. Again, how? Things get produced by applying energy to the transformation of raw materials into those finished goods and services we need and want. It also should be pointed out that technology can enable that energy to be utilized more effectively and efficiently such that more can be produced for the same or less energy.Well, therein lies the crux of it all. We are constrained in how much we can have by how much energy we can apply (or, the rate at which we can apply energy). You can cut only so much wood with a hand saw that is limited by how much energy you can put into the saw. But a power saw enables you to apply more energy which enables you to cut more wood and thus build more things.Another way to look at it is that it produces more time. Would you want to cut you lawn with a knife? Probably not. That would take forever. But a power mover - you can knock it out pretty quickly, giving you more time for other stuff, such as enjoying that lawn.It enables us to produce and to have more stuff for less of our time and labor required to produce and to have it.
