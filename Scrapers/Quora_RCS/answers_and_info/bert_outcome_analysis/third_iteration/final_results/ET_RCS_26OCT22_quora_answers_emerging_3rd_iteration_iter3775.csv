And I am her clone left behind to explain.""Sarah smirked visibly, getting the obvious reference. ""Wrong surname, my sweet friend.""Clara sighed deeply as she ran a hand through her hair, long, and a soft brown in color.""Is my surname not being Oswald the only thing you find strange in the notion of me wandering""Hey, Clara, are you there?""The addressed woman sighed with resignation as she closed the book in her hands, half-turning on the comfortable armchair she was seated on to look at the newcomer.""No, Sarah, Clara is currently at God knows where or when with some dimension-travelling maniac.

""Wrong surname, my sweet friend.""Clara sighed deeply as she ran a hand through her hair, long, and a soft brown in color.""Is my surname not being Oswald the only thing you find strange in the notion of me wandering through time and space with a dimension-travelling alien?""""Yep."" Sarah chuckled as she threw herself on the nearest couch, not even bothering to remove her coat. ""God, it's chilly out there.""Clara looked at her flatmate. Her usually pale white cheeks were reddened thanks to exertion on top of morning cold, contrasting nicely with a crown of raven-black hair as thick as a rainforest, maintained just long enough to reach the base of her neck.""Why the bloody hell would you go out for a walk in this weather? I mean, it is not exactly winter, but it sure is cold.""""Because, dear Clara, morning walks keep one healthy, fit, and nice-looking. Look at yourself! Getting a little tight around the waist.""""I am not!"" Clara exclaimed with annoyance as she checked her stomach. It didn't look any different than usual. Sure, she was never half as fit as Sarah, who was lean, solid, and toned like a coil of steel wire, but she was comfortably slim. Lacking in muscle, but still.""Keep telling yourself that."" Sarah chuckled, as she grabbed the remote and opened the television, zapping through the channels with a disinterested face. Clara picked her book again. She wouldn't have much reading time during the weekdays, and she would prefer not to postpone giving it back to Marcus for another week.""What the hell is going on?"" Sarah threw out a curse, and Clara absent-mindedly realized that the sounds from the television were gone, replaced by a nerve-rattling hiss. Sarah pressed a few buttons on the remote, but the screen stubbornly continued presenting merely static.""Oh come on, what happened?"" Sarah struggled with the remote, earning no reaction from the television as she did so.A few seconds later, the screen began to clear, but instead of whatever was the program last open, a new frame came into view. It was a man with the camera fairly close, only making visible anything up from halfway through his torso. He was dressed in a formal-looking uniform perfectly immaculate and decorated with gold and silver, a plethora of medals on the chest all polished and shining bright. His face was stern and hard, a fringe of short-cropped hair and a trimmed beard ending with a short point slightly below his chin, both as grey as the fur of an elder wolf. His face bore a few wrinkles, a face belonging to a predator, a face that couldn't possibly be beyond his fifties, but a pair of eyes told a different story, eyes the color of storm clouds, eyes with the wisdom and tiring experience of a hundred years.And then, he began to speak, his voice authoritative and commanding, a voice that filled Clara's mind with only one thing, an instinctive command to obey this man.""The inhabitants of this world, I greet you with pleasure, at the discovery of yet another wayward planet of the Emperor's children. I am Lord-General Iskander Savras, and I inform you, this world and all upon it now belongs to the Imperium of Man.I urge you to lay down your arms and embrace the Emperor's name. Resistance will not avail you. Those who cast off their false beliefs and embrace the light of the Imperial Creed, will be raised as equals in His mighty empire. Those who persist in their depredations and faithless ways, those who insist in a hopeless fight of defiance, will be granted nothing but total, absolute, and merciless extermination. You do not have long to decide. The armies of His Divine Majesty already descend upon your world, and destruction of its entirety is at my fingertips to command. With utmost sincerity I urge you to embrace His Divine Majesty, or prepare for your destruction.The hour of reckoning is at hand. Choose well.""--------------------------------------------------Jack Spencer cursed loudly as he threw himself behind a rock, as a terrific crackle filled the air.It had all begun in a flurry. First, that message that appeared on every screen, which looked more like a bad joke, so unbelievable it was. Then came the news. Spencer was merely a sergeant, a NCO, but the panic at Fort Bliss was so tremendous that no news could be entirely hidden by the brass. Invasion, they talked about. And then, came the mobilization order, and the entirety of the 1st Armored left Fort Bliss.That was hours ago. They were informed of an advancing armored column they were to block, blunt and destroy. Just like the Iraqi War. Only that they were not facing Saddam's T-72's. In fact, Spencer had begun to imagine how the Iraqis must have felt.Within half an hour of the engagement's start, the Old Ironsides was in ruins. They had not faced tanks, no, they had faced monsters, monsters not of this world. Not even Shermans facing the dreaded King Tiger was this outmatched. Twenty tanks, this was all that stood in front of the Old Ironsides, which greeted its enemy with hundreds of armor-piercing rounds and anti-tank missiles.The monstrous behemoths had shrugged it all off, with nothing but scratched armor and occasional gouge to show for where ATGM's and tungsten rods had struck them. Then, they had fired.Their rounds had split open the Abrams with laughable ease, barely being slowed by punching through the entirety of the tank. The sponson mounts, looking so inefficient and obsolete, had spewed forth searing beams of laser with terrific cracks. From the hulls and the pintles came a rain of explosive heavy shells that made Browning HMG's petty. And at the head of the enemy wedge was a house-sized behemoth with eleven barrels jutting out of it, all spewing death and destruction through. Within half an hour, Spencer had seen the 1st Armored cease to exist, and few surviving infantrymen and crews trying to hold their ground amidst a field of twisted metal.What were those people?He popped out to shoot a burst towards an advancing group of infantry, before immediately ducking behind as a flurry of crackling laser bolts impacted his cover. The enemies were marching in parade-ground order, their blue uniforms formed into a wall of flesh from which relentless waves of laser crackled forth, making it barely impossible to even come out of cover. They were falling, falling by what fire the beleaguered defenders could put out, but they did not seem to mind their losses, as they kept marching just like in a victory parade.Jack brought his rifle around the cover, and emptied the magazine, before fumbling for a spare. Then, he realized in horror, as his hands grabbed one magazine. He was down to his last.And there weren't any other bullet reports he could hear. Just the ominous, crackling lasers.--------------------------------------------------President of the United States Donald Trump rattled his fingers on the conference table, at the bunker beneath the White House, trying to cope with the terrific chaos that had taken the entire world. All over the world, reports were coming in, of a terrific air force decimating their Earth equivalents, followed by millions of soldiers and tanks descending from the sky wielding weapons no Earth technology could match. But miraculously, the communications all remained intact. Was it truly a miracle, though, or an already-victorious commander allowing its enemy to witness in terrifying detail their destruction?""Quiet."" The President growled, his voice rising above the others in the room. ""Secretary Mattis, what is the odds of the United States resisting this extraterrestrial invasion?""The retired general stood up, eyeing everyone with a solid glare. James 'Mad Dog' Mattis was the most experienced soldier there, and everyone knew it.""""Pardon my manners, Mr. President, but the odds of us resisting this for even a week is damn fucking zero. We lost.""No answer came from the gathered people. Only the President reacted, staring at the Secretary of Defense who glared back. Then, Donald Trump finally spoke.""Prepare the nuclear response.""A chorus of terror rose in the room, and a plethora of arguments began. For a minute, the bunker descended to ultimate chaos.""Shut up, God damn it, all of you!"" The voice of James Mattis rose up again, cutting through the arguments like knife through butter. ""Mr. President, you cannot be planning to kill the entire world.""""This is the whole point of nuclear deterrence. If the existence of the United States of America is threatened, then we will at least take down our enemy with us.""Mattis opened his mouth to reply, but before he could, the main screen in the bunker lit up again, to the face of the man claiming to be called the Lord-General Iskander Savras.""Many nations of this planet have wisely elected to surrender, yet many others stubbornly resist. Let this be a demonstration of what the Imperium is capable of doing to the heretical and the defiant.""The vision changed, to a city, being filmed from far and high by some sort of aerial camera.The president began to speak. ""That is...""""Washington DC."" James Mattis completed.For a milisecond, the inhabitants of the bunker managed to see on the screen a searing, enormous bolt of light descending from the heavens like divine retribution. Then, they delved into nothingness.And where the capital of the world's strongest nation once stood, the lance beam of the battleship--------------------------------------------------At London, there was chaos.All it took was the latest world-wide message for the whole city to be locked down in panic. Everyone tried to flee the city, not even taking their belongings, but it was too late as the roads immediately locked down. Except for those in the very end, at the suburbs, London was essentially a prison. A prison with its madmen loosed.Many, bolder, stupider, or more desperate than the common man, had taken to leaving behind, looting, pillaging and attacking at will at anywhere as all semblance of public order disappeared from the capital. Those at the edges of the city; were at least somewhat safer, with a possibility of escape.Sarah and Clara, living in the city center, were in the middle of insanity.Her friend pulled Clara into a crevice, seconds before a trio of London's newest gangsters passed by them, not noticing the two women huddled just a meter away. After agonizing seconds, the trio turned a corner, and Clara let out a heavy breath.A shrieking sound roared overhead, followed by a whoosh of displaced air.""What was that?""""Don't know. Something flying. We need to get out."" Sarah whispered as she picked up the pace, leaving her friend to follow as they wandered through the web of alleys that made up urban London, keeping their eyes and ears peeled for anyone nearby. Suddenly, someone turned the corner ahead of them, a grin plastered on his face.""Good morning, ladies. What are two girls like you doing here?""The man was youthful and tall, with a scarred face that could be considered attractive, and a bloody machete around his waist that definitely wasn't attractive. Two more followed him, one of them a blocky brute with a dim expression on his face and the other was a middle-aged, scrawny man with a hawkish nose.""You shouldn't be wandering out here alone. The city has lost its mind. Not everyone is good like us three, right?"" He laughed at his own joke. The scrawny man did not even smirk, and the dim brute looked at the machete-carrier with puzzlement. ""You should come with us. We would have a good time."" He took a few steps towards the two women.""Clara?""""Yes?""""Run!"" Sarah shouted as she took off into a sprint, her toned body moving like lightning. As best as she could, Clara pursued her. A whistle came from behind them.Another pair appeared, blocking the other end of the alley, leaving the two boxed in. Sarah picked up speed. For a moment, it looked like she was going to collide into the two men. Then, she leapt on them in a flurry of blows.Her knuckles impacted squarely on one's jaw, knocking him on the ground, but the other wrapped his arms tightly around her. Sarah yanked her head backwards and heard the sickening sound of a snapping nose.""Run, you idiot!"" Clara heard her friend shout. And run she did, with tears in her eyes.A hand clasped around her ankle mere seconds later, and ground came up to meet her. She turned around, and came face to face with the man Sarah had knocked down. Dread grasped her heart. Dread, and a frantic panic.""Where were you going?"" The man growled, pressing her face-down into the ground. His putrid breath filled her nostrils. Footsteps came to Clara's ears, and at the edge of her vision she saw the other three. With four at hand, they were quick to subdue Sarah as well. The man with the scarred face knelt to look into her eyes, a hungry look Clara did not like at all.Then, a terrific crackle filled the air, and the man's expression turned to one of pain and agony. Half of the brute's head disappeared, spreading blood and brains on Sarah. The scrawny man fell with a dozen holes on his chest.Pushing the limp weight of the man off her, Clara turned around, to come face to face with a smirking woman. She was wearing only an armored vest and military fatigues underneath despite the cold, leaving her toned, muscled arms bare. Her head was crowned with fiery red hair, and face was adorned by a cheerful smile. She extended a hand to Clara, and lifted her off the ground. There were four more troopers with the newcomer, all dressed the same way unbothered by the cold. And all carrying the strange laser rifles she had seen on the news.""Let's get you somewhere safer. You are lucky we came across you."" She put a hand to her ear.""Corporal Magot reporting. Found two civilians in distress, multiple gangers neutralized, nothing else of interest. Returning to LZ.""She turned to the troopers. ""Escort formation, form up!""Without another word, the five soldiers formed up. The redhead led the way, two more soldiers after her, then still-shocked Clara and Sarah, and then two more soldiers.They eventually came at the Trafalgar Square, to a bustling sight. The place was filled with soldiers and armored vehicles. Massive tracked behemoths were prowling in what was once the greatest square in London, their armaments sighted down alleys and streets. Heavy weapons were being set up, firing positions were prepared, and hundreds of soldiers were turning Trafalgar into a base of operations. And at one corner of the square, a group of civilians were huddled together, watched by a few soldiers.In the center of things, was a trio. One was a soldier just like the others, except what Clara presumed was a rank insignia. Her blonde hair was tied back into a ponytail, and her long face had a vague resemblance to a horse, but she carried herself with an air of authority. That air, however, was no match to the man next to her. He was clad in a long, black greatcoat with a scarlet sash around his waist, and a cap adjusted at a suitably heroic angle. He was tall, taller than anyone else present, and had a handsome face. A hand rested on the pommel of what looked like a large, heavy sword with chainsaw-like teeth. A step behind him, was someone completely lacking that dignified aura. A soldier he was, in uniform two sizes too big for him, and a ragged face hidden beneath a wild, unkempt beard. But the most interesting thing was the proof that Trafalgar Square did not belong to the British government any more, a banner fluttering in the sky. It was quartered like an old coat of arms, one of them red, two blue, and the last diagonal-striped gold and black. In the center stood a skull with the number 597 carved across its forehead, with two strips of text, one above and one below the skull, respectively saying 'London no longer belonged to Britain.-------------------------------------------At the bridge of""Send word to the Warmaster.

5,"Yes. Pakistan can become a developed country, far more developed than India, even when India is far ahead right now. For this Pakistan government has to take some hard decisions and policy changes. There are some short term steps and some long term.

The person quoted World Happiness Index figures and how Pakistan was way ahead than India. He told me to go and build toilets and then f*** myself. My current answer is very sincerely meant. To that misguided person my only answer is that if you are happy with the state of affairs in Pakistan, the state of the economy, the crashing PKR, then what can I say? Be happy and let things run its course.Land Reforms:Education:Women Education:Infrastructure Development:But ports, roads and bridges are not the only infra. Pakistan has to focus on power including renewable sources, irrigation, housing development, development of new cities, etc. India lags here too.Give up on Terror; hug peace:Forget Kashmir. Increase Trade with India:There are a few more options. Not all are simple. Not all may bring immediate benefits but in the long run they will. It is a matter of setting aside the ego.Edit 2 (30-May-2019):The whole thing has been misunderstood. The rhetoric lies in the minds of the Establishment and not general populace (maybe). The survival of the Army Generals depends upon the anti India stance. Let me also explain how India rhetoric, the unbalanced arms race, terror funding, etc., have crippled Pakistan.In 1985, the Per Capita GDP of Pakistan was about 27.7% higher than India’s (Pak US$350 : Ind US$274). Today, the Pakistan per capita GDP is some US$ 1222.50 and forecasted to grow to US$ 1400 in 2020 while India’s PCGDP is US$ 1963.55 and forecasted to grow to US$ 2350 in 2020. India is 60.1% ahead. How did Pakistan lose out by about 88%?Pakistan, while a smaller nation, is a much blessed nation. Almost whole land is fertile, it has a unique geographic advantageous location, it is rich in minerals, its population is lower (but growing at an alarming rate 2.5 times of India), the problems are lower, etc. Smaller nations grow much more than larger nations. The growth rate till 1985 was about 6% and exceeded India’s measly 2.75%.It was around this time (1985) that Pakistan started funding terrorism against India and started the Kashmiri insurgency heavily. They also started heavy military purchases including the F-16s. Pakistan's general thought that we won the war in Afghanistan by attrition. We can do the same to India. The US was funding Pakistan to fight against Afghans. Some of the heavy funding was to take care of the huge Afghan refugees. But a lot of these funds were misused and ended in terror funding or the corrupt. Pakistan still had to shelter the refugees. The money came from the exchequer.This is what I mean by India rhetoric and it is deeply coupled with Kashmir.People have also questioned on terror and how IK is sincere and wanting to talk and Modi isn't. There are reasons for this. Why did the bus to Lahore in 1999 end up in Kargil? The Kashmir problem was almost solved at that time. Who helped the attack on J&K assembly and later the Indian Parliament? Who sent terrorists to Mumbai on 26/11/2008? Modi invited Nawaz Sharif and he gracefully agreed. Yet pretty soon there were Uri, Pathankot incidents and later Pulwama. Pakistan can’t honestly say that they were ‘freedom fighters’ fighting alone. JeM have taken responsibility of these events. Pakistan can’t hide behind excuses such as ‘give us the proofs’. Where do all these people get the training and logistics support? How is 240+ kg of RDX, detonators, timing devices obtained and where does the training to assemble it come from?Pakistan is always in denial mode. They denied whereabouts of Osama Bin Laden. What happened exactly?All this not only creates mistrust but that logistics support to “freedom fighters” is costing huge amount of money. The army/ISI can’t provide their own arms to the terrorists; they provide funds. The terrorists buy their arms and ammunition from global arms dealers at open market (much higher) price. Hence they require more money - the same money that could be used to build better roads, dams, canals, higher educational institutes, etc.Just a fortnight ago, Pakistan got some $6 billion from IMF and the first result was deep PKR devaluation. What is $6 billion? It is loose change for tea/coffee. A similar sum was spent by Laxmi Mittal to purchase the bankrupt Essar Steel of India. And yet, this money was direly needed. It has come with deep consequences. We went thru same crisis in 1991 and I know what happened. How long will this money last. Without fresh global investments, Pakistan will have to back to IMF in a year. The world views Pakistan as an unsafe place. Reality may be different but perceptions matter.Just imagine ... if peace accord had been signed in 1999. The Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline would have been complete - bringing huge revenues for Pakistan. A road transit would have been created from New Delhi to Central Asia bringing customs duty, cess and road tolls to Pakistan. These two would have earned more than $6b per annum. This is the benefit of bilateral trade.I have told to forget Kashmir and India. Cut down on (useless) defence spending.I could go on. My answer and advice is to take good things. India is not perfect; in fact, it is very far from perfect.","17,898 followers",Prasanna Bhalerao,1.4K,9.1K,72.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-the-Great-Crusade-had-encountered-another-human-empire-with-more-advanced-technology-and-a-larger-military-how-would-the-Imperium-of-Man-have-proceeded

Israel is an immigrant country - Much like the U.S, the Israeli human landscape is a combination of various cultures, various schools of thought and approaches and - as such - is a breeding ground for new takes on a matter.This was part of the United States secret sauce.2. Necessity is the mother of invention - Unique needs in the security, agriculture, energy, and other sectors brought about the birth of inventions in military, communications, medicine, irrigation, solar energy fields - you name it.3. Education - From its inception Israel has put an emphasis on the importance of education: From Elementary to Academic - and in spite of its small size, it holds some of the world's leading academic institutions.4. Investment in innovation - 5% of Israel's GDP is invested into the private sector through various plans and grants of the Office of the Chief Scientist [ http://www.moital.gov.il/CmsTamat/Rsrc/MadaanEnglish/MadaanEnglish.html ] in the ministry of Economy - No country in the world comes close to this percentage.From as early as seed stage companies, to as far as publicly traded technology companies, Israeli tech innovators enjoy these grants and investments, aimed at increasing the amount of Israeli Intellectual Property and successful tech companies.But it doesn't end there.ALL major global tech companies have R&D centers in Israel : Amazon, Apple, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Samsung, Facebook - you name it: They're here. And it's a win-win situation.Also, approximately 80% of the private investments made into Israeli startups comes from overseas.This is on top of a vibrant, and experienced Israeli Venture Capital ecosystem, which is now entering it's third decade.5. The IDF technologies - Tech developments for special forces, air force, ground forces, navy etc., later find their way into private market applications, giving the companies a unique edge over global competitors. Given Imaging [ http://www.givenimaging.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx ] is a great example.6. Unique intelligence and data tech capabilities - The Mossad, Military Intel, Cyber warfare units, other agencies - No need to elaborate on the fact that some of the best - if not the best - minds in intelligence work for Israel. Young Israelis undergo unparalleled training and engage in sci-fi like activities.Then they leave the service.Now what do you think they're going to do?7.

In 1910, he registered a patent for ""The method of electrical transmission of images over a distance."" A year later, with the help of a kinescope of his own design, he carried out the world's first television signal transmission - simple geometric shapes appeared on the screen. But Rosing did not succeed in developing the technology - in 1931 he was arrested on an artificial accusation, sent into exile and soon died. Vladimir Zvorykin managed to implement the idea in practice, who after the Civil War emigrated to the States. In 1933, at a conference of the American Society of Radio Engineers, Zworykin reported on the development of an electronic television system. Six years later, Zvorykin, with the organizational and financial assistance of another Russian émigré David Sarnov, launched the first regular television broadcast in the United States.Electric weldingWho invented: Nicholas Benardos (1842 - 1905)His grandfather, a Greek by birth, one of the heroes of the Patriotic War of 1812, Major General Panteleimon Yegorovich Benardos.Inheritance from the Greek ancestors Bernardos got a decent condition and a hot southern temperament. In 1873, the name of Bernardos hit the pages of the criminal chronicle. He and his friends whipped a local doctor who insulted a woman. Nikolai was motivated solely by considerations of justice (he was married by this time), but the court sentenced him to exile in Siberia. This punishment was later replaced by 3 months of a guardhouse, but the process practically ruined Bernardos. To fix things, he took up the construction of the paddle steamer, which could crawl shoals. The metal parts were joined by traditional forge welding. But since in the workshop of Bernardos there were no powerful heating furnaces, he tried to warm up the edges with a volt arc before forging. At the same time, the inventor noticed that the metal parts were sometimes soldered together. Bernardos first demonstrated his welding method called “Electrohephaest” in Paris in 1881. He brought him worldwide fame.Commercial Video RecorderWho invented: Alexander Ponyatov (1892 - 1980)Creation history: The father of the inventor was from peasants, engaged in the timber trade, became rich and became a merchant of the first guild. Alexander received an excellent technical education and became interested in aviation. In World War I served as a pilot of a military hydroplane. Was injured.
