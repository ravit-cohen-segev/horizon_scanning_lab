This US $ 10 Billion market cap.At FY 19 profits of Rs 862 crore & EPS of Rs 9.43, we get a Price Earning ratio of 80 !!Firstly, what is the highest PE of any mature financial company in India. Look at HDFC bank, Kotak, etc & we see much modest PEs of 25 to 35 for HDFC Bank & Kotak. This is when everyone acknowledges that these are very richly valued. But there is a track record of 20 yrs & more for these banks.Many argue that credit cards is a growing industry & has huge potential to penetrate, unlike some mature retail banks that are settling at much modest growth numbers of 20% now. Valuations & PE multiples have correspondingly matured.Do you think that credit card is different than retail banking & is in a super-normal growth phase in India?SBI cards has been around for more than 20 years now in market. And last 20 years have seen the card industry mature & evolve reasonably well. It has hit the maturity phase quite sometime back in terms of penetration. Look at the table below to understand this:In-fact there are many players who chose to shrink in size after 2008ICICI bank has never seen cards as a growth engine again except very recently now. HDFC did well as it issued cards only to the bank customers where it has an implied collateral of bank deposits. As long the FD is intact, the customer won’t default on the card. If they do, well the bank & manage the rest. That strategy proved right.SBI cards has a different problem through.I can recall 2003 when SBI cards issued free cards to all PPF customers under some agreement. The sales pitch was simple – “Sir, SBI is issuing you a free credit card since you hold a PPF account. Branch mgr wants us to give you this card. Did we say its free? Just sigh here pls.” Boom. A card is created.This policy got close to a million new customers to SBI cards but at what cost?. Card company doesn’t make money by issuing cards. It wants people to use cards for credit. The card usage for PPF customers of SBI was not even 20%. So 80% of those never used the card even once. Not surprising at all, at-least for those who “sold the free card”. They knew that half the folks aren’t even going to open the envelope.So, this talk of having access to SBI customer database is a tried tested theory that doesn’t work. Well it works to get the new card issues in the short run but lack of such card usage doesn’t get any money to SBI cards eventually. So it is just a window dressing.I see a similar narrative being built now. SBI cards IPO document doesn’t include much details around the history before 2015. The years before that were all about a shrinking industry, all this when the overall credit in retail was having a best of time. It’s just in the last few years that the industry has again seen some fresh spends & new cards. However, most banks are staying away from any reckless growth, They all have learned the history well & will expand only a limited pace that the market can absorb.Everyone wants to be rational. However, when you’re looking to list thru an IPO, the priorities are different. One player decides to issue cards thru the roof outsmarting every competitor. It doubles the workforce every year for last 2 years. See the employee expenses in 2017, 2018 & 2019 below. They are doubling every year.Why does this happen ? Well because someone wants to issue cards at much faster pace vs the competition.While HDFC bank, is happy with stable market share, Kotak is in-fact reducing the cards to optimize profitability, one player is in a tearing hurry to issue cards, It issues 45% of credit cards in India in the most recent month reported. Who is this player in a hurry ? SBI Cards.Lending business however works very differently. You can always grow by lending money fast. The real fun actually starts later when you have to get the money back. Doesn’t look like a top priority for the company as of now. So, the below growth numbers in spends & market share doesn’t impress me. If HDFC & Kotak with their proven lending practices are not growing, I would worry if some else is trying to grow. SBI Cards is almost stable till 2017 & then suddenly grew by 100% in 2 years till 2019. Not a consistent growth trend one would like to see.Notice another pointer in the date above. Citibank with just 6% of cards share has 13% of transactions. SBI cards takes 18% cards share to generate a 16% share .Another look at the channel sales data throws the same conclusion. Look how theArmed with this background, lets get back to the IPO valuation. Is it worth a buy ?So, with a FY’19 PE of 80 , if someone tries to sell me the story of growth in cards issued over last 5 yrs(which basically is in last 2 years), I’m not going to buy it.The stable cards base of SBI cards is 3.6 Mn that it had till 2017, just before the window dressing started &not the 8 to 10 Mn number that SBI wants us to believe. The growth in last 2 years will produce lots of dead cards but not profits. I see the rise in spends but that’s keeping in line with industry trend. The peak however is quickly reached in India & delinquencies follow soon-after. If HDFC, Kotak, etc have stabilized, I don’t see why SBI could grow outside of the trend. At-least not profitably. And it has seen that high bad debt cycle before in 2008.Finally at US $ 10 Billion valuation, I think it is quite generously valued. While there are no Indian card companies listed, we can compare this broadly to Discover Financial & Capital One in USA.Just to put this number in context, see the market cap of Indian banks below:HDFC Bank - $ 92 BNICICI Bank - $ 45 BNKotak Bank - $ 44 BNAxis Bank - $ 28 BNIndusInd Bank - $ 11 BNAre you telling me that the credit card arm of SBI is equal to the entire IndusInd bank & one third of entire Axis bank ?Feel free to mail or write to me onHonest - Unbiased - Simplified, as always.References:Credit card penetration remains dismally low","84,943 followers",Adam Fayed,18.5K,3.6K,476.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-a-good-idea-to-invest-in-the-upcoming-Tata-Technologies-IPO
