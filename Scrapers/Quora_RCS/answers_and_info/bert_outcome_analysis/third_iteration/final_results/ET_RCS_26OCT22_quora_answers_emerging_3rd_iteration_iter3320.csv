The cost to add these alarms on portable generators, which started in 2019, was less than $5/unit.","2,320 followers",Akram Odaily,36.9K,889,16M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-problems-are-people-facing-during-COVID-19-that-can-be-resolved-using-advance-technology-but-have-not-been-addressed-yet

He met with JRD Tata, who is perhaps the most successful businessman in the history of our nation.Pandit Nehru wanted to set up an Indian cosmetic brand that would replace the foreign companies and prevent Indian money going overseas. He came up with the name ‘Lakshmi Brand Cosmetics’.JRD Tata, being a robust businessman suggested that such a name would not appeal to the upper class women and put forward an alternative. Inspired by a french opera having a similar name, he suggested that they use the same name but with a french accent. And hence the decision was finalised.The rest, as they say, is history. The brand soon became the largest cosmetic brand in India. Today it has become one of the most trusted brands in our country.So you see, this is India's problem. We are capable of achieving so much. But we have almost no belief in ourselves.So there you have it. India's biggest problem? Cynicism.Oh!

I’ll also address why those fears come up and how to overcome them.The first problem is easily resolved - just build a web page. Don’t worry about what language you pick, just pick the first one that comes up in search. People over complicate it by saying ‘Oh use this language, or use some other language’. Fuck the noise. Just pick the first you that comes up and build a web page. Read the first tutorial that comes up in where ever your looking. Take 3 seconds to look at it and then go.The second and third fears are from self-doubt and a lack of confidence in your abilities. These self doubts come about b/c you’re picturing scenarios where you might have tried something in the past and failed, so you’re worried that you’ll fail again. You keep asking your brain, ‘How can I fail at programming?’ and well, you brain keeps answering. Oh you need to be good at math to do this (false). Oh you need to have an IQ of 180 (false). Oh you need to have started this when you were in HS (false). It’s all self-doubt/low-confidence rearing its ugly head.So how do you overcome these fears? Start small. Don’t climb Mt. Everest when you can’t climb a hill. Don’t worry about how it all fits together or whether or not you need math, or how old you are or how fast you learn it. Those things don’t matter. Just focus on each lesson and getting really good at the lesson at hand. Once you finish all the lessons, then ask around about the next lesson. Just do the very best at EACH lesson. Don’t worry about the bigger picture. If you trust the process, eventually all the pieces start coming together and you’ll see how things start to fit together.Every engineer has had to do this. We weren’t born with computers in our hands. We’ve all worked through the struggle of not groking something on the first pass and saying ‘WTF’. It takes practice and persistence. Just keep banging away at it piece by piece, and you’ll start to see how everything fits together….—http://www.friendlywisdom.com","129,179 followers",Jessica Su,2.2K,1.5K,49.7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-problems-are-people-facing-during-COVID-19-that-can-be-resolved-using-advance-technology-but-have-not-been-addressed-yet

Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party.

Every time you delay pushing code fearing bugs, you are delaying some valuable learning. If you accept the fact that you will not push perfect code all the time, then it frees your mind to focus on other things, like monitoring or testing so that future bugs will be caught quickly. If you are repeating the same mistakes, then you should step back and think about whether you are actively learning from them. So, rather than worrying about preventing bugs entirely, you should focus on causing new types of bugs to progress as an engineer.Here is another way to think of it. Rather than thinking of reducing absolute number of bugs, think of the ratio of positive impact of your features to negative impact of the bugs that you have pushed. So, if you can move quickly and push more features, then you can live with a couple of non-severe bugs along the way. But if you delay pushing features due to fear of bugs, then the amount of impact that you can have in a given period of time will also be limited. The bottomline is that your impact is not dictated by the number of bugs that you caused but the positive value of your total output.This might seem counterintuitive but some major bugs are often caused by the very best engineers. This is because these engineers work on big, complicated projects which usually result in significant positive outcomes when things go well and huge negative impact when bugs happen. So, if you have the chance, just talking to them and listening to their war stories can help build confidence.

Your code is always the problem, there is no one else you can blame. You also have to accept that your code will not work the first time. If it does, it's probably even more wrong than you think.
