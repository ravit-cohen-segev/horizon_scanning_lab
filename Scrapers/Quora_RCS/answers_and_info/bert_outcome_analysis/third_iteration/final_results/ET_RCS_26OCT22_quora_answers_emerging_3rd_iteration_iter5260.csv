1,"TLDR: Ultimately, we use batteries for commuting, and fryer grease and alcohol to power vehicles than have to be on the road all the time.There isn’t such a thing as a replacement for electric vehicles. All non-ICE vehicles put together are a tiny proportion of the market and wouldn’t be viable without subsidies and incentives. No-one with any sense is going to try to replace a solution that isn’t yet entirely viable. What everyone is still competing over is how to replace gasoline.The basic problem of transportation fuels is that you have to carry the fuel, plus whatever is needed to containTLDR: Ultimately, we use batteries for commuting, and fryer grease and alcohol to power vehicles than have to be on the road all the time.There isn’t such a thing as a replacement for electric vehicles. All non-ICE vehicles put together are a tiny proportion of the market and wouldn’t be viable without subsidies and incentives. No-one with any sense is going to try to replace a solution that isn’t yet entirely viable. What everyone is still competing over is how to replace gasoline.The basic problem of transportation fuels is that you have to carry the fuel, plus whatever is needed to contain it and convert it into energy, around in the vehicle. That puts a huge onus on the weight of the fuel and the weight of the power train. Gasoline is a very good transportation fuel, because it works well in internal combustion engines, which are light and produce a lot of torque at high speeds, even though they’ve not very efficient, and it has an enormous energy density both per unit weight and per unit volume. The only real problem with it is that it produces a lot of CO2 when it burns, and in the long term we need to stabilize carbon emissions.There’s only really three options to replace gasoline: other hydrocarbons and engines, hydrogen and batteries.Natural gas is a slightly better transportation fuel than gasoline. Its lighter, only slightly harder to store, and has less carbon per kW of energy. Unfortunately it requires build-out of a whole new set of infrastructure to get only a slight advantage. The best option for other hydrocarbons is something renewable, hence net carbon neutral or nearly so. Unfortunately, other than ethanol from sugar cane, which we can’t make enough of, no such thing seems to exist. Ethanol from corn takes too much processing. Diesel from food oil waste is pretty good, but again there isn’t enough of it. Second generation biofuels as yet don’t seem to work.Marginal improvements to Otto cycle engines are possible, for example the combination of an Atkinson cycle engine and batteries and motors, or very small Otto cycle engines plus superchargers and batteries. Some of these are promising, but as yet all such hybrid vehicles kind of suck. Yes, there are millions of Prius’s out there. There Prius is to driving as Soylent is to eating. Its theoretically the same experience, but all the joy has been sucked from it.Hydrogen also sucks. Its a stupid idea that only ever looked non-stupid because its lighter than batteries. Making hydrogen is inefficient and emits CO2. Transporting hydrogen is inefficient and emits CO2. Storing hydrogen requires special alloys and equipment which are heavy. Which neutralizes the weight advantage of the fuel itself. The Mirai is an okay implementation of a bad technology. Its slower than a battery powered car, less convenient to fuel, and more cramped thanks to the hydrogen tank taking up space.Which leaves batteries. Plus sides: Its very easy to get electricity, so infrastructure built out is straightforward and in many places already done. Sufficiently large eletric motors produce a tonne of torque, and you can tune the drive train to get that torque at moderate speeds where you need it, much more easily than with an ICE car. So the drive train is very simple - its a battery, an inverter, a motor and a computer. No oil. No transmission. No clutch or torque converter. Downsides: batteries are very heavy per unit weight and slow to charge. So the main system design constraint is how much weight of batteries the rest of the car can tolerate, and that determines your range. Right now, Tesla is the master of this and they seem to be topped out at about 300 miles. Which is easily enough for most users. Even the new Leaf’s 150 miles is easily enough. Its still not appropriate for people who drive for a living, as even in the best case scenario you’re still charging for longer than you’re driving. Realistically, that charge time constraint isn’t going away. But batteries can easily replace 80% of personal transportation.If we can convert all the trucks to ethanol and biodiesel, and personal transportation to batteries, that looks very feasible and much lower carbon than we are right now. Nothing else really looks doable.",0 followers,James Burkill,613,315,1.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-is-poised-to-replace-electric-vehicles

And when Apple ships its new pro display later this year, I’ll probably buy the then-current model MacBook Pro and the display for my work.
