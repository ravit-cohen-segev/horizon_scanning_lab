0,"Q: How is a layman atheist who has sincere faith in the theories of scientists any different from a layman theist who has similar faith in the words of saints?A:There's no such thing as a “layman atheist”.Being an atheist requires no faith at all.An atheist can reject belief in everything science ever accomplished, and still lack belief in gods, thereby being an atheist.Atheism is the lack of belief in gods, nothing else, it's a description, not a religion.","1,274 followers",Andre Lieven,2.8K,4.2K,12.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-is-a-layman-atheist-who-has-sincere-faith-in-the-theories-of-scientists-any-different-from-a-layman-theist-who-has-similar-faith-in-the-words-of-saints

This was pre-public-wifi-hotspot-everywhere and being on the high seas for prolonged periods of time meant that the only internet access available was their ridiculously overpriced satellite internet.Worst of all, they charged by the minute, rather than by data usage, so even when only chatting with my friends at home, the clock was ticking, and so was the credit card bill my parentsHacked a computer on a cruise ship to get free internet access and impress a girl.This is years back, but I will go anon anyway.I was in my late teens at the time and vacationing on a cruise ship with my parents. This was pre-public-wifi-hotspot-everywhere and being on the high seas for prolonged periods of time meant that the only internet access available was their ridiculously overpriced satellite internet.Worst of all, they charged by the minute, rather than by data usage, so even when only chatting with my friends at home, the clock was ticking, and so was the credit card bill my parents would receive.Motivated by boredom and the desire to impress a girl I had met on the cruise, I started poking around.The PCs in the library were loaded with Windows XP, which was new and fancy at the time, connected to a card-reader and heavily locked down. They were physically attached inside a locked cabinet each, exposing nothing more than the power button, the front USB ports, and a floppy disk drive.The systems booted into a custom shell, which would simply tell you to insert your room key into the card reader and, upon doing so, invoked the standard windows shell to present you with an equally locked-down guest account desktop with literally nothing but Internet Explorer, print and USB access. USB Boot was disabled and the BIOS was obviously locked too.Safe Mode actually skipped the custom shell and presented you with the standard windows logon prompt. Useless without login credentials, but a start.What the system admin failed to realize however, was that the externally accessible floppy drives were still the default first item in the boot order. Even in those days floppys were so outdated, that he probably didn’t think that a teenager with a laptop and an actual floppy disk would ever venture into the library on this cruise ship.Strike One!But what can you reasonably do with 1.44 MB of storage? Load up NT Offline Registry Editor! This is actually a linux image small enough to fit onto a floppy, which can read the Windows registry offline. Now what is stored in the Windows registry? The local user passwords in hashed form! At the time XP was already using the NTLM hash function to actually authenticate user logons, but for compatibility reasons also stored the passwords seperatly using the older and much weaker LM hash by default. While the admin could have disabled this, probably due to the newness of XP he didn’t think of this either.Strike Two!With the LM hash of the local admin account and my laptop on hand it was time for some password cracking. Back then, L0phtCrack was a very useful tool for cracking password hashes, and even my old AMD Althlon laptop was able to power through the weak security the admin forgot to disable. Voila, local admin access! With local admin access disabling the custom shell was easy, so I didn’t have to surf the net in Safe Mode with ugly graphics. Success at last! Free Internet!Strike Three and Out!As an additional benefit, the local admin accounts also were standard user accounts in the Active Directory domain, so I had fairly wide access to all their fileservers. Some shares were still locked and at least the admin didn’t use the local admin password for the domain admin account, but poking around the network and reading the head engineers logs and documentation was fun!Needless to say, the girl I was after was impressed and this, among other things, got me laid. ;)Homerun!Whoa!, what a response, didn’t expect that. Glad you all enjoy this litte part of my life :) Made some edits, as suggested in the comments and to fix typos and grammar. Thanks for that!

Never would I expect there is a common database where you could find everyone’s personal data and account information (meaning teachers, students and you guess it: headmaster/the number 1 of our school). I went into the account of our headmaster and played God for 2 years.I could shut down the entire platform system, change passwords, erase/change bad notes, look into e-mails. Possibly everything you could imagine if you were the nr.1 in school. Afterwards I found out that there’s an IP system where you can see all the IP’S logged into the accounts. Typed in my IP: saw the history and I felt screwed. But fortunately they never looked into that unless awkward things happen (happened 1 time and I got away luckily when I blocked a teacher account). I knew after graduation that the headmaster knew that I was playing God but he didn’t do anything because I had clear evidence against him of some illegal/extracurriculur affairs (gotta keep myself guaranteed right if it goes nuts in court).I stole the tests/exams the last 2 years of school and graduated with greatest distinction (became second to a nerd with 100% of his time spending on school).

I know in relation understanding is very important but I could not understand her.We used to chat using cellular SMS and facebook messages on facebook website. I could see her online on facebook but she never replies to my SMS. One day I had created a fake facebook account of her close friend and then tried to chat with her. She replies to her but she doesnt reply to my messages (logged through another browser on same computer). One day I decided to hack her facebook account. But being an electronic engineer and software enthusiast just passed out from college, I was not having enough skill to hack.Then something strike my mind to use this simple trick. I just tried for the first time. Went to gmail.com and tried forgot password with her gmail/email id. Tried with security questions.We both were together for around five years. During this period she had changed 2–3 sim numbers. But I had remember her first mobile number even after several years because she used to call me anonymously from this number with a different name and used to flirt and propose me. Tough we know each other before but never spoke to her before so I couldnt recognize her voice. This is how our love started.2. Town? (Couldnt not remember exact question but some thing related to town or city)This I tried with different option but couldnt succeed. Then I started recollecting old memories she used to say about her families. I tried with her mom’s native which didnt work. But later tried with her dad’s native which worked. And thats it I could enter her gmail account and continued with entering new passwordI was going through few mails and chats but couldnt find anything. Since now I have access to her gmail account I decided to do forgot password on facebook and reset her facebook account as well.What I saw killed me. As I doubted she was in love with some guy and she used to chat with her very often on facebook.The same day we both supposed to meet. We met at a restaurant. She was sitting in the opposite table and I was starring at her constantly. we both were silent for few mins. Then I asked her “Do you love me?” She said “Yes offcourse”.Tears started gushing in my eyes when she said this. I said to her “This is the last day we both will be meeting”. She asked me “why”. And I said because I know you love someone else. I said to her about everything what I did. She couldnt believe it. I said I will share you the new password.Later we stopped talking to each other. Then one day she call me and asked me for the new password because she needed it to check some important email of her colleges.The password was “stillloveyou”I dont know whether this is so illegal.

I’d read an article talking about how modern scanners and printers (they were talking about laserjets though I believe) had gotten so sophisticated that it was becoming a problem in regards to counterfeiting. This was about 13 or 14 years ago.I only scanned one bill, and only planned to print one bill, so it took a few tries for me to get it right so that the front and back of the bill printed in the exact same spot on opposite sides of the paper, or at least close enough. It wasn’t perfect. I could tell it was a tiny bit off, on the back, but it was close enough I didn’t think someone would notice had they not known to look.I really only did it to see how it would look, and to see if it was something that would actually fool someone visually. So once I had it just right, I carefully cut it off the sheet of paper with an exacto blade, and admired my handy work. My scanner was a cheap scanner, so the image wasn’t perfect, but it looked like something that might be passable in a dimly lit room or maybe outside at night.I then proceeded to “rough up” the bill to make it look a little worn out, like a bill that’s been in circulation for awhile, and folded it a couple of times. Then I set it out in the living room near the front door and waited. A few minutes after my roommate got home I heard “Hey man, are you missing any money?” I told him that I wasn’t, and that I’d been broke for days. He then exclaimed. “Dude, I just found $50!” He figured at some point someone must have dropped it somewhere in the living room, and that maybe the cat had been playing with it and knocked it out into plain view.However, once he picked it up he said “Wait… what the… Dude, I don’t think this is real…” The feel of real money is completely different t...",116 followers,Mark Maupin,869,304,1.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-most-illegal-thing-you-have-ever-done-on-a-computer

Mom had just gotten a truckload of European oak furniture that needed to be cleaned and polished, have the handles screwed on and so forth.A nice-looking young man came into the store and started talking to my sister, who was 17 at the time. He introduced himself as Ted Smith, and we laughed and said we must be related as mom’s maiden name was Smith also. He chatted both of us up, but focused on sis for the most part.He purchased an armoire, but said he’d have to go get his truck, since at the moment he was driving his VW Bug—an old VW Bug. He then asked my sister and me if we wanted to go out to dinner that night with him. We were sweaty and dirty from work, I had a baby to care for, and sis already had a boyfriend, so we said “Thanks, but no thanks, Ted”.He asked me to ride with him to get his truck so he could drop his Bug off at the auto shop for repairs, but by that point I had to get home to my infant—-right away, because I was still nursing her and I thought my breasts were going to begin leaking at any minute.However, he wouldn’t give up trying to get one or both of us away from the shop.He said he could come back about 10:00 that evening for his armoire and asked whether one or both of us be there. We replied, “No, we close the shop at six, and we both have places to be tonight.”He was persistent. “How about tomorrow night?”“No, we close at 6:00, except on Saturdays, when we close at 4:00.”He asked whether one of us could meet him early in the morning, like at 5:30 a.m., but neither of us wanted to.He was getting to be a bit creepy and sis and I were eye-rolling at each other.Eventually, he said he was sorry but he couldn’t buy the armoire if we couldn’t be flexible.We hated to give up the sale, but after he had been there for two hours, we thought he was just looking and taking up our time. We still had a lot of work to do on the furniture that had just arrived in the shop.Finally, we just wanted to finish our work and go home.At 6:00 p.m., as we were leaving, his VW Bug was parked outside and he asked us whether we want to go for coffee; he especially wanted my sister to go.We said, “Thanks, Ted, but no thanks, like we said earlier, we have plans,” but he continued to be insistent.Finally I said, “Sis, let’s go—I’ll take you home.” Even though she had her car there, for some reason I didn’t want to leave her to drive home alone with this guy around.So he drove off in his Bug and we really didn’t think of it again…Until the next year, when this picture appeared in the paper:Ted Bundy.It still sends chills up my spine, writing this, and sis and I talk about it occasionally.

When you clicked on a title it would take the article url and combine it with a Google Translate url to create a link that would take you to the “translated” page on Google Translate.Because I wanted to do this on the go, I ended up building an Android app with the same logic and later an iOS one too.

The lady in front of me bought something on her credit card and they had a card imprinter which basically is a machine that has 3 pieces of carbon paper that you use to manually record the credit card.After the lady signed the receipt they just threw the carbon paper in the trash. I remember thinking how clearly you could read the numbers.Being 12 and my only source of income was from a paper route that I had, money was always tight. My friends were even worse off. We were at my buddy Ed’s house looking at a BMX type magazine just dreaming of owning the mongoose GT. Back in the day this was the best bike you could get. 360 degree swivel neck, plastic mag rims, foot pegs, hand brakes the works. Man they were over $500.We talked about saving up to buy them but quickly realized that it would take us years to save that money as we spent money like it was going out of style. Then I noticed that the ad we were looking at took credit cards. A light went off in my head. I know where I can get credit cards numbers!!!!But how do we do this? It was summer and having a paper route I knew when families were on vacation due to them having stopped delivery of the paper. So rode my crappy huffy bike to the back of TJ Max and I found a trash bag full of carbon papers. I grabbed a few and headed home. We then decided which one of us sounded the oldest and ordered the bike over the phone. Adding on all kinds of options. A few days later it arrived at a family’s home who was on vacation. That night we went and picked it up and put it together. This went on for some time. Almost all my friends had an awesome bike. We began to get stupid though. One guy had a fucking fruit basket delivered to his house. We had Van Halen tickets left at will-call for us under another kids name who could drive. We were living the good life. Then my buddy Chuck wanted a bike. It was near the end of summer. Family vacations were a little scarce. But one family was taking a vacation the next week. So we sprung into action like we had over a dozen times. Ordered the bike had it delivered to the family that was on vacation. The day the bike arrived though was a bit different. As I delivered the afternoon paper, I saw the box was sitting on the front step. Great I thought. I peddled down the road continuing to deliver the news papers. On the street I saw a family friend sitting in a car. Oh, I forgot to mention, my dad was a part-time cop at the time. This family friend was a cop as well. I stopped by the car and said hello to “Les” and peddled away.On the way home I stopped at my buddy Chucks house and I told him the bike was there but the cops were watching the house. So we wisely decided not to pick up the bike. The next day I came home from hanging out with my friends and there was a cop car in the drive. Not unusual as my dad was a cop and they stopped by all the time even when on duty. I walked into the house and there was Les. I knew I was screwed, but I going to try and deny it. Les told me that I had a nice bike, that he was thinking of buying one for his son. Where did I get it. I told him K-mart. Seemed plausible, Adults don’t know anything about bikes, I thought. I had a paper route so a $69 bike from K-Mart was feasible. He told me that he knows that K-Mart doesn’t sell that type of bike. He then told me that they had been investigating a credit card theft ring in the area and several bikes matching the one I was riding were among the stolen merchandise. He then said he was going to leave and that my father was going to bring me to the station in a bit and they wanted to “talk” to me about this coincidence. Man did I want Les to take me with him. I thought I was not going to make to the police station. I’m talking real police brutality. (I joke about that and if you have been the victim of police brutality, I apologize) So my dad tells me get in the car and we leave. He is quiet at first and then he tells me one thing. “You better not fucking lie to them!” Worst car ride of my life. I go in the the station I am in a back room and they ask me to write out what I know. I told them EVERYTHING. When I was done, I walked out of the back room and there were all my friends and their parents sitting on benches. Everyone of my friends was crying their eyes out.We all got caught. Life was not fun for a while after that. I say we got away with it because, none of us went to court. None of us had to suffer any “legal” consequences.

I was with the section that provided security to our personnel and some diplomatic types from canada and India. It was known to us, the sit in the schools and colleges, but our job was just the training and transfer of military units and hardware, and my section was just for watching our own nominated wards ( assigned vips ). It was an unsaid rule if anything got in the way of the diplomatic effort, we were to literally ‘blow it away’ and the Afghan govt. had the ball for that. Now the local police ( brave as they were, but no match for the taaliban instigated gangs of shitkickers with AKs) had cooperated enough to give us info, numbers , descriptions of cars, suvs that they used for abductions, rapes and hits. One of these we found circling the khost university campus, which is now I think the shiek Zayed university. It was known to belong to a rich landlord’s son, and he was a suspect in a gang rape. Enough for me.It was my ‘off hours’, 4 hrs of r&r, if you can call it that, and me and a buddy thought , “Hell ! While we’re here , why the fµck not ?” So we kept surveiling it, it was a tan range rover , with dark windows and a blaring music system, and it just idled along the only street that connected the campus to a residential area , then when it reached the campus it would stay at the gate, and 4–5 guys would make life hell for any kids around, any one going inside or coming out. Sometimes they would accost them, sometimes, they would snap pics of girls and tell them the were going on sale, and jeer, and all. Typical charlies.We watched for 6 days , then in the night my buddy went up to the gate on one of two shitty bikes we’d ‘borrowed’ from a pound, looking like aWe ducked , leaving our bikes leaning on the doors, went prone, and rolled away as fast as we could. Before we were on our feet, the ball of pinkish white light had heated up the interior and their shouts were turning to cries. I’d kept the second for if somebody escaped the vehicle. Nobody did though. The M34 is a marker grenade, but also comes in handy when you need to light up an area or just burn shit down. We can use it like an incendiary, white phosphorous burns and sticks to skin , burns through bone and cloth and most stuff. Water is useless for it, and it gets superhot in a jiffy. It is basically like liquid fire spraying out in fine droplets.I sometimes shiver thinking about the pain it must a’ caused, but then I remember the old women wailing over their abused and ravaged children the cops used to find.Because of the sudden fireworks , no one saw us, if they did , probably thought some assholes were playing with fire and burnt their expensive car. I don’t think the locals would complain anyhow. There were no abductions for months, until a boy was found sodomized again. By this time, we were being re-assigned, I don’t know what happened after. The next , Karzai govt. was weaker too. ‘God help the people there’, I thought, and moved on.But in that moment, I tried. Deterrence ? Vengeance ? Justice ? Plain psychopathy ?I don’t know.

So on to the good stuff:-Like many people around the globe, I didn't like my university much, all it did was milk me for money for 4 long years in exchange for a degree and crappy education that couldn't even land me a job, I was a poor student studying on student loan and I was sitting idly by, pretending to not notice the evils of modern education system as I waited to finally graduate that fall. That all changed when my university decided to pull a cheap trick on everyone...‌The year was 2012, and my university devised a trick to attract more undergrads. They registered their presence on social media (primarily facebook, they didn't have a facebook page before this) and asked the students in their final year to advertise the page as much as they can and bring people (undergrads) to like their page in exchange for a preferential treatment during placement drives. Oh and did I mention that it was 'compulsary' for each and every student of the university to 'Like' the page on facebook? Anyways, when I went over and checked the page, I was baffled; it was full of lies and made up facts about how our university provides a world class education and excellent campus placement records(which were fake btw). I was forced to 'like' the page but I decided that I cannot just let it slide while the university dupes innocent and unsuspecting young undergrads into their trap and milk them for money as they did with me. So this is what I did:‌‌The use of Facebook and other social networking sites was banned in our university's computer lab. By this time I had backdoors in almost every computer in the lab. I created a facebook phishing page but I was having a hard time hosting it to a free hosting provider as my accounts were getting suspended for hosting phishing pages. So I devised a workaround. The hosting providers would not allow phishing pages but they will allow php scripts right? So I hosted my phishing scripts and database on the hosting provider and for the frontend, I installed apache server on a machine and hijacked the DNS to route the facebook address to local loopback address and hosted the html part of the phishing pages on the local apache server that connected to the scripts on my web hosting.‌I 'accidently' let people discover that facebook is indeed working in the computer lab and with the help of cleverly designed phishing pages, I was able to walk away with more than 250 accounts in 3 days.‌Then I created a fake facebook account with a pseudonym 'Gray Matter' and created a facebook page to expose my university with real facts and data. When the admission season began that year, I made my page public with 'likes' from hacked accounts of university students. I then created fake profiles of girls on facebook and lured many outsiders to like my page. Quite an ‘unconventional’ approach I’d say but I had a purpose in mind and I wouldn't even listen to myself, I couldn’t let them have their way.‌‌The result was astonishing, my university was shaken to its core, it asked all its students to withdraw their 'likes' from my page, which they did, the university wanted to catch the mastermind behind it but I did all of this from the computer lab and the lab never kept record of who used which computer and when, their attempts went futile.‌I also created a webpage on a free web hosting exposing the lies and the real quality of education the university offered in its classrooms.I deleted my page at the end of the admission season, the university attained a record low enrollments that year, I don't know if my facebook page played a part in it but I knew that my little battle has been won.Besides this I have defaced websites, took down servers with DDosing and much more but I did it to learn and I never had evil intent at heart.Thanks for reading this long post guys..",0 followers,Staffan Sandström,13K,7.9K,17.3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-most-illegal-thing-you-have-ever-done-on-a-computer

After about 8 hours practice, I had become a master. I was printing the same $10 bill once every couple of minutes at this point. I even went so far as to take the paper and wet it, then let it hang dry so it would have that crispy, thicker texture that money has. By the time I was done, you'd have to look pretty closely to tell they were fakes.So, I printed up about $1000 worth of the same $10 bill, with the same serial # on all of them, and my friends and I had the night of our lives.

He could only choose the right structure if he knew what kind of data the program would store and how and when the program would need to access it.For a long time, there were no standard libraries for implementing and manipulating basic data structures, so programmers had to write them themselves. That, in turn, required programmers to understand and be able to implement basic algorithms for sorting, searching, etc.The systems that developers had to work with decades ago had very little CPU and memory. You had to make the most of every resource, and if there was inefficiency anywhere, it showed up quickly. So you had to write code that was lean and efficient.Finally, much of the software being developed decades ago was meant to run systems that had to be consistent, reliable, and durable, such as operating systems, telephone switching systems, air traffic control systems, etc. The organizations developing the software were doing it to run critical systems that were core to their business or mission, and they understood that writing it would take a long time.Fast-forward to today. A huge number of software projects are web-based and are built with ready-made frameworks. The developer’s job is to mix and match pre-fabricated parts. He rarely has to know anything of the internals of the system that his code is running on.Today’s computers have multiple fast CPUs and enormous amounts of memory. If your program is inefficient, it’s a not as big a deal as it used to be. There’s plenty of room for slack.In addition, the organizations building many of today’s systems are often not thinking for the long term. A startup wins by getting to market first. If it doesn’t win, it pivots, changing its focus and mission all at once, throwing out huge amounts of working code to develop something that will bring in more money more quickly. Today, development speed counts more than quality.All of these developments parallel other industries, such as homebuilding. You may ask why so few of today’s carpenters have the same skills as the master carpenters of a hundred years ago. The answer is that the market no longer demands it. Today, houses are assembled from pre-fabricated sections of framing lifted into place by a crane and attached by journeyman or novice-level carpenters.Add drywall, flooring, and a roof, and your main structure is done. The process is fast, cheap, and easily repeatable by lower-skilled workers, just like today’s web-based applications in which novice programmers assemble pre-fabricated components.Finally, today’s programmers get paid a lot. It is much easier to find people who are interested in making a good living than it is to find people who are interested in understanding what electrons are doing inside a complex machine.",0 followers,Steven Kelly,1.3K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-is-a-layman-atheist-who-has-sincere-faith-in-the-theories-of-scientists-any-different-from-a-layman-theist-who-has-similar-faith-in-the-words-of-saints

51,"The decline is real, the cause is simple — but there’s a solution too.In the early days, the only people who would be able to successfully program were those who were the very top of the scale in terms of innate ability. As languages and tools have improved, programming has become possible for those lower down the scale. Those improvements make all developers more productive, yet do not change the proportional difference between a decent developer and a great one.For a long time now, however, there hasn’t been a significant improvement in the languages and tools used by the majority of programThe decline is real, the cause is simple — but there’s a solution too.In the early days, the only people who would be able to successfully program were those who were the very top of the scale in terms of innate ability. As languages and tools have improved, programming has become possible for those lower down the scale. Those improvements make all developers more productive, yet do not change the proportional difference between a decent developer and a great one.For a long time now, however, there hasn’t been a significant improvement in the languages and tools used by the majority of programmers. Productivity hasn’t changed much, but demand has grown hugely in terms of number of users, devices, and problems that today’s hardware can cost-effectively solve - if only we have the software.Companies obviously aim to choose the best of the available candidates, so as time goes by and we need more programmers, the extra ones entering the market are on average worse than those already employed. At some point, we reach a stage where the new people are simply not able to program economically with the current tools, and the growth of programmers tails off.The US hit that point in 2004: after becoming the most common job in the country (overtaking truck drivers), the number of programmers stopped growing.When we hit that limit, the only thing that can help will be to raise the level of productivity significantly, nearly an order of magnitude. That will open software development to a new section of the population. The only innovation I’ve seen that can do this is called Domain-Specific Modelling: languages designed for a narrow task, and using the point of view of the domain expert, not the programmer. A tool designed for a specific task is much more productive and much easier and safer to use: yes, you can core an apple with a table knife, but it’s time-consuming, risky, and the results are uneven; with an apple corer, it’s one push and you’re done.For over 30 years, there have only been a couple of mainstream languages at a time: general purpose jacks-of-all-trades, masters of none: the table knives of software development. The challenge with the apple corer is that it’s useless for cutting your cheese, or slicing an egg - so we need more tools, for each domain. And as each domain will have its own domain experts and a different set of concepts and terms they use, we need different languages.Historically, creating new languages and tools has been time-consuming and intimidating. A new kind of tool, called a language workbench, takes the hard work out of it. The best workbenches can enable even a non-programmer to create a new modelling language and full tool support in under a week, and in under a fortnight a programmer can add the code generation that turns any model made with the tool into running code that works first time. And that generation is what makes the modelling 5–10 times more productive than hand-coding for that domain. One of my working life’s greatest privileges is to have been able to see that magic happen in probably more domains than anyone else — and yet it still delights and impresses me every time.While I think Domain-Specific Modeling is the long term answer, there is also a need for tools between the table knife and the apple corer. Find the kinds of system built most often by the greatest number of programmers, and make a somewhat specific solution for their customers to be able to make those systems mostly by themselves. This approach is called ‘low code’, and rather than using the concepts of the customer — one language for doctors and another for accountants — it aims for a more generic, yet still high level, modelling language, with bits of code as necessary. Rather than many hundreds of languages,So, the decline in quality is real, and inevitable — with current mainstream languages and tools. The interesting question is whether the software juggernaut can still turn. If it can’t, or stubbornly refuses to, it risks being overtaken by its own customers, producing their own software more productively with low code and Domain-Specific Modeling.",30 followers,Robin Thomas,2.6K,731,13.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-is-a-layman-atheist-who-has-sincere-faith-in-the-theories-of-scientists-any-different-from-a-layman-theist-who-has-similar-faith-in-the-words-of-saints

Talents that most geniuses possessLogical thinking is at the top of the list. If you don’t have this talent, I can’t teach it to you.Talents are things you are born with, skills are things you learn.You may learn a programming language (or think that you have) but if you lack the ability to think logically, you won’t make it as a programmer.By “programmer” I am covering all the various titles being tossed around.If you write programs, you are a programmer. If you analyze systems and automate them, you are a programmer, etc.A “software developer” is a programmer and there is no such thing as a “Software Engineer.”Any title other than programmer is merely a name someone gives themselves to make them APPEAR to be better than they are and more important.Proficient programming requires a lot of talents and skills, among which are:In short - the vast majority (say in the 90s percentiles) of people simply don’t have what it takes to be a competent and proficient programmer.Sure, many people can learn a programming language but that does not mean they can become a successful high quality programmer.That does not make them less than those who have the talents and abilities needed for programming, it simply means they are cutout to be a programmer.They probably can excel at some other job.The quality of software has declined because the average programmer’s proficient have declined - actually, they haven’t declined, for most wannabee programmers, they never had the ability to write quality software.I have long tried (say for 35 years) to come up with an analogy that explains, to someone not involved in programming, how learning a programming language does not make them a programmer. Here is is:A few years ago I hit on one that I think (hope?) gets the idea across:There is an American, a Russian, and a Frenchman (or women) who want to be the next world class, top selling, mystery novelist.They are all proficient in their native languages (English, Russian, and French) but that does not making them a writer, world class or not.They must learn to write, even people who are born to write successful novels has to learn some of the things needed to turn out good work.Learning a programming language (or learning some minimum amount of it) does not make someone a programmer.Programming languages are just like tools for a carpenter. Owning a power tool or two does not make you a carpenter. You can learn to drive nails with exquisite grace but that does not equip you to build a house.I think I can teach just about anyone a language such as JavaScript and get them to the point were they could write a small, simple program, say the old standard “Hello World” but that is perhaps only 10% of what they need to known and understand before they can become a proficient programmer.When I find that I need to learn a new language, I find a good language reference and jump into it. I don’t limit myself to what I need right then, I always work at it to master a new language. Learning a programming language is easy - for someone who has what is required to become a competent programmer.I could also teach just about anyone how to properly drive a nail with a hammer but I would not then turn them loose on an actual carpenter project.There is a huge need of proficient and competent programmers and there are not sufficient people to fill the slots because programming is hard - it is not something you do with little effort and it requires talents and skills that most people simply do not possess.As a result, less than competent “programmers” are writing the software that is needed and, well, things are not going well and they are only getting worse.","44,326 followers",Kurt Guntheroth,967,13.7K,167.4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-most-illegal-thing-you-have-ever-done-on-a-computer

How many different software titles did Best Buy or Staples carry? Hundreds maybe?Actually, it was probably less than that because you’d get a lot of variations of major software packages like Office, Quick Books, and TurboTax (especially in the spring). Otherwise, outside of computer games, there wasn’t a lot of variety.Now, a couple decades later we’ve gone from hundreds of easily available software packages to millions of easily available software packages.Two things happened - digital software distribution and billions of mobile phone computers creating a tsunami of demand for software.That’s great, but that also means millions of relatively new programmers joining the field. Again, it’s not a bad thing but they really haven’t had much time to hone their craft and learn the hard lessons some of us have been learning since the 90’s.In short, if there used to be like a few million programmers worldwide, and now there are 20–40 million programmers worldwide, that’s maybe a 10x jump in the number of programmers, but the percentage of “good” ones is going to decline until the new batch of programmers gets experience.Overall this is a good thing for everyone involved. It just looks like a drop in skill level of the profession. It’s really more of a drop in average experience in the field because the field of coding is growing too fast.Eventually, growth will slow and the average experience level will creep upwards again. Also, a lot of people will sort of fall out of love with programming and go do something else.In a lot of ways, it’s useful to look at the current growth in coding as a kind of modern gold rush. The news talks about software jobs being the best paying, most in-demand jobs out there. So, everyone goes out to get their digital pickaxes, and start digging for gold (err I mean code).Sadly, not everyone will strike it rich and many will go home disappointed. However, those who stick it out will find that it’s actually a lot more fun once everything shakes out and the focus goes back to building software, not just chasing the trendy career path.Those of us who were around and building software before it was cool and part of the big STEM push will likely still be here when the noise dies down.
