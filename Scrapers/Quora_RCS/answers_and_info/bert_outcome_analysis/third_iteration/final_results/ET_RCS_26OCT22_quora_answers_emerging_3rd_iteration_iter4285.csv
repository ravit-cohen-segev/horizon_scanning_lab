1,Of course yes infact today we are using this high speed network due to fibre optics which is invented by an indian. USB was also invented by an indian. There are many such invention in ancient India. When all the peoples on the world were wearing animals skin. Indian was wearing clothes made up of cotton and wool.

Many said that he was a hustler in business who used to believe that everyone had a price. I believe - he is a symbol of what a regular Indian can achieve, armed just with determination.He broke cartels - challenged monopolies, questioned norms and made a fortune in the process. He inspired millions - showing the world that dreams do come true.Those images you saw earlier, were taken from the Shareholder’s Annual General Meeting or AGM of Reliance Industries Limited - The company he founded.Dhirubhai Ambani, an Indian revolutionary in his own right, breathed his last on 6th July 2002. He was 69 years old.While his parents named him Dhiraj - which means patience - he within his lifetime became a symbol of the Impatient India - ready to take on the world - unhinged, unabashed. When he died - his friends, his foes, his supporters and his detractors - every life he touched, came on the streets - the city that never sleeps, stopped - everyone was in attendance, to show their respect for a man who pursued his dreams.Thank you for reading.

The concept of zero and its integration into the place-value system also enabled one to write numbers, no matter how large, by using only ten symbols.2. The Decimal SystemIndia gave the ingenious method of expressing all numbers by means of ten symbols – the decimal system. In this system, each symbol received a value of position as well as an absolute value. Due to the simplicity of the decimal notation, which facilitated calculation, this system made the uses of arithmetic in practical inventions much faster and easier.3. Numeral NotationsIndians, as early as 500 BC, had devised a system of different symbols for every number from one to nine. This notation system was adopted by the Arabs who called it the4.

The ancient Persians had also attempted to reduce zinc oxide in an open furnace but had failed. Zawar in the Tiri valley of Rajasthan is the world’s first known ancient zinc smelting site. The distillation technique of zinc production goes back to the 12th Century AD and is an important contribution of India to the world of science.12. Seamless Metal GlobeConsidered one of the most remarkable feats in metallurgy, the first seamless celestial globe was made in Kashmir by Ali Kashmiri ibn Luqman in the reign of the Emperor Akbar. In a major feat in metallurgy, Mughal metallurgists pioneered the method of lost-wax casting to make twenty other globe masterpieces in the reign of the Mughal Empire. Before these globes were rediscovered in the 1980s, modern metallurgists believed that it was technically impossible to produce metal globes without any seams, even with modern technology.13.

He crafted long iron tubes, filled them with gunpowder and fastened them to bamboo poles to create the predecessor of the modern rocket. With a range of about 2 km, these rockets were the best in the world at that time and caused as much fear and confusion as damage. Due to them, the British suffered one of their worst ever defeats in India at the hands of Tipu.Thanks…………",193 followers,Nikhil Jindal,10.7K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/Can-an-Indian-really-bring-revolutionary-change-in-the-field-of-technology

That is one tiny example of how India is changing.At a time when we are moving everything from education to healthcare to governance to entertainment, shopping and security online, the data availability is a key element to a nation’s success. It was impossible to think even 5 years ago that India would get ahead of the US in this! India’s mobile data usage is among the highest in the world!When I left India in 2004, we were talking of a teledensity [number of phones/people] in single digits. Not only everyone has a phone now, but the smartphone penetration is getting universal by 2020.About 12 years ago, my grad school friends and I were spending an evening doing some tech predictions for India. When will Google Maps come to India? Given the complexity of Indian roads, maybe 2040. How about ubiquitous wifi hotspots? Maybe 2030. How about the ability to seamlessly rent cars? When will an equivalent of social security number to connect all accounts? Maybe 2050.Our predictions were remarkably off. By 2016, Indians were massively using Ola/Uber powered by Google Maps. It was the default option to get anywhere. In no time India has brought the entire country in Aadhar ecosystem and drastically simplified many things. Recently I lost my mobile phone. I just walked into a nearby Airtel store, gave my thumbprint for Aadhar authentication, and got the sim card deactivated and new sim card activated in less than 2 minutes.Urban Indians are seamlessly shopping online and increasingly trying out new technologies. Technology gap between the US and India has reduced remarkably.Ten years ago, I visited India to meet my family and the US, to get technology. Now, the situation is getting reversed.When I left India for the first time in 2004, our airports sucked and the US airports like JFK, LAX and Logan looked way better. Now, our airports in Bangalore, Mumbai and Delhi are remarkably more convenient than the ones in the US and Europe.Our highway networks were horrible at the start of this century. Now, I can zip across the countryside in the new highways at speeds comparable to US interstates. And to do that I can rent a car from Zoomcar or equivalent in a far more seamless way than I do in the US with Avis or Hertz.Sure, our cities like Bangalore have horrible traffic and freak the hell out of visitors. But, that will improve too.Our cities are all getting Metros and if you are connected to the metro [such as in Delhi], the commute is much more convenient than the BART in SF and T in Boston and the coverage is rapidly growing and in about 5 years I expect to see viable metro rail connections in all major cities of India.The middle class homes in India have amenities pretty much the same as the middle class homes in the US. I find the difference getting less and less.Sure, some of the basic facilities are still weak. But, they are improving too.Electricity is still a problem, but we are slowly solving that.Domestic fuel is still a problem, but we have been rapidly converting homes to LPG.Rural India is changing too and getting students to schools.A generation ago we were ripped apart by terrorism and violence. We would hear of bomb blasts or cities under siege. Those have fallen dramatically.And we are trying some bold new ideas.And we are jumping directly to renewable energy in a big way.We have a long way to go and enormous problems to solve in education, employment, water, gender equality and clean air. Our generation has a unique opportunity to get these solved and turn a developing nation into a developed nation. The question is do you want to sit in an already developed nation (that is fact in decline) and leave no legacy behind, or get your hands at solving real problems and leave behind a real legacy. The question is do you have the man [or woman] in you to face the real problems or just spend all your energy escaping it and live a life of anonymity.Will India get developed by the time I die?

As a result, let’s just say 1/10th of the Earth’s population managed to make it off. That’s still 1.5 billion people. Even a 1% emigration rate would be 150 million people, just to get it all started. Let’s assume they started with 300 million, conservatively, by the time Mars gets more or less self-sustaining (probably 20–30 years with fusion drives cutting the travel time down to a couple weeks or months).Assuming a 3% population growth rate, which isn’t impossible for an expanding colony, that population doubles every 17.5 years. Exponentially.With a starting population of 300 million at 3%, it takes justSo, it’s not unreasonable for a colony starting with a few million to a few hundred million, only a fraction of the Earth’s projected population at the time of the colonization of Mars inThere’s also the matter of continued emigration from Earth to Mars. With the invention of the Epstein drive cutting travel time to a matter of days to weeks depending on orbits, it’s perfectly reasonable that Earth residents would continue to leave and head to Mars, even after it declared independence.It’s never directly stated when Mars was colonized inSolomon Epstein had his historic flight about 150 years before the events on theAssuming that references the very first colonists on Mars, and assuming that’s 2050, that sets the show probably no earlier than 2250, and more likely closer to 2300–2350.Assuming conservatively that humanity got to Mars by 2050, invented a workable fusion drive by 2100, and had enough of an exodus to bring the population of Mars to even just 100 million by 2150, 100-200 years is at least plausible at 3% growth to get the population to 9 billion even without additional emigration from Earth to Mars, and certainly well within the realm of possible with it.Technological AchievementSome of this is luck, some of it circumstance, and some of it dedication.First, circumstantially, Mars could just afford to dump more of its GDP into R&D.The Earth inThere are not enough opportunities for everyone to work or get educated. People have to work several years to prove themselves worth being given an education and have actual currency. Most live on “basic assistance,” or a bare minimum safety net. Many live between the cracks entirely. A 20 acre farm in Montana is considered an extravagant piece of private property only affordable by the tax break for eight people to have only one child.Mars may be smaller, but it can afford to put aEarth had the advantage in numbers simply by virtue of having a headstart, but Mars had a population with purpose. Rather than pouring resources into keeping the bulk of an unproductive population alive, Mars could expect every citizen to achieve, either working for the terraforming project or for collateral projects supporting it. It was essentially an entire economy dumping their GDP into R&D.There’s also technological inertia. This is why China was much faster to get to 4 and 5G cellular internet and a cashless economy. The western world had spent the latter half of the 20th century well ahead of the curve, but it had established frameworks that profited various entities that required a return. Implementing the latest and greatest immediately might cut short the time needed to get that return. China and India, by virtue of having no investment into that framework, could immediately jump ahead and adopt next-gen technologies without worrying about the return delay. China and India are both expanding rapidly, and need to add infrastructure, rather than just maintain existing infrastructure.Earth had the same problem as opposed to Mars. Mars had to stay on the bleeding edge to keep the colony moving forward and expanding, where Earth was busy maintaining what infrastructure it had, including military.That’s why the U.N.N. is flying around in old last-gen rustbucket spaceframes that have been retrofitted with some upgrades over the years while Mars is constantly building new. You can’t just stick aWhen Earth decided those achievements were worth seizing, Mars was thinking about declaring independence. The backstory says they probably would have gotten their asses kicked because of sheer numbers and rough parity of technology.Then there’s the luck.Mars got lucky when Epstein comes along to kick over the table with his drive. Earth is stuck with old-school fusion torches and Mars suddenly can leave them in the dust. Mars can access the outer solar system and more resources. Earth has no chance at that; their drives are just too slow. Mars suddenly had a modern automobile while Earth was stuck with a horse and cart.Then there’s the dedication.Mars would always be skeptical that Earth might try to invade again, and so whatever resources weren’t being poured into R&D for the terraforming project were being put into defense to prevent Earth from ever getting ahead enough to take over. Several Martian characters remark about how the constant threat of war with Earth was setting behind the terraforming project by diverting resources away from it.This is a culture that is extremely dedicated. They areEarth just doesn’t have that. Wealth inequality is crazy. There’s no unifying cultural mission. The bulk of its population is non-contributing,Ultimately, Mars is able to achieve more because of that dedication to a narrow set of focused, collective, cultural purposes, circumstances that lead to citizen opportunities for participation and extremely low non-productivity, and at least one really lucky breakthrough at just the right moment.",3 followers,Steve Baker,5.3K,27.4K,163.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Can-an-Indian-really-bring-revolutionary-change-in-the-field-of-technology

After the war, it was simply abandoned.In 1967, a guy named Paddy Bates moved himself and his family onto Roughs Tower (which is fine because it’s abandoned and in international waters) - and in 1975, declared the island “The Principality of SeaLand” with himself as the ruler.He made a pretty flag, added the motto “E Mare Libertas”, composed a national anthem…etc.He printed passports, money, stamps, etc - and made a small income from selling them.

That the Americans were able to use superior leadership, George Washington, guerrilla tactics and strategy to beat the better supplied British troops who just walked into the open without strategy and got mowed down by rifle fire from the trees in the distance.There is so much wrong with this. The Americans did not win the war. At least not the way many people think. They did not constantly outfight the British using better strategy and guerrilla warfare. All of the major American victories were fought in the conventional style of battle at that time. Yorktown, Cowpens, Trenton, and more. King’s Mountain and parts of Saratoga are some of the few arguably won by guerrilla manners. Next is that the British were not the greatest military in the world. They had the greatest navy.Their navy had won many victories in wars throughout the century. The British army was formidable. But it wasn’t the best. It was in the top 10–5 best armies, but the best actualor the Prussians.The British army was on the winning side of many wars. The Seven Years War comes to mind. However, it was won with a lot of strategy on William Pitt’s part, naval superiority as well as expansion into other countries, such as in India. So the Americans were not fightingSiege of Savannah (the British capture and defend the city against the Americans and French.)Battle of Camden (an outnumbered British force destroys an American force under Horatio Gates.)Battle of the Saintes (even though not important overall being after Yorktown, still worth noting seeing how heavily the French navy was beaten, Admiral De Grasse being captured.)The war has been taught the wrong way. The American victories were won in conventional-style warfare. Guerrilla warfare is never enough to win a war alone. It was a behind the scenes success that largely was only effective on the frontier. In fact, the British were more experienced and arguably more skilled in guerrilla style warfare, as were many of their Native American allies.Above is Robert Rogers: EvenEdit:But the Americans were not overly better than the British. British leadership was inconsistent. The generals were able to win many battles but failed to completely destroy the Americans. But they were able to constantly outmaneuver them. In fact, George Washington lost more battles than he won. It was his ability to keep the Americans alive that helped them win. It was also thanks to Nathaniel Greene outlasting the British in the south. The British generals were successful in the short term ideals. Such as William Howe, who defeated the Americans in New York and in Philadelphia, but failed to completely destroy the rebels, even when he had the chance to at Long Island. The Americans constantly lost in the short run, but their ability to live to fight another day kept them holding out until the French and Spanish became involved. After this, people like Baron Von Steuben trained and drilled American troops into a more professional fighting force. Then you have the fact that British troops were being sent to fight a war 3,000 miles away, meaning that British morale was likely pretty low.I would also like to mention the deciding battles before Yorktown, namely the southern campaign. With the fight reaching a stalemate in 1778, the British struck south, capturing Savannah, shifting the theater. They held Savannah and beat the Americans at Camden and Charlestown, which were terrible losses for the revolution.The thing is, despite all this success, this caused the Americans to shift tactics. Nathaniel Green became general of American forces in the south. He focused on outstretching the British, forcing them into a wild goose chase and weakening their supply lines. This split up the British, and led to General Morgan beating Tarleton Banastre at the Battle of Cowpens. Guilford Courthouse, however, despite being a British victory, cost their already small force high casualties. This put Cornwallis in a bad position. So he retreated to Yorktown to await aid from Henry Clinton. This help did not come, and led to the Americans and the French trapping them in the siege of Yorktown. Francis Marion was a large help in the south as well, harrassing British supply lines and more with his guerrilla tactics (I did say guerrilla tactics are overstated, but while they can’t win a war, they can help support and effort in a certain theater). Lastly is Pensacola. Galvez and his Spanish forces captured Pensacola, threatening British Jamaica and sugar colonies, and forcing their navy to take up defensive positions, keeping a British fleet that could have likely stopped the French navy at the Chesapeake Bay from attacking. So, overall the deciding factors were:The war was won by help from France and Spain. It really was just outlasting the British. Because the British could have kept fighting after Yorktown. They showed this with the Battle of the Saintes. They had the capability to try and capture or recapture major cities and hold off America’s allies, but they realized that it wasn’t worth it, abandoning the effort similar to what happened in the Vietnam war. So can we truly consider it an American victory? Not really. It was just the French and Spanish gaining the upper hand for the Americans.The American Revolution was complicated, but is often oversimplified by biased textbooks, authors and teachers. This book is one of the worst offenders.This whole book was propaganda, from trying and failing to debunk racism, overemphasizing the ‘heroics’ of people like George Washington to Americans being great heroes and the British like…storm troopers.The winners write the history books, so don’t trust everything your friendly neighborhood textbook says.Peace!EDIT: Since history is controversial, I’ve had comments disagreeing with me. Rude comments and replies to them have been deleted, but some pointed out my hidden message towards Trump. I dislike Trump, but that is my personal opinion. If you disagree, this answer is talking about an important aspect of history, not about Trump and starting an argument over it is not needed. Nevertheless I have gotten rid of it. I have added in a point or two some people have wanted me to add.EDIT #2: Okay, a second edit! I never thought I would have to do this! With many views and upvotes and supporting comments comes disagreement. Some have said my article seems to be bashing the American’s effort, while I then suddenly admit that people like Francis Marion and Nathaniel Greene helped win a theater despite debunking similar tactics earlier. Francis Marion and Nathaniel Greene had effects on the Southern Theater that would help the Americans win, yes, but me admitting that does not mean my other points are invalid. Even with the effects from those two in the south, all that I said about British logistical problems remains and was present. This whole article was mostly just getting rid of the idea that American won through ‘X,’ and more that ‘Z’ (logistical problems and all mentioned) was hampering the British, and that if I remove the those qualifiers, America won, and that I am downplaying American tactics. Yet the evidence I provided still helps support my opinion that it was logistical disadvantages on the part of the British that forced them to leave the conflict. Even with all of the American tactics I am supposedly bashing, if those problems had not been there, America likely would have ‘lost.’Sorry that this response was long. I had a lot to try and cover with all this. It’s hard to write about so much and make sure my points stay solid and consistent. I stand by my conclusions, and future rude comments will be deleted.

They were not used on the battlefield except by skirmishers, or what we now call snipers. The reason is that a musket can get off several times the rate of fire at the same range: the increased range later given by the Minie Ball allowed effectively enough time to send bullets down range to effectively have the same RoF as a musket (I.E. the same number of bullets were in the air) which is why rifles were in general issue in the Civil War.All of this pedantic bother is summed up in the statement that the two sides were equal in technology. Where the rebels prevailed was in geography. Once their government extended it’s dominance, it could not be gotten back.
