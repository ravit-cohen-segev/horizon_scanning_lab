0,"I'm a nanodegree graduate, and my advice would be to not rely on the qualification to stand on its own.Instead, take the opportunity to build a portfolio of work off the back of the course. Get your projects on GitHub, with clear ReadMe files explaining what your projects do and why they matter. Then, when you get to interview, be prepared to explain/sell the nanodegree and your work to whoever is interviewing you. It's this portfolio of projects that is valuable, in my opinion, much more than the certificate you get at the end.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,2.4K,996,155.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Do-top-technology-companies-consider-Udacity-s-nanodegree-like-they-consider-a-master-s-degree
1,"No it will not help a graduate application.  No one cares about Mensa, except to the degree that it indicates that someone enjoys being part of a club that believes in a notion of IQ or monolithic intelligence.  People who believe in IQ generally haven't thought deeply about what success in academics actually entails.Update:Rorschachtest on intelligence anNo it will not help a graduate application.  No one cares about Mensa, except to the degree that it indicates that someone enjoys being part of a club that believes in a notion of IQ or monolithic intelligence.  People who believe in IQ generally haven't thought deeply about what success in academics actually entails.Update:Rorschachtest on intelligence and IQ, I'll expound on it.I'm not denying that intelligence exists. It just simply isn't a single number that is an immutable fact about a person.It's a lot like trying to define an Athleticism Quotient and evaluate professional athletic candidates with you.  You take running a 5k, bench press, swimming, biking, javelin throw and triple jump and then combine these result into a single number and then evaluate all sports with this AQ.  You'll find that there is a distribution in the population at large and that athletes score much higher on this than schlubs like me on the street.  You'll notice children who score higher on it will do better as adults.  However, if you want to say that this is an immutable number or that you can't train yourself to raise this number substantially, it'd be a ridiculous proposition.  You'd also laugh if you expected Soccer/Football players, Swimmers, American Football players, Hockey players to be evaluated with the same number and that being 4 sigma high in this number is meaningful compared to being 3 sigma high.  Most importantly, if you looked at the people in the Halls of Fame in these sports, there'd be a lot of players with relatively normal AQs.IQ is nearly identical.  It measures something.  Repeatedly measuring it and training for it will improve your score substantially. You need specialized skills to make contributions in academics not generalized skills, though obviously if you're good across the board, then you're more likely to be good at a single subject.  However, if you're average, or even below average, it doesn't mean that you can't be freakishly good at a specific discipline and make amazing contributions.You'd laugh pretty hard if an MLB pitcher cared about his fictitious AQ over his ERA.  We've all seen players who have a freakishly high velocity for their fastball (an even more refined version of a measure of ability), but can't pitch in the Big Leagues.  A lot of 100mph rookie pitchers are really nonplussed by R.A. Dickey, but R.A. Dickey is the one with a Cy Young award and a 13 season career.People are free to measure things and make bell curves and find correlations with success and try to refine the number or define multiple quantities to measure different types of specialties. It's fine, it's just so meta-important.  You can simply look to see someone's past achievements in what they want to do.If you meet a bunch of Nobel prize winners, you'll notice, yeah some of them are really amazingly ""smart"" and then a lot of them are just ""average,"" but they made big contributions in spite of their horrible ""handicap"". ...","2,697 followers",Grammarly,933,0,0,2013,https://www.quora.com/Do-top-technology-companies-consider-Udacity-s-nanodegree-like-they-consider-a-master-s-degree

Our team at Grammarly has compiled a handy list of common grammatical errors to help make your writing accurate, clear, and professional.Ambiguous (“Squinting”) modifiersA squinting modifier is a misplaced modifier that, because of its location in a sentence, could modify either the phrase that precedes it or the one that follows it.

Our team at Grammarly has compiled a handy list of common grammatical errors to help make your writing accurate, clear, and professional.Ambiguous (“Squinting”) modifiersA squinting modifier is a misplaced modifier that, because of its location in a sentence, could modify either the phrase that precedes it or the one that follows it. In the example sentence, is the subject listening to music slowly or slowly getting a headache? To correct a squinting modifier, move its position in the sentence to clarify to the reader which word you intend to modify.Misuse of lie/layIf you plan to place or put an object somewhere, such as a plate on a table, you should use “lay.” If you intend to stretch out on a bed for a nap, you should use “lie.” The verb “lie” is an intransitive verb, which means it does not need an object. The transitive verb “lay” requires an object.It may take some getting used to this “lay” or “lie” business; after all, misuse of these verbs is common. But if you remember to lay down your fork before you’re full, then you won’t have to lie down later from overeating.Comma splicesHe was very hungry, so he ate a whole pizza.To splice means to connect or join. When a writer joins two independent sentences with a comma instead of separating them with a period or coordinating conjunction, that’s a comma splice.The comma has its jobs to do, but connecting two independent sentences isn’t one of them. Besides, the period gets testy when his sister, the comma, steals his thunder. Periods have their jobs, and so do commas, but never the twain shall meet—unless it’s in the form of a semicolon. Semicolons can also take the place of a coordinating conjunction, such as “and,” “but,” or “so,” among others.Run-on sentencesRun-on sentences, also known as fused sentences, occur when two complete sentences are squashed together without using a coordinating conjunction or proper punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon. Run-on sentences can be short or long. A long sentence isn’t necessarily a run-on sentence.To avoid run-on sentences, see if there is more than one idea communicated by two or more independent clauses. In our examples, there are two complete sentences:Example:Example:Both sentences are complete ideas by themselves; therefore, use a semicolon or a period to indicate that they are separate independent clauses.Using “could of” instead of “could have”“Could have” is always correct; “could of” never is. Writers probably make this grammar gaffe because, when we speak, the contraction “could’ve” sounds an awful lot like “could of.”TautologiesTautologies express the same thing twice with different words. In our example, the word “made” implies that Jack used his own two hands to create the pail. The prepositional phrase “with his own hands” creates a redundancy. Once you know what they are, it’s fun to discover tautologies: dilapidated ruins, close proximity, added bonus, large crowd...The list goes on and on!After reading through this list of common grammatical mistakes, you might be wondering how to remember all these rules as you write.
