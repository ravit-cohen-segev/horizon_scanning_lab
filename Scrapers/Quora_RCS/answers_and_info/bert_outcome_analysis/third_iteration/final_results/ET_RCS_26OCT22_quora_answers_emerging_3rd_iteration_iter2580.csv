But I assure you this would encounter enormous opposition even though most states aren’t that different from each other in terms of their standards. So there is nothing to overhaul and you can’t create it because of politics about the jurisdiction of the Federal government.2. In spite of the above, there have been numerous federal education programs. It’s not even accurate to say that that there hasn’t been an overhaul. It isn’t even accurate to say it’s rarely overhauled. There are constantly changes in educational models, programming, and spending, at local, state, and federal levels. There’s an excellent case that the more significant problem is that the major changes are too frequent. Since 2000 we have had:That’s just since 2000 and just the ones I can remember at the Federal level!3. Even though we are constantly making changes, academic objectives have been somewhat (though not completely) static. We still have a lot of the same academic goals today that we had a generation ago. We use computers and technological aids to help us with instruction and evaluation. But math, science, English, history, and arts are relatively the same. Partly, this is because the fundamentals of these subjects haven’t changed. Another part is that college entrance stadards have homogonized and college enrollment has dramatically increased. A generation ago, there was something called vocational education in public schools. This has basically been replaced with near universal college prep. So academically focused education has become the standard. The reason: Parents. Parents like academic goals. Parents like the idea of their kids being prepared for college. Parents don’t think preparing their children to work in trades is exciting or promising. Parents could vote for local or state officials to offer different curricula. All they would have to sacrifice is some of their college admission opportunity. Good luck getting them to make that trade.","68,794 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,2K,17.3K,413.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-hasnt-the-education-system-in-the-U-S-undergone-a-complete-overhaul-in-the-face-of-changing-times-and-advanced-technology

We showed how radio, TV, and satellites would allow nations to bypass the labor-intensive approach to education entrenched in more developed countries. India had already completed a year-long demonstration using a direct-broadcast satellite to reach community televisions in 2,500 villages.The entire educational enterprise in nearly every country is constrained by laws, regulations, licensing, accreditation, and an entrenched labor force. Add to this that practices are passed on from generation to generation, and reform can only make minor adjustments to the people, curricula, buildings, and organizations.The technologies of the past century — audio recording, radio, TV, video recording, computers, the internet were largely ignored for decades and then slowly absorbed in ways that support the established system when they might have revolutionized learning.

It appears it still is, with over 1 million students. I later moved to South Orange, New Jersey. They have a joint school district with the next town over, Maplewood. They have less than 7500 students across all grade levels. I now live in Loudoun County, Virginia. We have about 85,000 students. Each of these districts is dealing with budget shortfalls, children in widely differing socioeconomic situations. Loudoun is, by many counts, the wealthiest county in the country. Yet 8% of our students do not have access to high-speed internet at home. That’s not just a matter of cost. The rural parts of the county simply do not have cables (TV or internet) strung to the homes, and they are not dense enough to warrant cellular towers.Some districts are able to “undergo a complete overhaul in the face of changing times and advanced technology.” Those school districts tend to be uniformly upper middle class or wealthy.

Teachers would prepare worksheets by typing or writing on stencils through which the mimeograph pushed pale, blue ink through to produce duplicates. Then most of the class would work on the worksheets while the teacher pulled out some students for small group instruction.And instead of writing on boards, teachers used multimedia projectors. In my day, they used film strips or 16mm film projectors instead of digital video.Now teachers assign work on a computerized application while they pull out small groups. After ten minutes or so, the small group returns to their computer application and teachers pull out another small group.The more things change, the more they stay the same (Les Guêpes, July 1848).",0 followers,Ted Kord,1.5K,1.2K,11.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-hasnt-the-education-system-in-the-U-S-undergone-a-complete-overhaul-in-the-face-of-changing-times-and-advanced-technology

Then you find the totient function (don’t even ask) which is t(n)=(x-1)(y-1).With it? Good. This is where I drop to sleep but the next thing you do is select an integer e that is co-prime to t(n) and 1<e<t(n). The pair n and e make up a public key.Then you find d. Look, I didn’t invent it, alright? The d is from ed=1 mod t(n).Sigh. The values of n and d make up the private key.You then let everybody know the public key but not the private. Encryption between Cyphertext and Plaintext is C=P^e mod n. Decryption is P=C^d mod n.Simples.

It’d probably be shame on me too, but my sense of shame and I have not spoken since 1973 and so it isn’t, not at all.But back to the topic (as the actress said to the Bishop). The whole secret squirrel thing depends on boxes of transistors doing maths fast. If you’ve got a box of quantum doo-dads that can do maths zillions of times faster, you’ve got something that can break RSA in a reasonable time.So it’s just as well then that quantum computers are currently bloody useless for nearly everything. Because they need certain conditions, they look as though they’re going to stay nearly useless for nearly everything, but there’s always the remote possibility that some speccy twat in a university computer science lab will have a rush of blood to the head one day and say to somebody who knows how to make things “what if we could…….” and then shall come the end of days.

We talk about polarizing filters as being like a “picket fence” kind of filter that only allows, for example, “vertically” polarized light through, and filters all “horizontally” polarized light (assuming our filter is oriented vertically).When a photon (a single “chunk” of light) first enters the filter it is not polarized, it’s actually in a superposition of “horizontal” and “vertical” orientations — but if it passes through the vertical filter than it has then been “measured” and is nowHowever, if after passing through a vertically oriented filter we then send it through another filter that’s been rotated 45 degrees, so that instead of vertical/horizontal axes we now have diagonal axes (NW-SE and NE-SW), then we’ve changed our “basis” of measurement, and in that new basis the photon which was 100% vertically polarized is now a combination of 50% NW-SE oriented and 50% NE-SW oriented. So it now has a 50/50 shot at passing through the diagonal filter.So if you send a photon into a vertical filter and then into a series of filters that are rotated a few degrees each, you can get the photon to go through a horizontally oriented filter, because it has a high probability of passing through each successively rotated filter, which is essentially measuring it in a new basis, and since the rotation is only a little bit, the probability that the photon “collapses” into the new basis is high.So that’s superposition.With these two phenomena we’re able to do some things that we can’t do with traditional electronics components.You’ll often see popular explanations of quantum computing describe “trying all possible solutions at once” or working in parallel, that kind of thing, that’s only partially true. Superposition does allow qubits (quantum bits) to “represent all numbers at once” in a way, but when we go to look at (measure) those qubits theySo far there are only a few problems where we know how to use this for a big improvement, mostly for breaking certain methods of encryption, like RSA and discrete logarithm, both of which can be broken with the quantum discrete Fourier transform. (The other exciting possibility is simulating quantum mechanical systems, which normally requires tracking a lot more numbers than a classical computer can feasibly store, but in a QC might be simulated more practically, which could greatly benefit chemistry and medicine, especially genetics, with protein folding, and possibly with simulating novel drug compounds and understanding how all that stuff physically operates and interacts.)I’ve written some answers about how QCs can be useful in the following questions:What drastic changes will the advent of quantum computing bring in the common people's lives?What is a quantum computer used for?","9,064 followers",Allan Steinhardt,655,2.3K,5.2M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Why-hasnt-the-education-system-in-the-U-S-undergone-a-complete-overhaul-in-the-face-of-changing-times-and-advanced-technology

18,"AI and VR have nothing notable in common. I believe you might mean AI and VI? At which point the answer would be AI.The main issue is that AI and VR are not really comparable due to their vastly different ways of functioning. One the one hand, AI would be more advanced if you mean a full blown self-aware robot. On the other hand, if you mean VR as in an entire virtual reality rather than a VR gaming device, or similar, then VR would be more advanced.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Why-hasnt-the-education-system-in-the-U-S-undergone-a-complete-overhaul-in-the-face-of-changing-times-and-advanced-technology

20,"Quantum computers with enough qubits could very effectively assist neural network training. Neural network training is a high dimensional optimization problem: You try to find the model parameters that maximize the objective function of your data. Standard methods for finding model parameters that give a high objective function value include gradient ascent and its variants. With the pseudo-parallelism effects of quantum computing, we could speed up the optimization process, and potentially train models that are currently untrainable due to optimization issues.One hint that quantum computing wQuantum computers with enough qubits could very effectively assist neural network training.
