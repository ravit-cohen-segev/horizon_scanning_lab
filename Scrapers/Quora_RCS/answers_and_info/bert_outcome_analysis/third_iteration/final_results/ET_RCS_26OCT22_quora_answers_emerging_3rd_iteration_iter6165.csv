I went on a visit to China last year.

No pollution, clean streets, no beggars/homeless, wide variety of independent shops and food outlets, moderate traffic, !!electric motorcycles!!, well run places to stay, delicious food (so much better than UK ‘Chinese takeaway), very little sexualisation of women (either clothes or depiction in adverts), everyone with a 15cm smartphone, great internet access, people hiring bikes with an app on their phone.Where shall I stop?Once the truth starts to filter to the general population, respect will grow.Of course there will be resistance. We in the West cannot bear the idea that our version of ‘democracy’ is not the best for everyone. It will take us a while to understand the role of the Chinese Communist party and the benefits of a system like that.Addition 1: We are told that China suppresses religion - but in Dali there is a three-sources temple in the town - Confucius, Tao, Buddha - and the Confucius Centre in the centre has been completely rebuilt in the last few years. On the outskirts there is the Guan Yin temple. Ordinary folk out shopping come in all the time to say a prayer etc. I sensed their genuinely spiritual experience.Addition 2: I also realised why China was advancing so fast - they work steadily! Wherever I looked people seemed to be just ‘getting on with it’. I sensed this was a deep habit, centuries old in the population.Addition 3: Dancing in the park! Amazing. Just a group of people with a music-system doing musical Tai Chi. Another small group playing instruments in the park. So unselfconscious. Just enjoying themselves.Update 2020: My prediction is probably now wrong. A dark cloud has descended over China/West relations. There is a growing China-phobia in the UK. People with no knowledge of China, who, when I wrote this post 2 years ago, would have little to say about China, now are experts making cold-war-like statements.I responded recently to a very good article by a Harvard professor warning against a new cold-war with China. I was immediately vilified by comment writers (as was the author), accusing me of being a Chinese troll, or perhaps the author of the article. Very disturbing.The main driving force for this is that western commentators blame China for their COVID19 deaths because of the delay in reporting in Dec 2019. The very slow and inadequate responses by the UK, US and now Brazil and all the consequent deaths are blamed in China, not on the inadequate response.China is not perfect, but the inaccurate picture I reported 2 years ago has been transformed into something more dangerous.",0 followers,Mike Bell,4.7K,122,274.3K,2020,https://www.quora.com/AI-is-the-essential-technology-for-the-emerging-completion-between-China-and-the-West-Aren-t-the-Western-big-tech-firms-the-only-hope-for-maintaining-parity-with-China

The Chines high-speed trains that nobody can get off the ground in the USA…The new driverless subway systems will blow your mind. They arrive on schedule and stop EXACTLY where the lines on the platforms are.Buses are steered by GPS systems on narrow lanes. the driver seems to be there only to make sure that the doors are properly operated.And, of course, you “never pay”, most payments are “touch and go”.Traffic may look terrible, and it is, but that is because there are, as in Japan a few years ago, more cars than city streets.The traffic flow, traffic lights, are computer controlled with AI evaluating the traffic flow and cycling the lights for maximum throughput. Something that has been talked about in the USA for 50 years, and is still not widely implemented.I can go on, but will only say.Even visiting the USA, coming from Europe or Canada, you realize that there is something seriously wrong with your implementation of modern technology.You still give out bank cards WITHOUT chip technology, something that has been full and complete standards in Europe and Canada for over 20 years.","10,928 followers",Bengt Lindvall,800,22.4K,38.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/AI-is-the-essential-technology-for-the-emerging-completion-between-China-and-the-West-Aren-t-the-Western-big-tech-firms-the-only-hope-for-maintaining-parity-with-China

I’ve answered for both:Why western expats don’t like China:Lots of westerners like China. Some love it.I’ve been here for over 30 years.

But it’s home, anyway.”But yes, some westerners dislike China, and there can be a number of reasons for it:Why don’t Western people like China?I’m not sure if you’re asking about westerners living in China, or westerners living in their home countries.

In addition, there are some more objective reasons, such as air pollution and food safety, which can be troublesome.These feelings are sometimes amplified by what I call the “China sucks” feedback loop.In order to relieve the stresses outlined above, some westerners like to sit around in expat bars complaining about China and the Chinese. Their WeChat groups feeds are full of media that validate the “China sucks” narrative; videos, photos, stories, and memes featuring Chinese people driving badly, being rude tourists, assaulting or cheating foreigners, littering, spitting, etc. Also there are stories of Chinese cops or other officials harassing expats.Anyway, if you find a group of successful and mature westerners in China, they are unlikely to dislike the place. Westerners who really dislike the place are very often people who are having issues in some aspect of their lives, and whose anti-China views are constantly being validated and re-validated.Westerners living in their home countries.Now, if you are talking about westerners in their home countries who somehow dislike China, that’s a different story. This is likely due to the constant stream of disinformation about China and its activities. You have to understand that China’s economic and military ascension is a scary thing. For the past 100 (?) years the western counties have ruled the world economy— that looks like it’s come to an end. It’s hard to adjust.Take just one example: the South China Sea “dispute”. If you look at it from a Chinese perspective, it’s perfectly natural that China should carve out it’s own portion of the SCS. Everyone else has been doing it for decades and no one complained. In addition, look at how many US military installations are arrayed along China’s coast, between Taiwan and Vladivostok. And with the US and Vietnam getting more friendly with one another, it makes sense that China should reserve it’s own space.OK. That’s the a reasonable China perspective. But if you’re in the US, you may not even know, or may not notice, that the US has stationed itself across China’s doorstep and outside it’s backyard fence. You almost certainly don’t know that SE Asian countries have been claiming parts of the SCS for years. So it seems like a clear case of Chinese aggression.So the media tells you that China is threatening your economic and military dominance, and is a growing threat to world peace. If you believe that, it makes sense to dislike China.","29,962 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,1.7K,7.7K,249.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/AI-is-the-essential-technology-for-the-emerging-completion-between-China-and-the-West-Aren-t-the-Western-big-tech-firms-the-only-hope-for-maintaining-parity-with-China

Confused the growth rate, with the growth rate of the growth rate?About technology dependence, let's use data to speak?In February, China's Ministry of Commerce held a regular press conference, the Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng introduced the statistics related to trade in services in 2020. According to the introduction, in 2020, affected by the new crown pneumonia epidemic and many other factors, China's total service import and export 4,564.27 billion yuan, down 15.7% year-on-year.In 2020, China's knowledge-intensive service imports and exports amounted to 2,033.12 billion yuan, up 8.3%, accounting for 44.5% of total service imports and exports, up 9.9 percentage points. Among them, knowledge-intensive services exports 1070.14 billion yuan, up 7.9%, accounting for 55.3% of total service exports, an increase of 4.6 percentage points; the areas with faster export growth are intellectual property royalties, telecommunications computer and information services, and insurance services, up 30.5%, 12.8% and 12.5% respectively.Knowledge-intensive services imports 962.98 billion yuan, up 8.7%, accounting for 36.6% of total service imports, an increase of 11 percentage points; imports of faster-growing areas are financial services, telecommunications computer and information services, up 28.5%, 22.5%, respectively.The above amount is in RMB, and the conversion ratio with USD is 1 USD to 6.5 RMB.Many people probably do not understand the meaning of this, in fact, it is very simple, the so-called knowledge services, is the transfer of intellectual property rights, licensing. And basically, science and technology is the main category. After all, the so-called film entertainment, books, etc. The proportion is very low very low.That is, in 2020, China exported $300 billion of intellectual property and imported about $160 billion of intellectual propertyNo matter how we look at it, we find that China's IP exports, have far exceeded its IP imports.This suggests a result that China's need to buy foreign technology has been reduced too much.Here is a list of technologies that China is prohibited from exportingAll to the extent that they are restricted from export, apparently none of which are available abroad.China is now a world leader in these technologies1. Electric power systems, whether it is the scale of the grid, or the distance of the grid transmission, or the stability of the grid. There is no second country can be compared. The State Grid Corporation of China, is a more powerful company than Huawei.For example, China is now the whole country has been a network of all the grid, the United States is still divided into many grid areas.China is the only country in the world that has the ability to transmit electricity across continents.The highest delivery distance of China's power grid has reached 6,000 km (already has the ability to deliver tens of thousands of kilometers), those who have learned about high voltage transmission will understand that this requires the voltage to be raised to a very high level, and yes, the transmission voltage of China's backbone grid is already much higher than other countries. At present, 1000 kV extra high voltage has been the next step in the construction of China's power standardChina's UHV transmission technology became the international standard at the International Smart Grid Forum held in Germany on September 24, 2013.To this day, China's UHV transmission technology is unique in the world. Any country that wants to build UHV has to buy equipment from China, and the technical standards, the whole world is using Chinese standards.Take the second largest hydroelectric power plant in Brazil's history, ""Beautiful Mountain"" project, this project in the Amazon rainforest, the power has to be transported to the southern industrial zone 2000 km away. In the end, they could only find China, and the State Grid Corporation to 51%:49% share ratio joint venture development of ultra-high voltage grid.China's current laboratory technology has reached 7000 kV, a voltage that is capable of global transmission. It is possible to transport hydropower from Tibet to South Africa or Argentina.2, high-speed rail technology, this I do not need to say. China has the world's fastest and largest high-speed rail network.Although in the early days, China introduced some technology from Japan and Germany, but China now high-speed rail runs much faster than Japan and Germany, you can't say that China is dependent on Japan and Germany.The more advanced 600 km/h high-speed magnetic levitation transportation system was launched in Qingdao. Before Japan Tokai Passenger Railway Company's latest L0 series high-speed train in Yamanashi magnetic levitation experimental railroad trial, reached a speed of 603 kilometers per hour ultra-high speed. That was only a test. And China is building commercial operation this time, the normal speed is 600 km.It is expected that in the next 10 years, China will build dozens of maglev railroads with a cumulative length of more than 10,000 km.In addition China's ultra-high speed vacuum piping magnetic levitation technology has also made a breakthrough in the laboratory, and the speed is expected to reach thousands of kilometers through high speed vacuum piping transportation.Before that, Japan and Germany, can still compete with China in the high-speed rail market. In the magnetic levitation train, China has no more competitors.There are many more areas of high technology that China has accomplished independently.It goes without saying that, as you can see, aerospace is an area of development that has essentially no external support. In the field of aerospace, the overall is still behind the United States, but it has been able to develop completely independently.The field of aviation is also gradually catching up. China's only shortcoming is engine technology; it is not that China cannot manufacture engines, but that the performance of the manufactured ones is not as good as that of the West.In biotechnology, China is already the country in the world that relies the most on biotechnology to increase production and income. In particular, the field of botany and agricultural biotechnology, including agricultural transgenics, is basically equivalent to the international status of the Chinese diving and ping pong teams.Many people misunderstand the concept that this is actually the era of international cooperation, and it is actually difficult to achieve top level simply by one country.The advantage of Western technology over China is a group cooperation advantage, not an individual advantage.Take the more hotly discussed production of chips.At present, China has been able to independently produce 14nm chips (please note that this is completely on China's own technology), this technology is actually in the United States under the suppression of their own research.I guess you can not imagine, in fact, the United States own technology can not produce 14nm chips, but the U.S. advantage is that he joined the international cooperation, in the world's top chip processing equipment, he completed a part, and he (Intel) is one of the shareholders.This is like the International Space Station, because the Americans were the first to join, so he was able to exclude China and not let China join the International Space Orbit Station.Don't think this is how advanced the US is in chip manufacturing technology.If it is just a country independent manufacturing level, China's chip manufacturing technology has surpassed the United States and includes all countries in the world.At present, China's chip technology lags behind, not behind which one, but behind the Western cooperative alliance.For that matter, you can think about how strong China's development rate is.To conclude.1, China is dependent on western technology in many aspects, which is a problem of international cooperation, just like the world is dependent on China's rare earth technology. It's not a question of China not being able to live without the West, it's a question of multinational production.2, as far as independent production is concerned, China is almost the top country in the world. What China can produce independently, whether it is advanced products or ordinary products, has surpassed the rest of the world.Other countries in the world, including the United States, Britain, France, Germany, and Japan, they are just more advanced than China in some areas.And this overtaking is acceleratingChina's technology is a gap in the 2G systemIn the 3G system, China's technology can basically be ignoredIn 4G system, China's technology accounts for about 10%In 5G system, China's technology accounts for 40%I believe that in the future 6G system, China's technology will exceed 50%.",5 followers,Justin Schwartz,1K,19.1K,24.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/AI-is-the-essential-technology-for-the-emerging-completion-between-China-and-the-West-Aren-t-the-Western-big-tech-firms-the-only-hope-for-maintaining-parity-with-China

These are simply my observations.The biggest difference I discovered between the two, at a fundamental level is their priorities.China is Outcome-DrivenTo put it very bluntly,This is why it is extremely important in Chinese culture to have your own house and car to show people that you have wealth. You’ve made it. How you attain that wealth is not really important or up for discussion, as long as you reach that status or checkmark. Life is brutal and unforgiving. It is a culture where they respect power and money more than anything else.Chinese are also more productive and industrious at the business level. There is less red tape or regulations to deal with soSince Chinese culture focuses on results, people tend to be more successful in life. They are good at “obtaining” things like permits, quotas, meeting deadlines or requirements, etc.The West is System-DrivenWhile China is an outcome-driven culture, the west is a system-driven one. The outcome is important, but what’s more important in western culture is theThat is why in the west it’s taboo to ask someone how much he/she makes. What’s more important is what the person does for a living.In business, the Chinese will focus on reducing costs and increasing efficiency while Westerners, especially Europeans, will care more about how that product is made and provide valuable experiences with that product.To illustrate this let’s look at watches. TheIn western culture feelings or experiences are importantLiving in Asia I noticed how westerners are just wired differently from East Asians. They will have tons of small talk even at work, talking about the news or some difficulties they encountered on their way to work that day, trivial affairs that are never really the topic of conversation among the Chinese. For the Chinese, they made it to work on time, there’s nothing more to say on the matter.Since western culture focuses on theWesterners also tend to beTo sum up the global economy today:Collectivism vs IndividualismThe second biggest difference between China and the west is that the former is a collectivist or conformist society, while the latter is an individualistic society.China as a whole is much more unified and centralized than the west.The West is more individualistic and this is reflected in the political landscape.For example, Scotland has its own separate unique identity that is different from the UK or Europe. And Scotland is a country of only about 5 million people. Many medium-sized cities in China have more people than the entire country of Scotland. The same goes for regions like Wales, Northern Ireland, Cornwall, Andalucia, Catalunya, Bavaria, Veneto, Flanders, etc.Thanks for reading***If you found this answer insightful, please be kind enough to like and share.

Perhaps a heavy machine gun is mounted up in a window behind sandbags, etc. Maneuvering around and neutralizing the threat is dangerous and time consuming. But what if you had a grenade rifle that could precisely detonate a round just over their heads? Then you could aim just above the MG nest, pop of a shot, and those unlucky bastards would be no more. Firefight over in a minute. No need to call in artillery or air support!The way this works is that scope has a rangefinder and a computer, and it can program the round to explode at the lazed distance, orWhen field tested, it apparently developed quite a reputation amongst insurgents, who would sometimes flee when they realized the US squad had one with them. I only heard glowing praise about the 2010 field tests. Being able to neutralize cover with a weapon like this is literally game-changing.However, the project was ultimately cancelled in 2018. The ‘official’ reason always cites a particular misfire in 2013, althoughI think the other headwind is that current US squad tactics and organization don’t really have a good way to incorporate a system like this. Who wants to carry around a 14lb weapon and give up his rifle? They were patrolling around afghanistan, not taking Berlin. It is, however, a very outstanding little system. If I recall one particular conversation correctly, I believe the round can even punch through some wooden doors and explode on the other side. How’s that for breaching?There were also problems with HK, who made the frame of the rifle itself, being a poor partner and failing to deliver on time. (This also angered program managers.)The good news is that fitting this tech onto a 25mm grenade is the hard part. I can promise you that the same technology will find its way into a 40mm grenade system at some point.

In the first year after its arrival, 80 percent of American soldiers killed in combat were found next to a jammed M-16, which had no rod to clear the jam.

A horse required higher quality food and its ability to pull heavy loads was slightly less than that of a oxen, but it could move about twice as fast.As you might imagine power output moves up considerably once we move into the inanimate realm. A properly built vertical windmill or an overshot waterwheel could have a useful output in excess of 5 horsepower. Of course they required skill and material to build, operate and could only function when there was a sufficiently strong flow of water or air.Something like a sawmill might have an output 30 to 50 times that of a human sawing by hand.Though I am not confident in the specifics I can suggest that the most powerful output in pre-industrial days was generated by sails. Sails with an area in excess of a field hockey pitch could propel huge ships with hundreds of crewmembers at speeds in excess of 12 knots if the wind were right. Again I can’t say exactly how one would translate that to horsepower but I think we should see them as engines in the hundreds of horsepower range.The industrial revolution introduced new powerplants that had considerably smaller footprints and a higher degree of reliability. In addition they could run on fuel that was burned. Steam engines in ships, locomotives and factories could generate thousands of horsepower.What made cars and aeroplanes feasible were engines that had higher outputs at smaller sizes and lighter weights.Early automobile and aircraft engines might only have 30 horsepower internal combustion engines but rather than being the size of a three story building like a windmill they were small enough to fit in a modern shopping cart. By the end of the Second World War some aircraft were fitted with V-12 engines that had outputs in excess of 1000 horsepower while remaining comparatively pocket sized.Even lighter and more powerful engines such as various forms of gas turbines pushed airplanes beyond the speed of sound while rockets got us into space.The ultimate limit of our species is the ability to generate power. We can certainly improve existing power plants, their fuel cost, output, size, weight and manner of power distribution. However I do think there are limits to these. We kind of figured out how they all work and as such we are really improving them by each iteration.What I suppose the humans of the future need more than anything is something radically new. Something which can generate power beyond what we can imagine is feasible, something which might as well be magic to us.","16,663 followers",Lee Thé,944,10.1K,80.7M,2022,https://www.quora.com/AI-is-the-essential-technology-for-the-emerging-completion-between-China-and-the-West-Aren-t-the-Western-big-tech-firms-the-only-hope-for-maintaining-parity-with-China
