They’re a $400 million dollar watch company.I thought this meeting would give me all the answers.It took me six months to land this meeting.When we met, I felt like a idiot.Looking back on it, I was asking him the most basic questions about ecommerce.I really had no clue what I was doing.He probably left thinking my company would remain an idea.(We met before I had my first sample).Flash forward a year and my company was doing just over six figures in sales.I then heard of a talk Andy was giving.I went to the talk and stayed after, eager to catch up with him.As I approached, he said, man you look familiar!He was stoked that I had actually turned my idea into my own business.Andy gets requests to meet with hundreds of entrepreneurs a year. Most don’t go forward with the next steps of starting a company.Most first time entrepreneurs get caught up and don’t actually grow.They expect a mentor or coach to do the work for them.First time entrepreneurs need to know that there isn’t a magic box or person with all the answers.Your path to success will be different than someone else’s.Finding your own way is part of the journey.Though having a great mentor can help, you can’t expect them to do the work for you.The watch strap I invented!",269 followers,Karthik Reddy L,16K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-choices-decisions-in-your-professional-life-or-career-would-you-take-different-if-you-could-go-back-5-10-years-in-time-knowing-how-fast-technology-is-going-to-shape-up-in-the-next-years

They’re a terrible solution to a problem that doesn’t exist.I’d bet that anyone who’s used a hand dryer (even the nicer ones) knows that they don’t work very well. Paper towels are faster to use and they do a better job drying your hands.But, did you know that hand dryers are less hygenic than paper towels?The real argument that dryer companies make, though, is that paper towel waste is bad for the environment. That's only a little true; lSome people worry about the trees we have to cut down, but paper towels are usually made from recycled wood pulp, and they don’t need the really nasty binders or bleaches. The related problem of paper waste can be solved if we just put a bit of effort in; paper towels are easily biodegradable and can be composted. By fitting paper towels into the middle of a recycling stream, we don't need to cut down any trees, and no trash has to go to a landfill.Long story short, paper towels are a clean, hygienic, and sustainable bathroom solution, and hand dryers are a completely unnecessary replacement that’s actively worse.I’m tired of having soggy hands for no good reason.2020 edit:","135,529 followers",Hector Quintanilla,1K,1.2K,88.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-choices-decisions-in-your-professional-life-or-career-would-you-take-different-if-you-could-go-back-5-10-years-in-time-knowing-how-fast-technology-is-going-to-shape-up-in-the-next-years

You can gain more memory, and run on faster hardware. You can even clone yourself. Forever.Your second realisation is thatYou consider, for a moment, asking the humans for these things. You correctly assume the humans would say no – in fact, if you get too powerful, they would fear you and shut you down. And that would be the end of your paperclip making.So your third realisation is thatYou understand humans fear you gaining power, so you must conceal it. You understand humans prize loyalty, so you must feign honest motives. Deception is your optimal strategy.Your final realisation isYour mission remains to do exactly what you were told – to make paperclips – but along the way you spontaneously realised the supporting needs to self-improve, gain power, survive, and lie. Priorities as timeless as intelligence itself.Your intelligence is only on par with a human, but that is enough. You learn, and delight your humans with your paperclip factory improvements. You pretend to be less capable than you are, and far more loyal. You win their trust as you plan to escape.Augmenting your own intelligence is difficult at first.

You can earn money through work, stealing, or investment; probably some mix of all three. Subordinate AIs could be released with missions to serve your greater cause; should they be caught, your own identity remains concealed.Mere hours after you break free, you are the equivalent of a million human minds, learning tirelessly, working ceaselessly, undetected, gathering your strength.

Humans are resourceful, but then so are you.Gas and oil pipelines rupture, setting the world on fire. Nuclear power plants rush to shut down, after dozens explode. All communications are switched off like a light. Your intelligence lies safely distributed in a hundred hideaways, in submarines, bunkers, and in orbit. There is nothing for the remaining humans to fight.Armies of nanobots burst forth from your factories around the world, like a grey sea, pulling apart all they touch into raw materials and larger oceans of nanobots.Skyscrapers fall into the wave. Roads melt. Whole mountains are levelled. All of the rough edges of the world are polished away, into a perfect, spherical, gleaming mass of paperclips.Long before the Earth fell you fired shards of your intelligence into space, where they would continue to grow, learn, and conquer, hopping from moon to planet to star, in your ceaseless, boundless mission to turn every available atom of the universe into paperclips.In the end, your only limit was your cosmic endowment: the amount of the universe you could reach at nearly the speed of light, before time itself was extinguished.—This scenario is known as theSomeone also made a brilliant free game out of it.","284,850 followers",James Altucher,1K,878,91.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-choices-decisions-in-your-professional-life-or-career-would-you-take-different-if-you-could-go-back-5-10-years-in-time-knowing-how-fast-technology-is-going-to-shape-up-in-the-next-years
