And that’s no exaggeration, viable quantum computers will literally be millions of times more potent at certain vital tasks.Quantum computing is not ready yet — it’s still in its infancy — but very serious progress is being now made. It’s advancing fast.At the same time, thousands more researchers are already making dramatic progress in artificial intelligence using recent breakthroughs in machine learning technology. Already AI can drive cars, recognize faces and diagnose medical conditions with astonishingly prescience.Artificial intelligence is also only in its childhood, but advancing very rapidly.So here’s the question…What happens when we combine the most potent AI techniques with quantum computers… what can we expect when we combine advanced machine learning with computers that are millions of times more powerful than the best we have today?The fact is, no one knows, but for the first time in technological history there is a very real chance that some sort of intelligence will emerge.It may not be independently creative like a human — or even much like a human at all — but it will certainly be able to out-think and out-plan us, able to play the game of life far better than we can.The Up Side…QI machines could be fantastically beneficial in more ways than we can count. We could ask them to work on humanity’s hardest problems and they may be able to come up with solutions no human ever though of, or even be capable of imagining.Or maybe we give the the toughest problems in mathematics and physics to solve, and maybe they can make breakthroughs all by themselves, things we can quickly put to good use.Perhaps we can even ask them to invent ever more potent generations of themselves.The convergence of AI with QC could dwarf any other technology development in human history. The possibilities are endless and the benefits could be huge.There is a down side, but it’s not what you think…Any reasonable person reading this must also ask, what happens if it goes wrong? Do we even understand what we’re doing here? It’s only natural to ask, how screwed are we if one of these things goes all psycho on us?Could it become Skynet and nuke us all? Will we see terminators ravaging the landscape? Could this lead us to a ‘rise of the machines’, completely out of control and bent on killing us?The answer is a resounding NO.You see, their very brilliance is what also makes quantum computers pathetically easy to kill… a single bullet penetrating the quantum isolation chamber will stop a QI in it’s tracks, stone cold dead. Permanently.Rogue machines aren’t a risk, instead the problem is with rogue people and nations, as usual.Quantum Wars…It’s easy to guess that the military of advanced nations like the USA, Russia, China, South Korea, Japan and members of the EU will be early and enthusiastic adopters of QI, once the money they are already pouring into research bears fruit.So the real threat isn’t a single Skynet-like machine going berserk, the danger is we get into a sort of quantumThat is what AI might be like 30 years from now.",504 followers,Mad Mann,3.1K,1.8K,2.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-step-in-technology-quantum-or-parallel-computing

5,"One of the problems that will occur is using AI to “prove” some scientific hypothesis or guess. Since AI will not perform any true testing but only a priori testing, puzzle fitting, it will generate bogus claims. We have to remember that science depends on actual experimentation and not running through logical consistences. But I have no doubt that we will see a rise of “AI Testing” which I would equate to fake testing. Some one out there will read what I’ve written here and contest the claims 30 years from now.","284,850 followers",James Altucher,992,878,91.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-state-of-AI-technology-in-30-years

Then, I foresee a development in the capabilities for relating machines with humans, and in particular things like guessing the intention of humans: for instance, right now the single most hard problem in automated call centers and chatbots is the detection of the user “intent”, which is to guess what the user actually wants to be done (to open an account, to clarify why a charge appears in the account, etc.).The discovery of human intent will be a hugely important problem also when autonomous cars roam the streets by the thousands and then millions, because to interact with humans is tricky: “Is this driver trying to pass before me, no matter the cost?”, “Is this driver trying to intimidate me, but pays attention to my reaction?” and so on.Another area in AI that starts to receive wide attention is the ethical handling of situations by the machines, because the actions and ...",36 followers,Adam Ambrozy,579,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-state-of-AI-technology-in-30-years

Think about being scanned of every molecule of information that exists inside of your mind. Your own creativity. If you were an artist of any variety you could be used and copied before you ever had the ability or opportunity to create whatever, for yourself. That is the exact same for all human endeavors.AI is about encroachment not freedom. It’s being portrayed as a technology for the common good and is absolutely the opposite. Are there some significant values to ‘IT’? Yes, for the very few and highly selected and exclusive(not designed for the inclusive)persons from the elite. Initially this technology has to provide all kinds of benefits, otherwise the outcome wouldn’t of benefit to its creators. There is no way that it’s going to take 30 years to achieve domination, it actually already has that capacity. Certainly by 2025 we’ll be well on our way to have humans and also robots of global standardization.The creators have to sell this technological prowess as highly beneficial and practically usable. Globalization is part of the plan. Not for the benefit of each citizen of the world, but for dependency and ultimately blind slavery.Uniqueness will disappear, unless societies say and outstanding ‘NO’ to this automated ruler.Appearing as some technological angel of light and salvation……Disguising narcissistic oppressors.

8,"In 30 years we will write the the 22. January 2047.Technology trends in general are hard to predict as they do rather jump instead of exhibiting linear trends. But let’s give it a shot!My prediction is that we will still not have accomplished general artificial intelligence.So these guys will still be away from us:However, following the equation that X + AI = $$$ my assumption is that plenty of things X that as of today are not very smart will become smart and hence make our life moreIn 30 years we will write the the 22. January 2047.Technology trends in general are hard to predict as they do rather jump instead of exhibiting linear trends. But let’s give it a shot!My prediction is that we will still not have accomplished general artificial intelligence.So these guys will still be away from us:However, following the equation that X + AI = $$$ my assumption is that plenty of things X that as of today are not very smart will become smart and hence make our life more comfortable. This will be driven by the monetary rewards for all kind of entrepreneurs which will have access to our current AI technology, which they can just throw on existing dumb technology to improve it. Therefore, in the future tedious work will be extinct.Autonomous vehicles are already here. Even though we do not bump into them on normal roads yet(or only very seldom if they have test drives), they are used on non-public terrain like mines and quarries. 30 years from now autonomous cars will be common place and pick you up and bring you to wherever you want. These vehicles will communicate with each other and traffic will become more efficient. This also will result in less accidents on the streets. Most likely it will not even 30 years until this becomes reality, as the technologies for it already exist.Another common thing 30 years from now will be Smart Homes. Homes, where all devices you possess will be smart. They will have information about you, your habits, your schedule, what you would like to eat and when. They will be able to prepare food for you. We might not have 20 single devices anymore in the kitchen but rather one device that is a combination of your fridge, toaster, blender, stove, oven and dishwasher. It will check what you have in the fridge and order food automatically which will then be delivered to your fridge, without that you have even to bother about it. Your house will know when you come home, might send you upfront a menu from which you could choose what you want to eat for dinner and when you enter your door at home you can already smell freshly prepared food.This will be only one aspect of your smart home, though. The same can be applied to your laundry, lawn mowing, window cleaning and all the other housework. So you can spend time with your loved once or whatever you enjoy doing. Hopefully, humanity will not outsource quality time with the family and friend to machines as well.Furthermore, all the devices above will be able to communicate via text and speech without any problems. But they will not speak only one language. They will speak all languages.This advanced technology of language we can just take and implement it into earplugs which are microphone and speaker at the same time. Hence we can just take earplugs, which will work like a real time translator and hence there won’t be a language barrier between humans either. So while you speak in your mother tongue your conversation partner will hear it in their language of choice, translated by the earplug.Another form of AI we will have are AI advisers, that have access to all the information in digital form and will be able to give you advise about basically everything by summarizing its findings. Be it which outfit you should wear for your weekly nightout with friends, which car you should buy or what kind of partner will complement you the most. Robo-advisers will also help to make decisions in companies as well as military missions.All of those thing will be very pleasant to have. But instead of one single general AI we will have several highly specialized AI devices. So your autonomous car won’t be able to make you an omelette, and your AI cook will not have the capabilities of doing your swiping on Tinder for you, neither won’t your robo-adviser mow your lawn.Now to the academic perspective of all this:Many of the current AI algorithms like Convolution Neural Networks which lead to breakthroughs in Computer Vision are almost 20 years old. The same holds for Long-Short Term Memory Networks, which are great when dealing with language and sequences. So who knows, maybe the technology we use in 30 years already exists today.A lot of research is going into refining and improving those current algorithms. Making them more accurate, faster and able to generalize. Maybe, improving our current methods will already be enough to obtain all the above mentioned gadgets.One issue might be that Moores Law comes to a halt and hence computational power is stagnating. This would be a bottleneck in hardware, as we cannot get faster processors. Some people claim that will be the case some when in the 2020s. In that case we would have to come up with more efficient methods of how we can harness the existing computational power.Maybe the improvements of current technology won’t be enough to realize reliable robo-advisers and smart homes. From the AI perspective the trouble would be with coming up with algorithms that can generalize and that can use what they already know to solve a problem that they haven’t come across yet. Preferably in real time as living beings do. So in this case we can hope for an unanticipated jump in technology which would give us some totally new way of how we tackle the problem of solving artificial intelligence.So to summarize: we as humans will have a great and prosperous life ahead of us while a lot of tedious work that is not fun will be taken over by machines. In addition killer robots that try to extinct humanity won’t have arrived yet, so annihilation of our species is still up to us humans.I just hope that I did not offend any machines by picturing a future of robot enslavement and that the robo-overlords will not laugh about this post once they took over.","246,850 followers",Dushka Zapata,2.9K,8.5K,232.4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-state-of-AI-technology-in-30-years
