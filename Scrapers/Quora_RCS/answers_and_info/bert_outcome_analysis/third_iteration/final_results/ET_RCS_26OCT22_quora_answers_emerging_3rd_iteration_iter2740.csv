7,"Firstly it’s worth talking about the ‘steam’ coming from the hot water. Whilst we call it steam it isn’t. Steam is produced when water exceeds 100 deg C. It’s clear and the only place you will see it in the kitchen is looking very carefully at the spout of a boiling kettle. Very close to the spout when it’s boiling the first 5mm (1/4″) will be clear, this is steam (it’s invisible!). Shortly after this it turns white and what we call ‘steam’ is simply condensing water vapour.

If you need a further example a warm cup of coffee produces ‘steam’ or ‘steam’ coming off a warm road after a shower. Neither example produces 100 deg C steam both are condensing water vapour. So what is condensing water vapour? All air is capable of holding water. The warmer the air the more moisture it can hold, but like dissolving sugar in warm water, you can add sugar to warm water and it will dissolve and the next spoonful and the next, but there comes a point where the water can’t hold anymore sugar and no matter how hard you try it will fall to the bottom of the cup. This is like moisture in the air. If warm saturated air is cooled it will produce visible water vapour. So to answer your question, your hot pan of water is producing really warm air directly above it, so that air easily absorbs the water vapour. When the heat is turned down the hot convective up currrent from the pan disappears so the cooler air moves in with a reduced ability to hold as much moisture, so the condensing water vapour becomes apparent.

8,"Absolutely. In fact, you can boil water at temperatures down to 0.01 degrees Celsius. At that temperature you need to reduce the pressure to less than 611.657 Pascals, which is 0.006 atmospheres. This is considered a medium vacuum, meaning that the pressure is too low to be measured with a tube manometer. With even lower pressures it’s possible to have water vapor down to about -73 degrees Celsius, but liquid water cannot exist below 0 degrees Celsius regardless of pressure, so you’d either be subliming solid ice or cooling the gas at low pressure.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-do-we-know-that-as-a-species-we-are-the-first-to-have-advanced-technology

12,"Cellular regeneration is something all humans have only a limited ability to do naturally. To enhance this ability to the point of regrowing lost limbs would require major genetic tinkering. In general, the Star Wars universe doesn’t (at least in the canon films) explore genetics much at all, except briefly in relation to Anakin’s midichlorian count (and even there, the value of midichlorians vis-a-vis the Force is unclear).So my best guess is that there is some sort of social prohibition against genetic modification, similar to our modern non-GMO movement.But cloning technology in Star Wars iCellular regeneration is something all humans have only a limited ability to do naturally.

However, there needs to be some way to accelerate the cellular growth and maturation process, unless the clone is created at the time of birth.It’s possible that there’s a social prohibition against cloning for this purpose; maybe there’s some sort of “clones’ rights” movement that we haven’t seen.It’s also possible that SW R&D hasn’t yet found a viable way to do that without side effects. The Republic’s Clone Army was commissioned decades before they were able to take the field, because each clone had to grow to maturity and be trained; their growth and maturation wasn’t accelerated (that I’m aware of; I’m not an expert in Mandalorian organic bio-chemistry).Or it could just be a matter of economics. Mechanical prosthesis might just be cheaper, so it’s most common.In the early days of the SW universe, prosthetics itself was cutting edge tech, while cloning was yet only an unproven hypothetical possibility, and genetic modification for large-scale cellular regeneration is still only hypothetical. So keeping the tech “believable” by the scientific standards of the day might have been part of Lucas’ “used universe” production aesthetic, so might also have something to do with it.","2,094 followers",John Bambrook,754,1.2K,23.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-do-we-know-that-as-a-species-we-are-the-first-to-have-advanced-technology

Anakin's new arm connected to the remainder of his limb via a synth-net neural interface, a complicated piece of technology that allowed Anakin to register feeling in his mechno-arm.Anakin's metal mechno-arm was an advanced version, featuring golden, electrostatic fingertips that simulated a sense of touch. Data collected by the fingertips was transmitted through sensory impulse lines running down the fingers and into an interface module at the wrist. This module served as the junction between Anakin's robotic hand and living flesh. The arm's servos and sensors were controlled by a power cell near the thumb. The mechno-hand's motorized knuckles provide Anakin with a crushing strength far beyond the Human norm.A cybernetic replacement was any biomechanical device used to replace body parts ranging from internal organs to limbs, which were usually lost or destroyed by disease or dismemberment. Prosthetic replacements were connected to organic tissue via a complex synth-net neural interface, which provided the recipient with control and sensation. External replacements were often covered by synthflesh to emulate actual organic tissue.Darth Maul for example, owned great mechno-legs, powerful, strong and durable.If she hadn't known that his (Maul) legs were artificial, she never would have guessed they weren't the limbs he'd been born with. The prosthetics didn't slow him down at all.--- Ahsoka (Novel)“Fueled by vengeance and rage, the newly reunited brothers Darth Maul and Savage Opress spread terror and violence. As they forcibly recruit criminals from the darkest corners of the Outer Rim to join their army, the brothers begin to consolidate their new criminal empire in an effort to bring out Darth Maul's most hated enemy: Obi-Wan Kenobi.With the backing of an army composed of the galaxy's most vicious criminal organizations, there is nothing that stands in Maul's way that he cannot crush.”Maul had fought his Master many times, starting when he was little more than a child and continuing through his apprenticeship. His body bore innumerable scars from those duels—lessons in the peril of being too slow or two quick, too weak or too distracted. During Maul’s apprenticeship he had always known that Sidious had been willing to kill him. The Sith had not survived their centuries of exile by being sentimental, and a student who couldn’t stand against his Master in a mere training exercise was worse than useless—he was a waste of valuable resources better used elsewhere. But Maul had never faced his Master when he was actually trying to kill him.Maul had grown more powerful since the last time he’d been in Sidious’s presence, before the Neimoidian invasion of Naboo had turned disastrous and Obi-Wan had bested him inside the Theed power core. His hermitage on Lotho Minor, his lessons on Unbara, his restoration by Mother Talzin, and his training of Savage had all strengthened him, made him a more worthy vessel for the dark side to fill with its power.But strong as he had become, Maul found himself in awe of Sidious. The Sith Lord was astonishingly fast and efficient, and the Force flowed through him effortlessly. His sabers stabbed and slashed through the smallest hole in an opponent’s guard, his movements never carried him a millimeter out of position, and he could sense every attack Maul and Savage made before it developed.Maul tried to slash past Sidious’s guard, only to find his Master had given ground, causing Maul to extend his arms too far and leave himself slightly unbalanced. It was the smallest stumble, easily corrected, but Sidious saw it—and pounced before Maul could draw himself back. Snarling, he reached out with the Force and slammed Maul against the wall, leaving him lying stunned in a heap.—The Clone Wars: Darth Maul: Shadow ConspiracyAugmented their bodies with cybernetic enhancements give great benefits, and increase the physical strength.Widely feared as Emperor Palatine's deadliest enforcers, Darth Vader is, in reality, a tormented soul imprisoned inside life-supporting armor that both sustains his horrifically damaged body and enhances it, with advanced prostheses, and augmented sensory, skeletal and nervous systems.-- Ultimate Star WarsDarth Vader was impossibly strong, dueling with ease and can tossing his foes aside as if they were weightless. Vader Force-fueled strength was probably unparalleled. Vader was left severely injured and burned on the banks of a lava river, filled with anger and hate. He was found by the Emperor and encased in frightening black armor that kept him alive, and given mechanical lungs that emitted an ominous breathing sound with his every step. Anakin Skywalker was no more.I am the first to restore the Sith to their rightful place in the galaxy. As we planned, the Jedi thought the Sith gone, we were so inconsequential. The pomp of the Jedi, was insufferable. I set the galaxy aflame, my apprentice. I've purged all weakness and impurity. From the ashes, we would have a new age. I learned from the mistakes of my forebears. I used those who were not Sith to achieve my aims.And my apprentices ? Darth Maul was a loss, but Darth Tyranus... He was a proton torpedo. He served his purpose and was gone... I had a superior candidate in mind.--In that long night, with their technology, we remade you. In this way, we saved the Empire. I would have the apprentice I required.-- Darth Sidious, to Darth VaderVader quickly became a highly visible symbol of the Empire, serving as Palpatine’s fearsome enforcer. He hunted down fugitive Jedi who had escaped Order 66, as well as ferreting out enemies both within and without. Vader’s sudden arrival within the Imperial hierarchy gave rise to many rumors. Some high-ranking Imperials claimed he was a laboratory creation built to mimic the fallen Separatist warlord General Grievous, while others whispered that he was a technologically augmented warrior schooled in the now-forbidden arts of the Force. Only a few guessed the truth – that Vader was the reborn Jedi Anakin Skywalker.The Sith warrior Savage Opress also received a mechno-arm from Death Watch. Increasing his immense juggernaut-like strength even further. Same thing here, the fingertips was transmitted through sensory impulse lines running down the fingers, allowed Opress to register feeling in his mechno-arm.With his dark side-augmented strength, mechno-arm, transformed into an avatar of primal anger, empower him with dark energies. With the help of a full coven of crafters, the shaman injected the energies of the Spirits into the Brother's bone and muscle, turning him into a warrior behemoth. Transformed Dathomirian Zabrak were a head taller, with a broad chest, strong arms and a full crown of sharp horns. Mother Talzin’s cruel magic transformed Savage into a massive, hate-filled dark-side warrior.Maul and Savage didn’t waste time seeking an advantageous position. They simply charged, blades shimmering, trying to overpower Sidious with the animal ferocity of their attack. Sidious caught their sabers on his, the weapons howling and crackling where they touched.Maul saw that Savage was startled by the seemingly frail man’s enormous strength. Maul stared at his Master’s face. He saw the strain as Sidious called upon the Force to keep the brothers at bay. But there was something else there, too—a terrible pleasure. Sidious began to grin.—The Clone Wars: Darth Maul: Shadow ConspiracySavage knew the dangers of facing the Sith Lord alone, and pressed his attack before Sidious draw his hand back from Force-shoving Maul into the wall. Teeth bared, Savage windmilled his double saber, hoping to disarm Sidious or force him to give ground. If he did, that would allow the yellow-and-black Zabrak to follow his initial attack with a lightning-quick thrust that would penetrate Sidious’s defenses and wound or even kill him.Maul tried to shake off his attack, rocketing up from the floor. Sidious neatly side-stepped Savage’s assault, drawing back as the massive Zabrak raised his double-bladed saber high to try to pummel him with it. Savage didn’t think Sidious was fast enough to take advantage of the brief opening in his defenses, but he was wrong.Sidious rammed one of his blades through Savage’s black armor, the glowing crimson tip of the saber appearing between his shoulder blades. Savage gasped, his saber tumbling from his grasp. Sidious yanked his weapon back and Savage seemed to hang suspended for a moment, as if he were being levitated by with the Force. Then he crashed to the ground.—The Clone Wars: Darth Maul: Shadow ConspiracySo, yeah, as you can see, cybernetic limbs hamper nothing on a fighter.",515 followers,John Jaggerz,521,1.5K,7.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-do-we-know-that-as-a-species-we-are-the-first-to-have-advanced-technology

It was meant to make him more stronger and to become a far more fearsome opponent. This was why Vader used absolutely no mercy when delivering the point of this confronting lesson.When Vader realised that he had a long lost son, and that he could potentially turn him to the darkside, he tried to teach young Luke the same grim lesson. On Cloud City Luke learnt the value of loss, that his father was taught, at roughly the same age.Vader hoped Luke would understand the value and lesson of loss, and fall to the darkside with his guidance. When Vader was dealing with Luke, the Inquisitors, or any darkside disciple, he severered a limb with the expectation that the ‘student’ would take this lesson on board, and further their strength within the darkside of the force.Anyone else who lost a limb to Vader simply got in his way.","5,155 followers",Jawed Akrim,781,2.6K,42.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-advanced-technological-means-to-boil-heat-water
