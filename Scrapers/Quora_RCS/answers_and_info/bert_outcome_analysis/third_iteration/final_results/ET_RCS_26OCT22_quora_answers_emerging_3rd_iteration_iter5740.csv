1,"Moore’s Law is just that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years. That means that we have to keep making smaller transistors, and smaller interconnections between them. (If they’re located in the same place, but we make them smaller, we aren’t increasing the number per unit area.) If we reduce the width of the conductor (currently at 4nm), we’ll reach a point at which the conductor becomes an insulator because the wave “part” of an electron can’t fit in it. It’s not the cost, it’s the tech (1 inch is 2.54X10^7 nm, so 4nm is 1.5748X10^-7 inch) and tMoore’s Law is just that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years.

4,"Slow wifi. Period.This is the #1 tech problem for every teacher I know, including me.1:1 student tech is fairly cheap these days and a lot of schools have it. Either every student has a Chromebook or iPad, or there’s a cart full of them in the classroom, or students bring their own tech from home. Either way, it’s not uncommon for every student to have a screen in front of them when needed.And, as soon as it’s needed and all of the students jump on the wifi, it slows to a crawl or stops altogether.Chaos ensues as every student feels the need to announce, loudly, that their internet isn’t workiSlow wifi.

The teacher, upon realizing his amazing internet-based plans are falling apart, has to think quickly and come up with a back-up plan, and get the students back under control.After experiencing this a few times, many teachers will either give up on the tech, or learn to use it in a rolling fashion. That’s what I do most of the time: have the students go online in waves, so it doesn’t slow down the wifi too much, while other students work on something without the tech. As an added bonus, if the tech doesn’t work at all, all of the students already have a non-tech-based assignment to do.If any school administrators are reading this and want some helpful advice from a teacher about tech in the classroom, it’s this: Make sure your wifi can handle an entire classroom full of students going on it at the same time. Laptops and iPads in the hands of students look great, but they’re worthless without the behind-the-scenes investment of servers, bandwidth, etc…","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-emerging-technology-or-process-that-would-rejuvenate-and-revitalize-Moores-Law

They utilize different forms of communication in information technology. It permits those companies to create a saturation of the market. They influence the economy via a particular message. The firms get a number of feedback from the client via the methods of electronic communication.The inter-office communication is enhanced by technology. For instance, the software of social intranet offers the employees with the centralized website. It helps them to reach and get the update from the internal documents. There are contracts along with the pertinent data from different departments quickly. The methods assist the companies get the consumers via mobile in the real-time (Chicu et al, 2019).Improved Productivity of The EmployeeThe businesses could enhance the productivity of the employees' through technological utilization. The programs of computer and the software of business will permit the employees to make a processing of the data in comparison to the methods adopted manually. The owners of business could apply the technology of business to decrease the level of the human labor in the activities of business. It permits the business owners to bypass payment of the cost of labor and the advantages of the employee.The technology of basic business could create a lot of influence over the performance of employees. For instance, with the placement of the appraisal of the performance of employees in the online mode, the supervisors have the power to develop the target in a measurable way. It is meant for the staff for sustaining and fulfilling the objective of the organization. The owners of business can develop the operations with the help of technology in comparison to the employees when the technology offers great output in the production.Enhance The Base of CustomerThe technology permits the business owners to get new markets in the economy. In comparison to simply selling the goods of consumers or their services at markets locally, the businesses have the power to get the national, regional, and the foreign markets. The retail websites have been regarded as the simple way for the business owners for marketing the products in different regions. This will boost the economy significantly.The websites create the choice at a low cost for the consumers. They can reach the business round the clock for buying services and goods. They can fulfill their requirement at any time. The owners of business have the right to utilize the advertising of the internet to get new markets. They can grab customers in a careful way using the advertisements. They can create banners to attract the customers across the world (Khin et al, 2019). .Business Outsourcing and CollaborationThe technology of business permits the companies to grab the business from other countries. Other companies can get the functions from different businesses at a low cost. They can reach the foreign and national business environment instantly. The outsourcing assists the companies to get the service at a low cost, They can concentrate on finishing the function of business which is best for their company. They can offer support at the technical level. They can offer service to the customer.The owners of business can regard the outsourcing of certain operations when they lack the manpower or facilities in their area. The technology of outsourcing permits the corporate sector to outsource the function at a low rate from international destinations.Our society is expanding very fast with the help of technology. Digitalization is found in each sector. It can be agriculture or education. There is top priority of digitalization for the rising ecosystem of business. It is quite beneficial to become adapted to the technology following the graphs of corporate sector. Work systems are becoming quite easy and there is less complication. In this way, the employees can concentrate on their projects and they are not disturbed by the different factors which they encountered before (Gao, 2019)..Works Cited:Trașcă, Daniela Livia, et al.
