0,Science continually pushes back the boundaries of superstition and religion. That doesn’t mean that there is no room for religion; it just means that the scientific method is superior for obtaining knowledge about the known world and that religion shouldn’t just make stuff up as it frequently has.The major religions were founded 1.5 to 3+ thousand years ago when Man’s scientific knowledge was quite limited relative to what we know today.,99 followers,David Johnson,705,25.8K,15.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Who-feels-religion-is-heading-out-the-door-and-being-replaced-by-technology-and-science-combined
1,"“Science” is good for connecting cause and effect. But it’s not a source of values. Perhaps some values are instinctive or perhaps some are cultural. But they still need to come from somewhere and we should be explicit about where that source is.Personally, I think the big change has had to do with freedom of speech. If people can speak their minds directly (at least for now) then that changes how they communicate and organize.But there are aspects of religion (organization, tradition, morality) which will always appeal to people.

2,I think humanity is splitting into two super cultures. One is a culture that is comfortable with the fast pace of technology rushing by… more than doubling every 5 years.Those that aren’t good with the fast pace of science and technology are increasingly afraid of the future. They are retreating into cultural protection from it. Increasingly religious. Increasingly needing authoritarian leadership to “handle it” for them. Denying climate change. On and on.No I don’t think religion will be dead among technological humans… it will be almost dead and completely secular. God will come with us… butI think humanity is splitting into two super cultures.

And I suspect most religions will opt to stay on Earth.

4,"I was going to say breast-feeding, but, no, that will likely be coopted by surrogate “mothers.” That’s a pity…Then, of course, I thought, “Love-making” — that’s gotta be exclusively human; but, no, with all the strings attached, it’s almost like you’d rather avoid those hangups and have it out with a responsive silicone doll or mannequin instead. (How far can they go with this anyway???)And won’t people get tired of that and say, “This ain’t the real thing.”I wondered about novel-writing.

6,"Well, it a good question, and there will be no short answer.There are two levels, technological and conceptual.Technological.I assume we still use Turing machines, because it all we have.

7,"Near term, the obvious examples of AI replacement are vehicle drivers, radiologists, assembly line workers, and any other jobs that rely on pattern recognition and simple manipulation.

8,"There are none.You need to understand that human brains are not incomprehensible. Eventually, we will be able to duplicate them in hardware and software. At that point, there will be no difference between what we call “artificial intelligence” and what we recognize now as “natural (human) intelligence.”In fact, for all we know, we ARE artificial intelligence.
