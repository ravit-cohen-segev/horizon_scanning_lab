By no means am I a fan of the Democratic Party, which is not to say I am a fan of the Republicans, but I do tend to favor them.I saw a recent Democratic debate held by the DNC, and what stood out to me was the fact that,I was resigned to the fact that Trump would have to be the one I would vote for. My first vote in a presidential election to a man that I dislike, but only vote for because his policies tend to match my views far more than what Democrats typically present. However, due to the fact that Yang stood out to me, I decided to research him.I started with his campaign website, and I looked through his major platforms. I didn’t agree with many, which is to be expected, but his three main policies, I actually found to be reasonable.Universal Basic Income is the cornerstone of his campaign. I was skeptical at first, as it sounded to me like another free government handout that would only cripple tax payers.However, he explained his plan of a Value Added Tax, which would ensure that companies like Amazon (which will only profit more from automation as opposed to people like truckers who would have their jobs taken by automation) wouldn’t get away with avoiding taxes, as they apparently made money from tax rebates as opposed to paying into the system.A value added tax is, from what I can understand, like a sales tax, except it doesn’t just tax you at the point of sale, it also taxes you right from the acquisition of materials, through manufacturing, to sale; essentially a tax at every step of the way, which would mean that Amazon (and other companies running on a similar model) is paying taxes.Another main platform he is running on is medicare for all. This is another platform I would typically see as a free handout, and it doesn’t make him unique from the other candidates, all of who would support this. I think it is ethical, but perhaps not practical, so it didn’t really stand out to me, but as I’ve gotten older, I often wonder if paying higher taxes so that the general welfare of the nation is preserved is really such a bad thing.His third point is “Human-Centered Capitalism”. This is basically capitalism but with some more regulations the preserve the general welfare of the nation; think of a model of a European economy. I’d normally be opposed, but he is the first Democrat to have explained his points in such a way that I can actually get on board.At this point, I’ve mentioned very often that I skew conservative, and I am no fan of Democratic policies, so why is it that I, whom assumed right from the start that Trump was my only option, believe that Yang would make a good presidential candidate?Aside from the points I mentioned, I advise you to go to conservative YouTube videos that gets hundreds of thousands, or even millions of views. Think of The Daily Wire, or Fox News.You go to these conservative videos which are known for proclaiming Trump as some kind of living god, or deeming any well known Democrat living garbage, and you will see that this is not the case for Yang.You will find in these videos a very good like to dislike ratio, and you will find that most of the comments are about how they were going to vote for Trump, but Yang seems like a good candidate, or how Yang might be the only one with a chance of effectively debating Trump.Yang is the candidate that can actually get conservative votes. Those other candidates tend to be jokes in the eyes of most conservatives, myself included. Yang doesn’t appear to be this way, and I think of these videos, such as Ben Shapiro’s interview with Andrew Yang, to be a pretty good polls on how conservatives feel about Yang overall.So, why is Yang the best presidential candidate?I believe that he has the best chance at beating Trump. I will personally vote for Yang in the Primary Elections because it is my hope that my vote helps him remain in the race.My very first vote will be one for a Democrat, despite my family being Republican, despite my views often aligning with that of the Republicans.You can vote for Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, or whoever else seems to be winning the Democratic popularity contest. Or, you can vote Andrew Yang. He is an outsider like Trump. Not a politician, but an entrepreneur. Not just any entrepreneur, but one that studied economics and law, and knows what he is talking about, as opposed to Trump, who talks out of his rear end most of the time.Trump has pretty good odds, but it is my belief that if the Democrats want to truly beat Trump, Yang is the one that has the best shot. Of course, as it currently stands, the DNC seems to be doing what they did with Bernie Sanders last election, making the big names in the debates appear to be all the rage, in the hopes that people don’t bother voting for lesser known candidates like Yang.If you want to know how the DNC views Yang, this can tell you all you need to know.I apologize if my answer was boring or dragged out too much. As I said, it was my first answer, and this will very likely be my last. I just hope that if I can change one mind about Yang, then perhaps one vote may make the difference between him being booted out of the race or staying in.",UNKNOWN,H.L.

3,That is hard to say but I do look for Wayne Messem to drop out before too long. He is just too far behind to ever be the potential candidate. He suffers very much from lack of name recognition. I even had to look him up and I have no idea what he stands for or what ideas he is running on.,"2,045 followers",Nelson Tan,24.1K,70,943.5K,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-2020-Presidential-candidates-would-help-us-the-most-with-the-next-technology-boom-coming-in-2020
