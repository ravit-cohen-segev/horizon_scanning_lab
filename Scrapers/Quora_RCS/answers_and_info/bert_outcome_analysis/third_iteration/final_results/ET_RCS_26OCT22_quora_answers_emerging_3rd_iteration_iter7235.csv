I will attribute this failure to the mindset of policy makers and people who choose to live in a chaotic corrupt society.From a technology standpoint, India likes to call itself digital in some aspects; however, the lack of civic sense and education makes the technology look useless. Imagine driving a Tesla in India! There are a lot of educated illiterates purely because the education curriculum is more about getting a job.The government of some states has invested heavily in infrastructure, but it is also up to the citizens to keep things clean and operating. Even if everyone is forced to pay taxes, it won’t help because most residents believe in loopholes and bureaucratic connections.The justice system in India is rigged to an extent where an average resident has a higher chance of succumbing to circumstances than getting a timely justice. When people dare to elect and worship a PM accountable for mass genocide, there is not much left to say. India is still dealing with dowry, caste, reservation, rapes, infanticide, corruption at scale. Astonishingly, India has the largest constitution globally compared to the US constitution, but that reasonably may be its biggest weakness. Freedom of speech is a myth. Population and the size of the country are out of proportions.There is a significant influence of western culture in India. Nothing wrong with that but most advancements tend to be a shallow copy of what the west does. There is a saying, “the devil is in the details.”Education is still a dream for many. Simply put, there aren’t enough schools and colleges in India. My wild guess is there are more religious monuments than places for education and advancement. Even the idea of basic sanitation wouldn’t exist if it wasn’t for COVID.As a country, India has only made average strides since independence. Thanks to the British who gave rail, postal, reforms, education, army, administration, and much more. Many countries attained independence from British rule around the same time and are doing much better than India. Regardless, the question is not about British rule, so I won’t get into that.",4 followers,Dan Bradbury,2.5K,21.7K,235.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-far-is-India-behind-the-US-in-terms-of-science-technology-and-development

She's a rare breed of Muslim that is sort of reformationist (like Lutherans or somesuch).  She rejects (what I think are) the later occurring Hadiths.

We sparred quite a bit but usually got on quite well:  we challenged each other brutally and kept each other on our toes.Anyhoo, after having a conversation with her and a group of other associates in which I expressed my love of and passion for India/Indians, she retorted (angrily) that I was a racist, culturalist ""standard American"".  I asked her why and I remember her pointing out something that may well be true about me.  I'll try to be as accurate as possible in quoting her.""You love Indians because you see all the IT professionals, doctors, scientists and 'hard-working' college students here in the USA.  You don't love anything about Indians.  You love what you think Indians do here in the USA:  the perfect immigrant.  No criminals.  Hard working, well-educated.  Your prejudice is obvious because you conveniently leave out other immigrant groups like Hispanics which demonstrates your racism.""This is because your opinion of Indians is stilted by the very distance which Indians must cross to get to the USA, which effectively filters out all the people you'd think were 'undesirable'.  Because if India were next to the USA, you'd have a lot of illegal border crossing. You'd get all the rapists, the sexists, the criminals, the thugs.  You'd see the horrible corruption that comes with being Indian and you'd simply be 'silent' the way you are with Hispanics† or other groups.  You'd have gangs just like Latino or Black gangs.  Prisons would be full of Indians because of that.""But the very fact that Indians have to get an education, then experience, then a visa, then spend a thousand dollars, get on a plane, fly to the USA completely filters out all the 'riff-raff' that would be here were it not for those obstacles.  This self-selection sends you India's best and brightest.  So of course, you love Indians.  The USA gets what is effectively all of India's least corrupt, best educated most upwardly mobile people!""So don't say you love Indians.  You love doctors and IT engineers.  Not Indians.  When I say 'I love India', I know what it means to love my country -- warts and all.   That's why I'll be moving back there one day.""I have to admit, I can't argue with her.  It doesn't change my fascination with India, but she's a persuasive person.  I can't help liking what I see here in the USA.  I hope that doesn't change when I finally get to India.  But when you talk about how well Indians do in the USA, you have to understand what my amiga -- Sadia -- was saying and why the general opinion of Indians in the USA may well be stilted when compared to opportunities for Indians back in India.I hope she's wrong.†I reject that claim on account of -- you know -- my other passion for my Spanish-speaking brethren; a passion that made me move overseas to learn the language.  But that debate for another time.†I reject that claim on account of -- you know -- my other passion for my Spanish-speaking brethren; a passion that made me move overseas to learn the language.

When I went there, it was still a national poverty-stricken county.————————I don't know about India. Let me introduce China.A few years ago, I participated in a traffic poverty alleviation work, in short, building roads for poor areas.The national poverty-stricken county I went to has only 180000 people. We plan to build 1000 kilometers of such roads and 79 bridges in 2 years.For any natural village, even if there are only a few hundred residents, concrete roads should be guaranteed.The minimum requirements of design standard are: at least 6m wide, at least 20cm above concrete pavement, 15cm above cement stabilized soil base.China's highway design standards are divided into five levels:expressway,first-class highway,second-class highway,third-class highway and fourth class highway.For the sake of unnecessary misunderstanding, I need to explain:The “highway” I'm talking about below, in Chinese, refers to the road connecting cities and Townships. The official term is 公路， Literal meaning is public roads.Standard of Expressway：The following picture is from ya'an-xichang expressway. I participated in this project 16 years ago. Of course, I was just a young technician at that time.This is a picture at that time. It's been too many years. The most handsome one is me.Standard of first class highway:Standard of Second-class highway:Standard of third-class highway:：Standard of Fourth class highway:At present, the total length of China's highway is 4.2 million km, and the expressway is close to 120000 km.In fact, the standard of the Roads for poor areas mentioned above is lower than that of the class IV Highway. In other words, such a road can not be called a highway in China. In our words, The official term is “out of grade road”.But such roads can help a lot in poor areas.This is a picture I took during the construction.Because of a Cervical spine surgery, I didn't see the completion of the project.At that time, only the subgrade was completedIt's standard like this when it's completed.This is a random picture on the Internet—————",0 followers,Gab Chan,10.7K,4.5K,26.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-far-is-India-behind-the-US-in-terms-of-science-technology-and-development

So, the head needs achievements in the year end. The mayor don't care what he talked in front of city council , but the consequences. If traffic jam happens in a city and get worse for a long time , and people think no efficient effort to deal with , three steps are likely to happen,And China even has more horrible things for Indian, if the project not reach the standard, the officer who operated it must be responsible for it whole life, even retired. If the project failed for artificial wrongdoing, cause considerable losses,he still will be jailed even 60years old.If Modi change the bureaucracy, introduced the accountability mechanism,claim if new transport projects plan can't be completed, the minster and principal secretary have to both resign, lost their career,the whole department lose bonus,the opportunity to promote.there will be no problem at all. I promise they can both find Money and settle land acquisition in there own ways.Now, they just say they can this, they can that, and do nothing . 5years finished , they promoted or changed positions, eating the promise and plan in election. And nothing happens.It is nothing about the democracy or socialism, it is poor governance. If everyone civil severant is under pressure, has the sense of responsibility for people ( the ambition for his career, the scary for lost job and being humiliated ) , he has 100 way to do the job perfectly.Democracy is not the excuse for poor governance. Bureaucracy will say we lack of funds,environment issues, land issues, technology requirements. The fact is they don't want to change, they still have benefits in the poor conditions,China has the best high speed rail, why? Many reasons blablaThe key fact is the Chinese central government not allowed the rail bureau to raise the passenger ticket price ,for 30 years. The price hasn't changed for 30years, they don't have profits for bureau at all, and affect their salaries .Yes , it is communism stuff, beacause people will unhappy about rising price.but cargo trains can raise the price.So they desperately to build a separate High speed rail for passengers , charge them the higher price for a quicker transport,and run more cargo trains on the old rail track for national interest and Yes ,their salaries.This is good governing. people , bureaucracy, nation both happy about it. And they can build rail 20000km for 5years and Shanghai to Beijing rail 1300km finished in 39 monthsLike what Deng Xiaoping said, socialism is not poverty. When China reformed, 99 percent people said we can’ touch with the western world, they said socialism this, socialism that, we lack money they control us …….and the beginning is what Deng said.Bureaucracy always has 1000 reasons to say we can't, beacause they don't want to do that. India said democracy is superior to China ‘s socialism and India can't build infrastructure for its own people because of Democracy . Is it means democracy is too good to build rail hospitals, roads?

My neighbor just needed to land good IT job to be considered as a part of a developed house.What is complicated is scaling that development to a massive continent sized nation with a huge hinterland with 100s of millions of people living far away from the sea or any urban development.People often get enamored with city states like Singapore or Dubai, but the fact is it is not hard to build a Singapore. In our own country, Mumbai’s GDP is comparable to Singapore’s. If the government didn’t use its tax money to fund rest of the country it could be having even better roads & infrastructure. Making a city with an excellent port in a major trading route into a rich city is not a big deal.What is complicated is turning a place 1000km from a port with no river, no big freshwater access, very limited energy or school into a developed one. That takes a long time. That is the challenge India has in developing the interior states like UP and Bihar. If turning a city of 5 million people into a developed nation required a brilliant man like Lee Kwan Yew, turning a country of 1400 million people requires 300 such brilliant leaders and the world doesn’t have that much of a supply.I will end with one final analogy.

The idea that the US doesn’t do industry policy is a myth. The US does industrial policy on a massive scale, and has always done so.Prior to WWII the US had 40% - 50% tariffs on everything, and it was the most trade-protected countries in the world. After WWII the US championed GATT and later on, the WTO, which opened the markets worldwide, but also put restrictions on how much the US can tariff foreign goods, which drove a change of US industrial policy from tariffs to domestic incentives and subsidies.Take a look at government procurement. Since the 1933In addition to government procurement, the US has a whole bagful of industrial policies worth $trillions of dollars a year, including:Direct subsidies such as ARRA, which is direct federal contracting with small to medium firms totally $200+ billion a year. industry subsidies such as Federal loan of $65 billion to GM and Chrysler in 2008 - 2009, Export support through NEI, R&D tax credit, state and federal manufacturing subsidies such as the $1.3 billion subsidy Tesla received from Nevada, and the $2 billion subsidy Intel received from Oregon. The top five manufacturing companies are all old established political players. All in manufacturing too: Boeing ($13.17 billion), Alcoa ($5.64 billion), Intel ($3.87 billion), General Motors ($3.49 billion) and Ford Motor Company ($2.52 billion). Long history of government subsidies in agriculture, energy, and military. Government VCs such as the one CIA started, what is it called, In-Q-Tel, whose success triggered an avalanche of other government-backed VCs from the Military and other government agencies. Oh, and let’s not forget the super duper deal of TARP, which provided $2 trillion federal funding to shore up banks.It’s not that the US does’t have an industrial policy. It’s that there are massive number of people benefiting from these procurement, subsidies, and favorable tax policies already, and they are all working quietly behind the scenes to keep the goodies going. So the money you need for any NEW industrial policy - you don’t have it! If you sit back and think about it - the government is not in the business of making money. It doesn’t make the pie. It’s in the business of dividing the pie. So if you want to give a slice of the pie to somebody, you have to take it away from somebody else.And so, who gets the money then? Well, the Congressmen all spend half of their time asking for money, so they’ll call up the ones who can write a check. And who can write a check? The guys with money. Duh. That’s why you can “opine” however you like.

It is the soft things like design, brands and customer service that make the big bucks and drive the stock market.Industrial policy is not my thing but my observations tell meWhat America is losing out on is its’ brain power.The importation of temporary workers in high tech fields is testimony to the lack of US resources, in the fields that matter the most.At this point in time, the US cannot out brain China. Nor can the US stop China from implementing 2025.US entrepreneurism seems to be declining, which is not a good trend. Does this predict for a slower economy ?

Unless one believes that Asians are naturally more intelligent, we should be ashamed at the poor results. Our colleges often have to teach students what they should have learned in high school. We shouldn’t be using tertiary education to teach students remedial work.We need to favor industry over finance and we need to favor long term production over short term profit. We also need to have a policy that encourages internal infrastructure investment. Internal communication networks don’t grow automatically and the US has let the needs of the stock market decide where to invest in broadband. China doesn’t do that, and China is about the size of the US. I live in rural Minnesota and the 2 providers of ‘broadband’ in my area: Hughesnet and Arvig are terrible. There are practical solutions already available but companies have no incentive to invest in small town and rural America.The US is run by people who think that what is good for wall street is good for America, until that changes we will will not have a successful future.So, we need a change in attitude, I don’t mean America first, but I do think our businesses need to focus on this country.","23,886 followers",Robin Daverman,1.2K,2.3K,40.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-far-is-India-behind-the-US-in-terms-of-science-technology-and-development

Politicians basically spend their whole time trying to discern how their actions might be perceived by their constituents, what good news to bring back, what “bad news” to deflect so that they stay in office.

The original IBM PC and the Apple II could only issue clicks to the internal speaker. Game developers worked hard to make it suitable for sound effects and music, but it was difficult—if not impossible—to deliver quality sound and music through the built-in speaker.Enter sound cards. Hardware developers like Creative Labs developed sounds cards like the Sound Blaster that allowed programs to use digital-quality sound and music. They had to be specifically programmed, but when exploited delivered new levels of realism and immersion to games.Today sound chips are built into most motherboards and PC users regard it as a given. But those features were a luxury in the 1980s and early 1990s and would’ve have come about without video games.Video cardsThe original IBM PC was only capable of deliver 4 colors at a time, and at relatively low resolution of 160×200 pixels. This allowed for rather crappy games.Improved graphics cards were released that upped the number of colors to 16 and the resolution to 640×350 pixels (EGA), then 640×480 (VGA), 800×600 (SVGA or Super VGA), then 65,536 colours at 800×600 and 1024×768 (XGA).Today, most graphics capability is built into most motherboards and most users regard it as a given. But today’s high resolution and crisp colors owe a debt of gratitude for video game developers who exploited higher resolution and colors for their products.But these improved cards only allowed for higher-resolution 2D graphics. These cards and computers still fell all over themselves when trying to push 3D graphics. That led to the development of…3D cards3D cards are, of course, necessary for high-speed, high-resolution graphics. Any computer can display rudimentary 3D graphics, but it takes special hardware to deliver high-speed, colorful, high-resolution 3D graphics at 120Hz.The desire for 3D graphics was spearheaded by the video game development industry who wanted to exploit 3D graphics for increased realism and immersion for their games.Originally video card manufacturers developed 2D facilities and added some 3D features as extras. They anticipated that 2D graphics would still be more popular than 3D, so pushed their card’s 2D capabilities. They soon discovered that 3D performance was way,Some amount of 3D capability is built into motherboards today as graphics chipsets, but for really acceptable performance moving forward, most users will need to—or will be able to—upgrade and replace their 3D cards with better and better cards.And while 3D graphics can be used for a number of CAD and scientific applications today, their development was spurred by the video game industry.",1 follower,Chris Nash,13.6K,5K,30.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-far-is-India-behind-the-US-in-terms-of-science-technology-and-development

You can’t imagine how awesome (in the most literal sense of the word) it was going from the beeps of a PC speaker to hearing crystal-clear digitised real-world sounds and MIDI music in games that supported them.Hearing the beeps of the Leisure Suit Larry 5 theme song turn into what sounded at the time like a real-world band playing it wasWolfenstein 3D and Dune 2 would not have left the fantastic impression they did on my young mind otherwise, I’m sure.My cousin and I spentThe arrival of the CD-ROMBefore the CD-ROM, there were floppy disks, then stiffy disks. Floppies held 360kb of information each, then 1.2MB, then stiffy disks replaced them entirely with their comparatively large 1.44MB capacity. Each capacity increase was welcome.Side note: These were the days when games would ship on a shit-ton of disks. The number of times I’d go to a friend’s house to copy a game, only to get home to hear one of the disks clunking inside my drive and throwing out a read error and aborting the installation wasThen… CD-ROM drives arrived! We went from being able to store 1.44MB per stiffy disk to a whopping 650MB!! This lit a fire under the gaming industry, and developers started making use of high-resolution art assets, digitised sound, video, and speech for all characters! This was a revolution!The first game I saw that took full advantage of this was The 7th Guest, followed later that year (1993) by Myst. There’s a reason these games sold like gangbusters: the gaming world, which was still hot for adventure games at the time, had never seen anything quite so beautiful, and both games pushed the technology to its limits while also offering fiendishly difficult puzzles that hold up even today.The CD-ROM was an absolutelyMy gaming experience had been enhanced beyond what I could imagine at the time, and it wasThe beauty of 3D accelerationI think the most recent advancement that had my jaw on the floor was the arrival of 3D accelerators in the mid-to-late 90s; seeing Quake go from a pixelated mess to the smooth fluidity granted by GLQuake and a Canopus Pure3D accelerator card (with a whole 4MB of VRAM!) was almost unbelievable.I can remember clearly walking up to a wall in Quake and staring at smoothed-out pixels in absolute awe at what computers were capable of, and wondering what the future holds.Today’s advances are - subjectively - not as impressiveToday, I am less impressed at game technology developments, even though they too are huge when you look at the incredible technology behind them.They seem to beI’m sure developers disagree, of course - they likely have a lot more freedom to do more with their games thanks to newer, more powerful hardware than we had back in the day - but then I’m not a developer, I am merely a gamer looking in from the outside.Jaded? Maybe.Maybe I’ve just become jaded, I don’t know. 4K/60fps widescreen gaming on a big display is nice, but it’s not soNow, when VR improves to the point of defeating the screen-door effect entirely and hardware is capable of true photo-realism and games come out that take full advantage of that, my mind may change.Until then, jaded I shall remain.Wrapping upAnyway, these are the gaming-related technological advancements that I have personally experienced and which greatly affected my perception of gaming and my appreciation for computer hardware.I look forward to seeing where we go from here.Hope this answers your question!","3,454 followers",Matti Porkka,3.6K,1.8K,16.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-far-is-India-behind-the-US-in-terms-of-science-technology-and-development

A few rolls of gauze and a couple pills of generic ibuprofen isn't exactly going to cut it here. But there's something that might:Yep.Of course, morphine alone would not stop you from dying. For that your video game protagonist is going to be looking at blood transfusions, surgery, and possibly the removal of any shredded organs that might start hemorrhaging while they're tearing their sutures open in the midst of a drug-induced battle rage. And since it seems unlikely that they'd have the flexibility or the skill to do that all themselves, we can only conclude that the machine is somehow taking care of it with those generic mechanical bits. By itself.Now, think back to the last news article you read about a self-driving car getting into some kind of accident that a human driver probably would have easily avoided.
