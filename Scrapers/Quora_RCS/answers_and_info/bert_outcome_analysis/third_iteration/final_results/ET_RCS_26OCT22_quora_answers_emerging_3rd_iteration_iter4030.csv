It would remove the biggest barrier to traveling that RV’ers face: the cost of fuel. A trip across America in a gas or diesel coach currently costs thousands.

5,"THAT is a pretty big question. Considering that the use of rocks and sticks for simple tools were a form of invention, I would ask that some sort of limitation be put to this.Among the oldest inventions that we have on record are cutting and scraping tools made from rock. It was a great intuitive leap from those to making spear points, drills, and other simple devises. It is currently assumed that these spearheads predated fire (another invention) by some time, and that the next great invention was either (depending on my memory and to whom you speak) farming or the wheel. Farming was followedTHAT is a pretty big question.

It is currently assumed that these spearheads predated fire (another invention) by some time, and that the next great invention was either (depending on my memory and to whom you speak) farming or the wheel. Farming was followed pretty swiftly by the making of both beer and bread, enough so that they may have actually been the kickstarter that farming needed.If I was dropped down in history at a time when farming existed, the horse had been domesticated, and the wheel was in use; the first question I would ask would be about writing. Does it exist? Is it at all intuitive? How commonplace is it? etc. If there is writing (a distinct possibility since the Aztecs had writing and farming, but no formalized concept of the wheel) I would then need to look at people’s lives, particularly farmers, and ask how I can make their lives easier. Then I might consider the plow (as opposed to just putting a stick in a log and dragging them both behind oxen) The hoe (even if there is some evidence of that tool’s existence very early on) or even a long blade reaper, along the lines of McCormack’s invention in the 1800’s.Or, I might go back to the writing, decide to simplify it, and invent the book.It would all depend on what was perceived as being a need, and what the peoples of the time would be willing to accept. There have always been folks who cannot accept something new because it’s seen as being “detrimental” to youngsters.Things I would shy away from, despite my urgent desire not to? New religions (including prophecies about current ones), partisan politics (that may have already been in place, any how) newspapers, automobiles, and anything else that may have been more revolutionary than the people I’m with are ready for.There’s a wonderful book by L. Sprauge DeCamp called “Lest Darkness Fall.” The hero in that book is from the 1960’s and somehow lands in Rome right after the fall of the Empire. What he “invents” and how he does so is a worthwhile read, even if you disagree with me on everything else.","9,587 followers",Max Searle,2.1K,82,6.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-will-happen-when-technology-reaches-its-peak-and-there-will-only-be-an-invention-to-lose-than-to-invent

Besides, lots of meaningless stupid questions are the core of Quora’s business model.Instead, what really makes me sad are the stupid answers. People who think they know what they’re talking about, and telling the askers things that are totally, objectively false.Examples in medicine include various lies including the claim that vaccines cause more harm than good, that antibiotics are never necessary, that insulin can be replaced by a healthy diet, that AIDS only affects gay people. In politics, people insist that Biden won because the Democrats cheated; that Hillary Clinton’s emails and Hunter Biden’s laptop are evidence of crimes; and that inflation is Biden’s fault. People claim the war in the Ukraine is Ukraine’s fault. There are earnest claims the the government is covering up information about UFOs, not to mention 9/11 and the Moon landing. People loudly insist that astrology works, and so does homeopathy. People say that the observer in quantum experiments means the universe is conscious.Some of the information circulating on the Web isn’t just wrong, it’s actively dangerous. Obviously, anti-vaxx disinformation is my go-to example.Sought solutionSo I’d like to see an AI, or maybe a panel of “truth experts” or whatever, that can reliably inform us (and not just on Quora) about what is considered established knowledge in the eyes of the world’s relevant experts, and what is flaming garbage. Sure, there are questions without a clear answer. But there are lots of questions where the discussion needs to be over, at least until significant new data calls the prior answer into doubt. Something like the peer review process for science. Or like Snopes, only bigger, with a bigger scope and more resources.And it needs to be everywhere where people argue and make claims about reality. Not as a censure, but as a voice of reason, a reality check, providing an alternative voice to the many voices pushing objectively false information.Because people act on the information they get, and the more poorly they’re informed, the more stupid and potentially destructive their actions will be. The world is hurting from misinformation, and we need an oracle of truth to save us.I don’t have any suggestions on how to actually implement this, much less on how to make it reliable and trustworthy. I’m just here to tell you what I think is needed.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-will-happen-when-technology-reaches-its-peak-and-there-will-only-be-an-invention-to-lose-than-to-invent

12,"No - in fact one of the problems with the shuttle is the relatively small amount of time it could stay in orbit. Without solar panels, it could not remain in space for an extended period of time.It was designed for a maximum 16 days - but STS-80 stretched that to 17.5 days - I think due to (failed) efforts to solve an airlock hatch problem that had prevented them from doing a couple of spacewalks.As a space station, it would have been pretty terrible because it only had 74 cubic meters of pressurized volume - the ISS has 935 cubic meters - and even the much smaller MiR had 350 cubic meters.AltNo - in fact one of the problems with the shuttle is the relatively small amount of time it could stay in orbit.

More specifically, it was usually scheduled to occur about 45 hours after launch.That wasn't because it required 45 hours of maneuvering to get to ISS.

A few hours before docking, the visiting vehicle will be directly behind the ISS. It will be at the same altitude as the ISS, so physics will make it travel the same speed. Both vehicles will be moving forward at 4.76 miles per second (7.66 km/s). If it isn’t a Russian vehicle that will dock to the aft, it will then do small burns of its engines to inch forward and downwards. Depending on where it will dock, it will either slowly climb the R-bar (radial vector below the ISS) or loop around to the front of the ISS. During this final approach, its speed, relative to the ISS, is less than an inch (2.5 cm) per second.It may sound scary, because we are so affected by our experience on Earth. You’ve seen a lot of movies like the one pictured above, in which two cars travel at high speed and someone jumps from one to another. The stuntmen driving those cars do the same thing the ISS and visiting vehicle does - they match each others speed. That should make it so that, for the stuntman doing the jump, jumping from one to the other is no different than if the two cars were parked. Well, almost……don’t try that at home. There are a lot more variables in the car scenario and variables can get you killed. The wind is a variable. Other vehicles on the road is a variable. Road conditions is a variable. If one driver hits a slick spot or a pothole, the distance between the two cars can suddenly change and the jumper will miss.In space, the two spacecraft are in a vacuum and there is no road other than the fabric of space time. Nothing should create or induce a variation in velocity between the two objects, so it really is like one of them is stopped and the other is moving at one inch per second (2.5 cm/s).",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,537,9.4K,195.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-will-happen-when-technology-reaches-its-peak-and-there-will-only-be-an-invention-to-lose-than-to-invent
