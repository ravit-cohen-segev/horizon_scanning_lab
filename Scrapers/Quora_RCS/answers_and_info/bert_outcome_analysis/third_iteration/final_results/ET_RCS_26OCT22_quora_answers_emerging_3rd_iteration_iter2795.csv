The first account testimonies of the first Spanish soldiers to arrive to America certainly didn’t paint them as “savages”, and many marveled at the cities of the Incas and the Aztecs. The “brute savages in need of enlightement” narrative didn’t arrived until much latter on the XIXth century during the peak of European colonialism and American “far west” expansion, and religion affinity wasn’t conflated with civilization either, having the experience of warring against a very civilized, yet very heretic enemy (the Spanish muslim kingdoms and latter, the Ottoman Turks).That being said, certain parts of the Americas were indeed considered underdeveloped and “savage”. The Caribbean due to the cannibalistic practices in some of their islands, but also the Mayan regions (their civilization collapsed way before the Spanish arrived) and the North American Natives, which saw their civilizations getting decimated due to the deadly plages and diseases carried by the Europeans.","3,804 followers",Marius Stanlaire,7.6K,194,18M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-does-advanced-technology-features-mean-in-car-commercials

Their advances in infrastructure, Astronomy and mathematics is well known.If you compare them to worldwide cultures, most have eclipsed, surpassed and fallen several times over before the Aztecs reached their own zenith, which paled in comparison to others.I don’t wish to downplay the advancement of the Aztecs, but I believe they’re overhyped. Tenochitlan and it’s fantastic irrigation system was a necessary consequence of living on an island, in the middle of a lake, which was another consequence of being despised by everyone around you so they make the city isolated, making it harder for tribal coalitions to invade you.To be honest, I don’t pity the Aztecs at all, if you read any account of their interactions with other native peoples you learn pretty quickly that they probably had it coming.Honestly there’s a lot more cool cultures to Mexico and Latin America alone than just the Aztecs, I so wish people would see that more often.(P.S Some of you might dislike my saying that the Aztecs had it coming, and it does sound insensitive.
