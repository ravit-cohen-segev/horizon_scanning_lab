3,"If you are in a relationship where you deeply love the other party, normally you'd try everything for a reasonable amount of time to save and improve the relationship. The reason you can ask this question is a worry. Do you love your partner? If tge answer is yes, you have to try. For me it is that simple.If trying doesn't work - and you have given it proper time and both parties made proper effort, then it may be ‘the end’ but not before that. The human condition is impatient and selfish.

She worries about me leaving her, she always seems to be waiting for me to turn into the monster she is used to dating, and she finds it very difficult to just be in the moment and enjoy herself. It's a very tough road. But she's kind, and funny, sensitive, and caring. She is beautiful inside and out and I genuinely love her. The key that I've found is consistency. Someone with trust issues must be shown, time and again, that their fears will never be realized. Someone dating a person with trust issues must always be open, honest, and willing to understand things from their partners point of view, and also be willing to accept the occasional suspicion as a symptom of a problem that you can help with. But, if you're not willing or unable to do all this then you should stay far away from someone with trust issues because you'll only destroy him or her when you find that you're at the limit of your tolerance and you leave that person in the lurch.",368 followers,Ayorima Mitra,674,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/Would-you-end-the-relationship-if-your-loved-one-told-you-she-he-has-trust-issues-or-would-you-communicate-about-the-issue-with-hopes-of-saving-your-relationship

If you have been hurt because someone violated your trust in them, then you are going to automatically feel threatened whenever you find yourself in a similar situation—and you will begin responding in fight or flight mode.Think of your Amygdala as being a smoke alarm in your house. It doesn’t know the difference between an actual fire or when you burned your toast. When it goes off you don’t automatically call 911, and evacuate the house. You investigate. You determine if there is a real danger or not, and then you silence the alarm.You get rid of your trust issues the same way. Your Amygdala will be going off like a smoke alarm whenever you find yourself in situations that are similar to when you have been hurt in the past.Your job is to acknowledge the alarm and to silence it. You do this with some self talk or inner dialogue…“This feels exactly like the time when I got hurt and taken advantage of before, but this is different. These aren’t the same people, and this isn’t the same situation. Therefore I’m going to choose to trust, and I will continue to trust—until I have a good reason to not trust anymore.”This both satisfies your inner alarm, and it puts a speed bump in your response—allowing your brain and your rationale to catch up to the urgent warnings of your Amygdala.",1 follower,Akshay Tiwari,14.1K,145,21.3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Would-you-end-the-relationship-if-your-loved-one-told-you-she-he-has-trust-issues-or-would-you-communicate-about-the-issue-with-hopes-of-saving-your-relationship

It’s the same tricks with modern names.There could be all manner of reasons why someone might attempt to manipulate you. Add to that, that they might not even be aware that they’re doing it. Perhaps it was a tactic that developed in childhood that no one ever bothered to haul them up on. I honestly had a few dates where the bloke kept reverting to a child mentality, wanting to be taken care of in a motherly sort of way. I don’t think he was aware of it. So you see, this is an example of someone who is manipulative, but doesn’t have malicious intentions.I have also experienced, dates where the bloke was clearly threatened/resentful and every other comment was designed to smash down self-esteem, with glaring-red -flag malevolence.Then of course, we have everyone in between. The co-worker who always seems to have a sick pet when it’s their turn to do the late-shift. The neighbour who sneakily puts your name down on the ‘leave parcel with’ list, without asking you. The woman begging on the street for money who then drives away a BMW!Whether or not their manipulation is intentional, DOES NOT MATTER. What does matter is that their behaviour is unacceptable. Even if someone does not mean to manipulate you, but their communication style is causing you issues, it’s their problem! We all take responsibility for ourselves.To try and help you identify a manipulator. Here’s two examples.In general, people you want to mix with, always try to do the right thing. Even if they don’t get it right the first time, when you point it out to them, they should want to correct the situation/make it up to you. If you have a manipulator and point out how what they’re doing is not working for you, you’ll either get a tantrum, or they’ll feed you more excuses/ lies.Hope that helps.LuvEDIT: Crikey, what an essay!

The key is toIf I suspect someone of being manipulative/narcissitic/overly self centered (they’re all the same thing) I have this simple test:I deliberately turn the conversation to myself and talk about myself, then I closely monitor how long I’m allowed to do this and whether the other person is paying attention.

27,"As a happily married husband, I face and yield to emotional manipulation often, so that my marriage can continue to be happy.When my wife makes a request I sometimes say No.That's when the emotional manipulation starts.Pouting and hurt silences are merely the initial weapons. When they fail, hydraulic power is used (popularly called tears) and finally it is this emotionally charged question “Not even for my sake?”At times when I have lied to her on some issue where I felt she should not or need not know the truth, she is quick to suspect that I have lied just by looking at my face.

28,"Here’s a good one, and you’ll never realize it’s a manipulative tactic.When someone has a complaint or an issue with you—such as a higher-up, sometimes they’ll throw in something like “everyone has mentioned it”, or “everyone feels that way about you.”Of course, they won’t tell you exactly WHO else feels this way, or exactly who has brought it up. They’ll refuse to tell you that part.So then you stew about it. You wonder what’s being said or why everybody seems to be in on this and you’re the last to know.

29,You have a lot of work ahead of you. Couples counseling and individual as well. It’s hard to repair a relationship once the trust is broken. What we allow will continue. If you two work it out then it can never be brought up in future issues. Healthy communication is a must in a healthy relationship. You both need to work on your self and self confidence. Then and only then can you have a healthy happy relationship.

But to be in a relationship is to understand that there is another person that you have to consider. Because we can usually only see things from our own perspective, being able to have the safe space to say what’s on your mind is hugely important.The same works in reverse, you have to be attentive to your partner and allow them to have the same safe space to air out their feelings with you.I would offer that the two of you set a date to have a heartfelt conversation. Turn off cellphones and minimize your distractions as much as you can. Sit at a table and each silently write out the things that you want to talk about, then decide who will go first.Rules: (Remember that this is going to be a sacred space for troubleshooting your relationship.)",326 followers,Anubhav Jain,1.3K,4.4K,123.8M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Would-you-end-the-relationship-if-your-loved-one-told-you-she-he-has-trust-issues-or-would-you-communicate-about-the-issue-with-hopes-of-saving-your-relationship
