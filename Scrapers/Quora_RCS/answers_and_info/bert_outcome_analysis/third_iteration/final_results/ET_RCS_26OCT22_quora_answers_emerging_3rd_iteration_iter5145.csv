The Bucket Brigade and early hand tubs were very manpower intensive.In England and France, they used an improved fire extinguisher in the 1500’s, it probably only produced a few gallons a minute if that.In the 1600’s they reinvented the pumper and the French still call Firefighters Pompiers.

The early pumps or handtubs as they were called in North America required anywhere from 2 to 16 young strong men to pump them.Oko HomeThe handtubs still required a bucket brigade to supply it in most area’s. In some cities, water mains were installed which allowed the elimination of the bucket brigade altogether. However, the handtubs were a lot of work and required 3 teams of people to pump. The operators would usually work for 5 minutes with a 10-minute break. The local pub was contacted and they supplied the teams with beer to consume during the break. So a handtub with a crew of 48 pumping could supply 200 gallons per minute a pretty significant task.Then came the 1800’s and the steam pump. Drawn by horses and powered by steam.Steam pumps could produce up to 1000 GPM and do the job of over 200 men on handtubs with a single operator. So those watching the fire would now have to buy their own beer. The bucket brigade alone would have required hundreds or even perhaps thousands depending on how far it was. So even by the mid1800’s technology had replaced hundreds of potential firefighters.The 1900’s brought the internal combustion engines which replaced the horses. Although the early ones could not out pump the steam engines they quickly improved and today a modern diesel power engine can pump 1500 GPM easily with a single firefighter. How many of the old handtubs would it take to do that?So yes firefighter jobs have been and will be replaced by technology, but will they ever be eliminated? I do not believe they will be eliminated unless society has some radical changes and we can build machines that have compassion and can formulate a plan to think out of the box as they say.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,6.1K,5.6K,427.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Could-flat-tyres-become-a-thing-of-the-past-What-technology-is-replacing-the-inflated-tyre

Calculation ability does not equate to innovation or creative ability. The tools and resources available for scientists today are vastly greater than those of previous generations and for relatively far less cost.A lot of science is joining the dots, finding information that can either support or reject an idea on how things work and this is happening at a much faster rate. Computers can cross-reference and compile information for you, but computers don't UNDERSTAND.  They just do the grunt calculating work and can tell you that you're wrong much faster, saving you a lot of time.Yes, scientists in previous years were brilliant in working out things on limited information. However, I think many would be surprised at the level of thinking and understanding that is still required to do science in the modern world and how many brilliant people there are out there that are doing it.That being said, I think one thing that computers and technology also do is create distractions and cause some people to lose focus. Sometimes you just need time to just relax and think (i.e. let your brain work, rather than forcing it to do things it doesn't want to do). Of course these days, most management types don't like that idea and will try and get you to do more useless paperwork if you look like you have any free time.","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,631,1.5K,2.9M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Could-flat-tyres-become-a-thing-of-the-past-What-technology-is-replacing-the-inflated-tyre

But we lost the ability to be paid for our muscles in the industrial revolution as steam, and gas, and electricity, took over all the muscle work. We don’t even use our muscles to turn a screwdriver anymore. We pay for an electric drill to do the job for us now.But in 20 to 30 years, expect all that to change. Our machines won’t just match our brain’s adaptive learning and intelligence, they will fly past anything a human can do. Once that happens, there will be nothing we are paid to do now with our brain, that couldn’t be done better by a machine. This new world will be a big shock for many, but we will get past that shock, and a new type of society will emerge. We will have to learn to share the economic wealth instead of compete and fight each other for it. We will do that by using some form of a UBI to define people’s share of the economic wealth as the machines do all the automated work to generate the wealth.But, despite the fact that machines will be better at every mental and physical task than humans, doesn’t mean there will be no jobs left for humans.People will do jobs that they WANT to do, just for the fun of doing them, even if the pay is poor or non-existent. There will still be competition for social status. People will “work” at this, even if the pay is not direct but indirect.People that become famous, will get paid for their fame. They can collect fees for doing public events because people want to be near those that have achieved high social status so some of that fame might rub off on them. Whether your fame comes from politics, or sports, or for being an actor, or YouTube star, seeking that fame, and collecting payment for that fame, will still exist after the machines take over all the common work that people don’t want to do.There is also the small amount of work that only a human can do because it’s not mental or physical work. We generate and sell our blood for example. Or sell a kidney. We can sharing our understanding of what it is like to a meat based biological human. (in our writing and art for example). Machines will be smart, but since they aren’t humans, they will never have as deep an understanding of what it is like to be human as an actual human will have.So there will be some very highly paid jobs in the future, mostly for celebrity status. The will be some low paid jobs, and endless opportunities for volunteer work ($0 an hour), but 99.9% of the value in our economy will be the resources and the machines, not human labor. Work won’t define value as it does today. Work, as we know it today, won’t be a central focus of anyone's life in the near future.

The same sort of great thinkers that spent 200 years claiming heavier than air flight was impossible had to eventually shut up because there were wrong for 200 years and never were smart enough to know it. The current rash of “jobs will never go away” people are just as misguided.Jobs today are currently being replaced as fast they are being destroyed for two reasons. The first, and most important, is that society forces everyone to create new jobs for themselves if they want to eat. If you can’t find a normal job, you have to become self-employed and stand on a street corner and beg for money so you can eat. Or you become a criminal and steal for a living. Or you “fall in love” with a rich person and use their money to eat. Work, or die, that’s the society we live in, and that is preventing our work weeks and retirement age from shrinking as automation grows. If we had learned to start sharing the wealth of our automated economy people would be working for less than 40 hours a week and would be retiring sooner. That hasn’t happened because we haven’t learned to share, especially in places like the US and other underdeveloped nations.The second reason that we keep working is that our automation and AI aren’t as smart as humans yet. Our intelligence keeps us useful to the economy, it gives us a monopoly that pays. Even minimum wage workers have adaptive learning skills that surpass the best and most expensive AI systems. We cope with the unexpected far better than any AI current AI system.Currently, AI systems are smarter than any human but only in limited domains, like playing chess or Go, or other specific tasks. They don’t have our general adaptive learning skills yet. But every year, the scope and power of our AI systems expand. AI research has been on a constant growth path for 50 years whereas humans are not smarter today than they were 50 years ago. We are standing still, and AI is growing at lightning speeds compared to human intelligence.But in the next couple of decades, AI systems are on track to reach general human intelligence and then fly right past us. When this happens, the monopoly on intelligence that makes us useful to the economy will vanish. We will become outdated, unemployable workers that can’t compete with the machines for any job any more than we can do math better than a calculator today.It will take more than just the powerful technology for us to lose our jobs. The entire economy has to be retooled to convert from a human-centric workforce to an automated workforce that will take decades. Just as the internet explode in the 1990s once technology passed a cost and power threshold but here we are in 2022, almost 30 years later, still trying to retool our society to convert the entire economy to a network-connected phone app. The conversion from an economy driven by human workers to one driven by machines will take time as well. But in time, humans will no longer work for a living at all. The machines will do all the stuff we call “work” today.But most importantly, we have to stop forcing everyone into wage slavery before we can take advantage of automation. We will still need to use capitalism for the machine economy to optimize itself to maximize the gq2uality and value of goods being delivered. But we won’t have to work to get money to pend. People will get their money as a free handout, just like we don’t have to pay for the right to vote, and won’t have to be wage saves for the right to use a share of the robotic output. Everyone will get free money in the form of a Basic Income from birth to death. This will represent our individual share of the output of the automated economy. We will convert society from one driven by competition and wage slavery, into one where people are truly free to do whatever they want with their lives. We will be very busy working to create the best life we can, but we won’t be slaves to money anymore.We should already be using a Basic Income system today to share the wealth of automation. But because most people can’t understand what is happening, we cling to a backward view of work and purpose that makes everyone wage slaves that can’t even afford to retire anymore while the 1% control trillions of dollars of automation wealth like Bezos, Zuckerberg, etc.Even though people could still work for money in a post automation society, it won’t be a job in the sense it is today. Just as someone might pick up a hobby business for the fun of it in retirement today, people in the future might have hobby jobs as well. We will do some type of work because it’s something we find it fun and enjoyable, and the money we make will not support us, but it will help pay for our hobby. It's easy to have a hobby job when all your basic survival needs are taken care of with a pension — which is what everyone will have staring at birth in the post-automation world. So though some people will choose to charge for their hobby work, it won’t be anything like the “jobs” of today in our work or die world, so I don’t think it’s fair to call them “jobs”.
