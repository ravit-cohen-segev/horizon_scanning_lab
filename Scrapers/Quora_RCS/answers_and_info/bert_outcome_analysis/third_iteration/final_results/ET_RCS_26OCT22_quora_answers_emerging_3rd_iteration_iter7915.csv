These include crew hibernation, generation ships, and other concepts that do not require the ability to somehow circumvent Einstein.Sleeper Starship - TV TropesWith all of these factors and more in mind, some bright minds have put considerable thought into exactly how it might be possible to send an unmanned probe to one or more of the nearest stars utilizing currently available or at most near future technology. The first of these was a concept developed by the British Interplanetary Society which they named, “Project Daedalus”. Propulsion was to be provided by a series of miniature nuclear explosions which would push the massive spacecraft to greater and greater velocities until it topped out at approximately 12% of the speed of light (the “c” in E=mc2). The emigre German physicist Friedwardt Winterberg contributed significantly to Daedalus with his “Winterberg/Daedalus Class Magnetic Compression Reaction Chamber”, a proposed starship drive that relies on multiple detonations of so-called “mini-nukes” . These in turn appear to have been derived from certain fusion-based nuclear weapons concepts explored by the German Army Weapons Bureau (the ““Project Daedalus: Our 1970s Plan for Interstellar Travel”, a Documentary Video From the SciShowSpace YouTube Channel.

11,"No. Not in a century.Fusion takes place at the core of the sun, where the pressure is about 265 billion bars (atmospheres) and the temperature about 15 million K (~ 15 million ̊C). Despite these ideal conditions for fusion, the peak power generating density of the core overall is similar to an active compost heap, and is lower than the power density produced by the metabolism of an adult humanTherefore the required temperature for self-sustaining fusion at a rate useful for power generation is several times that of the core of the sun.

Despite these ideal conditions for fusion, the peak power generating density of the core overall is similar to an active compost heap, and is lower than the power density produced by the metabolism of an adult humanTherefore the required temperature for self-sustaining fusion at a rate useful for power generation is several times that of the core of the sun. Such a high temperature is needed to overcome the electrostatic repulsion by a sufficient fraction of the hydrogen nuclei to enable their fusion. Using heavy hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium rather than ordinary hydrogen helps to increase the power density to useful levels above 100 million K – about seven times the core temperature of the sun.Achieving this temperature – and compressing the “fuel” – is relatively easy with the aid of a nuclear fission trigger – thereby creating a so-called hydrogen bomb. Doing soOne reason is the Stefan-Boltzman law of thermal radiation that states that the emissive power is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature. This thermal radiation is about 10^15 times brighter than solar radiation at the “surface” of the sun (at 5 700 Kelvin, rather cool relative to the solar core). It would quickly vaporize the walls of any reaction chamber in which fusion occurs. Even the surface temperature of the sun would quickly melt a tungsten filament, or the highest-melting refractory materialThus protagonists of fusion power who claim that such temperatures can be sustained are denying the truth of physics that has been established more than a century ago, and which is used and confirmed on a daily basis in all furnaces, and in understanding the energy dynamics of the sun and stars.The original US Project Sherwood was an excellent attempt at achieving controlled fusion. But even after it became clear that it was not feasible, it gained a momentum of its own. It is expensive research, and to motivate funding, some quite esoteric claims unrelated to reality are being being made today.","220,639 followers",Franklin Veaux,8.6K,47.3K,783.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-long-could-the-average-starship-travel-before-it-needed-to-refuel

By viability I mean that they have been able to produce a stable fusion reaction that is sustainable long term and generates more energy than is consumed to contain and maintain the reaction. The excess energy, in the form of electrical power, was still less than 30% of the total energy produced by the fusion reaction, but still viable if inefficient. It takes a very high density magnetic field to contain the reaction at the required pressure for fusion. So for this project more than half of the energy produced is used to contain the reaction.SPARK Tomahawk, for all of the claims, no less than 10 years, likely closer to 20 before they are at the point of being able to build a viable commercial fusion reactor plant.The key to fusion based energy is forcing the nuclei so close together and with enough motion of the atoms that they fuse, converting binding energy into radated and molecular motion, aka heat. To get those conditions you need either some form of containment that can force the atoms that close together or a gravitational field that is strong enough to do the same thing, like in a star.Edit:I should add that just like in early fission based reactors, there will be growing pains where safety and reliability are concerned.
