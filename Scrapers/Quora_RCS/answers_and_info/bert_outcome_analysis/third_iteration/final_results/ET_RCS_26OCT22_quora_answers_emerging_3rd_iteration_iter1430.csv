Externally, vertical farms will be connected to other networks and information systems, including databases that track local demand. For example, local restaurants could input when they need to replenish their fresh food supplies. And vertical farmers could access that information so they know which crops to grow in what quantities.It would be interesting to see some of great innovations will be emerging on farming in this urban (busy) world!",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-Big-Thing-for-Startup-in-Technology
1,"Transfer learning in ML models.Humans are really good at generalizing. We only have to see a few dogs before we can recognize a dog when we see one.Machines are not. ML models require millions of examples before forming a reliable classifier, and that classifier is very specific to the data on which it was trained. If your training data doesn't include dogs with three legs, the model won't recognize them. A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one.

A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one. It's hypothesized that the reason humans learn so quickly is that we are fitting new examples into our existing knowledge rather than forming entirely new categories. If we could teach machines to do the same, they would learn exponentially faster and apply that learning more effectively.Transfer learning is a very hot topic in AI research right now, so I expect major breakthroughs in the next few years. I think this may be sufficient to achieve artificial general intelligence, but even if not, it will dramatically extend the range of tasks that machines can accomplish.","135,528 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-Big-Thing-for-Startup-in-Technology

5,"The question is about “technology” so all the answers are about the technology we already have is very incrementally better.

But better computers is not fundamental change.An Earth-shaping changerequiresthe invention of something new we don’t have today,not just a better way to make wheels or hotter fires.in 1600 physical science has a collection of rules of thumb, observations and stories. there was no common system to explain things.

Then in the 1680s Issac Newton published “Principia” and changed everything overnight. Now the there was one theory, based on a new branch of mathematics (Calculus) that could explain the cause of the ocean tides and the flight of cannonballs, and we learned the nature of light. One book changed the world. That is in the field of physical science.Some day, this century or the next couple centuries someone will discover the fundamentals of cognitive science and the cause of nature of consciousness and free will be by made simple and we will see it is based on this new branch of mathematics. Cognitive science is the field that includes not just human psychology but also AI. It is about thinking and knowing and experiencing. Some day this will be understood.Already we are at the point where very few people care about new cell phones or new computers. It is about like when Delta announces a new line of showerheads.Even fusion power is just a small thing. So the power comes from fusion or solar? Small difference.But being able to copy a mind, short it on a container, edit it and send it someplace and then let it live and operate opens up a world. I could have a partial copy of myself sent to Mars, work there a few years and then send the experiences back, not just to me but others. Same idea could be used for the entertainment industry. But some “Newton-level” breakthrough is needed. These only happen once every few centuries.","16,063 followers",Pavel Fekula,1.4K,11K,118.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-Big-Thing-for-Startup-in-Technology

Some predict its future may eventually produce “thinking and reasoning” robotic entities.Think of the computer named “HAL” in the classic Kubrick film, “2001, A Space Odyssey.” HAL attempted to takeover control of the spaceship against the captain’s orders making HAL a dangerous force to deal with.The possibility A.I. could veer off into the wrong direction concerns the pros who figure that is a distinct possibility are concerned how to assure that does not happen.","12,264 followers",Anthony Andranik Moumjian,1.2K,1.6K,31.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-Big-Thing-for-Startup-in-Technology

In that time, the US military has embarked on a number of programs like the SPIW and ACR programs that looked into things like caseless ammunition, flechette rounds and a number of other ideas that have yet to offer a sufficient improvement to justify replacing more traditional systems.The US military appears to be considering a new squad automatic weapon that fires 6.8 mm caseless round to the M249. However I would be surprised if anything like that gets adopted in the next 20 years.

In down-market conditions, technology companies tend to fall back to easily defensible market positions, called “core competencies”. Usually there’s a great deal of soul-searching involved in this, with CEO’s writing pensive memos about “getting back to what really defines our business”.In reality, there’s value for tech companies in both the expansion & contraction cycles of the economy - during an expansion, companies are more able to redefine themselves by exploring new technologies & markets, whereas during a contraction they’re motivated to cut fat & trim unproductive investments.ThePhotos by Shutterstock (editorial use only)",0 followers,Ashok Bishnoi,12.8K,314,7.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-Big-Thing-for-Startup-in-Technology
