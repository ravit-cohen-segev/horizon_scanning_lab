1,"The move from 4G WiFi to 5G Wifi. I can’t pretend to understand all of it BUT 5G is a part of the radio-magnetic Spectrum. Essentially why some people are afraid of this tech rolling (some places already have it) is because 5G is in the middle of the “Microwave” part of the Spectrum. It WILL cause Cancer of many kinds and other health threats that most persons do not know about. The elite say its safe but most persons who live near the 5G towers have developed various illnesses, including Cancer as stated along with signs of advanced mental illness in persons younger than 10 years old and oldeThe move from 4G WiFi to 5G Wifi.

The elite say its safe but most persons who live near the 5G towers have developed various illnesses, including Cancer as stated along with signs of advanced mental illness in persons younger than 10 years old and older. Dementia in young adults and other brain issues, both physical and mental, in persons under age 20 while for the most part only persons over 60 would need worry about this before the 5G signals. Some 5G towers are placed in Farmers’ fields and the crops began dying for no apparent reason. Fruit on trees just developed malformed and were tested by labs who found deformed apples were full of cyanide. Apples in nature do contain very low levels of cyanide but you would need to eat over one hundred apples over the course one week to be affected. Now, the crops are either dying or growing dangerous, malformed fruit and berries, grain crops such as Wheat, which is used in so very many products from bread to ice cream. Potatoes are alos being affected. It’s quite strange with the Potatoes as they are part of the Nightshade Family just like Tomatoes and the Nightshade plants whose leaves are poisonous. Some potatoes are growing malformed also and developed some of the dangerous toxins usually only found in Nightshade roots and leaves. These events are going unreported by the media. We are on our way to better Cell Phones and WiFi BUT out food and health are being affected. Crops stop growing safe food and we will all die. And the effects of 5G on the Water Supply is still unclear.",UNKNOWN,Dr. Pooja Singh,2.8K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-an-upcoming-event-happening-in-our-current-era-that-can-be-described-as-enframing-of-technology
2,"Focus on any one programming language but understand it in depth. Keep your basics clear. Programming Languages are just a tool to implement your solution through a code.So my suggestion would be to focus yourself towards understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms as much as you can and then implementing it through the code. Practice as much questions as you can on sites like codechef, hackerearth, geeks for geeks, etc.If you complete the above and have ample time left, then you can move towards Dynamic Programming(DP).

6,"The first thing that I would suggest you is don't neglect your academics.You have to decide whether you go for higher studies or for job after the completion of engineering.If you are going for higher studies then decide in which field you want continue your studies and prepare for the corresponding exams (like GATE , GRE, CAT , TOEFL etc… ) If you think you need tutions then attend them and prepare well.If you want to enter the IT field then you have to concentrate on strengthening your resume, communication skills and prepare for the placements.

As placements starts in 7 th semester (in most of the colleges) you have to be ready to face the interview at the end of your 3 rd year. You won't get much time in the 7 th semester to prepare for the interviews(-From my experience).Last 2 years of your engineering can change your future. So don't waste your time. You shouldn't regret for not placed in a good company or for not clearing the exams as per your expectations just because of your bad preparation.Enjoy your engineering life but don't forget the above things. I could have prepared well but I didn't and wasted my time and I still regret for not preparing well. Don’t make the same mistake.
