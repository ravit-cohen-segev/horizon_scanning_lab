2,"Once upon a time…Somebody figured out how to make a material that is 200 times stronger than the strongest steel, transmits heat into electricity, and is extremely lightweight. Its discovery resulted in the Nobel Prize for Physics being given “for groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene.”Graphene is classified as two-dimensional: it is one atom thick (not pure two-dimensional but as close as we can come) and this form creates several fascinating properties.So why hasn’t this material exploded?

5,"Over the years, brick and mortar retail outlets thought they would continue doing what they had done for decades. It took some longer to realize the retail customer base was increasing their buying to the Internet, year over year. The smart ones realized that if they were to stay in existence, they were going to have to join those, all or partly, who had embraced eCommerce. Success is tightly tied to location - be where the customers are. People who were a little uneasy about paying online using their credit cards found that over time, safer payment systems were developed.Getting locked down iOver the years, brick and mortar retail outlets thought they would continue doing what they had done for decades.

Success is tightly tied to location - be where the customers are. People who were a little uneasy about paying online using their credit cards found that over time, safer payment systems were developed.Getting locked down in your home for over a year has been a real eye opener for both sides - retailers and customers. Customers either could not get out to stores at all, or not all stores could be open and accessible. Wise retailers had to get out in front of customers with ‘safer’ ways to sell and deliver - in ways that customers felt comfortable with.There are so many more no-touch payment options now available, more retailers realized the need to jump on the eCommerce train. Websites have so many more features that support selling - and buying. Shipping to customers’ doors is great, but everyone has found that to be challenging as so many shifty people think it’s perfectly OK to ‘work’ at stealing other people’s packages off their porches. Artificial intelligence has more websites adding ChatBots. Robotics is being used in retail distribution centers to collect and package customer items.Lots has changed and will continue to change to meet challenges.",0 followers,Leonard Kim,709,593,15.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-new-in-the-internet

7,"If I’m not wrong, these guys were first in India to offer ai in B.tech. So in that way, they are kind of pioneers. The faculty as Rahul above is pointing out is top class. And AI is happening these days. Even beginners are getting good salaries, even up to 10 to 15 lacs yearly. Regular engineering colleges don’t have much focus on ai. It’s all basically up to you. So the best thing to do is go get that knowledge from the best people.I have seen lots of other online courses also. But nothing like learning in IIT campus. I mean, the energy will be very high.

Lots of people with serious ambition will come there. So you will always be on your toes. And the faculty in such places is quite reputed and a lot of them are doing research in the same field. So learning from such people is always good. You may not get to use IIT tag very effectively, so be careful about that. Regular Btech guys from IIT are seen differently. But your resume may have a better chance of getting shortlisted at least. The rest is all on you. How you do in the interview depends on you.And these iit guys have lots of practical projects. So you can do something of your own and showcase it to companies. In that way, you can make the most of it. IIT hyd can help you, but It’s all up to you to make it happen once you are out there.","284,852 followers",James Altucher,992,878,91.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-new-in-the-internet

9,"Around half a decade back, when computer science started gaining momentum electrical engineering departments around the world started breaking out into CS departments or re-branding themselves into EECS departments.At that time the move this was highly criticized and concerns regarding the future of the field were raised.

But then today we see computer science as a core part of every field.AI is in a similar state right now, it's future is really very uncertain but it's something we as humans will always try to understand.AI has huge untapped potential and some universities are including it in their current curriculum while some have chosen to create a separate department dedicated to it.MIT and CMU have taken a lead in establishing one already indicating that they see a huge potential in this field. So I see it as the right time for iit's to tap into this area.Coming to few of the concerns raised in the other answers regarding capability of an IIT to tailor the curriculum of such a course. IITH has already been running an M.TECH in Machine Learning program for few years now. The program has generated very high quality graduates in this field.There are several excellent faculty both in the CSE and EE Department who have expertise in the field of machine learning, computer vision, speech and image processing, NLP, text processing, statistics and probability etc.Hence I feel IIT H will be able to establish this branch pretty well. The only thing is because of the ranking system for JEE advanced people who are not even vaguely interested in the field might take it up. But then again this happens with the the current CS department across most universities in India so we can only hope that people who pick the branch (for that matter any branch) try to do some groundwork before they pick the same.","20,171 followers",Sriraman Madhavan,4.1K,186,7.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-interesting-emerging-technology
