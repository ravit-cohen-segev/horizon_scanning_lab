Gasoline is far more dangerous than hydrogen. Gasoline vapor is heavier than air, so it lingers around and pools around you. Gasoline vapor sticks to you and your clothing, so you can become a fireball if some sparking happened near you. Hydrogen is the smallest and lightest element on Earth and it will go up into the sky as fast as it can, and has no interest in sticking to you or your clothing. Filling a hydrogen tank in a car only takes a few minutes.To “So, our proposed design is to install charging posts wherever there are public parking spaces. Then, these posts are connected to a central energy storage bank in their local area with the new generation of supercapacitor (special graphene). At night, when grid power demand is low, it will “download” power from the grid (many MWh) to charge the vehicles at night and later in the day. The grid can also tap power from all of these supercapacitor banks during the day in case it needed for load-leveling. So, this will solve the EV charging problems for non-homeowners and for our over-burdened grid. Since this energy storage will cycle up and down frequently, the charge leakage is insignificant in this application. Supercapacitor cycle-life exceeds 1-million+.Although this answer did not provide the specific chemistries of rival “batteries” of the future, since they are still confidential, but just wanted to broaden the horizon for the audience on energy storage for EVs. Li-ion will not be the only game in town.By the way, current NCA cells used in the Teslas are around 254 Wh/kg. It is feasible that NCA and other Li-ion chemistries will be in the 350–450 Wh/kg range in the next few years. So, if the battery pack remained at the same weight, the EV range will increase by about 50-70%. This will decrease the hassle factor for those without a home charger.",3 followers,Steve Baker,4K,27.4K,163.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-potential-evolution-of-battery-technology-to-substantially-increase-the-range-of-electric-cars
1,"The issues that so far remain unexplained concern either cosmology (dark matter, dark energy, what happened very close to the Big Bang) or physics at the utterly microscopic scale called the Planck length.None of these are experimentally accessible by today’s techniques, though they may just barely become so within a few decades.The fact that they are so hard to observe will also make it extremely difficult to use them in any kind of technological endeavour. So I guess there will essentially be no technological spin-offs from a unified theory, should one come along.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-potential-evolution-of-battery-technology-to-substantially-increase-the-range-of-electric-cars

Sharing economy, rent out your car when it isn’t in use.In the update Elon Musk hinted that Tesla is going into electric trucks and mass transportion as well.And don’t forget Hyperloop, also initiated by Elon Musk.So, Elon Musk and Tesla is certainly going to change the transportation industri even more.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-potential-evolution-of-battery-technology-to-substantially-increase-the-range-of-electric-cars

4,"Blockchain: What it is and How Important it is?Blockchain is a lot of digital information (called the ""block"") that are put away safely in an open database (called the ""chain"").

Here is the rundown of the total rundown of the highlights being offered by the blockchain innovation.FasterCustomary banking by and large sets aside more effort for an exchange to process. In any case, by the methods for Blockchain, the whole exchange procedure can be made quicker, which can in the long run give a more advantageous encounter to the clients.DecentralizedBlockchains are decentralized in nature, which implies that the clients are given the all out possession access to their computerized resources, which are scrambled with an entrance key. The clients can subsequently, effectively move the resource for anybody, they need.Immutable and secureAn incorporated trade is inclined to hacking on the grounds that the database's security is absolutely reliant upon the outsider's trust. In contrast to this, on account of blockchain, the exchange subtleties are totally permanent and almost difficult to decipher. Similarly, as of late, Singapore's national bank, Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), has held hands with JPMorgan, the worldwide financial speculator to bring blockchain over the entirety of its verticals (Source: Project Ubin Report,2019).","31,156 followers",Phillip Remaker,1.7K,11K,78.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-potential-evolution-of-battery-technology-to-substantially-increase-the-range-of-electric-cars
