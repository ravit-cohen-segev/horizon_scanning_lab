6,"Not me, but my sister is a doctor.Firstly I'll mention her earnings, then what she sacrified to become a doctor.So, her earnings,While she was doing her internship (2013–2014), the stipend she used to get was 15,000 INR.Then, in 2015, she did a contract based job for 6 months and got some 70,000 INR.And now, in her PG, MD( obstetrics and gynaecology) she's getting 88,000.What all she sacrificed,Ummm, not only her, but us, her family too. :)Well we are a nuclear family of 5.

Mom, Dad, Deedo (i love calling her this), Me, Brother. She was born in 1991, me in 1996 and bro came to us in 2001. So, a gap of 5-years in 2 of us lead us in 3 different stages of life always, till date, unless all of us are adults.So, when i was in 6th standard and bro was in 1st, we had to bid goodbye to our didi to Chandigarh, 190 kms from our town, for her medical entrance exams coaching. You see, how little was he, 6.5 years old! And she was his favorite in house. He used to cry every evening missing her to be home. I used to sit beside her and chatter about my day for a long time and used to go to her taking every little problem, from personal to fights with bro to my homework and drawings, she would do it all. And now, i was the elder kid in home. That sucked. I barely used to talk to her on phone, as i just used to sit beside mom and listen to her conversation with Deedo, reason being, she had to study and i was an introvert. She used to visit us every 2.5 months only for 2 days, and used to cry everytime i bid her goodbye and take a promise from her that next time she would come soon. But no, to get something we have to lose. Papa Mumma missed her a lot, of course. Papa's favourite child. <3 Haha, and we were always happy with that. :)Okay, time passed, 2008, with God's grace, she got a great rank in All India Medical test exams for UG, she got MBBS in Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute, Bangalore. This time, 2024 kms away, but we were happy. Didi was going to be a Doctor. She used to visit us after every year for 15 days and we grew up almost without her. She graduated in March,2014, when i passed my 12th and bro was now in 7th standard. You see, he entered in teenage and me in adulthood, almost without her.Then she started to prepare for her MD entrance exams but luck didn't favour her for the first attempts.Decided to try again, second time and this time, she did a job for 6 months in Government hospital, 32 sector, Chandigarh to gain some experience, and to freshen up her mind from constant studying. This time,2015, she didn't get a rank of her choice so she decided to try again. Not an easy-peasy task, only medicos know this. Hats off to them!2016, second attempt, again, she wanted to clear for AIIMS or PGI, Chandigarh or a good government college in All India exam. Her wish, though, was to in AIIMS.But, 2017, not yet.3 years of her constant struggle, hard work and we had to be away from her. Why? Because in these 3 years, even when she was in home, no one from us was allowed to go her room. But we were happy, at least she was with us.I am a naughty kid at home (officially an adult but I'm a kid at home). I just used to open her room steadily, smile like an idiot, say Hi! And come back.Thank God🙏🏻2018, she got AIIMS, Delhi, her dream college and now she is in second year MD (obstetrics and gynaecology) working from 7 am in morning till 11 pm or sometimes even late till, 1 or 2 am. Holidays? Doctors don't get that. Okay, once per month. Since then 2018 , she has got home twice, once for one day and this time for 2-3 days. But, since Delhi, is an overnight journey, we get to go there sometimes.Brother is now 18.5 Years old, I'm almost 24, Missing her since 11 years. We love her like anything.Being doctor ain't easy. Almost every doctor's life is like that.She used to be little arrogant and stubborn but since she has been doing and completed her MBBS, she's turned into such a humble person that I'm shocked.I think, if soldiers protect us from border, doctors protect us in the border.",UNKNOWN,Mohana Krishna Padda (KrishCdbry),623,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-much-salary-should-I-expect-initially-in-BTech-food-technology-How-much-will-be-its-increment-in-the-upcoming-5-years

You could easily found European-brand cars in the street. Qatari likes to use European-brand clothes in daily basis. They hire foreign engineers like me for building their skyscrapers and streets. They hire migrant workers from under-developed countries to do hard-labour. Which is why Qatar is full of expats in the first place.Qatar is an utopia build from the sweat and tears of foreign workersHosting a World Cup is just a way for them to gain more foreign tourists, especially European tourists.

Any such web site that criticises Qatar's labour system is blocked.It was when I returned to India I came to learn about the horrible nature of the situation there. I read articles and saw news videos that explained the horrendous scene in Qatar. It made me unhappy to learn that the same situation was seen during the preparation for the Asian Games. On realising that I was blissfully ignorant of the plight of such workers during the preparation for the Asian Games made me sick.To puts things in perspective check the infographic below that compares worker deaths for various sporting events that took place over the past decade.SourceSourceWhat the Qatari authorities and FIFA don't see is that the people who died are not just a part of some statistic made by a foreign media house. But they are people from India, Bangladesh and Nepal who have families back home. These people came searching for greener pastures by taking up huge debts that their families will not be able to pay off. These people died not only because of the extreme heat but also because of the inept medical care provided for the injured and sick, shoddy work ethics, and lax safety standards followed in such construction projects they work in.  To further compound the situation these workers don't get any medical or life insurance  that can at least provide some financial respite to the worker and his family.Frankly I find the conditions of unskilled labourers better in India, a developing country with a low per capita income. Qatar being a nation that is constantly punching way above its weight should have put in effort to make the lives of such workers easier considering it has enough money to do so. At least the authorities could do is to compensate for the loss of the human lives that happened in Qatar's pursuit of achieving status and fame and provide justice to the families by punishing the companies that overtly flout the already toothless labour laws.Qatar instead of working to fix the situation is trying to silence any detractors or buy its way into garnering favourable positions on world bodies such as FIFA and IOC.People around the world have started campaigns to spread awareness of this situation. People made anti-logos of those  global brands, such as Coca Cola and SONY, that are going to sponsor the 2022 World Cup. I have added the link below with the other references if you want to see more.This is why I, with a heavy heart, want FIFA to take away Qatar's right to host the World Cup if nothing is done to alleviate the condition of these workers.This is why I, with a heavy heart, want FIFA to take away Qatar's right to host the World Cup if nothing is done to alleviate the condition of these workers.See:Edit2.
