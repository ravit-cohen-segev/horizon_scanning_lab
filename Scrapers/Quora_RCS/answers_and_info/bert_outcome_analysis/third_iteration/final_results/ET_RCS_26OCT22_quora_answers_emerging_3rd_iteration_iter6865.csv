Every year we’re alive, we accumulate more and more memories. The fact that we can store as much information as we can within the lump of meat between our ears is absolutely astonishing. That said, no brain has ever had to store more than around 120 years worth of memories.If you want to liveSo, we’re going to need to get memory density increase, or else a dedicated cloud storage device for our memories (or both). Also, we’ll need increases in processing power to handle all those memories.None of these defy the laws of physics, but there’s a limit. A person who lives for centuries, even millennia, will chew up a rather sizable amount of memory storage. In addition, there’s the problem of the increased population size. If this technology is made real, we’ve got an exponentially expanding population using an exponentially expanding amount of memory and processing power.This leads to the last issue: energy. The energy costs are going to increase rather staggeringly. We could easily need the total energy output of multiple stars just to power our minds.Eventually, forever is going to run out of hydrogen, and when it does, we’ll run out of energy to power ourselves. No matter what we do, no matter how hard we try, we appear to be powerless to halt the heat death of the universe.But, in the meantime, there is at least one good reason to pursue immortality — the incredible minds that we breed might well be able to halt that heat death, and let us truly live forever.","358,998 followers",Sean Kernan,4.6K,5.6K,727.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-medical-technology-will-eventually-develop-a-method-for-humans-to-live-forever

Biology is using normal, run of the mill, everyday atoms, just like everything else.Yes, and in the not too distant future.It is all but inevitable.There's only a few real pieces of knowledge that all but guarantee that inevitability.1. Biology is using normal, run of the mill, everyday atoms, just like everything else.Those 6 facts and 2 trends mean that aging will, unequivocally, be a solved problem in a time frame that in any historical perspective, is very soon. It's not going to take a thousand years to solve. In fact, it can be shown that our ability to manage complexity through Moore's law increases reaches the ability to have as many bytes of memory in your home computer as there are protons in the visible universe in less than 300 years.Cells are complicated, but nothing compared to that, so even the most pessimistic futurist out there, armed with these facts, has got to realize that aging will be solved in less than 300 years, and not just aging, but all diseases, and a way to go through life with a reasonable safety margin allowing us to avoid accidental death as well.But what the people working on today are doing is a bit less extreme than that. They are working on point solutions to handle the most common problems that will cause the greatest advantage to the most people in the shortest amount of time. Most are trying to find a more direct path, something that doesn't require that level of understanding, but is still demonstrably affective with the state of technology that we can muster today.There 2 approaches there that are doing the most with the least, that strike me as being furthest along doing all that is possible with the less advanced technology of today to try to make up for the fact that we were born too soon for this to be a slam dunk easy project that it will be to our progeny 300 years hence.One is known as SENS,The other company is taking an entirely different approach, which is to essentially build time machines that transport people to that future when atoms are under our complete control regardless of the complexity. Of course we are nowhere near having a DeLorean that can transport anyone safely 300 years ahead but there is a simpler approach which is to just freeze cells in place using the best technology of today to do it, and carefully funding themselves well enough to run and survive as an organization designed to last long enough for that time to come. That organization, TheThese are just 2 organizations that happen to be committed to giving us the best chance possible at a future of unlimited health. But these are the 2 that have worked hard, despite the science fiction like charter that they possess, to be totally upfront with all of their research and progress in an open fashion in ways that are open for anyone to examine and find out more about them. Both are non-profits, and so are not engaged in the kind of trade secrets approach that most of the other organizations engage in who might be competitive with them.There are other companies, many that have been in existence for decades, devoted to similar goals. Only recently, with more successful tech entrepreneurs understanding the validity of their approaches, and with technology itself continually advancing, have these companies started being talked about in main stream press with more respect and consideration.Of course there's always the person who is going to throw out the scarcity argument, that we can't possibly keep coming up with discoveries to get better at using energy or land or some such, and the people who will point out that the sun is going to heat up in a few hundred million years.  I kind of think that our track record facing the former, and the time we have at our disposal to worry about the latter make those not such serious concerns as people suppose.","2,081 followers",Nurav Lagdum,20.6K,131,1.3M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-medical-technology-will-eventually-develop-a-method-for-humans-to-live-forever

This will be enormous library of data about us. Apart from sequencing, we need to understand the role of every gene in our bodies. This is where supercomputers come, making possible to simulate proteins folding and interactions. Current supercomputers are able to simulate behavior of any single protein. But in order to simulate complex cellular environment, we need supercomputers 100000 faster - which are expected around 2030. When we understand the role of each gene, we will be able to determine what changes in genes are necessary to live longer. Then we need a way to perform these changes on adult humans. There are also research programs in this area, and in 20 years they might be possible to perform such operation:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC392180/But understanding human DNA will not be enough. If we want to prolong our lives to more than 120 years, we need to use DNA from other species. Naked mole rats are good starting point, because they live 10 times longer than other rodents.Genome sequencing unlocks the mysteries of naked mole ratTheir genes might allow us to prolong our lives to 300 or 400 years. Then we will have at lest 200 years to devise a way to prolong our lives further. We will think of something.EDIT: When I wrote this answer there was no known way to make arbitrary changes in genome.

The thing is we have to take a look at the innards of a country to really know whether or not you are truly developed. That Chinese are so obsessed with portraying the facade that they are technologically advanced and ahead is actually an indication that they have not fully developed yet. Because fully developed countries have no need to show off things like that. Everyone knows they are developed.For example, here is San Francisco:Look, not many skyscrapers right? And look at those old cable cars going around! That must mean they are undeveloped right? Nope. Everyone knows San Francisco is a developed city. That’s why it has no need to show off with luxury skyscrapers and such things.Or how about Florence, Italy?Again, no skyscrapers here. But everyone knows it’s a developed city and Italy is a developed country.My point is, you have got to look at the people and the innards of a country to truly know if they are developed.This is the true face of China:You have got to look at the average person. Does the average Chinese have good access to healthcare (which is ranked near the bottom in WHO rankings btw)? Can they drink tap water safely? Do they have access to quality food? Do all have access to electricity or paved roads or a quality education? The answer is: probably, yes, if you are living in the rich east coast provinces of Jiangsu or Zhejiang or Guangdong- but not if you are living in say - Xinjiang or Gansu or Tibet. China’s wealth is not spread equally, neither is it developed equally. Even though the CCP has developed China quite fast - there is still a lot of work to be done making sure *every Chinese* have equal access to everything.And then you got to look at the attitude of the people. When I was in China I found that you really got to look out for who you trust, because there is a lot of scams going on all the time. You never know what is real, what is fake, what is real price of anything. Why do these scams exist? Because people have to be desperate to make money that’s why.Why are people desperate to make money? Probably because they are not making enough to survive, which is an indication that the country is still developing. You’ll notice that in general, the more developed a country is, the less likely there will be scams. In Korea/Japan/Taiwan, you will not find very many scams. In China and Eastern Europe it’s likely.Another aside I want to note is that Chinese bathrooms don’t contain any toilet paper. Do you know the reason why? It’s because people steal it. Now, in what developed country does this happen? I can’t think of any. Only in a developing country would you need to bring your own toilet paper to the bathroom because there isn’t any there due to fear of people stealing it.I find GDP/capita to be generally a pretty good indicator of how developed a country is. The average GDP/capita (PPP) of China is still around $8k/person. While that is higher than most Asian countries - it’s still below the 4 East Asian tigers + Japan and far from the $62k/person that the USA has.The true measure of a developed society is to observe the people that live in the country and not the appearance of the country itself. Chinese “face” culture is the same. You can just obviously see that China has developed really really fast, and mentality wise people are still harping about luxury products and consumerism - this is where Americans were back in the 50s, 60s and 70s, not now.The biggest consumers of luxury products are Chinese people, not Americans or Europeans. The more developed you are, the less need you have to validate your self worth with materialism. The less desire you have to spend thousands of dollars on your children's schooling just to send them to be educated abroad. The less need to travel to countries like Canada or USA for giving birth so that your child becomes a US or Canadian citizen, or to launder your money by buying up real estate in other countries. Developed countries do not need to do things like that.Thats why you should always pay attention to the old adage -Edit:Of course, Chinese commenters love to bring up the USA. Yes, USA has lots of impoverished areas too; every country has developed areas and undeveloped areas, however my point is that for China there is significantly more undeveloped areas at a higher % compared to the USA. The poverty rate for China is 16% as of 2019 and for USA it is 1.5% as of 2019.

The Middle Kingdom considered itself the middle of the universe and the emperor considered himself the middle of the middle!He therefore lacked interest in outside trade because he felt the kingdom already had all the resources and technology it needed to satisfy his wildest imaginations.ConcubinesAnd like the emperor, we should ask ourselves…To reflect on this question, sit on Daddy’s lap, and let me tell you a story about a Chinese farmer and a Western businessman…The Fisherman and The BusinessmanA businessman took a short vacation to a small Chinese coastal village. Unable to sleep he walked the pier. A small boat with just one fisherman had docked and inside the boat were several large tuna.“Only a little while”“Why don’t you stay out longer and catch more fish?”“I have enough to support my family and give a few to friends,”“But …. What do you do with the rest of your time?”The fisherman looked up and smiled,The businessman laughedThe fisherman asked“15- 20 years, 25 tops”“But what then?”The businessman laughed and said“Millions? Then what?”The businessman replied,Where this anecdote can be misleading is it presumes theBut what if the businessman continued by saying,The fisherman must then eitherThis would make the anecdote more historically accurate.Because if the Chinese fisherman was a metaphor forThis is also true for today.If a country or corporation becomes too satisfied then they’ll eventually be conquered by the competition.But what if there was no competition?If there wasn’t a West then Imperial China would likely still exist. Keep in mind a Chinese person of 1400 A.D. lived a remarkably similar life to a person of 1800 A.D and so it’s conceivable to believe that without the West a Chinese person of 1800 A.D. would live a similar life to a person of 2200 A.D.And life was better for the Chinese when they were stuck in theIn businessIn governmentLet’s go forward in time…I believe the pace of change will eventually slow down as global power continues to centralize into fewer and fewer hands.Eventually the global elite will come together under the premise,Now hopefully this decision will be made by some sort of coalition of democratic nations.Because if it doesn’t happen through democratic consensus then it will happen by dictatorial decree.“Artificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia but for all humankind, whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.” — Vladimir PutinBecause left unabated the race for better A.I. will eventually lead to someone getting the upper-hand and so, for example, the Chinese could unlock an artificial intelligence so powerful it gives them control over all the global satellites and therefore the globe.And then they would build a metaphorical great wall around any further technological development that could threaten their power, and then who knows, the world could slowly devolve back into something that looks a little like Imperial China.And as long as there aren’t any alien forces lurking upon the horizon, technology could stay stopped for a long, long time because the only people who could tear down the wall would be the people guarding it.I hope this answer gives you a greater sense of purpose because we can control how the wall is built.

If not, go bankrupt for all we care.” And they gave those development contracts to multiple companies, so NASA wouldn’t be dependent on any particular one succeeding.That’s an oversimplified answer, of course, since we’re still talking thousand-page Federal government contracts. But it gives you the right mental image.",10 followers,Andrew Forrest,2.3K,6.2K,16.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-medical-technology-will-eventually-develop-a-method-for-humans-to-live-forever
15,"Besides rockets, SpaceX is developing other technology directly related to the exploration and settlement of outer space.One of the most notable developments is their own spacesuit:Spacesuits are not new technology but this is the first time that a company has gone the extra mile to blend functionality with fashion in a spacesuit. The suit (probably) does not use any fancy technology specific to SpaceX, but it is one piece of equipment that they have invested a lot of effort in developing.The next (and one of the most interesting) pieces of innovation at SpaceX is the fueling plant for their BBesides rockets, SpaceX is developing other technology directly related to the exploration and settlement of outer space.One of the most notable developments is their own spacesuit:Spacesuits are not new technology but this is the first time that a company has gone the extra mile to blend functionality with fashion in a spacesuit.

It will utilize locally sources water and carbon dioxide to make liquid oxygen and methane propellant. This methane propellant is made through a chemical process called the Sabatier process, and SpaceX is currently developing the infrastructure to allow them to collect the H2O and CO2 necessary for making propellant using this process. Their architecture for a refueling station will look something like this:","68,811 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-medical-technology-will-eventually-develop-a-method-for-humans-to-live-forever

Learning is a continuous process, but as far as I understand based on the trends, JS frameworks are dominating the web like anything. Even if you know only PHP/Python, without JS frameworks knowledge you will still be behind the race.","82,153 followers",Quincy Larson,2.9K,358,29.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-medical-technology-will-eventually-develop-a-method-for-humans-to-live-forever
