2,"The more interesting question is how we managed to avoid extinction in the first place. Why it took us so long to get where we are technologically is pretty well documented in our history. It took us long enough to climb out of the trees and stand. Sharp stones and sticks and finally fire helped us barely survive a world that conspired at every turn against us, and was not prepared to grant us the time needed to settle and advance . It may also have required us to first mate with the larger brained neanderthals, to provide that necessary intelligence that helped us develop the complex languageThe more interesting question is how we managed to avoid extinction in the first place.

Sharp stones and sticks and finally fire helped us barely survive a world that conspired at every turn against us, and was not prepared to grant us the time needed to settle and advance . It may also have required us to first mate with the larger brained neanderthals, to provide that necessary intelligence that helped us develop the complex language and writing skills needed to store, perpetuate and add to the knowledge that compounded and accelerated over the centuries. Keep in mind that it was only a bit over two thousand years ago in ancient Greece that the birth of the western scientific method, and the earliest forms of secular philosophy, skepticism and atheism occured. These helped inspire the Enlightenment. Which finally broke the shackles of superstition, that for centuries constrained the human mind from seeing and understand the real world and universe around it, and by doing so unlocked our potential to greatly expand our knowledge. Granting us the means to harness nature and create wondrous things. Therefore the physical cerebral attributes necessary for our enlightenment may have occurred millenia ago during a great ice age, while the first glimmer of light into the natural world was cast in a tiny little Mediterranean peninsula but two millenia past, and the final and full emancipation of humanities mind began in Europe just a handful of lifetimes ago. Why be disappointed that we are not further advanced, is it not enough that we have achieved so much, and will continue to pursue knowledge and accomplish even more.",78 followers,Rajan Singh,1.5K,360,25.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/With-how-quickly-are-humans-known-to-advance-technologically-how-are-we-not-further-ahead-if-we-have-been-around-hundreds-of-thousands-of-years
3,"Progress is not a one way arrow. It can go backwards. As evidenced by Anti-vaxers, Trump, Brexit, etc.Inventions get forgotten, for example batteries. War, despots or famine means capital intensive technologiess don't get invested in, and the skills are lost. The cause does not have to be as major, and can be as fickle as fashion or superstition.Religion is also a suppression.How we are so far advanced recently is because the technical revolutions are overlapping, where previously there were long gaps after an new technology before another came along.","4,371 followers",Michael J Zupon,802,3.2K,4.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/With-how-quickly-are-humans-known-to-advance-technologically-how-are-we-not-further-ahead-if-we-have-been-around-hundreds-of-thousands-of-years

5,"Human technology has only been improving since about 1800. Before that we had the tools we had and we worked with he concept of individual craftsman making each item. They would be similar, they would not be exactly the same as happens with industrial manufacturing.I think war is one of the events that pushed back to the manufacturing process to get things exactly the same.A saw that is almost the same as your last saw is not an issue.Lead ball ammunition where each musket has to have its own unique casting unit for making ammunition for THAT gun is horrible for fighting wars.

The trigger broke, let me make 1 from scratch because it is different that all the other muskets is a much higher skill set than pulling a trigger from spares and replacing it. As well as needed the skills, tools, and fire to make it.Henry Ford had the first “modern” assembly line plant and it has expanded from there. It opened in 1913 and took production time on a vehicle from 12 hours to 2.5 hours.(What color would you like your Model T? It can be any color as long as that color is black.)We are now in a use and throw away economy. I suspect we will swing back from this extreme at some point. That means ball point pens and clothes washers and automobiles.It would be unthinkable today to craft each item individually as there is no economy in that behavior.Humans almost died off about 70,000 thousand years ago because we were having a small ice age and a volcano blew up and made it into a 6 year bad weather and low temperature event. Crops were killed from the hot fallout and people starved to death, globally. It is estimated that humanity was down to as few as 40 breeding pairs of humans, 80 adults capable of reproducing.We clawed our way back from that extreme point to 1 billion humans in 1803.One last bit of perspective. You do not get people thinking about manufacturing when all you are trying to do is get enough food on the table. The improvements come to society when there is enough “extra” to give people the time to think about something beyond feeding their family.Best of luck.","2,052 followers",Aaron Jantzen,1.7K,3.4K,13.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/With-how-quickly-are-humans-known-to-advance-technologically-how-are-we-not-further-ahead-if-we-have-been-around-hundreds-of-thousands-of-years
6,"Technological advances are not individual things. Someone doesn’t just invent the light bulb, or plastics, or lasers.The first great invention was probably Agriculture. It allowed humans to move from hunter gatherers to builders of settled cultures. The problem was, there were so many threats. Insects, drought, flood, weather, soil exhaustion, and other humans. Diseases kill hundreds, thousands. So societies formed and grew, and then died out.

The problem was, there were so many threats. Insects, drought, flood, weather, soil exhaustion, and other humans. Diseases kill hundreds, thousands. So societies formed and grew, and then died out. This happened over and over for thousands of years.Eventually things like the plough and the wheel, and domesticated animals came into play, and societies grew bigger and slowly advanced. Primitive writing, metal working, roads, better transport. Societies became rich enough that some people didn’t have to spend all their time working on the land or fighting off other hostile tribes and cultures. They could spend time just thinking and experimenting. So human learning started to accelerate.But still, learning about the world was a hit and miss thing. Nobody knew anything. There was no one you could ask if you had a problem. You had to do it all from the ground up, everywhere, over and over. IP, just like now, was valuable. If I knew how to make a boat that didn’t leak and sink, I’m not going to tell anybody. I’d make boats and sell them. Then I get old or sick and die. My boat making skill dies with me. Maybe my workers remember bits and pieces. So they try to duplicate my work. Maybe they succeed, maybe they don’t. More time passes.Some Daoist genius in ancient China mixes some powders together in just the right proportions heats it up, and a burst of flame burns his beard off. He realises he has something. He tries again. This time he is more careful and puts the powder in a jar with a small hole. He pushes a smouldering stick into the hole. The jar explodes. He has invented gunpowder! But he is also dead. On another mountain another Daoist priest mixes some powder …Now, taking a helicopter view, imagine someone sees lighting and thinks “Wouldn’t it be great if I could make lighting on a smaller scale”. But static electricity has yet to be discovered. Metal working has not progressed enough to easily make wire. Nobody knows about magnets, Nobody knows about insulators, or batteries. And yet all of these things need to be on hand to do anything useful with electricity.In other words, technological advancement only accelerated in relatively recent times because we had accumulated many many bits and pieces of knowledge and had started to put them together. Just like a jigsaw puzzle, if some pieces are missing you can’t solve it. The trouble is, you don’t know what is missing until you try, and fail. Then you have to figure out what is supposed to be on the missing pieces, and actually make them.Remember, in Word War 1, most of the transport was still done with animals.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/With-how-quickly-are-humans-known-to-advance-technologically-how-are-we-not-further-ahead-if-we-have-been-around-hundreds-of-thousands-of-years

This enough to be careful while using fire.What can happen to me after 1 year or 1 decade can not be predicted. If there is any planning some thing can be said.
