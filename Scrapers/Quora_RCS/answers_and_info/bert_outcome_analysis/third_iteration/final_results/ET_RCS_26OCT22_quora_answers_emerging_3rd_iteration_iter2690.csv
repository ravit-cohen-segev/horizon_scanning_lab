3,"Because there's so much expected to happen in the next decade, there isn't going to be only one great technological advancement in the 2020s. There's going to be advancements in all fields of science and technology. People will be returning to the moon for the first time in sixty years for one. That in itself will lead to many advancements. Automation is already becoming increasingly prevalent and will only get more so as time goes on. Genetic modification has made leaps and bounds in the last decade and can only keep going from here as the CRISPR method is fine tuned.Really there's no one ansBecause there's so much expected to happen in the next decade, there isn't going to be only one great technological advancement in the 2020s.

That in itself will lead to many advancements. Automation is already becoming increasingly prevalent and will only get more so as time goes on. Genetic modification has made leaps and bounds in the last decade and can only keep going from here as the CRISPR method is fine tuned.Really there's no one answer to this question. What I have provided is only a small portion of my most optimistic predictions. What's a better question is what kind of social and political developments will be made in the 2020s. We live in the darkest times since 9/11. Racism and prejudice is on the rise, civil wars displace millions, the economic disparity between the rich and everyone else grows astronomically, and the American government refuses to acknowledge climate change just to fill their pockets. I honestly worry about our future with all this in mind.But we must be optimistic. Those of us who despise all this terrible stuff happening, we must rise up and say “NO!” to the dictators, the bigots, and the fools. Only by resisting these sources of suffering can we work to making life better for everyone. If everyone wants to change the world, there's little beyond global cataclysm that could stop that change. Futurism isn't just about the technology that may arise in the future, it's about thinking of how people will be in the future. By working towards making people not be terrible, we prevent all those dystopias we write about in fiction.","68,796 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-do-we-expect-to-be-the-greatest-technological-advancements-in-the-2020s

It will have to be larger and almost certainly fully automated.Another reason for the increased weapon capacity is that some of the weapons will be smaller, such as the Swedish lightweight torpedoes, which are loaded two to a tube. Or the Northrop Grumman-developed Very Lightweight Torpedo (VLWT). These can be employed against lower-value targets, which are currently a difficulty for submarines equipped only with high-cost torpedoes. They can also be employed to intercept enemy torpedoes.The mini AUVs on board will be utilised to enhance the submarine's sensor range. ""I can readily imagine that pricey submarines with a human crew on board may stay silent and deep, deploying or remotely-controlling a range of air, surface, and underwater autonomous or semi-autonomous systems.Drones and submarines will work together as part of a network thanks to new secure, separate underwater communications technologies.Due of the difficulty in determining whether a target is a friend or adversary, today's submarines are mostly lone wolves.Armed drones, which lack human judgement, face an even greater issue.However, next-generation undersea communications technology has the potential to transform the game.There are rumours that vertical launch mechanisms will be phased out.Torpedo chambers are more adaptable, allowing for faster launches of weapons or drones.XLUUVs (XL uncrewed underwater vehicles) are extremely large drones that can be transported.Consider them to be miniature unmanned submarines with their own warfighting skills.These, however, will require their own infrastructure.",UNKNOWN,DurgaPrasad (దుర్గా ప్రసాద్),546,183,3.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-do-we-expect-to-be-the-greatest-technological-advancements-in-the-2020s

Enter the Type XXI U-boat:Compared to the Type VII that it was intended to replace, the Type XXI was quieter, making it more difficult for Allied ships to detect. At the same time, it featured a much more hydrodynamically efficient hull design that permitted better underwater performance than previous submarines. As a comparison, the Type VIIc could make about 8 knots when submerged while the Type XXI could reach 17 knots under the same conditions. Such speed meant that the vessel could get into an attack position more swiftly while also being more difficult to intercept. Endurance, meanwhile, had also considerably improved over the older boats.However, of the 118 Type XXI U-boats completed, only a small number ever became operational before the war ended and their capabilities were never truly tested in combat. Although U-2511 was stalking a Royal Navy cruiser when it received Germany's ceasefire order.After the conclusion of hostilities, a number of Type XXIs were captured and tested extensively by the Allies, who were obviously quite interested in the Germans’ innovations in submarine design.As a result of the studies conducted by the nations that were able to get their hands on a Type XXI, the submarine classes that were designed in the years immediately following World War II borrowed heavily upon the German warship.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-do-we-expect-to-be-the-greatest-technological-advancements-in-the-2020s
