With this revolutionary technology, humans have successfully colonized the entire Solar System, allowing them to travel from Earth to Mars, to back again with relative ease. What once would have taken years to travel to, can now be achieved in a matter of seconds.Sounds easy-peasy right?Well there is a catch, of course!YouIf you are conscious while Jaunting, you will go insane, your consciousness doomed to an eternity of oblivion.Imagine being left to only your thoughts, in an endless field of white, for what would feel like billions of years, your sanity slowly disintegrating and mind starting to auto-cannibalize itself.“How long in there, in terms of years? 0.000000000067 seconds for the body to Jaunt, but how long for the unparticulated consciousness? A hundred years? A thousand? A million? A billion? How long alone with your thoughts in an endless field of white? And then, when a billion eternities have passed, the crashing return of light and form and body. Who wouldn't go insane?”For this reason, every person who goes under the Jaunt must be asleep and unconscious. The solution to this is to put everyone under general anesthesia before take-off.But what happens to the poor unfortunate souls who don’t go to sleep? Here is what happened to little Ricky, who held his breath while the attendants administered the anesthesia.The thing that had been his son bounced and writhed on its Jaunt couch, a twelve-year old boy with a snow-white fall of hair and eyes which were incredibly ancient, the corneas gone a sickly yellow. Here was a creature older than time masquerading as a boy; and yet it bounced and writhed with a kind of horrid, obscene glee, and at its choked, lunatic cackles the Jaunt attendants drew back in terror. Some of them fled, although they had been trained to cope with just such an unthinkable eventuality. The old-young legs twitched and quivered. Claw hands beat and twisted and danced on the air; abruptly they descended and the thing that had been his son began to claw at its face. ""Longer than you think, Dad!"" it cackled. ""Longer than you think! Held my breath when they gave me the gas! Wanted to see! I saw! I saw! Longer than you think!"" Cackling and screeching, the thing on the Jaunt couch suddenly clawed its own eyes out. Blood gouted. The recovery room was an aviary of screaming voices now. ""Longer than you think, Dad! I saw! I saw! Long Jaunt! Longer than you think-""It said other things before the Jaunt attendants were finally able to bear it away, rolling its couch swiftly away as it screamed and clawed at the eyes that had seen the unseeable forever and ever; it said other things, and then it began to scream, but Mark Oates didn't hear it because by then he was screaming himself.So remember kids, always go to sleep, so you don’t turn into a creep.In all seriousness, this is probably one of the creepiest technologies available because it combines my 2 biggest fears:It just seems so tempting too. It’s like the elephant game. Tell someone not to think of an elephant. Then they probably automatically think of elephants! Same theory goes with Jaunting, I am sure after being told not to be awake during Jaunting only helped to increase Ricky’s curiosity. And I can relate to that.Also, the Jaunt technology opens up all sorts of sinister possibilities. The Jaunt is purported to have been used by tinpot dictators to get rid of political dissidents, and imagine if someone with connections kicked you awake into a Jaunt portal, while closing up the other exit, leaving you screaming in limbo for eternity….Anyways, I got a flight to catch, see you on the other side of Io, loser.The Jaunt - Stephen King (large text for mobile).pdf","220,632 followers",Franklin Veaux,5.7K,47.3K,783M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-far-away-are-we-from-developing-an-autodoc-such-as-that-found-in-the-science-fiction-of-Larry-Niven-among-others-To-what-extent-do-you-think-this-technology-will-be-predicated-on-the-development-of-nanites

The earth will cease to be habitable in one year unless scientists put an atomic bomb on the core to start it spinning again.I swear I am not making this up.Why did the core stop spinning? Because evil government scientists were testing an earthquake machine to use as a weapon, only instead of making earthquakes it somehow stopped the core.This stopped the earth’s magnetic field, which caused birds to drop from the sky, created a lightning bolt that blew up the Roman Coliseum—no, really—and caused a beam of microwave radiation from outer space to melt the Golden Gate Bridge.Somehow, all the cars that are on the bridge at the time don’t melt. But no matter. Still with me so far? Good. What’s the solution?The good scientists must use a burrowing machine to take an atom bomb down to the core.So they put an astronaut with the Professor and the Skipper into a lava submarine—yes, again I’m being serious—and dig down with their atomic bomb to blow up the core and, in the words of one character, ““hack the planet.” (Did I mention the dialogue makes",469 followers,Daniel Cohort,11.9K,377,1.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-far-away-are-we-from-developing-an-autodoc-such-as-that-found-in-the-science-fiction-of-Larry-Niven-among-others-To-what-extent-do-you-think-this-technology-will-be-predicated-on-the-development-of-nanites

The reason for doing this is redundancy, the mission won’t fail if one engine fails and it’s cheaper to develop (and maybe manufacture) a smaller engine and use multiples than creating one big-ass engine.Question:",UNKNOWN,Dr. Swapnil Rajput,739,0,0,UNKNOWN,https://www.quora.com/How-far-away-are-we-from-developing-an-autodoc-such-as-that-found-in-the-science-fiction-of-Larry-Niven-among-others-To-what-extent-do-you-think-this-technology-will-be-predicated-on-the-development-of-nanites

They cupped their mouth tight. You know, toA group of boys stood there, bewildered. Their eyes were full of puzzle. One guy definitely looked scared. His eyes screamed: “Is she gonna be okay?”A few girls joined the escorts to help them.The struggling girl waded past all these groups toward the restroom.I quickly dispersed the onlookers and directed them to go to their classrooms.Whenever I see a girl going through periods, I do not see much of her. I see much of others.It shows me their inner being.In my sessions, whenever I see a girl in discomfort, I can guess what that is. I casually walk to the girl and ask her to help herself. I usually request a few other girls to walk her out.No mayhem. No ruckus.Also, girls in my class know that they can always walk out if they should. Just like that.But I should admit that it took some time for me to gain their trust. Whenever they approached me hesitantly, I reacted with a nonchalant shrug.“Hey, do you wanna use the restroom?

Sony has Morpheus. GearVR is actually an excellent VR platform (and it's just a phone!).  AMD has a VR initiative. Microsoft jumps in with Hololens. Unity and Unreal (and Cryengine, etc.) announce VR support.Lets look at whats happening;It's a very open community, everyone is thrilled with the tech and want to show off how they did what they did. *Everyone* is very open to helping each other - for example my company asked Oculus for some stereo video codec help - we got some source code written by John Carmack. Awesome! Everyone is enthusiastic.I left my safe tech job in PC graphics in early 2014 to pursue a job working in VR. I now know of work being done for Oculus, Vive, Morpheous, GearVR, Meta, Magic Leap, and a few others. I'm blessed to work in a company that has many connections with these technologies.  It's awesome. When I put out product, and  let folks try it for the first time, I see what Carmack has called Oculus face. And I get that warm feeling in the pit of my stomach. *This* is why we work on this tech.We are currently working on VR projects that will not be done till 2016. They are *that* big in scope. All the tech companies and many commercial companies are jumping on the VR bandwagon. You will see an explosion of VR videos. Of VR ""experiences"". I foresee some really cool experimental stuff that only exists in VR.  VR is an experience like no other. Just drop you mom into a VR experience and see what happens. It's a disruptive tech. It's awesome.The end of 2015 will see some consumer product come out. There will be a consolidation of tracking and input devices. More product will come out in 2016. Samsung is leading  the mobile VR effort. Cardboard is surprisingly workable. The VR marketplace has gotten better in the last year, and from all observations it's going to be even better next year. The hardware will just get better and better - it's already happening.The folks behind this are the best in the world - and by that I mean they are smart, enthusiastic, and sharing. Oculus in particular has a stellar team of folks. AMD, Nvidia, Valve, Epic, Unreal, etc. all have greatly increased their VR/AR teams in the last 18 months. Microsoft, Samsung, etc. have all had folks working on this for a while. Apple recently joined :-). Folks  everywhere are ramping up their VR teams, big time.My personal belief is that this will be a ""big thing"". A lot of other companies who are not known to follow a fad are also following VR. Once you try a good VR experience, you are usually a convert. Once you do that, there's usually no question in your mind if this will ""work"". Where will it end up? I doubt it will fade away - the technology, the ambition, the creativity, the manufacturing capabilities are all aligned. There is enough sheer momentum from true believers  to carry this forward for a while. There is a desire to push this into everyone's hands.So what the current state of VR? A  ground swell of support for VR in general. Consumer hardware about to hit in about 9-18 months.  The current state-of-the-art is jaw dropping. The soon-to-be-revealed tech is even better. Price point from $5 to $200 to ~$1200 (casual, consumer, gamer). I've played a (custom made) FPS in VR - you really have to aim! It's very different. It's awesome. It's like nothing you've ever experienced before.So... yeah, I think its a good bet.",0 followers,Sandeep Kaur,4.3K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-non-chemical-space-engine-in-development-at-the-moment-If-yes-by-who-If-no-what-kind-of-technology-will-may-reach-this-phase-in-the-future

16,"Well, this didn't happen to me, but to my friend’s friend. Hold your breath ladies and gentlemen!!For privacy puroses, let's assume her name Alex. She used to work untill late in the evenings. On the way back home, everyday she needed to go through a local park, as that was the shortest way. On the usual evenings, there's always few old people sitting on bench and gossiping. So she never had any fear of walking alone in the dark through the park.Though one day, she worked quite later than usual. On the way back home, she felt a little hesitation to go through the park, as it was darker than usWell, this didn't happen to me, but to my friend’s friend. Hold your breath ladies and gentlemen!!For privacy puroses, let's assume her name Alex. She used to work untill late in the evenings. On the way back home, everyday she needed to go through a local park, as that was the shortest way. On the usual evenings, there's always few old people sitting on bench and gossiping. So she never had any fear of walking alone in the dark through the park.Though one day, she worked quite later than usual. On the way back home, she felt a little hesitation to go through the park, as it was darker than usual plus the fact that she knew there wouldn't be anyone sitting on the bench at this time. But anyhow, she chose to go through the park, as that was the shortest way. As soon as she entered the park, she heard some noise from her back. She turned her head, there was a man who was quickly running towards her. Oh damn! she started walking fast. She looked back again to see him, but to her surprise, the man stopped chasing her. After few seconds, Alex looked back again to see him. What the heck!! he was walking so fast towards Alex again. She started praying so hard and started running. But to her surprise again, the man stopped chasing her and started walking in opposite direction. This happened four times, the last time he was so close to Alex, that it was mere 4–5 feet distance and she could clearly see his face. Luckily, she was out of the park by then and felt so much relief.No, that wasn't the horror part. Few days later, she saw the same person in the news arrested for a rape and following murder. Alex was shocked to see the same man for those charges. He could've hurt Alex too that day, but why he didn't do anything that day when he could. Was he just playing around or scarring her like this?Alex went to police station to report that incident and to see him. Finally, she was able to speak to him and ask him that why he didn't hurt her that day if this was all he was planning that day too.The man’s answer shocked Alex.He said because there were so many people with you.“What?? No, I was alone.” Alex said.“You were alone before, but as soon as I was approaching you, few people came and asked me to leave you. I went back, but then I saw you were walking alone. I started chasing you again, then more people came and told me to leave. I was surprised how come so many people come at once and that too this late at night. The last time I tried to come close to you, their shouts were so loud that I couldn't bear. They also told me that they would kill me if I don't leave you alone. So, I just ran away from there.”That was even more shivering than what happened to Alex that day.

We’ll get out.Within 60 seconds we could feel the condensation from our body heat already dripping off the door wall.We tried to force the door open. Nothing!We screamed. Nothing.

I’m having an internal panic attack.Was there enough oxygen? Would any housekeeping staff come?Long story short, we didn’t die. We got out. I had a credit card in my pocket. She had her phone. We found a shaky WiFi connection, downloaded the skype app, used the light on her phone to read the numbers on my credit card. Bought Skype credit. Looked up the hotel and phoned them. No answer. Called the hotel next door… they answered!She cried Help us! We are stuck in the hotel next door!They said okay they’ll come talk to our front desk. A few minutes later we heard knocking on the outside to the room's door. We screamed for help.Finally after over an hour, they opened the door and we collapsed, covered in sweat, the door dripping from the condensation of our breath and body heat.The entire housekeeping staff was there.Their response?

Why did they bother?I began to realize that the web offered a new venue for a natural human spirit of generosity, of sharing. People love to help others. It is a very deep instinct, and probably more responsible for our civilization than is generally recognized.  We gain pleasure when we do it.Wikipedia is also such a miracle. It is amazing how good a job it does. I grew up with the Encyclopedia Brittanica, and Wikipedia goes so far beyond it that it is amazing.  Many people contribute to improving the Wikipedia web sites, just out of the pleasure they get in doing a good thing, in helping to create something so well-done. Jimmy Wales should be given a Nobel Peace Prize.Quora, in my mind, is the latest discovery of a method to extend this instinct to help others. I am addicted. If I have the right answer to a question, I really enjoy sharing it. Unlike email, Quora shares the questions and answers with thousands of other people. In fact, many people don't even realize that they have a question until they see someone else posting it.","47,951 followers",Jedidiah Benhur Margoschis Wisely,4.9K,168,18.3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/When-will-we-have-the-capability-to-record-and-share-virtual-experiences-just-as-we-so-thoroughly-share-glimpses-of-our-lives-through-photos-and-videos-today-What-developing-technologies-will-lead-to-this
