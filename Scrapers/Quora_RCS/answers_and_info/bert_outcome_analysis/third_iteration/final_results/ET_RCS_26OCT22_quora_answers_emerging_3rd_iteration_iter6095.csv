This new field is “quantum mechanical engineering (non-particle)”. Advantages from this new technology will pave to the way for future mechanical inventions with improvements in all performance areas.The permanent nut fastener is an example. It combines an ancient machine, (threaded fastener date back to before the days of the Roman Empire) with quantum mechanics to create a superior technology.It is the only nut design that does not use friction for vibration resistance. Instead of friction, it uses ""the difference of relative space/time"" in thread timing, and is the only nut fastener design that is vibration-proof. The technology uses “space/time compression”, derived from the “twisting of space/time” and based on a “black hole”, with a twist.Unsurpassed in all performance areas (torque, proof load, clamp load, max. load and material strength vibration resistance), and appears and installs like a conventional nut. You remove it the same way as a conventional nut, but all of the threads will strip off of the bolt, destroying both the nut and bolt in the process. It won’t come off unless you want it to.Performance so extreme, you can cut a bolted joint in quarters and retain pressure and engagement. It also retains pressure even if the bolt head is removed and cut in half.Advanced technology such as this, will allow mankind to achieve the next level, in all engineering fields. Performance that is impossible using Newtonian science.",UNKNOWN,Guy D. McCardle,516,6.6K,129.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-do-IMAX-and-other-technologies-emerge-in-the-film-industry

While the US is still leading in number of published articles and granted patents, these are increasingly written and invented byAnd it’s really no wonder. China outperforms the US in PISA results, and since a few years back, also on raw spending on R&D counted in dollars. In expenditure on R&D per capita, the US ranks fourth in the world; in R&D as percentage of GDP, the US ranks 11th. The US is not investing nearly enough to maintain the technological edge, and hasn’t done for quite some time.And I might be stating the obvious here, but one thing that the US definitely has no need for at this point is a leadership that scoffs at science and derides experts.

The new luxury will be safety from infection, freedom from viral danger.Given all this, the virus doesn't discriminate. It kills children and the aged, preachers and politicians, people who clean bedpans and billionaires. The virus cannot be intimidated. It's not afraid of rhetoric and bluster. It cannot be lied about because the virus contains its own truth in its genetic structure, in its power of replication, and in its power to infect and to kill.Our ability to affect our own destiny is diminished.
