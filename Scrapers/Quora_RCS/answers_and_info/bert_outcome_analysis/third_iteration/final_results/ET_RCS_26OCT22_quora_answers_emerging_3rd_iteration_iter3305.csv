3,Taiwan is ahead of China in terms of Technology and Quality.Right now Taiwan is focussing on High End Technology due to its small size and it leads in Semiconductor design and manufacture and stacking.China on the other hand leads in Low and Medium End Manufacture like say a Portable Ultrasound or Portable Sauna or a Massage Chair or a Teddy Bear or a Pencil Sharpener or a Laptop or a Mobile Phone.So if you want to build a $ 10 Million - $ 250 Million Factory to build Mobile Phones or Laptops or Toys etc- China is the best place to do so and gives you the best quality for money.If you want toTaiwan is ahead of China in terms of Technology and Quality.Right now Taiwan is focussing on High End Technology due to its small size and it leads in Semiconductor design and manufacture and stacking.China on the other hand leads in Low and Medium End Manufacture like say a Portable Ultrasound or Portable Sauna or a Massage Chair or a Teddy Bear or a Pencil Sharpener or a Laptop or a Mobile Phone.So if you want to build a $ 10 Million - $ 250 Million Factory to build Mobile Phones or Laptops or Toys etc- China is the best place to do so and gives you the best quality for money.If you want to invest $ 2 Billion in CVX Chip Design or to build a stacked 7 nm Processor technology - Taiwan is the best place to goChina is however speedily closing this gap. The Gap is narrower than it was in 2012.China needs another 2 - 4 years to master the manufacture of high quality chips/processors and once that is done - China can deliver at 1/2 the cost of Taiwan and threaten the entire Taiwanese business and way of life.,"2,296 followers",Rafiul Alam Emon,5.2K,200,1.8M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Which-among-these-developing-nations-India-Pakistan-Brazil-Iran-and-Taiwan-can-we-say-have-a-more-advanced-technology

India is truly one of the most diverse nations in the world. It's quite more equal than Brazil and it has much lower crime rates on average. India also has a stronger military.If you're rich, you'd be pretty much okay in any of them both, but in India you'd have less worries about crime. If you're poor, you definitely want Brazil, especially if you intend on living on a smaller town. If you want cultural adventure, India is the place to be - Brazil would be an intriguing twist on familiar settings. If you want a longer and healthier life, chances are you'd be better off in Brazil, but if you want a life with better education, India is a good choice. Your government will be slightly better in Brazil, and your private sector slightly better in India. India is more traditionalist and Brazil is more liberal.I could go on and on, but some country being better than the other is too subjective a thing.

In order to conclude such topics, we will have to look at various parameters and keeping in mind the size difference between the two countries as well.Let's look at the comparison of these two countries ~Economies →India —Nominal GDP — $3.53 trillion.GDP PPP — $11.745 trillion.GDP per capita — $2,543.Iran —The official figure is a little disputed and both confusing so it can be different but I'm taking World Bank's data just in case.Nominal GDP — $231.55 billion.GDP PPP — $1.61 trillion.GDP per capita — $2,567.Looking at the current stats provided by IMF and World Bank, India has outclassed Iran in both fields.In Per capita as well India and Iran are equal as both are lower middle income countries but here, we should keep in mind that India's population is 10 times more the population of Iran. A huge population significantly decreases an average output. Hence, we can assume that there are more Indians prospering than their Iranian counterparts.Exports →India —India's Exports — $670 billion.India is a mainly service-manufacturing based economy. It exports manufactured goods, fuels and mining products, agriculture products. It's main sectors of manufacturing includes car manufacturing, electronics, aircrafts ships, computers, medicines, textiles and chemicals etc.Iran —Iran's exports — $107.43 billion.Though, Iran has made numerous attempts to diversify it's economy. Iran is still a mainly oil exporting economy. Iran's main sectors of exports are petroleum (which attributes to 56% of total exports), petrochemical products, fruits, carpets, automobiles etc.A point to be noted here is that India is Iran's one of the major trade partners but not vice versa.Another point which makes Iran better than India is that Iran's exports are higher than it's imports which is not the case in India where imports are still higher.Infrastructure →Iran —Iran has 5 fully functional metro infrastructure across it's major tier 1 cities like Tehran, Esfahan, Shiraz, Mashhad. The metro system in Iran is highly advanced and planned and the largest among all is the Tehran metro which covers 155.8 kms. 4 more metro infrastructure is under development and will be in use by 2023.Iran has a total road network infrastructure of 223,485 kilometers.Iran has a total railway network of 16,988 kilometers which is the 16th largest in the world.India —India has 15 fully functional metro infrastructure across the country in it's major cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai etc. The Indian metros are advanced as well. The largest among all is the Delhi metro which covers 348.12 kms which is much bigger than Tehran metro. 6 more metro infrastructure is currently in development and will be in use by 2023–2024.India has the 4th largest metro system in the world ahead of Japan.India has a total road network Infrastructure of 6,371,847 kilometers which is much much larger than Iran's.If we keep road size aside and focus on quality only then also, India is a lot ahead of Iran in terms of road quality.India has a rank of 46 with road quality of 4.5 while Iran has a rank of 77 with road quality of 3.9.Largest flyover cloverleaf in Asia —Kathipara Junction, India.India has a total railway network of 70,225 kilometers which is the 4th largest in the world.Hence, I can conclude that in terms of infrastructure, India is a lot ahead of Iran in basically every sector.India also holds aPoverty →India —Although, India had a high poverty rate in the past. India worked substantially over the years to overcome the issue and is pulling most of it's population out of poverty.India's Extreme poverty rate — 4%.It's a commendable that a country as gigantic as India is having an absolute poverty rate of 4%.Iran —From having a much higher GDP per capita than India in the past and a lower poverty rate. Unfortunately, Iran today is lagging much behind in poverty rate as well.I found just this official data by Iran's government.So it seems India is also doing much much better than Iran in terms of poverty handling.Unemployment and Job opportunities→India —Iran —Iran's unemployment rate has been increasing over the past years where people either don't have a job or are getting menial jobs which doesn't satisfy the masses.In India, cases are although much better but government jobs do lack where there's a single vacant job position for every 100,000 applicants. Although, India is much better in service sector.India's entertainment industry is also one of the most successful in the world which is considered the second only to Hollywood.Producing the highest numbers of films in a year.Iranian film industryBut still Iranian director, Asghar Farhadi won the Oscar for Iran in 2012 —Unfortunately, Indian movies haven't earned an Oscar yet despite being nominated several times.India also has many MNCs set up there and more and more entrepreneurs are opening their businesses.Sadly, due to sanctions Iran is having none of it which is why there's next to no foreign investment. Very less entrepreneurial programs, people are mostly looking for a 8–6 job.Conclusion →Considering all these factors, I can conclude that Iran is just an unfortunate country like many others. Comparing India to Iran makes no sense, India is better in almost all terms.Sanctions have chained Iran and it is suffering economically whereas India is just a few decades away from becoming a world power. Both have their journeys so best of luck to both.","12,141 followers",Rajagopalan K Suryanarayan,1.5K,10.9K,80.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-among-these-developing-nations-India-Pakistan-Brazil-Iran-and-Taiwan-can-we-say-have-a-more-advanced-technology

If you haven't watched it go watch it, it's on Netflix. It will give you a whole new perspective on the universe we live in. And one possible answer to this question.Another thing that I wonder that how do we know if we haven't created an universe already, without even realising that we did?

25,"Not humans, but intelligent beings. The odds are in favor of it, yes. But the distances involved in space travel are so great and the obstacles so severe that we might never leave the solar system—and they might not leave theirs either.Life forms are adapted to the place where they evolved, in moderately warm, wet places. Space is incredibly hostile to life.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-among-these-developing-nations-India-Pakistan-Brazil-Iran-and-Taiwan-can-we-say-have-a-more-advanced-technology

27,"Our best estimates make the universe slightly less than 14 billion years old. Is that young or old? One theory has the universe ending in the Big Rip 22 billion years from now. If we do give the universe a total “lifetime” of 36 billion years and liken it to a human lifespan of, say, 80 years, the universe is currently like a 31-year-old — fully mature, and at the age where one can really begin to work out one’s place in life!Life as we understand it could hardly exist during the first few billion years of the universe.

For one thing, the heavier elements we consist of were formed by fusion processes inside older generations of stars, which had to go through their entire life cycle and finally release the matter formed inside them before any planets could come into being.On our planet, getting from the first simple stirrings of life to ourselves apparently took more than three billion years. We have no idea what the “chance” of it happening was, or how easily it could have happened elsewhere as well.But my hunch is that if there are others, they are far away. I do think there is a very real chance that we are currently alone in this galaxy, at least. There could be many other worlds with life, but only what we would call animals. No technology-building species. Once one emerges, it (or its self-replicating robotic probes) would likely spread throughout the galaxy in a relatively short time. We have no evidence that it has already happened in the Milky Way. Perhaps it will beYes, this could well be the relatively early days of the universe, and we","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Which-among-these-developing-nations-India-Pakistan-Brazil-Iran-and-Taiwan-can-we-say-have-a-more-advanced-technology
