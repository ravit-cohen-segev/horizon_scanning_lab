Then what, right? Then it is the decision maker authorities turn to implement the relevant and effective solutions. It is what we can for now. Hope we can meet in greater tomorrows.For you all to complete the survey, I am putting the link down below.

Robust public transport :2. Wide Roads , Footpaths , Cycle Track :Footpath is for use of citizens who wish to walk / run for health.Cycle track is for people who cycle. To tailor this to needs of Aligarh we can have seperate track for Rikshaw on either side of roads.Possibility of parking cycle at bus stands and near tram stops (Tram is local railways) which can be underground and above ground also.3. Electricity Underground :Electricity lines should be like this :) :P4. Garbage disposal :Garbage is like treasure and can be used to make manure and natural gas for fuel, other can be recycled. Polythene usage can be minimised by motivating people to use bags and by increasing the cost of bottles. In Europe Bottles can be returned for money. 25 euro cents for a plastic bottle.Liquid waste from house is managed underground. In my 4 years stay and travels i never saw a single open garbage drain.5.

2,"There is no universally accepted definition of a smart city. It means different things to different people.

A Smart City would have a different connotation in India than, say, Europe.However there are some definitonal boundaries associated with the term. For understanding the same, let us start with why is there a need for smart cities. Once we understand this, we will have an outline of what a smart city is.Cities are hubs of economic activity. Currently, every one out of two persons in the world resides in cities. The cities, at present, contribute to 70 per cent of the global Gross Domestic Product (GDP). It has been estimated that by the year 2050, nearly 70 per cent of the population would reside in cities. This estimation presents a mammoth opportunity to the cities for strengthening their local economies. If the economies are able to develop their cities, they will be able to leverage the growth opportunity which the cities present.How will the cities leverage the opportunity? By becoming smart.Now, cities are required to become ""smart"" so as to attract more investments, employers, residents and visitors. They have to become ""smart"" for being globally competitive and the preferred choice of the residents and visitors. Essentially, there are two components to smart cities:Now, everything that helps the cities in enhancing ease of living and ease of doing business, comes under the concept of smart city. A smart city, thus, should have AT LEAST the following:While many may thing that the word ""smart"" refers to wifi, e-challans and using digital technologies,  it entails building the core infrastructure of the city and enhancing the quality of life. Wi-fi is just one tiny component of it.99",95 followers,Dylan Woon,17.6K,84,7.1M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-revolutionary-ideas-in-making-a-city-smart

Today you’d probably have trouble believing what an amazing world it opened up.Just to show you can’t always believe your mother, when I told her I’d gone to work for a “Home Computer Company,” her response was, “Heavens, why would anyone ever need a home computer?”When she died about 10 years ago she had a Macintosh (so, to answer her question, she would need one.)

Getting ANY computer was the goal, and that's what I did, not able to buy an Apple right away due to cost.Interestingly, the computers I did get before the Apple had potent multimedia features including hardware graphics and sound and a speed advantage too.  Despite this, the real appeal of the Apple ][ was that it could be a ""serious"" computer.  By ""serious"" I mean really usable across a broad spectrum of use cases from tinkerer / gamer to business / developer / producer.  Add on hardware also took the machine into manufacturing / test / measurement as well as enabling development for other hardware.  Some console and arcade development happened using Apple 2 computers in various ways, for example.I bought one, and continue to use it to this day, because the thing was made to be completely understood and used period.  The slots and simple discrete logic design limited it's feature set, but the software and hardware engineering more than made up for that.My first 6502 assembly language programs were written using the Apple ROM listing and a blurry photocopy of the 6502 datasheet, typed in to the computer directly from the included monitor / mini-assembler.   Most other computers were not built in that simple, powerful way, requiring peripherals and additional software to do the same thing.  That impacted me as a kid.  Still does.The hardware slots were pure genius.  At the time, many computers were cost optimized, or just not engineered in the way the Apple was, though that engineering was often fine otherwise.  It's just that Woz hit the sweet spot with his perception of how a computer might get used and was careful to enable that, not get in the way of it, or overly manage it like other computer manufacturers tended to do.I'm on Quora this evening, actually taking a short ""creative break"" from some class prep I'm doing, looking at this package I just got in the mail.  Haven't had a chance to fit it to the Apple yet, but I'm going to this weekend.  It's a Compact Flash / USB storage solution!  Imagine that!http://dreher.net/?s=projects/CFforAppleII&c=projects/CFforAppleII/main.phphttp://dreher.net/?s=projects/CFforAppleII&c=projects/CFforAppleII/main.phpSo many years later, I'm still able to make use of this great computer and enjoy hardware produced today for that purpose.  That same design ethic makes the Apple ][ easy to interface to other devices as well.In the end, I would have to say I bought an Apple ][ computer to use the great software and hardware produced for it, and to learn and develop my own, and despite the technical limits, the thing is still just fun.

So I waited for a year and got my first Apple in 1985.
