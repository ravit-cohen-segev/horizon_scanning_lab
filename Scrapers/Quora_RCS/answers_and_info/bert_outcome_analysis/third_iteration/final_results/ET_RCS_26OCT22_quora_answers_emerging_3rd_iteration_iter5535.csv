Unless you have extraordinary technical knowledge, you're neither likely to invent nor know enough or the right people to invent or invest early in a breakthrough technology.

If you agree with that assumption (and it's OK if you don't) - think of all the different tools that will be necessary to optimize the ability to create content.

Not really that hard to do. (Just taking a bit of AI and Context to drive VR content fragments).The point is - content is still king. With all of this new technology - it's just technology.

Then the culture has to figure out how to educate everyone enough to maintain skills and it is trying to apply them in that fashion now. This also depends on predispositions, talents, traits, and so on, so it wants to know how to adjust those. Whatever the trick was in the previous century is going to be suspect now.  They are calling overpopulation and underemployment in many spots so the solutions have to be specific to the site which seems feasible.There is also philosophy and ethics to look at how all of this can be steered where possible to avoid the worst downsides. Regulation is an issue in itself. Values such as sustainability are significant. Ideally the machines will be friendly to human ideologies. There are the logarithmic curves versus the linear and the advice to provide value to a billion persons so returns do not have to be large in each case.
