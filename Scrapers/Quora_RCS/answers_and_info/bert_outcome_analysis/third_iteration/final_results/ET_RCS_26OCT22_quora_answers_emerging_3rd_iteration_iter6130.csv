Then robotics will become a real disruptive technology - right now just automotive industry and some other industries felt the ”wind of change”.Less tech countries will be less affected in the first stage of changes, but as robots will take over the low level jobs usually reserved to immigrants or relegated to those countries, the second stage will be devastating for their economies.","24,639 followers",Terry Lambert,777,23.1K,77.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-does-the-emergence-of-disruptive-technology-affect-our-society
1,"Prof. Cleyton M Christensen of Harvard business school introduced the ‘market’ term called the ‘Disruptive Technology’. He describes it as a technology that unexpectedly displaces an old technology in such a way that the old technology becomes redundant and is phased out.

He describes it as a technology that unexpectedly displaces an old technology in such a way that the old technology becomes redundant and is phased out. Introduction of automobiles were an ‘innovative’ technology no doubt, but not a ‘disruptive’ one since, in those early days, automobiles remained as an interesting luxury ‘toy’ in the hands of a few, horse drawn carriages were still the norm. But introduction of mass-produced automobile like the ‘Model T’ from Ford virtually replaced horse drawn carriages and is considered ‘disruptive’.Social perspective“The plan is like this, we first take the night train to Madurai, reaching there in the morning”.“Ummm….”“Then we take a car and straight go to Kodaikanal, we reach by noon”“Ummm….”“You know where I have booked up this time? Guess what, karlton”.“Ummm….”I realized that my teenage daughter was not paying attention. Her fingers were busy dancing across the Smartphone, typing out text messages.“Why can’t you listen at least, I took so much of pain and trouble for arranging this holiday. You are not even interested”. I was visibly upset.“Ummm….”.“What ummm?”“Ohh papa I am listening”.One more time Smartphone proves to be smarter than a dumb parent.Medical perspectiveWhen I joined my third year of medical curriculum, during the surgical posting, 9 out of 10 general surgical procedures would be some kind of surgery for peptic ulcer. A part of the stomachs was removed with cutting off the vagus nerve (which triggers off the gastric acid secretion) a technique called ‘gastrectomy’ and’ vagotomy’. Faster the surgeon more was his status. By 1980 Prof James black discovered a novel kind of drug that blocked the receptors in the stomach that resulted in profound reduction of acid secretion. It was a new concept, acting like a wrong key in the lock. The receptor, like the lock got essentially jammed by the drug, making the real key useless and the lock failed to work. Acid in stomach came down. The implication of the discovery of H2 bolcek...","9,883 followers",Kenzi Mudge,1.8K,1.3K,8.3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-does-the-emergence-of-disruptive-technology-affect-our-society
