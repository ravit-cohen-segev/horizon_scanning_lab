1,"I don’t think they would have managed to get into space much earlier. After all, it was only fifteen years between the Germans first successful launch of a ballistic missile using modern technology and the first satellite put into orbit. Much of the key technology was only invented a few decades before that first German ballistic missile. Even basic materials like aluminium only became available in bulk at the very end of the 19th century.

Even basic materials like aluminium only became available in bulk at the very end of the 19th century. The electronics required for communication arrived somewhat later than that.So, at best, these low-gravity aliens might have got into space a few decades earlier. It might have been that over-sized fireworks might have got things into orbit, but not very controllably.Of course, having developed the technology, then they could far larger items into orbit rather easier than we can. It would not have required anything remotely as large as a Saturn 5 for their first Moon landing (should they have a moon of course). A single stage rocket would suffice. Putting up the material for a space station would be a great deal easier too.So their ability to exploit “near space” would be much enhanced being easier and cheaper than it is for us. That advantage would extend, to some extent, to longer distance exploration of their solar system, but the issues of logistics on long journeys. The equivalent of us travelling to Mars, would still be there albeit eased by the ability to lift much more massive objects into orbit at very much lower cost.There is a big “however”, and that is it is highly doubtful that a planet with just half the gravitational pull of the Earth would be able to hold onto much of an atmosphere. Mars has gravity about 40% of that of Earth yet has an atmospheric pressure only about 0.6% of that of our planet. Without an atmospheric blanket, it means that you can’t have liquid water on the surface (at least for any time). Like Mars, the core would have frozen up earlier and that would mean the loss of a magnetic field. In short, it’s unlikely that intelligent life anything like what we see on Earth is unlikely to appear, in large part, due to that very low gravity. It might just be that we are at a “sweet spot”.",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,6.7K,9.4K,195.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Does-technology-in-the-recording-studio-make-singers-sound-better-If-this-recording-technology-continues-to-evolve-will-having-vocal-talent-eventually-no-longer-be-a-requisite-in-the-music-business
2,"Orbital velocity is 7.8 km/s.  So if you could launch directly horizontally with no atmosphere, and do it instantly, this is the Delta-V you need to reach orbit.  But yet, for real rockets, the engines have to deliver upwards of 10 km/s.  That's a big difference!  But why?Rockets have to raise their elevation, because they need to make it high enough that there is virtually no atmosphere.  Also, during this process of raising elevation and increasing speed, they're not in a full-speed orbit, and this causes something called gravity drag.  These increase the Delta-V cost to orbit in the neighboOrbital velocity is 7.8 km/s.

But yet, for real rockets, the engines have to deliver upwards of 10 km/s.  That's a big difference!  But why?Rockets have to raise their elevation, because they need to make it high enough that there is virtually no atmosphere.  Also, during this process of raising elevation and increasing speed, they're not in a full-speed orbit, and this causes something called gravity drag.  These increase the Delta-V cost to orbit in the neighborhood of 1 km/s each, with some additional cost due to air resistance.  This is how we go from 7.8 to 10.  Due to the exponential nature of the rocket equation, this is a big deal.If you have half the gravity, the atmosphere will extend twice as far into space (given the same sea-level pressure).  You are correct that orbital velocity would be lower.  Because gravity is lower, the elevation climb and gravity drag would also scale roughly the same.  But air resistance is what will kill you.A terraformed Mars with breathable atmosphere would have an orbital environment that is extremely difficult to manage.  You couldn't get by with orbiting at 200 km above the surface, because thin gases would extend much further (although the exact limit would depend on what gases you seed Mars with).  Since the radius of Mars is only 2,100 km to begin with, the gravity will drop off with elevation much faster too.  You could wind up relatively close to planetary escape just to attain orbit.  The escape velocity is 5 km/s, but with no orbits to hang out in, gravity drag and air resistance will increase this dramatically.  It might be more than Earth in the end.Anthropic factors that put humans so deep into a gravity well were: the need for a dense atmosphere and the temperature of our sun.  New research continues to shine light onSo blame photosynthesis.  If our sun had been a brown dwarf instead, life could have evolved in a more shallow gravity well, possibly even 0.5 g.  Life may still be possible in those systems, but it would take longer for them to evolve.  So our rocketry challenges can be tied to the Fermi paradox - the fact that the universe gave birth to us first.

Almost all jobs were displaced by technology and while there is a certain amount of transition pain, the big picture is not something terrible or even all that important. The benefits to be gained by increased production creates new problems (like widespread obesity for example) but unemployment isn’t among them.I think there’s a separate question of whether there are or will be enough jobs for the uneducated. The answer is no. There are always going to be plenty of things that people want done, the question is at what price? If the government props up wages with minimum wage laws and applies massive taxes to pay for a UBI scheme then there won’t be enough money for these jobs and THEY will cause massive unemployment by means of the mechanism they imagine will solve the problem.“Uneducated people” is not a new group. They are an old group and one that needs to shrink if we want anything cl9ose to an optimal society. One of the biggest impediments to this is (again!) the supposed government solution of government-provided crappy schools. These consume huge amounts of resources and do a terrible job of educating children. Millions “graduate” incapable of reading their own diplomas and they feed the problem of too many people in the population without the skills and motivation to take care of themselves. The right solution is to educate away the lack of capacity to make a living, but more trillions of government money is going to make things worse rather than better.Why? There are several reasons. One is that at a fundamental level, education is a personal and psychological matter. The idea that you can or should present the identical lessons to a bunch of identical students on the same day at the same age in the same rooms by uniform teachers approved by a far off bureaucracy that knows nothing about the teachers, the schools, the students, or the parents is madness. That approach is doomed to fail and adding more money just makes the bureaucracy bigger, most distant, and less capable of doing its job.Another reason is priorities. When there are vast sums of money out there to be made in the schooling business, there are going to be a lot of people there to scoop up as much as they can for themselves. There are school construction contracts to be won, food concessions to be landed, there are teacher union fees to be collected, busses to be sold, football uniforms to be manufactured…and the more money you pour into this mix the more focus all of these players will have to cement into place the broken system we have because for all of its educational faults, it writes checks to all of the people involved and their careers are built around its continuation. Adding more money would make this kind of problem even more intractable.Another issue is accountability. The people running the educational bureaucracy have to be accountable to all sorts of people…teacher union bosses, the legislature, the bus drivers, the lunch ladies, the administrator union bosses, the janitorial union, the federal department of education, and a million others, but there’s essentially no accountability to the students and their parents. Why? Because they don’t hold anybody’s purse strings. The “wise educators” claim that they are too stupid to be given the power to question them and their results. That’s a REALLY corrupt way of looking at the relationship. It treats the students and parents more like livestock on a farm than customers in a business. Pouring in more money and power will only make this massively worse, handing even more unaccountable power to those who are committed to never ever solving the problems they themselves have already created.Since the politicians and bureaucrats (and too many teachers too) will never change their ways, it’s up to us to fix the problem, not the government. Are you up for that? If not the problem won’t be solved.My prediction? The rate of completely unprepared students leaving high schools will continue to rise until the only ones remaining are those who were able to find some education some other way (perhaps through parents or blind luck) and the whole country will continue its slide toward an endpoint that looks a lot like Detroit. I’m not saying that it has to be that way, and certainly not the way I want it to be, just that’s if we don’t doing something pretty major that’s where we are headed.",173 followers,Ryan Gilpatric,7K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-technology-or-programming-language-would-you-advise-me-to-learn-to-have-a-solid-future-in-the-ever-evolving-telecom-sector

When someone wants something to be done, he can wither do it himself or hire someone else to do it. It could be designing a new vaccine or digging a ditch, or anything in between.

Well we can say this for AI: it only replaces smart people. AI hasn’t been invented to take the jobs of dumb people. And we can say this for automation: it replaces manual labor a lot more than highly technical jobs.But the underlay of your question assumes that there will be non-educated people. AI and automation could be turned to the activity of educating people, too. There should be no non-educated people, with the possibility of people whose IQ is so low that they cannot be educated, and existing government programs will apply to them.No new governmental action is necessary.","1,896 followers",Jalon Fonseca,21.7K,485,5.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-technology-or-programming-language-would-you-advise-me-to-learn-to-have-a-solid-future-in-the-ever-evolving-telecom-sector
25,"First of all, I object against the suggestion that “technology and automation evolve”: Technology and automation can only ‘evolve’ by human intelligence, while the Darwinian theory of evolution doesn’t allow any intelligent influence.Secondly, I object against the suggestion that “AI becomes more intelligent”:Artificial Intelligence is not based on natural laws of intelligence. Therefore, AI is not intelligent by itself. As a consequence, AI needs to be fully programmed or trained.","135,552 followers",Hector Quintanilla,4.7K,1.2K,88.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-technology-or-programming-language-would-you-advise-me-to-learn-to-have-a-solid-future-in-the-ever-evolving-telecom-sector
