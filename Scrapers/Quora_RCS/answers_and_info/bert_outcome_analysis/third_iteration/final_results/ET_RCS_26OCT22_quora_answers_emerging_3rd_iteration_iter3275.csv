Would-be poisoners could easily obtain the requisite materials from the shops of apothecaries or chemists, under the guise of using them in small doses for a cosmetic or medical purpose.Mithridates VI of Pontus: The Poison King of Pontus and Aggravation to RomeKing Mithradates VI had a good reason to become obsessed with poison. The previous ruler, king and his father, Mithridates V, had been assassinated by poison at aMithridates's mother, Laodice VI, held regency over Pontus until a male heir was of age.“He, however, being on his guard against such treachery, frequently took antidotes, and so fortified himself, by exquisite preventives, against their malice, that when he was an old man, and wished to die by poison, he was unable."" Justin,mithridates vi - Google SearchSupposedly during his youth he began to suspect plots against him at his mother's orders and was aware of her likely connection with his father's death.Living in times when slipping poison into food or drink was a reality that had been one of the choice methods of assassination for thousands of years, Mithradates VI began a rigid program to educate himself on every form of poison and that knowledge would later become his greatest enemy.While in the wild it is said that he began consuming non-lethal levels of poisons and mixing many into a remedy to make him immune to many poisons. The Roman natural historian Pliny the Elder called him, “with his brilliant intellect and wide interests … an especially diligent student of medicine, [who] collected detailed knowledge from all his subjects.”Scythians & CannabisMithradates VI fled into exile and returned in triumph to become a ruler of superb intelligence and fierce ambition. Sometime between 116 and 113 B.C., Mithridates VI returned to his home of Sinope and seized throne, having Laodice VI arrested and eventually executed.Once he secured the throne, Mithridates consulted physicians, scientists, and shamans in the hopes of creating a foolproof remedy to toxins.Inspiration forImage: folio 3v of the Vienna Dioscorides MS (produced around 500 CE). Clockwise from left: Apollonius (unclear which one); Krateus; Galen; Dioscorides; Nicander. Included on folio 3v but not pictured here: Andreas and Rufus (One ancient medical text,Rather than relying on court food tasters, Mithradates VI developed lethal poisons and then took small, self-administered, non-lethal doses to ensure that his immune system would be able to survive.The most famous of Mithridates’s potions was later namedThe Mithridatic antidote is composed of fifty-four ingredients, no two of them having the same weight, while of some is prescribed one sixtieth part of one denarius. Which of the gods, in the name of Truth, fixed these absurd proportions? No human brain could have been sharp enough. It is plainly a showy parade of the art, and a colossal boast of science."" (XXV.6-7)The original recipe for hisMithridatismMithridates took his concoction daily for decadesMap of the Kingdom of Pontus, Before the reign of Mithridates VI (dark purple), after his conquests (purple), his conquests in the first Mithridatic wars (pink) and Pontus' ally the Kingdom of Armenia (green). (In 88 BC, in a measure of the hatred felt for the Romans in Asia, Mithradates ""wrote secretly to all his satraps and city governors that on the thirtieth day thereafter they should set upon all Romans and Italians in their towns, and upon their wives and children and their freedmen of Italian birth, kill them and throw their bodies out unburied, and share their goods with King Mithridates"" (III.22). Tens of thousands were massacred: Valerius Maximus (XI.2.4) records 80,000 deaths, Plutarch (Mithradates’ wars against Rome lasted four decades, engulfing three continents. He survived at least two assassination attempts during his 57-year reign.In the end, Rome was victorious and King Mithradates VI lost his kingdom and his life, butAfter his defeat at the hands of Pompey, Mithridates VI fled to the lands north of the Black Sea in the winter of 66 BC in the hope that he could raise a new army and carry on the war through invading Italy by way of the Danube.In 63 B.C.E., when the Romans were about to capture him, he withdrew to the citadel in Panticapaeum, where he was surrounded by his enemies who sought to overthrow him.Pompey - WikipediaIn the end, ironically, it would be a representative of Rome, the champion Pompey Magnus, who would take the body of Mithridates VI, and bury him in the rock-cut tombs of his ancestors in Amasya, which had been the old capital of the kingdom of Pontus, and the heart of Mithridates VI Eupator Dionysius’ kingdom.""Mithridates had tried to make away with himself, and after first removing his wives and remaining children by poison, he had swallowed all that was left; yet neither by that means nor by the sword was he able to perish by his own hands. For the poison, although deadly, did not prevail over him, since he had inured his constitution to it, taking precautionary antidotes in large doses every day; and the force of the sword blow was lessened on account of the weakness of his hand, caused by his age and present misfortunes, and as a result of taking the poison, whatever it was. When, therefore, he failed to take his life through his own efforts and seemed to linger beyond the proper time, those whom he had sent against his son fell upon him and hastened his end with their swords and spears. Thus Mithridates, who had experienced the most varied and remarkable fortune, had not even an ordinary end to his life. For he desired to die, albeit unwillingly, and though eager to kill himself was unable to do so; but partly by poison and partly by the sword he was at once self-slain and murdered by his foes.""Cassius Dio (Florus, too, has Mithridates ending his life by the sword, one ""which he had in vain tried to destroy with poison"" (When Mithridates was defeated by Pompey, a notebook was found in the king's own hand with a prescription for an antidote which consisted of only two dried walnuts, two figs, and twenty leaves of rue pounded together with a pinch of salt (Poisoning was already becoming widespread in Rome by the end of the Republic. This made the Romans “very keen to acquire … [this] universal antidote.” They claimed to possess his original recipe and to improve upon it.For the next 2000 years, an antidote called “mithridatum” or “mithridatium” was included inIn Mithridates’s day, “poison” and “antidote” had somewhat different connotations than they do today. A “poison” commonly referred to an extract of plants containing alkaloids such as henbane (hyoscyamine), wolf’s bane (aconitine), or poison hemlock (coniine). Venoms of poisonous animals were also included. “Antidotes” were sweet-smelling lotions and potions believed to antagonize poisons. A “poison” could also develop inside a person without exposure to poisonous plants or animals. Thus, it was thought that “systemic poisons” were present in illnesses and these could be ameliorated by the same antidotes.CelsusA hundred years after the death of Mithridates, Celsus recorded the formulation, which comprised thirty-six ingredients, all of which are derived from plants, except for honey to mix them and castor to enhance the aroma.""But the most famous antidote is that of Mithridates, which that king is said to have taken daily and by it to have rendered his body safe against danger from poison. It contains costmary 1.66 grams, sweet flag 20 grams, hypericum, gum, -tears and parsley, 17 grams each, casia, saxifrage, darnel, long pepper, 20.66 grams each, storax 21 grams, castoreum, frankincense, hypocistis juice, myrrh and opopanax, 24 grams each, malabathrum leaves 24 grams, flower of round rush, turpentine-resin, galbanum, Cretan carrot seeds, 24.66 grams each, nard and opobalsam, 25 grams each, shepherd's purse 25 grams, rhubarb root 28 grams, saffron, ginger, cinnamon, 29 grams each. These are pounded and taken up in honey. Against poisoning, a piece the size of an almond is given in wine. In other affections an amount corresponding in size to an Egyptian bean is sufficient.""Celsus,Pliny (XXIX.24-25) was skeptical of theriacs such as Mithridatum, with their countless ingredients.""The Mithridatic antidote is composed of fifty-four ingredients, no two of them having the same weight, while of some is prescribed one sixtieth part of one denarius. Which of the gods, in the name of Truth, fixed these absurd proportions? No human brain could have been sharp enough. It is plainly a showy parade of the art, and a colossal boast of science.""And yet an examination of the pharmacology of Mithridates' original formulation shows a conscious effort to select plants thought to be useful, many of which have a strong scent and are from the familyEighteenth-century portrait by Georg Paul BuschGalen, physician to Marcus Aurelius, also created his own antidote, which he calledWhen it came to medicines, Romans held that more expensive and “exotic” ingredients were higher quality and more effective. (Plus, medicine-makers would earn more money selling a more expensive remedy). Physicians were well aware of the attraction that such an expensive drug could have on a wealthy clientele,.Mithridates Vi Eupator Stock ImagesWhile many have sought to unearth Mithridates’ cure-all potion, few have actually taken the time to doubt the veracity of Mithridates and the ancient authors’ assertions. What if Mithridates’ panacea was an elaborate ruse meant to persuade his enemies that all poisoning attempts were futile?It seems that Mithridates’ personal theriac must have either been inadequate or a hoax because he always kept a fatal helping of poison in his sword’s hilt in case he decided to kill himself.There are still other deficiencies in the Mithridatium myth. In order to build immunity against certain poisons, it has been asserted that Mithridates consumed small amounts of arsenic and possibly venoms, which may have been included in his chewable tablets, and while this could work in theory, the results would probably have been disastrous.Over the next few centuries, recipes for universal antidotes proliferated worldwide. In the eighth century, theriacs appeared in Islamic medical texts as poison-repellants and cure-alls. While some theriacs survived in European writingsThroughout the Renaissance and early industrial eras, major centers of trade from London to Cairo had flourishing antidote industries. Often, the jars the remedies came in were as expensive and ornate as what was inside them. Venice’s 60-ingredient theriac (dubbed “Venetian treacle” by the English) became the most famous, but pharmacies across the world popularized different versions.Theriac was perennially popular because it was thought to cure every ailment, no longer just poison.To make sure everyone was making medicines properly, doctors began to circulate pharmacopeias—manuals outlining official drug preparation.
