This is really because it’s very hard to draw a distinct line between what language is, and what a mind is (or what consciousness is).Languages will evolve, or change, inasmuch as human minds/brains continue to change. As far as I know, the evolution of consciousness is also poorly understood. Most evolutionary biologists seem to agree to some extent that our brains (minds/consciousness) evolved with the need for an ever more complex system of cooperation being the main evolutionary driver. To tHuman language still represents a bit of a mystery in terms of our fundamental understanding of it. This is really because it’s very hard to draw a distinct line between what language is, and what a mind is (or what consciousness is).Languages will evolve, or change, inasmuch as human minds/brains continue to change. As far as I know, the evolution of consciousness is also poorly understood. Most evolutionary biologists seem to agree to some extent that our brains (minds/consciousness) evolved with the need for an ever more complex system of cooperation being the main evolutionary driver. To think of language in these terms, as a complex social tool, makes sense.I met an evolutionary biologist at a language genesis conference who claimed, quite cleverly I thought, that language evolved in order for humans to be able to do social grooming without occupying their hands, like baboons do for example. Baboon society relies heavily on grooming as a means of creating hierarchies and relationships, but it takes a long time and during grooming they cannot forage for food. There is a direct correlation between the number of hours spent grooming and the social cohesion of a troop of baboons. Keep in mind that social cohesion in the case of baboons and humans increases the odds of survival.Language exists almost exclusively to fulfill a social function. If we define it this way your question becomes quite simple, technology will connect more people, and allow interaction to take place over great distances. It therefore should speed up change, as a larger amount of interaction would be taking place than without technology.Notice that my answer does not address specific aspects of language change, like some other answers did. From a purely linguistic perspective, these changes are almost completely arbitrary. They are more akin to the the symptoms, rather than the root cause. People who get upset about the way smartphones and chatting have changed specific languages in specific ways (e.g. spelling) are more into prescriptive linguistics and stylistics. That is a different question all together.",1 follower,Oscar Tay,2.6K,641,14.4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Will-modern-technology-prevent-or-attenuate-language-continuing-to-evolve
1,"Modern technology may speed the development of regional and social class dialects because of the way social media seems to organize people demographically.And modern technology may simultaneously spread the ability of people to understand, speak and write broadly-applicable standardized dialects by increasing access to information and entertainment presented in such dialects.Those two things are not mutually exclusive, because most people use multiple styles and dialects of their native language without realizing it, moving back and forth in a process sometimes referred to as code switching.",334 followers,Chris Johann,4.6K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/Will-modern-technology-prevent-or-attenuate-language-continuing-to-evolve

3,"Tamer, my take is that the trend is toward repetitive physical functions being automatized while information technology continues to grapple with keeping up with productivity - or the lack of it.

4,"Extremely unlikely in my estimated opinion.  A single mechanically produced artifact would have been sufficient evidence dinosaurs had technology and culture.  And although 65 million years since the Chicxulub asteroid killed them might seem like long enough time for all remnants to have decayed and been reclaimed by nature, many things would have survived.  For example objects machined out of aluminum or copper and which had not been recycled due to geologic activity would still be around for archaeological discovery.So just how long would it have taken the Earth's surface to be completely reExtremely unlikely in my estimated opinion.

For example objects machined out of aluminum or copper and which had not been recycled due to geologic activity would still be around for archaeological discovery.So just how long would it have taken the Earth's surface to be completely reformed due to tectonic plates sliding below one another and melting the entire surface of the earth so no metal dinosaur artifacts would have survived?  Pangaea existed 200 million years ago and much of its fragmented pieces are still intact at least in terms of the top layers of the crust so we know that much of the Earth's surface has survived more or less intact since well before the Chicxulub event.  PresumablyAnd if you're interested in dinosaurs which reached 'our level' of technology there are other unmistakable traces of environmental tampering which would have been left behind in the fossil record.  For example any non-human civilization 65 million years from now would clearly be able to tell humans had been here even if all artifacts of our civilization had disappeared, simply by the abundance of CO2 and other industrial byproducts in our atmosphere, captured in gas bubbles trapped in rocks and ice and readily available for chemical analysis.That said, I don't think we can definitively rule out stone-age dinosaurs just yet.  While we still haven't discovered any species with sufficiently complex brains or behavior to imagine they were fashioning tools out of stone, it's a much more difficult challenge to disprove the existence of stone-age dinosaurs than it is industrial-age dinosaurs since most artifacts left behind could have been destroyed due to erosion.","5,214 followers",Pepper Meister,3.3K,5K,17M,2014,https://www.quora.com/Will-modern-technology-prevent-or-attenuate-language-continuing-to-evolve
5,"Proving that somethingWhat we do have for the past is the presence of evidence not consistent with the existence of not just an industrial civilization and no plausible process to explain why the evidence we’ve got would be preserved while evidence of greater technological sophistication would not.

For example, we’ve got fossil evidence of various kinds of animals and plants. We lack evidence not only of industrial facilities, homes, cities, orbital objects, and the like, but also evidence of the many, many long-lasting chemical byproducts of industrial civilization, of the domestication of plants and animals (domestication produces identifiable physical changes in many organisms), and even of organisms with the large brains and dextrous fingers necessary to invent and use industrial or even simple technologies. The more “wild” plants and animals we find without any association with products of civilization and technology, the less likely it appears that such civilizations ever existed.","8,303 followers",Untorne Nislav,5.4K,325,4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Will-modern-technology-prevent-or-attenuate-language-continuing-to-evolve

7,"No.They did not evolve into an advanced civilisation because they were doing phenomenally well with tiny brains forIn general, there’s no reason to believe that intelligence is even a major factor in the survival of a species. The top intelligence of species has been increasing over time, but extremely slowly, as if it were a secondary factor. It is obviously not a huge survival factor in most situations, from the perspective of a species.","26,672 followers",Donna Fernstrom,2K,9.3K,64.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-is-the-world-evolving-in-technological-businesses-and-what-is-the-future
8,"No. It simply wouldn’t have happened, period. Mammals and dinosaurs evolved around the same time, and throughout that period, dinosaurs dominated. They would have continued to do so without the Chicxulub strike. That means mammals would have remained small, furry, scuttling creatures.On the other hand, it seems likely to me that birds would have gone ahead and developed higher intelligence, just as they have. Perhaps some avian would have achieved sapience. We’ll never know.","26,672 followers",Donna Fernstrom,834,9.3K,64.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/If-a-lineage-of-dinosaurs-had-evolved-human-sized-brains-and-a-technological-civilization-then-how-likely-would-it-be-for-us-to-have-missed-any-evidence-of-them-so-far-assuming-they-went-extinct-at-the-same-time-they-reached-our-level
9,"HMS Sheffield was abandoned, USS Stark was notThere is a tendency to see the different fates of the HMS Sheffield and USS Stark as a result of design differences or crew training. In fact the similarities are greater than the differences.HMS SheffieldHMS Sheffield was stuck by an Exocet missile amidships while on ASW picket in the Falklands War on 4 May 1982 at about 11 am. Another ship HMS Glasgow had detected the two incoming Super Etendards but the potential for attack by Exocet was regarded as low and hence SheffieldHMS Sheffield was abandoned, USS Stark was notThere is a tendency to see the different fates of the HMS Sheffield and USS Stark as a result of design differences or crew training. In fact the similarities are greater than the differences.HMS SheffieldHMS Sheffield was stuck by an Exocet missile amidships while on ASW picket in the Falklands War on 4 May 1982 at about 11 am. Another ship HMS Glasgow had detected the two incoming Super Etendards but the potential for attack by Exocet was regarded as low and hence SheffieldThe missile strike fractured the water main preventing effective fire fighting and forcing the use of Rover portable fire pumps.USS StarkUSS Stark was hit by two Exocets which both struck the port side of the ship below the bridge while she was on patrol near the Iran–Iraq War exclusion boundary on 17 May 1987 at about 10:10 pm. The attacking aircraft, a modified Dassault Falcon 50, was also detected before the missile launch, but not regarded as a threat. Stark’s radar and ESM systems failed to detect the incoming missiles and the CIWS was in local rather than autonomous control. The ship went to general quarters only a few seconds before the first missile hit. The missile struck the ship 13 feet above the water line. The second missile struck in almost the same location 25 seconds later. Twenty nine died in the initial explosions and fires. Eight would later die from their injuries and 21 were injured.The missiles had also destroyed much of the fire-fighting system, forcing the use of a P-250 pump to fight fires in the forward section of the ship, along with electric submersible pumps.Further SimilaritiesIn each case the fate of the ship depended on fighting intense fires when the primary fire-fighting systems were unavailable (Sheffield) or severely degraded (Stark). The fires impinged on missile magazines, large numbers of casualties were involved and damage control was hampered by thick acrid smoke and the breakdown of electronic communication systems (Stark) and shortcomings in crew preparedness (especially SheffieldThe Oliver Hazard Perry Class (Stark) had the notorious aluminium superstructure, which melted in high temperature fires, collapsing ladders and sometimes decks. Communications within the USS Stark were severed and a piecemeal sound powered phone system was used to coordinate fire fighting.The Type 42 Destroyers (Sheffield) had poor ventilation design to remove smoke, lacked fire curtains, and contained many flammable materials (such as PVC plastics). Some escape hatches were too small for men dressed in breathing apparatus. The crew of both ships also had nylon clothing!USS StarkUSS Stark the morning after the Exocet strike.USS Stark was in the usually calm waters of the Persian Gulf, only about 100 km from port in Bahrain. She was accompanied by five other USN ships: La Salle, Coontz, Waddell, Conyngham and Reid. They provided additional breathing apparatus and rotated firefighting teams relieving Stark’s exhausted crewmen. So much water was poured on the flames that Stark listed up to 17 degrees, despite Captain Brindel ordering the starboard side be flooded to keep the port side hole above water. A commercial salvage tug was quickly brought in to use her water cannons to cool ships starboard side.Sufficient US assets were present to screen the unfolding drama from any further attackers. The fires took nearly 18 hours to extinguish. Calm seas were critical in saving the ship, which was extremely vulnerable to foundering.Exploding ammunition is a critical consideration when fires break-out on a warship. The fires came close to Stark’s missile magazine and threatened to cook-off their fuel causing a catastrophic explosion. A single crewman (Gunner’s Mate Mark Samples) stayed in the missile magazine for 12 hours before being relieved, pouring water onto the missiles. Mark Samples was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for heroism for risking his life to save the ship.The stricken ship was towed to Bahrain by the evening of 18 May.Stark (FFG-31)HMS SheffieldHMS Sheffield soon after the Exocet strike.HMS Sheffield was in the normally rough waters of the South Atlantic Ocean over 1500 km from the nearest safe port in South Georgia.The escorts Arrow and Yarmouth soon came to the aid of Sheffield. As with the USS Stark, the fires began to impinge on the missile (Sea Dart) magazine. After fours hours fighting the fires, Captain Salt ordered the ship be abandoned. The crew were rescued by HMS Arrow.The fires aboard Sheffield burned for two days, at which point the ship was no longer salvageable, although multiple inspections were made to see if any equipment might be recovered.HMS Sheffield after the fire.By 10 May Sheffield was taken in tow by HMS Yarmouth. High seas caused slow flooding through the hole in the ship's side, which eventually sank her.Could HMS Sheffield have been salvaged like the USS Stark?The circumstances of the Exocet strikes on the Sheffield and Stark were remarkably similar. Sheffield lost 20 of her complement of 287. Stark lost 37 of a complement of 222 at the time (On the Sheffield the feared explosion of the missile magazine did not eventuate, and like the Stark, escort vessels came to her immediate aid. All else being equal, and even accounting for the remote and rough South Atlantic location, Sheffield could have been saved!However, two days prior (2 May) HMS Conqueror had provocatively torpedoed and sunk the ARA General Belgrano (ex USS Phoenix) a light cruiser and pride of the Argentine Navy, killing 323 men, over half of all Argentine military deaths in the Falklands War. Although the remaining Argentine Navy surface ships returned to port, a Type 209 submarine was still thought to be in the war zone. At all times the British task force was vulnerable to attack by Argentine aircraft, including Super Etendards, Skyhawks, Mirage IIIs (& Daggers), and Canberra bombers, as well as being under surveillance by C-130s, a 707 , Grumman Trackers and 2 Lockheed Neptunes.Captain Salt could not afford to place additional ships and his crew in further danger in a war zone. And there was no way of knowing whether a missile magazine explosion could have been averted. To attempt an heroic rescue of a warship that was no longer combat capable - like the USS Stark - would have been reckless in the somewhat different circumstances in which the Sheffield found herself.",1 follower,Bruce Tabor,739,147,1.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Will-modern-technology-prevent-or-attenuate-language-continuing-to-evolve
