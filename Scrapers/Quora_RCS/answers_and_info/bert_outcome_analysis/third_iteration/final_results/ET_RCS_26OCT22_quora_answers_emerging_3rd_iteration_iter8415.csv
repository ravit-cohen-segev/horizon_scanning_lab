15,"No. Throughout continuity, Lex Luthor is a success within himself, but a failure when compared to Batman.Now there’s a lot behind the scenes, if you will, about this.A) Batman is DC Comics primary genius, and main builder of their universe. He is also comic book royalty. Like Superman or Captain Marvel (Shazam), he is one of the original blue prints of the comic book heroes we take for granted today.B) Intellect Level (DC’s replacement of a IQ score) has always been all around the room for Lex Luthor.

He has been at 7 (four levels above humans, one level below Batman) to that of 12 (the highest I.L.). This changes because of inconsistent writing, to that of plot.C. Batman’s Intellect Level is also inconsistent. For someone at the level of 8, same as Krypton’s greatest scientist, Jor-El, he has been able to not only reverse engineer a Motherbox (God-Tech), but hack all of Apokalypse’s Motherbox’s. They are sentient. This alone should be beyond any life form below the God Tier. And where I’d usually put this feat to bulls**t, he has done this twice in the Modern Age.D. Batman’s main reason for being superior out of universe is the same as reason A. He is their primary genius. He was designed to be their primary genius eighty years ago. But the other one is…E. Action Comics, aka Superman comics, are not exactly canon in the greater DCverse. For reasons I’ve never really understood, they have their own editor. Their comics are made for Superman fans and not for continuity. This is why you can read Wonder Woman telling Superman he is the most powerful one of them on Earth in the JLA headquarters in a Action Comic, then see her tell him he’s not in a JLA comic. Because JLA/JL is under DC’s editor and thus the greater DCverse. One is written for Superman fans, because that’s Supermans audience, aka the cash cow. And the other is written in balance with the rest of continuity. If you were raised in the Modern Age, you’d understand this. Continuity between these two were tedious and all over the place. As a result Lex Luthor will seem superior in one version, but less so in another. However to be fair here, Lex was never really well written till the nineties. To put this in better terms, Lex Luthor is the smartest human within Action Comics, outside of it in the greater DCverse he is the worlds greatest egocentric.F. A in universe answer is that because of Lex’s demented outlook, he is mentally handicapped from reaching is fullest potential, often rushing things, or letting his ego and hubris get the better of him.As it stands though, Luthor has nothing over Batman in feats. This is largely do to the fact that as far as I know, Batman has no limits to his Intellect.

Apparently, larger brains do have more neurons but they are less interconnected. Which allows for some space-driven efficiency and modularization in the processing.A studyIn addition, neuroimaging studies have shown that intelligent individuals, despite their larger brains, tend to exhibit lower rates of brain activity during reasoning. [..]We found that higher intelligence in healthy individuals is related to lower values of dendritic density and arborization.These results suggest that the neuronal circuitry associated with higher intelligence is organizedIf this is the case, there’s a sweet spot in the trade offs in certain brain structures that allows for higher IQ given more or less the same starting resources.In computer enthusiast terms, this would mean thatIt is supremely difficult to generalize though, since each brain is an entire Universe of its own.

They can get emotional easily and even overwhelmed; this goes better with age.They have no idea how amazing they actually are; they are humble, helpful, and caring. Treat them well and you get loyal companion, a beautiful mind with their heart on a sleeve. When they look into your eyes, it feels like they see the bottom of your soul, pleasing or intimidating, depends.They can have big baggage of issues, it’s not easy to live with extremely sharp senses, a mind few can keep pace with, galloping thoughts and emotions, as a kind of Martian with no clue about mundane stuff Earthlings seem to be familiar with, and being treated badly because of being different. They may overreact, freak out, get scared, do stupid stuff, feel bad vicious circle, especially if growing in traumatizing circumstances. They may be destructive, do drugs to calm their mind and blend into mold, to sink into average; not all are lucky enough to meet their tribe when growing up. Actually, they can be awkward, even rude in a world of white lies, hypocrisy, fake, and manipulation; it’s a blind spot for them and they just learn to be aware of it rather than naturally play the game.",3 followers,Amy Chai,2K,6.5K,115.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-anything-left-to-gain-from-space-exploration-Is-it-worthy-of-our-time-and-resources-Of-course-we-can-learn-phenomena-and-science-about-the-cosmos-But-can-we-make-use-of-anything-out-there

Some years ago, Julian Jaynes wrote a book titledIn 1976 Julian Jaynes published his controversial book The Origins of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind, introducing the hypothesis of a two-chambered brain-mind model that preceded the evolutionary development of the conscious mind. Jaynes’ speculative model gave rise to a huge debate, which has reverberated throughout the current neuroscientific and neurophilosophical literature. Has the bicameral mind stood the test of time? To answer this question, the present paper adopts a multidisciplinary perspective and, after briefly summarizing Jaynes’ hypothesis, addresses two main critical issues: the neurological basis of the bicameral model and the philological accuracy of Jaynes’ arguments. Finally, the concept of a non-unitary Self is presented as one of the most relevant contemporary legacies of the bicameral mind.A similar sort of condition — separate from Jaynes’ hypothetical — is observed in some autism cases, where long-term memory is more or less inaccessible to conscious recall, that function being performed by implicit (‘muscle”) memory inaccessible to the conscious mind. Magnetic resonance and positron emission imaging allow identification of where in the brain different kinds of information handling is performed and determine if, where and perhaps how an autism condition may result from atypical mentation. Given that my experience as an undiagnosed (then) “Aspie” working in high-tech firms was often more “resident magician” that normal engineer, together with the trouble I got into in algebra classes in 9th grade (writing down correct answers without being able to show the work) convinces me that the idea holds some merit.","33,164 followers",Susanna Viljanen,3.7K,10.7K,165M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-anything-left-to-gain-from-space-exploration-Is-it-worthy-of-our-time-and-resources-Of-course-we-can-learn-phenomena-and-science-about-the-cosmos-But-can-we-make-use-of-anything-out-there

23,"Short answer: noLong Answer: (oh boy, here we go)Like you may know, there is no air in space: it’s a vacuum. No air means no sound (as sound is nothing more than particles in the air vibrating and moving this vibration towards us, and reaching our ears where we can feel these vibrations, which we describe as sound).

Like. That.In the opening scene from Revenge of the Sith, we see Anakin and Obi-Wan in their spacefighters. When they are joined by clones, they go straight to Grievous’ ship. At that moment, they are attack by Vultures and droid tri-fighters. What happens now, is a full charge in into the droids (see picture).Why the hell would you do that?I mean look at this. Their Venator class Star Destroyers are so close to the droid central command ships and Subjugators. When they have powerful long range weapons (as we saw in TLJ) they could put themselves at the other side of the planet, and not risk their capital ships to fall, like we see in this pirate-like shootout a few minutes into the film.3. PhysicsYou see this X-Wing? Looks nice, huh? But I do really wonder, how do they turn, in space, without turning their engines (with are, as far as I know, stuck in this position)? How do they slow down in space, where there is no gravity, and no air resistance to slow them down? They have no flaps (well, the Snowspeeder does, so that one doesn’t count here), their engines can’t turn in another direction but forward.Yeah, the space battles are not very realistic, but still look very nice, though.Hope that helps, and as always: may the Force be with you.","1,914 followers",Brett Lissaman,1.1K,472,20M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-anything-left-to-gain-from-space-exploration-Is-it-worthy-of-our-time-and-resources-Of-course-we-can-learn-phenomena-and-science-about-the-cosmos-But-can-we-make-use-of-anything-out-there

They’re on the wingtips and as far as we know, cannot be adjusted to converge. But at varying ranges, the four blasts come together to meet their mark consistently throughout the saga.

This is plausible for a TIE Fighter. The guns are short and very close together (to the point where the convergence computer was probably only necessary because of the narrow trench they were in).
