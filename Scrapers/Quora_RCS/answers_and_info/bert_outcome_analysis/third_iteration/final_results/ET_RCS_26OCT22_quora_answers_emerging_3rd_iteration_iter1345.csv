0,"Transfer learning in ML models.Humans are really good at generalizing. We only have to see a few dogs before we can recognize a dog when we see one.Machines are not. ML models require millions of examples before forming a reliable classifier, and that classifier is very specific to the data on which it was trained. If your training data doesn't include dogs with three legs, the model won't recognize them. A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one.

If your training data doesn't include dogs with three legs, the model won't recognize them. A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one. It's hypothesized that the reason humans learn so quickly is that we are fitting new examples into our existing knowledge rather than forming entirely new categories. If we could teach machines to do the same, they would learn exponentially faster and apply that learning more effectively.Transfer learning is a very hot topic in AI research right now, so I expect major breakthroughs in the next few years. I think this may be sufficient to achieve artificial general intelligence, but even if not, it will dramatically extend the range of tasks that machines can accomplish.","135,529 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-big-step-in-technology

2,I think that the next step in tech is going to be the fold-able phones. Currently Samsung has come out with theirs and to my knowledge its the first big innovation since the IPhone. Obliviously its a but buggy and not perfect but a company taking these first steps can be huge for the phone industry in the future.,"58,988 followers",Michael Wolfe,504,2K,17.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-big-step-in-technology

12,"Oh hell yes. There are so many people with a stake in presenting it as more that it currently is. So many ambitious overachievers out there spinning BS to get money.Look, we do not have the ability to create an AI controlling a robot that can peel an orange. We lack ability to do many things a human does. And yet morons like an ex-exec from Google excite the press with claims that AI will replace humans all over in industry.I say the Emperor’s New Clothes are baloney. The ability of NNs to be trained to classify images is just a small part of real AI. So what if there’s a lot of success thereOh hell yes.

The ability of NNs to be trained to classify images is just a small part of real AI. So what if there’s a lot of success there identifying a truck in an image? That hardly translates into an AI that can think like a human and solve problems. There are no AIs currently that can reason about why your girlfriend suddenly got sullen and quiet with you, or why Billy down the street beat up a cat.Then there’s Ray Kurzweil. I’d like to get him on stage and beat him over the head with a mop for the terrible hype he generates regarding the ‘Singularity’. His time frame is wrong, his view is only an opinion, not fact nor provable fact. He angers me for conning the public into thinking humans are going to be threatened by AI overlords any time soon. Not going to happen. Making AIs as smart as people is exceedingly hard and it’s not soon in the cards. I say this as an AI researcher who works on these problems and I see how truly difficult they are. We can, and will solve some of the problems but we are a long way from AIs that can match human minds. An AI that plays Go better than humans is buildable because the game is a closed small universe. What humans have to work with is an enormous complicated world, and much harder to deal with.So, yes, AI is way hyped, and the promoters may be leading us to the next AI winter if they keep up the crap and eventually burn out expectations.","45,628 followers",David Seidman,790,3.6K,85.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-big-step-in-technology
