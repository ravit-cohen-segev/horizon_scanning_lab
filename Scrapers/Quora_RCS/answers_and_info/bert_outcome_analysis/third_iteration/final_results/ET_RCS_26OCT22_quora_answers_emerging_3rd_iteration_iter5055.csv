I think for the following reasons why human translators can not and will never be fully replaced by machine translation tools :In conclusion, I think a translator is the best choice, even we do make mistakes sometimes and we can not work continuously 24/7 like a machine. My recommendation for you is to pick a translation service or hire a verified translator.P/S: if you need a English to Vietnamese translator with a verified work portfolio, I am always available to work.",6 followers,Mats Andersson,1.9K,20K,369.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Can-machine-translation-fully-dominate-and-replace-human-translators
1,"When I was a baby lawyer, there was a partner I really enjoyed working for who was something of a mentor figure, and he threw me a bone in letting me run the day-to-day aspects of a major case. It was of course like drinking from a fire hose for someone whose prior work had involved mostly document review and binder making, and I struggled to keep the trains running on time. The partner, however, pushed me harder, and gave me one of the best pieces of professional advice I’ve ever received: “you can’t constantly be reacting to a case, you need to get out in front of things, develop a plan,When I was a baby lawyer, there was a partner I really enjoyed working for who was something of a mentor figure, and he threw me a bone in letting me run the day-to-day aspects of a major case. It was of course like drinking from a fire hose for someone whose prior work had involved mostly document review and binder making, and I struggled to keep the trains running on time. The partner, however, pushed me harder, and gave me one of the best pieces of professional advice I’ve ever received: “you can’t constantly be reacting to a case, you need to get out in front of things, develop a plan,This, more than anything else, is what separates great lawyers from the rest of the pack: they learn their cases, they really understand what their clients want (or can realistically obtain), and they come up with a plan early on as to how they’re going to get from Point A to Point B. A great lawyer is constantly reevaluating their plan, as situations/needs are always subject to change, but they know where they need to go, have thought seriously about how they’re going to get there, and don’t take their eyes off the ball. You look at the best trial lawyers, the best deal lawyers, even the best tax lawyers, and at core, they’re all masters of planning and execution. Just the other day, one of my firm’s founding partners—and the best trial lawyer I’ve ever seen—counseled a client that was in reactive mode (waiting for the other shoe to drop in a matter) on how they could instead play offense and potentially pull away from a loss entirely. This is the kind of advice you get from the great ones; I’m a very good lawyer (in my opinion), but even I was like “wow, that’s fucking brilliant, I would never have thought of that.”You’d be surprised how many lawyers—including ones at big name firms—are purely reactive. They get a file and know that at some point in time, they’re going to have to do X, Y, and Z; they’re going to go down that checklist, deliver their best work by all the deadlines, and handle your matter in a professional manner. But ultimately, it’s outside forces—the calendar, the rules, the court, the lawyers on the other side—that are always driving the train, not them. Such lawyers aren’t necessarily going to lose cases—there’s something to be said for intellectual firepower and delivering good work product, and of course, the facts and the law are ultimately determinative of the majority of cases—but they also aren’t likely to get those kinds of “you pulled a rabbit out of a hat” or “you got me the expected result, but months in advance and for less money” outcomes that clients love.","11,218 followers",Ty Doyle,3.1K,6.3K,49.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Can-machine-translation-fully-dominate-and-replace-human-translators
2,"That professional obligations often dictate your behavior, and what sounds like the “safe” or “right” thing to do may actually be forbidden.Once there was a homeless man whom I would buy food for occasionally.

He accidentally found out where I lived, simply because he happened to be walking past once when I was walking out the door.Some time later, he showed up at my door, very bloody and panicked, asking for my help because he had just killed someone.

This is the same thing that people don’t understand when they get upset that Hillary Clinton once represented an accused rapist. She had no choice. A judge appointed her. She asked him to let her withdraw from the case, and the judge said no. If she had not represented the accused, she would be facing contempt of court citations, a hearing before the state bar association, and potential loss of license. You don’t own your conscience any more.Once a lawyer was assigned to represent a man accused of raping and killing a child. The defendant admitted the crime and a number of others, and offered to show the lawyer where the bodies were buried. The lawyer agreed, then turned all the evidence over to the state. He lost his license and thought it was a fair trade.",5 followers,Bill Otto,7.6K,7.5K,43.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-three-reasons-lawyers-wont-get-replaced-by-technology-will-exist-in-the-near-future

7,"Lots of rosy fantasy answers to this question.But the workplace automation revolution has been going on for roughly half a century, so our starting point for predictions should be based on what has actually happened so far.Which is that every advance in computerized workplace automation has been accompanied by the people who used to do the work getting fired, along with the people who supervised them.

Nearly all of whom then had to take much lower-paying jobs in the service sector, or have no jobs at all.The incomes of the richest men in America has steadily soared in this period, while that of most everyone else has stagnated or even sagged (in the case of most unskilled laborers, in part due to competition from illegal immigrants).First to go was repetitive manual labor and management of same. Next has been repetitive mental labor, then non-creative computational mental labor.Of course smart people can find other avenues of work. But most people aren’t smart, by nature’s design, so to speak. Excess brainpower can actually be deleterious to productivity in most work people did as hunter/gatherers, and it was true even moreso in early agriculture. A few people with smarts were needed for emergencies, for the rare unexpected danger/challenge. Hence the bell-shaped curve of intelligence, along which each succeeding generation has been born for over 200,000 years, and continues to be born this way:You aren’t going to be retraining people in the fat part of the curve to be computer programmers.There have been workplace revolutions before, of course. The industrial revolution saw zillions move from farms to manufacturing plants in cities. But in previous revolutions the IQ needed for the new job wasn’t any higher than the IQ needed for the old job, and lots of workers were still needed.Today the “demand curve” for employment in advanced nations is that bell-shaped curve…inverted. The labor market still needs dummies to push brooms and knowledge workers to, well, work knowledge. But it doesn’t need all that many skilled manual laborers with just high school diplomas.And watch what happens when truck and cab driving get automated. I live near Google and see robot cars driving around here constantly.Now of course the richest men in America could decide to give their workers 30 hour work weeks, full medical insurance and pensions. If they belonged to a different species maybe. Instead they’ve kept all the productivity gains of workers for themselves.There is still a market for the cream of the non-college crop. Germany has done a great job of private/public partnership apprentice programs with such people.But no matter how you slice it, the “free market” doesn’t need more than 50 million Americans, and within decades won’t need 100 million or more Americans. It will take aggressive government policy to deal with this, but the richest men in America purchased one of our two major political parties and currently owns both the federal government and a majority of state governments. So don’t look for change there.The scary thing isn’t workplace automation but the sophistication of right wing propaganda and campaign finance laws and other laws that make it easy for the richest of the rich to convince all those diplaced worked that libruls and foreigners done it to them. Tyranny no longer has to stand behind lots of guns. Instead it uses a giant bullhorn coupled with the susceptibility of Joe Lunchbox to appeals to his biases and fears.Note that Donald J. Trump has never said one word about computerized workplace automation. I doubt he even knows it exists…So I strongly suspect the future is full of frustrated people of average mentality forced to do work that’s too dumb even for them, but with their resentments continuously misdirected at precisely the people who are trying to save them.So instead of this…we’ll get this…because",UNKNOWN,Ben Y.

8,"The key is useless to whom?People obviously believe they do not personally have to have a purpose to be of value. They feel they have rights to life and to pursue happiness simply because they do. These are God given rights.But all other life on this planet does not have any such right. They depend on our valuation of them whether they live or die, even to go extinct.

They feel they have rights to life and to pursue happiness simply because they do. These are God given rights.But all other life on this planet does not have any such right. They depend on our valuation of them whether they live or die, even to go extinct. The best arguments by environmentalists to the public are that we humans are dependent on other life for our existence. Save the planet, means preserve it for future human generations. Rarely do humans accept that other life has value, given by God, to exist even if they compete with or harm humans in some way. Those are the Earth First people, and most consider them extreme eco-terrorists.So, it depends on who is in charge of the world when it comes down to deciding if production and profits are more important than people. If the purpose of a corporation is to make profits, then robots will eventually replace humans as workers. If the purpose of a corporation is to provide jobs for humans, then they will chose humans over robots.Now, the famous argument is that humans need jobs to make money to buy the products the corporations are producing. Factory robots won’t buy the cars the factory is producing. In the last few decades, Americans’ earning power has been declining as outsourcing and automation have reduced jobs, but this has been somewhat balanced out by cheaper costing products Americans consume. World trade means an equalization of worker value across nations. American workers will increasingly compete directly with workers overseas, raising the pay of their’s and lowering the pay of Americans.But eventually, automation will be cheaper and more productive than human labor entirely, no matter where or how cheap. Yes, US manufacturing shipped to China because Chinese labor was cheaper, but actually, Chinese factories are now more automated than in the US. The Chinese are working harder to automate manufacturing than any where else in the world. Their goal is to be the world’s cheapest and best manufacturer, not to give their people jobs. People are the resource a country uses to build itself richer and more powerful, not necessarily that the country exists to serve the people. The Chinese government has openly stated that it is the necessary sacrifice of the current generation of its people to suffer sickness and death from pollution so that future generations can enjoy the benefits of living in the world’s greatest superpower. The same government implemented population control measures to keep human population down and harvests organs from executed political prisoners. The Chinese government operates very similar to an American corporation.The fact is, it is possible to have an entirely robot based economy, where robots build and maintain robots, and produce the resources to do it. The surplus output of that economy can be used to provide the basic needs of many people, or extreme wealth and power for a very few people.Who will own the robots? Will individuals own their own personal robots (like we own cars, homes, washing machines, and computers) and thus be directly supported by their benefits? Or will a few mega-corporations own and control all the robots (like Microsoft owns and controls Windows)? A democratic government is supposed to represent the people. Its leaders are supposed to serve the people, make decisions that put the people and their prosperity and happiness first, yet in times of war, it will send thousands of its people to die overseas. It will allow the use of lead in gasoline for decades even though it knows how toxic it is. It will do this and worse to protect its wealth and power in the world.If the corporations have effective control over the government, if the government thinks and acts like a business, then people will have no jobs, no resources, no power. They will become a useless, resource consuming burden. The hungry disenchanted masses will riot in the streets, having no other purpose in life. The robot police will protect the corporate and government infrastructure. The time will come for the final solution to the population problem.Hopefully, the People First revolution will save the masses, otherwise, the Earth will become a garden paradise where a few extremely rich and powerful humans will live like gods, served by their robot slaves. They will write the history books that describe how the great plague (sent by God) saved the human race.",366 followers,Brett Alder,1.1K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-three-reasons-lawyers-wont-get-replaced-by-technology-will-exist-in-the-near-future
