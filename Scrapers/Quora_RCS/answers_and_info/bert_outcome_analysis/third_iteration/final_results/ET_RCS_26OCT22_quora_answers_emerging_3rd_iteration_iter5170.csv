1,"The problems with PDF’s start with paper itself!We have a problem with paper! Not for the typical reasons, most people offer up, which is a problem with the paper production process. People often tout environmental issues as a reason to stop using paper. Deforestation; carbon footprint; water usage are the usual culprits. The truth is that there is a lot of paper being produced using extremely sustainable methods that make most those gripes null and void.Another grumble often voiced is that paper is challenging and expensive to deal with in business processes.

Deforestation; carbon footprint; water usage are the usual culprits. The truth is that there is a lot of paper being produced using extremely sustainable methods that make most those gripes null and void.Another grumble often voiced is that paper is challenging and expensive to deal with in business processes. The solution is usually to create digitized, usually PDF, versions of those paper documents and introduce them into the workflow. Organizations will go to elaborate lengths to use OCR and even AI to extract the valuable data, but extensive manual work still exists to deal with exceptions.Creating digital versions of paper documents is like putting a bandaid on a festering sore. It temporarily improves the situation but does nothing to treat the infection or underlying cause.Let's face it - the document format we still use today was made for humans at a time before computing devices entered the mainstream. In practically every digital domain, we do not engage with digital representations of the physical object anymore. When the first generation of iPhone's was released, we used skeuomorphic representations of real-world objects.The music player looked like an old school tape deck; the news/book reader looked like a bookshelf. While this was initially useful and needed for us to make the transition from tape decks, newspapers, and books - the whole digital landscape quickly moved beyond skeuomorphic designs to more practical and useful designs.Now when you engage with a website or phone or tablet, it does not try to mimic the real-world. We have moved beyond that. Not so for paper documents. Digital paper documents, usually PDF, still look the same as they did in 1922.It is time for a new standardI would argue that we need to stop digitizing paper and move to an entirely new document format. A format that is born of the digital world.I believe the following should be attributes of a new digital document format:﻿It is time to rethink digital documents.In many jobs, people spend over 50% of their time dealing with digitized paper versions of documents. Much of this time is not dealing with the content but time spent finding content and wrangling information and data from the document. It is time to reinvent the document standard. Productivity will dramatically improve, and every person will benefit.","1,546 followers",Alan Tracey Wootton,3.2K,63,769.5K,2019,https://www.quora.com/Could-5G-WiFi-really-replace-cable-internet

3,"Who says we aren’t robots already????Joking aside, no, I don’t see lawyers being replaced by robots.

The classic example is discovery. In ye olden days (ie. a few years ago) you would get tens of thousands, sometimes millions, of pages of documents in discovery which had to be read through. Classic stuff for junior lawyers to cut their teeth on. Now? It gets prescreened by software which flags up the key bits for the senior lawyers to hone in on immediately. Automated drafting is another one - no longer is the first cut of a document done by a junior - it is done by software.The profession will change, but I think it will be a very long time (if ever) before lawyers disappear. The role lawyers fill is too complex to automate entirely for the forseeable future. But there will certainly be fewer lawyers, who will be far more efficient due to technology in the future.",11 followers,Jennifer Anders,3.3K,351,1.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-is-going-to-replace-PDF

6,"80% of the law could probably be taken over by robots. Drafting of forms, due diligence, legal research can be streamlined and done more efficiently by non humans.However there is that 20% that will never be able to be done by robots. In transactional law, there is the negotiation that needs to take place among parties. In litigation, there needs to be depositions, trials, the selection of the jury. Many aspects of the law are driven by human interaction and emotion.",36 followers,Adam Ambrozy,579,0,0,2014,https://www.quora.com/Will-lawyers-be-replaced-by-robots
