In fact, most of the “good” products are made in China, that include the Iphone you might be using. But they also know that a lot of people can’t afford an Iphone but want it very badly. Thus they create a cheaper version of it which people can afford, without the consent of Apple of course. This act is not “copy the technology”. What they do copy is the idea, and make use of the popularity of the product to make profit.Irony enough, this whole “fake product” thing come from the idea of “commodity” in capitalism. We live in a world where your social status is tied to what you own. For example you are cosidered as a rich person (especially in Vietnam) if you own the newest version of Iphone. If you work on minimum wage but want to look rich what do you do? You buy the newest Iphone. Nobody knows how much you make. The only thing they see is the Iphone in your hand. But what if you can’t afford an iphone? Well guess what, there are fake, cheap iphone for you. Who cares if the screen froze every 5 minutes and the home button stop working after the second day. The iphone boost your self-awareness of social status. It makes you feel rich. It already serve it purpose. Same psychological effect goes with every other fake product out there.

The thing is we have to take a look at the innards of a country to really know whether or not you are truly developed. That Chinese are so obsessed with portraying the facade that they are technologically advanced and ahead is actually an indication that they have not fully developed yet. Because fully developed countries have no need to show off things like that. Everyone knows they are developed.For example, here is San Francisco:Look, not many skyscrapers right? And look at those old cable cars going around! That must mean they are undeveloped right? Nope. Everyone knows San Francisco is a developed city. That’s why it has no need to show off with luxury skyscrapers and such things.Or how about Florence, Italy?Again, no skyscrapers here. But everyone knows it’s a developed city and Italy is a developed country.My point is, you have got to look at the people and the innards of a country to truly know if they are developed.This is the true face of China:You have got to look at the average person. Does the average Chinese have good access to healthcare (which is ranked near the bottom in WHO rankings btw)? Can they drink tap water safely? Do they have access to quality food? Do all have access to electricity or paved roads or a quality education? The answer is: probably, yes, if you are living in the rich east coast provinces of Jiangsu or Zhejiang or Guangdong- but not if you are living in say - Xinjiang or Gansu or Tibet. China’s wealth is not spread equally, neither is it developed equally. Even though the CCP has developed China quite fast - there is still a lot of work to be done making sure *every Chinese* have equal access to everything.And then you got to look at the attitude of the people. When I was in China I found that you really got to look out for who you trust, because there is a lot of scams going on all the time. You never know what is real, what is fake, what is real price of anything. Why do these scams exist? Because people have to be desperate to make money that’s why.Why are people desperate to make money? Probably because they are not making enough to survive, which is an indication that the country is still developing. You’ll notice that in general, the more developed a country is, the less likely there will be scams. In Korea/Japan/Taiwan, you will not find very many scams. In China and Eastern Europe it’s likely.Another aside I want to note is that Chinese bathrooms don’t contain any toilet paper. Do you know the reason why? It’s because people steal it. Now, in what developed country does this happen? I can’t think of any. Only in a developing country would you need to bring your own toilet paper to the bathroom because there isn’t any there due to fear of people stealing it.I find GDP/capita to be generally a pretty good indicator of how developed a country is. The average GDP/capita (PPP) of China is still around $8k/person. While that is higher than most Asian countries - it’s still below the 4 East Asian tigers + Japan and far from the $62k/person that the USA has.The true measure of a developed society is to observe the people that live in the country and not the appearance of the country itself. Chinese “face” culture is the same. You can just obviously see that China has developed really really fast, and mentality wise people are still harping about luxury products and consumerism - this is where Americans were back in the 50s, 60s and 70s, not now.The biggest consumers of luxury products are Chinese people, not Americans or Europeans. The more developed you are, the less need you have to validate your self worth with materialism. The less desire you have to spend thousands of dollars on your children's schooling just to send them to be educated abroad. The less need to travel to countries like Canada or USA for giving birth so that your child becomes a US or Canadian citizen, or to launder your money by buying up real estate in other countries. Developed countries do not need to do things like that.Thats why you should always pay attention to the old adage -Edit:Of course, Chinese commenters love to bring up the USA. Yes, USA has lots of impoverished areas too; every country has developed areas and undeveloped areas, however my point is that for China there is significantly more undeveloped areas at a higher % compared to the USA. The poverty rate for China is 16% as of 2019 and for USA it is 1.5% as of 2019.

Be happy and let things run its course.Land Reforms:Education:Women Education:Infrastructure Development:But ports, roads and bridges are not the only infra. Pakistan has to focus on power including renewable sources, irrigation, housing development, development of new cities, etc. India lags here too.Give up on Terror; hug peace:Forget Kashmir. Increase Trade with India:There are a few more options. Not all are simple. Not all may bring immediate benefits but in the long run they will. It is a matter of setting aside the ego.Edit 2 (30-May-2019):The whole thing has been misunderstood. The rhetoric lies in the minds of the Establishment and not general populace (maybe). The survival of the Army Generals depends upon the anti India stance. Let me also explain how India rhetoric, the unbalanced arms race, terror funding, etc., have crippled Pakistan.In 1985, the Per Capita GDP of Pakistan was about 27.7% higher than India’s (Pak US$350 : Ind US$274). Today, the Pakistan per capita GDP is some US$ 1222.50 and forecasted to grow to US$ 1400 in 2020 while India’s PCGDP is US$ 1963.55 and forecasted to grow to US$ 2350 in 2020. India is 60.1% ahead. How did Pakistan lose out by about 88%?Pakistan, while a smaller nation, is a much blessed nation. Almost whole land is fertile, it has a unique geographic advantageous location, it is rich in minerals, its population is lower (but growing at an alarming rate 2.5 times of India), the problems are lower, etc. Smaller nations grow much more than larger nations. The growth rate till 1985 was about 6% and exceeded India’s measly 2.75%.It was around this time (1985) that Pakistan started funding terrorism against India and started the Kashmiri insurgency heavily. They also started heavy military purchases including the F-16s. Pakistan's general thought that we won the war in Afghanistan by attrition. We can do the same to India. The US was funding Pakistan to fight against Afghans. Some of the heavy funding was to take care of the huge Afghan refugees. But a lot of these funds were misused and ended in terror funding or the corrupt. Pakistan still had to shelter the refugees. The money came from the exchequer.This is what I mean by India rhetoric and it is deeply coupled with Kashmir.People have also questioned on terror and how IK is sincere and wanting to talk and Modi isn't. There are reasons for this. Why did the bus to Lahore in 1999 end up in Kargil? The Kashmir problem was almost solved at that time. Who helped the attack on J&K assembly and later the Indian Parliament? Who sent terrorists to Mumbai on 26/11/2008? Modi invited Nawaz Sharif and he gracefully agreed. Yet pretty soon there were Uri, Pathankot incidents and later Pulwama. Pakistan can’t honestly say that they were ‘freedom fighters’ fighting alone. JeM have taken responsibility of these events. Pakistan can’t hide behind excuses such as ‘give us the proofs’. Where do all these people get the training and logistics support? How is 240+ kg of RDX, detonators, timing devices obtained and where does the training to assemble it come from?Pakistan is always in denial mode. They denied whereabouts of Osama Bin Laden. What happened exactly?All this not only creates mistrust but that logistics support to “freedom fighters” is costing huge amount of money. The army/ISI can’t provide their own arms to the terrorists; they provide funds. The terrorists buy their arms and ammunition from global arms dealers at open market (much higher) price. Hence they require more money - the same money that could be used to build better roads, dams, canals, higher educational institutes, etc.Just a fortnight ago, Pakistan got some $6 billion from IMF and the first result was deep PKR devaluation. What is $6 billion? It is loose change for tea/coffee. A similar sum was spent by Laxmi Mittal to purchase the bankrupt Essar Steel of India. And yet, this money was direly needed. It has come with deep consequences. We went thru same crisis in 1991 and I know what happened. How long will this money last. Without fresh global investments, Pakistan will have to back to IMF in a year. The world views Pakistan as an unsafe place. Reality may be different but perceptions matter.Just imagine ... if peace accord had been signed in 1999. The Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline would have been complete - bringing huge revenues for Pakistan. A road transit would have been created from New Delhi to Central Asia bringing customs duty, cess and road tolls to Pakistan. These two would have earned more than $6b per annum. This is the benefit of bilateral trade.I have told to forget Kashmir and India. Cut down on (useless) defence spending.I could go on. My answer and advice is to take good things.

This applies to all the Asian Tigers and to China.Having taken a few courses on development economics, I can tell you that it's very complicated and nothing useful is yet known. The path of how a poor country can become advanced and wealthy is still a black hole for knowledge.

But neighbouring Communist countries like Romania, Albania, Bulgaria, etc., were treated more leniently — in order to drive a wedge between them and the USSR.After the Cold War, this stayed the same.

Also Microsoft bought Xamarin which are the one that created MONO which is basically the open source version of .NET plus some extra libraries.So things look pretty good for .NET developers on MacOS.Mono did have some incompatibility issues in the past but no show stoppers AFAIK.Mac as a platform is very solid developer wise. XCODE is very good IDE , but then there are tons of IDEs to choose from.Surprisingly enough many open source projects are not only run on MacOS but have very large community of developers. Even though user wise its 95% Windows 4% MacOS and 1% Linux. For developers its quite different its actually 30% Windows 30% MacOS and 30% Linux.This may look surprising but you should not forget that Windows runs smoothly alongside both MacOS and Linux and since a developer is an expert user he wont care so much about the popularity of Windows since in most case developers deploy on all 3 platforms plus iOS and Android.Comparing Windows with Mac render usual conclusions , macos is more stable, more easy to use and with very good quality software. Windows on the other hand is unstable , hard to us and with a lot of low quality software but obviously has far larger user base and does not need special hardware to run.Linux is somewhere between with the added bonus of being open source. Its semi-unstable mainly because of problematic driver support, harder to use because it relies too much on the terminal and software is okish.Mac is a very good platform for development because like Linux comes with many languages included like python, ruby , pearl etc and generally Apple has always had a very good relationship with the open source world contributing a lot of technology like OpenGL , WebKit etc. that we take for granted.On the other hand the tendency of Apple to go against the flow is something that has been causing headaches for many developers. Apple did try to kill Flash and they succeeded and now they also try to kill OpenGL. So its not all roses on MacOS because Apple does not hesitate to show its teeth, something that Windows and Linux rarely do.Personally I code in Python and the last 5 years in Pharo, my experience has been very smooth but I try to avoid the MacOS only parts and instead focus only on the cross platform parts.Hardware wise mac are rock solid and unlike many people believe they are act the most cost effective. They are more expensive but do not lose their value like pcs. So you can sell them back and make a substantial amount of the price you paid.In the end you can easily have a double boot Mac with MacOS and Windows and Linux inside a VM. I am not so sure about triple boot mac with MacOS/Windows/Linux , it must be possible but no idea how easy it is as I have never tried it.In any case having those OSes on VMs is even better because you avoid having to restart your mac to change OS.About Python specifically , cpython runs great on macos , no problems what so ever and a ton of libraries. Apple also supports cpython natively through its PyObjC bridge which gives cpython access to all Objective C libraries which still remains the OS language. If you look at something cross platform GUI wise, I was successful with pyQT.Latest MacOS is Sierra 10.12 and it comes with Cpython 2.7.10 preinstalled. Of course you can also install python 3.As I said, I rarely concern myself with the MacOS peculiarities because I rely on cross platform tools and libraries the workflow is almost the same.Windows has also improved quite a lot lately with the addition of Ubuntu core and Powershell making it come much closer to Linux and MacOS.I did not have to unlearn my Windows way actually to this day I am pissed that MacOS does not maximize windows but when I first converted back in 2007 it took me 2 days to feel comfortable with MacOS. The reason is that you dont have to battle with settings and customisations to get things right with MacOS. It works well out of the box and this is why customising MacOS is pretty rare.Your Windows ways will come handy because most likely if you make commercial apps you will keep developing on Windows or at least testing your apps, even if it is free software. So dont unreal those skills.Summary: You will be fine and you have a ton of options to adjust the workflow to the one you feel comfortable with.","129,189 followers",Jessica Su,937,1.5K,49.8M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-possibility-for-a-poor-country-to-develop-without-copying-any-technology-from-advanced-countries

It can be made as such, but it potentially breaks some applications. I recommend splitting the HD into two, where the second partition is formatted case sensitive, and used for the coding. This saves a lot of headache down the line.Bottom line, they work for some, not for the others. I consider myself heavy user, and Macs are not for me.

Apple works with hundreds of Asian suppliers from screens to screws for their products. Boeing built a complex management platform for its global supply chain. Intel designs chips in Israel, and makes them in china.On the demand side, China is 20-25 percent of apple's revenue, while Boeing forecasts China will need 8,700 airliners in the next 2 decades, or more than 400 per year. Boeing delivered 157 jets last year while its record was 806 in 2018. As for semiconductors, China consumes more semiconductors than the rest of the world combined, though a significant portion is exported as components in finished products.As long as America continues to have access to the irreplaceable Chinese market and supply chain, targeted sanctions against Chinese tech companies will be limited. China is so big that systemic shocks will cause upheavals in the global supply chain.

For many years, the second-largest city in Texas was dominated by two newspapers - Dallas Morning News and Dallas Times-Herald. The Morning News had more subscribers and considered a higher quality newspaper.Nonetheless, the Times-Herald had many loyal readers, since the Morning News was considered too supportive of ‘Big Business’ and Dallas ‘Establishment thinking.’ The Times-Herald was considered the rebel but had struggled financially and the owners had agreed to sell off its franchise to the bigger paper.The Morning News was excited to buy out their main rival. They shut down the Times-Herald and Dallas turned into a one newspaper town. The inevitable results - Dallas Morning News lowered its quality of local news coverage, they lost many subscribers, had to enact huge rounds of layoffs and the media outlet is no longer one of the best newspapers in the country.The lesson from the tale is to explain how competition can breed excellence and a monopoly can cause the opposite impact than expected. In the global science and & hi-tech industries, the two main business rivals emerging are the United States and China.The US is acting like the Dallas Morning News thinking they just need to throw money to buy out their rivals and if they don’t succeed there they are lobbying Washington, London and Brussels to block Chinese tech. firms. And if they can accomplish that we will witness US hi-tech companies not upgrading since they have no competition to fear.A company becoming a monopoly cares only about its self-interests and without competition they tend to act as bullies towards their customers by raising prices on products and services on offer while lowering the scale of R&D (research and development) investments and operations.They can act with impunity and that’s why many governments, including China, enforce strong regulations on anti-monopolistic practices.In the short and perhaps mid-term outlook, US companies could enjoy some success wiping out its competition from China but in the long-term they have sealed a doomed fate. Chinese tech companies will shift operations and localize productions, development and consumer base.The Chinese companies will have added incentives to upgrade as they can only succeed by expanding in the domestic markets, as well as in the emerging markets. Meanwhile, US tech firms have no motivation to upgrade as they believe their competition was eliminated in the markets of the US, Canada, United Kingdom and European Union.China hi-tech companies are innovative and we can read more about it from China Daily. The link is here:As reported by the China Daily:“The 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) under discussion at the annual sessions of the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee sets out a blueprint for becoming a global front-runner in scientific and technological innovation. China's lawmakers and political advisers are exploring the issue at this year's two sessions.Noting that the world is moving into a digital economy and that China has led the foray into 5G and related industries using artificial intelligence, China can make bigger strides in global innovation by getting deeper into the combined use of AI, cloud storage and big data analytics, he said.”In other words, the US decoupling from China tech strategy will not restore the USA to its former glory days.WeChat: 86 13439758718",22 followers,Joseph Wang,1.1K,28.6K,105.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-possibility-for-a-poor-country-to-develop-without-copying-any-technology-from-advanced-countries

Being vigilant is necessary, but don’t be short sighted and stupid.So, my answer to this question is with an absolute no.This will not help us become more competitive, dominating or secured.",49 followers,Bill Chen,556,3.8K,52.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-possibility-for-a-poor-country-to-develop-without-copying-any-technology-from-advanced-countries

This opens them up to happily establishing a Tech Transfer platform with a Singaporean or Malaysian company which is entirely chinese controlledChina thus acquires the Technology indirectly and the Private Tech CompaniesConclusionsThe Chinese beautifully Exploit the Justice System in democracies, exploit the initial advantage given to them by Clinton and Obama to invest in many many countries and exploit the fact thatThus no matter what the Politicians say -US Cannot throttle China in this childish way.China will get all the equipment it needs without any restrictions whatsoever.","68,812 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-possibility-for-a-poor-country-to-develop-without-copying-any-technology-from-advanced-countries

37,"This question is often used by those who have no idea what it takes to have technological progress.In 2016, the Chinese proThis question is often used by those who have no idea what it takes to have technological progress.In 2016, the Chinese produced 4.6 million STEM (Science, Technological, Engineering, and Maths) graduates whereas the US only produced 568,000. The Chinese outnumber the US by more than eight times.With all that brainpower reserve, do the Chinese produce more discoveries and inventions?Historically, when the US was progressing in the early 20th century, the UK tried to delay the needed technology to the US in hopes of delaying their rise. It worked for a short while but eventually, the US surged forward to displace the UK. Similarly, China will meet with some hiccups but eventually, there’ll be enough smart people who will help China overcome these hiccups expeditiously.The result of the above is manifested in the realities on the ground. The more the US blocked China like in the space technology, the more the challenge by the Chinese to make breakthroughs like the Chinese Beidou vis-a-vis GPS.The US barred the Chinese from participating in their space station venture before. Soon the only space Station will be the Chinese space station which the Chinese return the barring of the US from participating. The technological race as reported by the Harvard Report is a good read of the race between China and the US which will provide some pointers to the future.In summary, the US cutting Chinese technology companies off US supplies of key components would not be able to restore the US’s competitiveness and consolidate its absolute technological dominance of the world. The hard numbers showed the outlines of the future indicating the rise of China. The Harvard Report clearly showed that China will win the technological race in the future. The US just does not have the numbers. Biden leading the US to deny the facts will result in futility. The US must respond sensibly if it were to continue to prosper with the Chinese. The rise of China is quite unstoppable.","68,812 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,1.4K,17.3K,413.9M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-possibility-for-a-poor-country-to-develop-without-copying-any-technology-from-advanced-countries

39,"This is all subjective, but here is my take on it. For those who preach bootstrap, Jquery etc on the front end. You don't need that to create a responsive page. If you find you will only use 10% of a framework, don't use it, you are loading 90% for nothing. Writing media queries are not that hard to create a responsive page, and if you are only simple dom manipulation skip even loading jquery. You will find your page will perform better for it, and you have less moving parts to break in the future and less hassles with version control. Now back to your question of back end.

Google app engine is great, but so is AWS, and many other host out there. I personally take the skeptical approach and take the cheapest option and scale from there. It's not hard to redirect your sites domain and name servers, it is however more costly to support a site that's getting 3 hits a day yet your paying for services you aren't using. As far as someone just saying you should go with a mean stack, or any other stack without hearing specifically what your application does, it's impossible. In many cases going with SQL over noSQL is highly beneficial,  in others using a compiled language versus an interpreted on is the way to go, all of these are even subjective to time versus product.","82,153 followers",Quincy Larson,547,358,29.1M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-possibility-for-a-poor-country-to-develop-without-copying-any-technology-from-advanced-countries
