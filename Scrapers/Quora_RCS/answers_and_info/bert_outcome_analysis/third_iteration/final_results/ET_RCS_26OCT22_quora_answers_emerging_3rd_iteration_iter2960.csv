There are pros and cons on either side. Let's begin with the pros.Evidence on earth suggests that almost as soon as conditions became favorable for the emergence of life, life sprung into being. And once it emerged, it refused to be eradicated, despite massive cosmic bombardment and extreme climate changes. Even today, life clings on in extreme environments where the existence of life was previously thought impossible.Based on this it seems very likely that any celestial body with a stable, favorable environment, will produce life of some kind. And yes even technologically intelligent life. Life evolves survival strategies and it turns out technological intelligence is a winning strategy, so far anyway. So why wouldn't intelligence as a survival strategy evolve somewhere else?So how likely is it that such environments exist elsewhere in the cosmos? Well we've not found any others so far. But of the 150 billion or so solar systems in our galaxy we have data for a miniscule proportion. And the data we have is based on deduction, not actual observation. Statistics would suggest that in a population of 150 billion stars with all their planets and moons (just in our galaxy, nevermind the universe), it is almost absurd to think that our local star is the only one around which those stable favorable conditions exist.So that all sounds pretty good for the emergence of life, right? But here is the one enormous con.There is not a single shred of evidence that life has ever existed anywhere in the universe other than right here on planet earth. Sure we've picked up some weird signals that some suggest could be extraterrestrial in nature but that's hardly proof. And yes, there are frequent UFO sightings, but there's no proof that any of those unidentified flying objects are actually little green (or gray or whatever) men in spaceships zooming through our skies. For all the pros that life must exist elsewhere, we have no evidence. And we probably never will.There's a very good possibility that the immense distances between stars and the laws of physics sets up an impenetrable barrier to interstellar travel, for any civilization regardless of their advancement. That leaves us with listening for their transmissions, as we're attempting to do with the SETI program. But that's problematic as well.Take the earth for example. We've been sending radio waves out into space for about 200 years. That means that the only civilizations who can possibly pick up those signals must exist within a bubble around the earth with a radius of about 200 light years. That is a ridiculously tiny volume of our galaxy.Even if there is a civilization a 100 light years or so away, would they even be able to detect those signals? 100 light years is a long way and the only signals they could pick up would have to claw their way out of our atmosphere without becoming scrambled, and then stretch across the expanse of space without attenuating to meaningless background noise. And while it's true that we have space probes outside our atmosphere sending transmissions, all those transmissions are aimed squarely at the earth and nowhere else. And of course these same issues impact our ability to detect them.So, is it likely that life exists elsewhere? Unless we find it somewhere in our own solar system we'll probably never know. The galaxy could be absolutely teaming with technologically advanced beings and they would all be in the same boat as us, looking out into the cosmos and wondering if they are alone in the universe, and faced with the very real possibility that they will never have an answer.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-odds-of-life-outside-earth-And-how-likely-is-it-that-they-are-at-a-more-advanced-technology-level-than-us

When I was growing up in the 90s, the Kenyan government depended on IMF and World Bank for loans and other forms of fiscal support. However, the support from these institutions came with numerous conditions.One of these conditions was the government had to implement Structural Adjustment Policies or SAPs. The policies meant that the government had to freeze hiring and remove all forms of subsidies to farmers or support to economic actors such a small businesses. The government also had to open the economy or reduce its role to the minimum.In the short term, the conditions depressed the economy. In 2000, Kenyan economy contracted by 2% or thereabout. I cannot recall. The government could no longer give farmers AI services, so the quality of dairy herd deteriorated. Milk production plummeted.The exit of government in critical sectors such as coffee farming led to takeover by cartels. Farmers could no longer get their earnings on time. Millions of coffee farmers as a consequence uprooted their coffee. Production declined. Without a source of income, millions of farmers sank into poverty. In 2001, I visited a coffee growing area and could see people had built big and nice houses during the coffee boom but at that time the whole area was economically depressed. The desperation was to high that in fact I met a woman begging me for money. It is not normal to see beggars in rural areas. You can now see the level of despondency.The Kenyan government fully complied with IMF and World Bank conditions but the foxy institutions often did not meet their side of the bargain. After opening the economy as well, the financial support never arrived. They then started talking about opening up the political space. That we needed democracy. And those kind of things.From my personal experience, it is hard to trust World Bank and IMF. I am saying this and yet I am an outsider. I am not in government or ever worked for it. This is write-up is based on my personal experience growing in rural areas and from what I was reading in the papers or listened on radio. I also noticed that support from the western countries also came with conditions similar to those of the World Bank and IMF. Its like the two are one and the same thing.Chinese loans in contrast do not have those conditions. I think that is why African leaders have embraced them. If I were a political leader myself, I would accept them. Support from western countries and their affiliated institutions has too many disruptive conditions. I agree that the objective of those conditions is to make the economy competitive but I don’t see how you can make an economy competitive by cutting subsidies to peasant farmers so that they cannot access AI services. Or leaving small scale farmers to the vagaries of the market.These loans are good for recipients but they have security implications for the west as time Magazine has argued very well here.I must admit that the economics of debt and stuff is complex. Too much indebtedness without sufficient economic growth might lead to debt distress. Also, the west, IMF, and World Bank perhaps impose tough loan conditions in good faith. So we cannot generalize and say the west and Breton Woods institutions are intrinsically bad, as some people often do. That is why I think poor countries need to think long and hard on how to develop their economies because solutions elsewhere might not work.Personally, If were a political leader, I would modernize agriculture, improve marketing of produce and particularly focus on processing and formalizing all aspects of the economy, automate processes, and encourage adoption of new technologies such as electric cars, as that would automatically eliminate the huge oil import bill poor countries incur. I would also limit some imports. Introduce universal feeding programs for school going children to provide market for the farm produce. Create powerful devolved units based on tribes or related tribes to combat corruption and mindless competition for political seats which is in reality tribal contests.

Recent research reveals how those slaves were vitally important to the cotton industry which led America to global dominance, in the times when ‘cotton was king’, or as Noam Chomsky puts it - it was the ‘oil’ of the time. Of course a significant chunk of the territory was purchased for a song from France, which had done to the Red Indians of those states what other Europeans had done.On the other hand, China - which had been the world's largest economy for nearly 2000 years, right upto the 1800s - but was subjected to ‘100 years of humiliation’ by the British and other European powers, who took advantage of their superior military technology to rape China, including by forcing down Chinese throats opium grown in India and Turkey (Solozzo from the Godfather, the Roosevelt family in real life) - was reduced to a poor country. As was India, which had been the second largest economy.This Trumpian claim that China has stolen trillions from the US is a brazen fraud, and a grotesque over-simplification of the facts. The simple fact is that following the ‘Powell memorandum’, the super-rich in America (now known as the 0.01%) took giant steps to take control of politics, the media, the judiciary, the academy and think tanks, for the purpose of destroying labour unions significantly - by transferring production to wherever labour was dirt cheap, starting with Mexico, then Eastern Europe, then China, now Vietnam, Thailand, Bangladesh, etc.Some decades ago, independent Ross Perot who ran for the White House - tried to warn that the planned NAFTA would result in the ‘giant sucking sound of jobs moving to Mexico'.The globalists succeeded in drowning out his warning.These mercenary vermin only care about personal profits. Why pay $20 or 25 an hour to American or European labour, when the same work can be done overseas for $1 or 2 an hour?So China benefited from this, starting as an assembly machine, but now has used its wealth to invest in high technology, as well as vastly superior infrastructure including a marvelous network of bullet trains.Excepting military technology where the US is still the dominant force (with significant exceptions such as the hypersonic missiles that Russia has made, EMP missiles and its SS-400 system) - despite the monstrous bloat, hubris and fraud that plague the Pentagon system, China is now more advanced in many ways than the U...",UNKNOWN,Prashant Kumar,5.7K,428,335.2K,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-odds-of-life-outside-earth-And-how-likely-is-it-that-they-are-at-a-more-advanced-technology-level-than-us

It can do the job, much faster and perfectly.In manufacturing, research and development, and technology India doesn't even stand a chance against China. Comparing the two is preposterous. The pathetic state of Indian manufacturing can be gauged from the fact that 69 years after independence, India can't even manufacture products as simple as earphones. Yes, even your earphones are probably manufactured in China, though they might contain a Made in India tag, to fool the Indians.Comparing the two countries would be a great injustice to China. Most of Chinese people don't want their country to be compared with India, they think of it below their dignity, the same way we think of Pakistan. They like to compare their country with countries like America and Japan.Images source:",52 followers,David Levy,889,295,1.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-so-many-advanced-technologies-sold-to-the-stupid-and-not-even-good-people

There are no such things as betting, speculating or guessing when it comes to investments of this size. 1 trillion is in no way considered pocket change even for a country as rich as China.

There are no such things as betting, speculating or guessing when it comes to investments of this size. 1 trillion is in no way considered pocket change even for a country as rich as China. This project would have been studied from various angles, for a least a few years, consulted with various think tanks and agencies before China themselves even came up with a name call OBOR or CPEC etc. It is a plan that consist of many other plans that forms part of a full vision of a even greater plan to form a even greater vision that is a part of the grand plan. Simply put, it’s not like you wake up one day and say, “Let’s invest 1 trillion in OBOR and help Africa because I BET that it’s going to be our golden goose.”And if you think that during the planning stage of any part of this plan, there were no resistance from anyone, you must be quite naive. If western economist, consultants, and even the common citizens of another country can be negative about it, don’t you think that someone that is part of the planning process would not have been able to see any problems with such a complex project? Hell, my wife just disagreed with me this evening on whether I should buy a pink shirt for next year chinese new year! So disagreements and problems must have already been discussed thoroughly with solutions and backup plans in place before they move through each of the hundreds of thousands of KPIs they need to meet for this project to be even consider if they can start the project.But maybe those who don’t think it will work is better than the collective minds of all those involve…who knows?In a business project, we do our best to foresee all the problems and come up with alternatives and solutions before they can even happen. And if they actually did happen, we will react and solve it before moving on. You don’t get a chance to choose between being reactive or proactive, you just have to cover both simutaneously, if you can’t and think that all your plans and contigencies will work as it should be, then you would most probably fail.So does the Chinese knows this? I think they very much do, because they have managed to successfully manuvere themselves economically to hit almost all their targets for the last 20 years so far. You don’t become the 2nd largest economy in the world or biggest by PPP, simply by being lucky or even by being smart. They did it through their collective hard work, minds, experience and sacrifice of the 1.3 billion population they have.And if you ask me if China’s bet on Africa will pay off? I think the whole world should BET on China to be successful in this project since a better developed and richer Africa continent not only benefits China, but the whole world.","1,367 followers",Rahul Badami,16.4K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-so-many-advanced-technologies-sold-to-the-stupid-and-not-even-good-people

We eat badly, almost all our food is manufactured, our houses, cars offices are mostly AC tight. We fall sick more.The Europeans and Africans way of life were far different. We viewed wealth differently.In my tribe; A wealthy man is someone honourable enough to be called a Chief. A man with children, wives and land for agriculture. A powerful man in terms of strength, a man who could go to the scary forest to bring meat for his family.The west decided that for Africans to be called rich, they must have so and so billions, cars and houses.Africans are at a disadvantage here. This was not how we viewed wealth.The white man-made all things difficult and forced the black man to accept it as the new normal.In an attempt to meet this mark, our political leaders, even businessmen now steal funds to keep up with the status, 'rich man'.Africans are grossly at disadvantage in this metric system, hence we're rich in one part and considered poor in another part.Colonisation worked pretty fine because the majority of Africans have accepted the European standard and are now doing any and everything possible to attain the status.Africa is poor according to global standards, but even the very poor in Africa, mostly in the villages have enough food to keep body and soul even though he doesn't spend a dollar a day.Comparing Africa's wealth standards with that of the west is like telling a woman to have some features to qualify her a 'man', we are far different people.I know quite a lot of wealthy men in Africa who does not have a single Dollar to their name and are obviously considered poor by the coloniser.Why is Africa so far behind the rest of the world?It's because the new metric system of measuring wealth is new to Africans, we're only adopting it now.Meeting the standard wouldn't have been a problem only that our leaders are working tirelessly to ensure we remain behind.And since Africa is a continent, it won't be wise to say the whole continent is far behind, there are some countries that are doing extremely well in global standards.","68,790 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-so-many-advanced-technologies-sold-to-the-stupid-and-not-even-good-people
