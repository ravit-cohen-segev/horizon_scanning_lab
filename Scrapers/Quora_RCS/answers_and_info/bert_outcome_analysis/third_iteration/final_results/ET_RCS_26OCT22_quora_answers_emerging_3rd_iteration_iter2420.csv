8,"Technology is defined asthe application of scientific knowledge for practical purposesSince fiction ends up employing a whole lot of different kinds of technology I‚Äôm going to confine my self by the following rules:Technology is defined asthe application of scientific knowledge for practical purposesSince fiction ends up employing a whole lot of different kinds of technology I‚Äôm going to confine my self by the following rules:DISCLAIMER:DC TECHMother BoxesThese are small portable supercomputers, that are partly sentient. It‚Äôs said to be created by a scientist in New Genesis. Father Boxes are analogs created in the rival planet Apokolips, that‚Äôs ruled by Darkseid. Some of the major powers of these boxes are:The earth hero Cyborg survives only because of his convergence with one such box.Zeta BeamsWhile a Boom Tube is one method of fast-travel, the other, that is commonly used by the Justice League. Again, this is actually an alien technology that was originally built for interstellar communication.Lantern Rings/BatteriesOne could argue that these are magical in nature, but considering the fact that the batteries have been built and the fact that they aren‚Äôt particularly effective against Superman makes me think they can be classified as technology.Phantom Zone ProjectorThe Phantom Zone itself is a plane outside of space-time that has just existed. It was discovered however, by Jor-El. In order to use it as an alternate method of incarceration by exile (as opposed to the earlier method of suspended animation), a projector was developed.MiracloThis drug was developed in the comics by Hourman, but is actually more popularly known to fans via its counterpart 5-UR-93-R from the Injustice games. These ‚Äúsuper-vitamin‚Äù pills grant the consumer augmented strength, speed and reflexes. That‚Äôs how a player with Nightwing could stand a chance against Superman.VenomThis is a strength enhancement drug, a super-steroid of sorts that is derived from Miraclo. A variant strain is popularly used by Bane. Although, Batman has used it too. A hybrid version of it is used in the Arkham games to produce the Titan formula by Joker as well.Velocity-9Flash fans would find this familiar. This is literally a speed boosting drug developed by Vandal Savage.MARVEL TECHUnstable MoleculesEver wondered how Mr. Fantastic‚Äôs costume never stretches thin? Invisible Woman‚Äôs clothes disappear with her? Or how does Spidey change the colour palette of his gear so seamlessly?It‚Äôs because of synthetic material Reed Richards developed that would be ideal for Superhero-level wear and tear.RepulsorPopularly used inside Iron-Man‚Äôs arch reactor, but it has more uses too.A repulsor is a form in which a high density muon beam can be projected, as a powerful blast of concussive energy called repulsor blasts. Repulsor blasts may be directed by magnets and focused by electrostatic lenses, although they may also be self-focusingAs seen in the MCU, the repulsor technology is used to power many things including the original Avengers‚Äô tower.AdamantiumThese are some of the strongest metals in the MU. Wolverine‚Äôs skeleton is Adamantium and Captain America‚Äôs shield is made of Proto-Adamantium. Even though Vibranium itself is naturally occurring, you could mine it at Wakanda, Adamanitum is a man-made iron-based alloy.According to comic book lore, Proto-Adamantium was formed miraculously overnight while the scientist working on it was asleep. When he tried to emulate that feat he created True-Adamantium - the one used on Wolverine.Note:Shi‚Äôar Holographic Hard LightEver heard of Doctor Who‚Äôs TARDIS? It‚Äôs a telephone booth that‚Äôs bigger on the inside. The only such object (that I can remember) in the MU is the X-Men‚Äôs Danger Room. This is possible because of alien tech from the Shi‚Äôar (Xavier is virtually their son-in-law). The hard-light projections eliminate the need of elaborate obstacles or automated arsenals from training. Anything programmed in can be conjured up.Note some Shi‚Äôar upgrades are also present in the mutant version of Facebook that the X-Men use, Cerebro.SentinelsActually they‚Äôre just gigantic mechazoids. But the only difference from other fiction is that Bolivar Trask designed them to specifically detect and hunt down individuals with the X-gene, i.e. mutants.Super Soldier SerumIn the comics there‚Äôs no actual fluid, just a bunch of mad scientist steps between frail child to John Cena. However in the movie, the serum is a legit chemical, with formula et al.Hope SerumThis is known in the X-Men movies simply as ‚ÄúThe Mutant Cure‚Äù. What it does is exactly what it sounds like a mutant can suppress their abilities. It‚Äôs never been investigated if the cure is permanent though.Mutant Growth HormoneThis is the street-steroid for mutants. Interestingly enough, it was created by Dr. Hank McCoy (Beast) for noble purposes. This drug would kickstart any dormant mutant abilities within an individual.Gamma Ray ProjectorOne could say that gamma radiation in Marvel is screwed up, but let‚Äôs just use the projector to explain it as a conduit. Gamma radiation is what made Bruce Banner Hulk. That transformation was actually via a ‚Äúgamma bomb‚Äù. Later Banner used a projector to ensure he can ‚ÄúHulk out‚Äù at will.That‚Äôs pretty much all I can think of right now. There actually many interesting items that I‚Äôve skipped over because they‚Äôre more like minerals, substances or even zones that actually discovered and not invented.","4,879 followers",Ben Skirvin,3.5K,5.4K,29.9M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-America-not-stop-Covid-19-although-it-has-the-most-advanced-technologies-and-medicine-facilities

The characters have to grapple with the consequences of their actions and those of their enemies. When a city in the story is torn asunder, the book focuses entire volumes in how they deal with the fallout.Things change.DC and Marvel, on the other hand, don‚Äôt show a consistent universe. Theirs is a collection (a vast one) of tales from hundreds of authors, about different aspects of a hero‚Äôs life. Those heroes evolve and change as time passes, sometimes switching tracks and sometimes staying consistent. But the sheer scale of the assorted stories makes the creating of a single ‚Äúuniverse‚Äù impossible. How many reboots have occurred? How many times a character died and was revived?It‚Äôs not exactly a fair comparison, both things are too different from one an other.

Well did you know that back in 1990s, when there wasn‚Äôt a HUGE rivalry between Marvel and DC, there was a crossover called JLA/Avengers.Yeah. Back In the day, there weren‚Äôt many fanboys debating which one is better. The writers were actually friends, and they created crossovers. Now, there aren‚Äôt even any crossovers anymore. In fact, Stan Lee was in the new Teen Titans movie, and he was about to be featured in a Super Man show. Back then, the Marvel and DC writers and companies were at least friendly. They were rivals, but they were still friendsIn fact, it‚Äôs been highly speculated that Barry Allen traveled to the Marvel universe one time. I mean come on man. That showed how even though they were fierce rivals, they still worked together on some easter eggsNow, its considered like a taboo if Marvel is friends with DC. Before, fans couldn‚Äôt care if you were a DC or Marvel fanboy. It doesn‚Äôt matter which heroes you liked, as long as the hero is fleshed out and has cool moments. You guys could still gossip. Now, in 2018, if you say Marvel is better, there are fanboys who have the compulsion to fire back and say Marvel sucks. It‚Äôs a shame that instead of moving forward, we are moving backward and hating on each other.But back to the point. So I mention on perspective right? Here‚Äôs the thing.Some people like DC Super Heroes because they areIn All Star Super Man, a boy was about to commit suicide, Super Man stops him, and comforts him.He is also the First Super Hero in the world. Without Super Man there wouldn‚Äôt be Marvel, Spider Man, or Batman. All superhero characters are based on his template. The origin story, the superpowers, the secret identity, the love interest, and the villains. He‚Äôs obviously not the first character in history to have all of these things but the classic superhero tale is all Superman‚Äôs.People complain that Super Man is boring because he‚Äôs too nice, he‚Äôs too good, and he‚Äôs just not interesting. They probably haven‚Äôt even read Super Man. Super Man is basically Clark Kent, Kal-El, and Super Man.Clark Kent is a guy who‚Äôs born on a farm in Kansas. He‚Äôs nerdy, humble, and doesn‚Äôt stand out. Sounds kinda familiar right? Because clark Kent is US. Clark is the nerd who does what‚Äôs right and doesn‚Äôt get the recognition. Clark is the guy who is good at a lot of stuff, but doesn‚Äôt get noticed. He‚Äôs the guy loves the beautiful girl at work and can‚Äôt seem to get her attention because of the big strong guy in the cape she‚Äôs in love with. That‚Äôs Clark Kent. The mild-mannered reporter.Kal-el. The alien sent to earth who is just a little bit different. The immigrant with the american dream. Kal-el may be an alien, but how does that make him any different than us? We‚Äôve all felt alienated. We‚Äôve all felt different, and that we need to hide who we are to fit in. We feel like there‚Äôs nobody else like us. We‚Äôve been to new places, started new schools and jobs and gone to new countries where we are very much out of our element. Kal-el is this person in all of us. Diametrically, Kal-el is also the person Superman wasSuperman. The hero. Superman is the guy we all want to be. He‚Äôs strong, he‚Äôs fast and he can FLY! Love him or hate him, you would be Superman if you had the chance. He‚Äôs what we all wish we could be. The nerd who can take off his glasses and be strong and get noticed. He‚Äôs also an ideal. This is where people find him too alienating. They can‚Äôt seem to be able to connect with the idea that a man with all the power in the world would use his strength to help others and not for personal gain. And if that concept is too foreign to you, than you are beyond help in many ways. I think the idea of this guy who just wants to do good and help others is a beautiful idea. But there‚Äôs also the action hero side of Superman. He may want to do good, but he‚Äôs a strong dude and he‚Äôs not afraid to hit something. He‚Äôs a man of action of justice. And he will fight for what‚Äôs right.Super Man is considered by some people to be the best hero because he‚Äôs both relatable and inspiring at the same time.People also like Batman because he‚Äôs one of the most inspirational super heroes.Batman is not designed to be relatable. . I don‚Äôt know too many humans who are infinitely wealthy, driven by vengeance, and pathologically broody.But the key point is this. As a child, Bruce Wayne had a huge tragedy in front of him. But instead of being corrupt and being angry, he decided to channel his energy to fight crime to prevent kids from losing their parents. He had a dark past, but instead of choosing the easy way out and being a criminal, he fought against Fate and became a superhero. A lot of people are inspired about this, and believe that even if they have a dark past (like a drug or drinking addiction) they can change their life around.Batman strictly follow his principle ‚Äì Never kill anyone. He believes that no one has the rights to end someone‚Äôs life. Even when many tried to convince him that killing the bad ones is the only way to stop them, he never gave up on his principle.Ra‚Äôs Al Ghul: ‚ÄúYour compassion is a weakness your enemies will not share‚ÄùBatman: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important. It separates us from them‚Äù.Batman is also inspiring because he‚Äôs one of the founding members of the Justice League. He‚Äôs standing next to beings who are revered as gods. But does he cower or show any signs of being uncomfortable. No. He stands up to them, and even talks down on them, and they often listen. This inspires people, because no matter if you‚Äôre a nerd, you can stand next to jocks or people who play sports as equals.But you must be thinking, gee this guy talks a lot about DC Super Hero Heroes, he must love DC right hahahahaWRONGLet‚Äôs talk about my boy, Spider Man over here.People like Spider Man why? Because he‚ÄôsBut do people relate to Batman? Are people billionaires, or at least millionaires? Are they super genius who can solve almost any problem? Can they create gadgets, as well as machines and cars and tanks? Are they a head of their company? Can they learn countless martial arts?NO.Spider Man is relatable, because he‚Äôs like US. Back in the 1960s, Stan Lee decide to create a risky move. He decide to create a teenage superhero not as a sidekick, but as a loner.Back in the day, teenage superheroes had to be sidekicks so it could appeal to younger audience because most writers don‚Äôt know how to write a story where a teenager could act independently, and it could boost the mentor‚Äôs sales. They also thought that a teenage superhero wasn‚Äôt a good idea, and could give them a bad reputation.Stan Lee was like SCREW THAT. Just because you‚Äôre a teenager doesn‚Äôt mean you aren‚Äôt qualified to be a superhero. Just because you‚Äôre a boy doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be a sidekick. Spider Man was a teenager, when he would react to danger, he would react what a teenager would react. A teenager wouldn‚Äôt look at a bad guy and say ‚ÄúPfft. This guy is nothing. I could do this all day.‚Äù No, a teenager would be like ‚Äúoh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit.‚ÄùIn DC, you had Batman. you had superman. you had all these superheroes who were MEN, who all children could aspire to, and all the children could be men and superheroes if they eat their vegetables or something like that. A nerdy kid would read that and be like ‚Äúoh dang. I want to be like that. Except I‚Äôm not because I‚Äôm just a boy who‚Äôs a loser and don‚Äôt have any chicks.‚ÄùSpider Man came along and say ‚ÄúHey nerdy kid. you too can be a superhero because you‚Äôre just like me.‚ÄùSuper Man may be an alien, but did he had to worry about acing his classes? Super Man became a superhero when he first got a job. Did Batman have to worry about curfew? Batman does this superhero thing all night! Does Bruce and Clark Kent have to worry about asking girls out? No, because Clark already have a girlfriend, and Bruce is a playboy. Not many comic readers are playboy, or have girlfriends. Spider Man was what every superhero was. He had to study, but he can‚Äôt because he‚Äôs too busy fighting crime. he has to worry about money issues, and needs to find a job. He has to contemplate whether he should use his 20 dollars for his bus pass, his lunch, or to use it for web shooters.Every human being has struggled with doing the right thing at some point. Every human being has had problem in life bombard them to the point they aren‚Äôt sure what to do. People like spidey because he shows us ourselves in a way that shows we can overcome the mundane if we don‚Äôt give up. In fact, Peter‚Äôs first job was at the Daily bugle, where his boss doesn‚Äôt even like Spider Man, so Peter has to take pictures so that his boss can publish Anti-Spider Man news. talk about bad luck. But does Peter complain about it? No. He has to push on and keep on doing it because he is self-less and he needs to do it not for him, but for his aunt. He also gets underpaid, but has to deal with it.Peter parker gets bullied at school, but he can‚Äôt fight back or else he will risk his identity out. He can‚Äôt seem to make that many friends because he‚Äôs an introvert. If you think of your typical teenage comic book reader in the 1970‚Äôs, Spider-Man hit all the right buttons.Finally, people like Spider Man because of his attitude. Even in the face of danger, peter quipps not because he finds it funny, but because he‚Äôs nervous so he‚Äôs trying to relieve tension. That‚Äôs what a teenager should react. When Batman and Super man meet a bad guy, they often react with confidence or without emotion, just wanting to get the job done. when Spider Man meets a strong super villain, he is nervous, but he uses humor to disguise it. People also like Spider Man because it‚Äôs more colorful and unique and Batman and Superman. Spider Man also learns martial arts too, which some people could relate to.So now that I got that out of the way, the million dollar question. Which one do I prefer. DC Or Marvel? or which one‚Äôs better.Like I said, it all boils down to the reader‚Äôs perspective. Do people like heroes that inspire people (Batman, Super Man) or do people like super heroes that relate to people (Spider Man).In fact, this was point out in JLA/ Avengers.When the Justice League arrived in the Marvel universe, they were shocked and dismayed at the Avenger‚Äôs efforts to improve their Earth.Super Man is EXTREMELY angered by this because even with all the powers, the Marvel super heroes have failed to improve the Earth‚Äôs conditions. He feels that they haven‚Äôt been doing their job correctly.When the Marvel heroes got the Ultimate Nullifier away during a skirmish, Super Man says he doesn‚Äôt respect them at all.Similarly, when the Avengers arrived in DC Universe, they were shocked and in awe of how futuristic the DC Universe is, and surprised how beloved the super heroes are, compared to the Marvel universe where everyone hates mutants and blames super heroes for destruction.Captain America is furious about this because he believes that Justice League are treating the civilians like public. He believes they are treated like Gods, and believes that superheroes should protect people‚Äôs freedoms, not demand people‚Äôs adoration.on one hand, I do understand why Super Man is ticked off. It seems that the Avengers aren‚Äôt doing their job right. There are so many drug dealers, so many people that are in poverty, so many people that are corrupt. He believes that the Avengers aren‚Äôt doing their job to the fullest ability. But the issue is that the Marvel universe is more cynical than DC Universe. The public hate the mutants because they‚Äôre not normal, they‚Äôre like abomination. But in the DC universe, everyone accepts superheroes.And for captain America, I understand why he‚Äôs ticked off. His ideals are that everyone should have equal rights and be treated equally. He believes that being a superhero is for people to not be scared for them. He believes that being a superhero will help the civilians be at ease so they won‚Äôt be afraid of danger, because they know the Avengers will arrive. He doesn‚Äôt agree with you should be a super hero because of the public will adore you. That‚Äôs not what being a superhero is about. It‚Äôs about saving people, not making you popular. He doesn‚Äôt like how, in his perspective, the Justice League are like fascists, and they are considered Gods.In conclusion, people prefer Marvel because they have characters that are more relatable. People prefer DC because they have characters that inspire you. But there shouldn‚Äôt be which one‚Äôs better or not. I mean, if DC and Marvel super heroes can hang out, I am pretty sure Marvel and DC fans could hang out.",55 followers,Gerardo Vazquez,1.2K,57,402.9K,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-America-not-stop-Covid-19-although-it-has-the-most-advanced-technologies-and-medicine-facilities

Congratulations!So I know that your question was just Thanos VS Ultron, but if Ultron were to beat the Avengers, a LOT, and I mean A LOT of things would change in Phase Three, which therefore changes the amount of Infinity Stones that Thanos has on his gauntlet.Later on, there will be different scenarios that will take place that might even prevent Ultron from fighting Thanos in the first place. I‚Äôll take care of that dilemma as it comes along.Anyways, yeah, if Ultron beats the Avengers, it changes the location of the Infinity Stones and the powers that both sides have, so we need to figure out who has which to decipher a victor.Let‚Äôs run it down:But for the sake of argument, let‚Äôs say that Ultron somehow finds a way to win so he can fight Thanos. How is the Mad Titan doing on his quest?That puts Thanos in a predicament:The Space Stone seems like a good idea, since with that he can easily teleport around, but Earth has TWO Infinity Stones, and considering he‚Äôll probably need as much power as possible to best Hela, he could go to Earth just as easily.Since I don‚Äôt know which Thanos would go for first or if he would try to take both simulataneously, this splits this answer into three scenarios that change the amount of Infinity Stones Thanos has in the end.Scenario One: Thanos goes to Earth first.So this one is interesting. Thanos lands on Earth and finds it almost if not completely devoid of Human life and replaced with an AI with thousands of robots who has the thing that he wants on his forehead.Thanos has:Ultron has:Who would win that fight? To be honest, NO IDEA. Thanos could turn the Ultrons into ribbons (Reality Stone) and just One-punch them with the Power Stone, but Ultron probably knows this (since he has the Mind Stone and he‚Äôs already super smart) and turns back time with the Time Stone and continues the fight. Theoretically, it could go on for a long time, and I don‚Äôt know how a fight between two people with two Infinity Stones each would go.The Black Order can very well defeat a number of Ultrons, but once the main Ultron gets there they‚Äôre all pretty much done for. Remember, the original Vision was injured because he was caught off guard. Ultron is never like that in a battle like this.I think it really could go either way. Comment if you have a winner in mind.If Ultron wins, then Thanos‚Äô plan is stopped. Hela would eventually run into Ultron in her attempt to take over the Nine Realms, but that‚Äôs for another time. It sounds like an awesome scenario, though.If Thanos wins, then the fact that he hasScenario Two: Thanos goes to Asgard first.This one is more iffier in an outcome than the last. Thanos goes to Asgard, and therefore has to face Hela, who at this point should be MUCH more powerful than in Ragnarok since she‚Äôs had much more time on the throne and therefore, Asgard makes her steadily more powerful. She also has her entire army at her disposal.Thanos has the Outriders and the Black order, as well as the Power and Reality stones.Here‚Äôs the thing: Thanos doesn‚Äôt like to use more than what is necessary since he sees himself as a hero. So, he wouldn‚Äôt go full power right out of the gate.But, on the other end, Hela DOES go full power, and her full power is legendarily strong. She can definitely kill all of the Outriders single-handedly; heck, even the entire Black Order. Thanos is her only problem.Since Hela can kill very quickly and efficiently, before Thanos even considers using more power than usual, Hela could have murdered a HUGE chunk of his army, and maybe even a few members of the Black Order, if not all of them. Long story short, Thanos loses most likely more than half of his army before deciding to step in and get more serious.Since he has the Power and Reality Stones, all he really has to do is turn Hela into bubbles or something and then wipe those bubbles out of existence with the Power Stone. He wouldn‚Äôt let Hela live (Since she‚Äôs actively trying to kill him and therefore interfere with his plan, which the Avengers were only doing the latter, which is why he respected them), most likely, and therefore just walks in and takes the Tesseract.Then, it‚Äôs off to Earth, which Thanos (if his whole army is dead, which is a real possibility) just travels to with the Space Stone, probably by himself.Now, it‚Äôs Thanos, alone, with the Space, Reality, and Power Stones, up against the entire Ultron Army and Ultron himself, who has the Mind and Time Stones.Thanos does have a huge number disadvantage, but he also has a huge advantage by having one more stone.I think that Thanos might have the edge in this battle. Sure, he‚Äôs up against an entire army and may or may not have been injured by Hela, but since he has the Space stone, any attack he uses with the Power or Reality Stone can be made universally among all Ultrons. So, he could theoretically win if he puts a lot of effort into it, but I don‚Äôt know the kind of strain it would put on his body, using that much energy that quickly.I think that in the end, the only Ultron that would survive that wipeout is the main one with the Time and Mind stones. How would Thanos go about this?Ultron is a smart individual. He wiped out humanity to preserve life, so MAYBE he would agree with Thanos and his plan to preserve life by killing half of it, maybe he wouldn‚Äôt. I honestly don‚Äôt remember much of Age of Ultron to know if his ideals match with the Mad Titan‚Äôs, but either way, the outcome‚Äôs the same.Thanos is too strong, and he ends up with the Time and Mind Stone, which either way kills Ultron, whether he agrees or not (since the Mind Stone is connected to his body).Now, all he has to do is find the Soul Stone. Since he has the Space Stone, he can eventually find out by proxy that Gamora knows where it is, teleport to her, sacrifice her, get the Soul Stone, and then SNAP! Half of life is gone, and since the Avengers are gone and the Guardians are too weak, there‚Äôs nothing stopping his plan in the future.Except‚Ä¶maybe there is a way? I did say Ant-Man survived, and if Nick Fury somehow managed to lay low while Ultron was ravaging Earth‚Ä¶then he could have used the pager to contact Captain Marvel.Guess who are the two Heroes in the actual MCU that weren‚Äôt in Avengers 3 that survived the Snap? Ant-Man and Captain Marvel. (and also Hawkeye, but‚Ä¶eh.)Maybe they can save the universe after all?Anyways, onto Scenario 3.Scenario 3: Thanos plays it smart and goes to Asgard by himself while the Black Order and Outriders go to Earth.This one is probably what would have actually happened if this event occurred, but I just did the other two because they were so distinct in the end when you think about it. But this one endsWhen Thanos goes to Asgard (maybe on a separate ship or something since he doesn‚Äôt have the Space Stone), he‚Äôs alone against an entire undead Asgardian Army and Hela, who is stronger than ever. He only has the Reality and Power Stones, like in the 2nd Scenario, but this time he doesn‚Äôt have his army to back him up.Here‚Äôs the thing: Hela could very easily Stormbreaker him and pierce him in the gut or pierce his head open with her neat spike things. The only reason why I didn‚Äôt say that in Scenario 2 is because she was distracted with Thanos‚Äô army. If that happens and she uses her spikes on Thanos, he‚Äôs dead, and really I think that‚Äôs easily what could happen.But since this question wasWhen he gets there, he learns his entire army has been completely destroyed.Why? Because 1.) Ultron doesn‚Äôt have weird military tactics like the Wakandans do, and 2.) He‚Äôs a lot STRONGER than the Wakandans and could easily destroy all of the Outriders. The Black Order is also overwhelmed as well, since they‚Äôre fighting the equivalent (or stronger) of Vision who not only is genocidal but has two instead of one Infinity Stone, as well as a lot of Vibranium counterparts. To be honest, Thanos‚Äô army is destroyed, and Thanos is faced with the same predicament as Scenario 2.Only this time, Thanos is much, much more injured. If Ultron sees Thanos as an immediate threat (he probably would since he would realize that the Mad Titan has Infinity Stones too), he might kill Thanos on the spot, since the Mad Titan isn‚Äôt strong enough to wield the full power of the Infinity Stones he has. And since Thanos could just be restrained like in Infinity War by all the Ultrons, Ultron could kill him and get the other three Infinity Stones for himself.Edit:Scenario 4: Thanos goes to Earth, while the Outrider Army and the Black Order go to Asgard.This scenario‚Ä¶does not end well for Thanos, at all. For two big reasons:1.) He‚Äôll be alone against Ultron, who has just as much Infinity Stones as he has PLUS an entire army that could be reaching the millions at this point.2.) The Outriders and The Black Order aren‚Äôt even remotely a challenge for Hela. Like I said, once they land there, Hela can take ALL of the Outriders at once (she did kill all but one Valkyrie- and Valkyries are much more skilled than Outriders, obviously.) and most likely solo the Black Order as well. This isn‚Äôt even taking into account that she has an army of her own.So the fight on Earth would most likely go in Ultron‚Äôs favor since his robots and his Infinity Stones are all focused on one guy, while the one on Asgard is a slaughter in Hela‚Äôs favor.So‚Ä¶yeah. The one on Earth probably ends up with Ultron winning 6‚Äì7/10 times, while the one on Asgard ends with Hela winning 10/10 times.Which means the most probable outcome in this scenario is Ultron ending up with four Infinity Stones and then running into Hela in her quest for the Nine Realms.And that‚Äôs a fight I want to see.So‚Ä¶yeah. That‚Äôs what would happen. I hope that wasn‚Äôt too long of a read (let‚Äôs be honest, it probably was), and please feel free to disagree or correct me if you think a scenario could have happened differently.Thanks for reading!Edit:Edit 2:Edit 3:Edit 4:Edit 5:I‚Äôm seeing a lot of people disagreeing with me on the comments below (good, you should, I sometimes miss a lot of details), and I agree with a lot of them. However, I think I can get around most (if not all) of the glaring issues with a bit of writing. Here are the1.) Nebula still tries to kill Thanos, so Thanos still knows about Gamora knowing about the Soul Stone.2.) Wakanda would beat Ultron, easily.3.)4.)5.) Hela can‚Äôt make it to Asgard, since Loki isn‚Äôt on Earth to get her there.I think that was everything.

"" I did MBBS to study, the physiological composition of a human being,"" says this scientist, with a penchant for a quest. from 1972 to 2000, Shukla has been involved in energy projects. "" I got so fascinated by solar energy, that I started reading the Surya Sanhita, an Indian scripture that describes the tantra (techniques), mantra (talismans) and yantra (tools) to worship the sun.

"" I stayed eight months in Rameshwaram to get an insight. my scientific rationale never got influenced by hearsay. many told me that they got cured by taking a bath in the wells of Rameshwar."" he analyzed the water from 24 wells and found out that a bath in it for eight days, was able to cure skin diseases like psoriasis. his study revealed that the water from each well, contains radioactive ions like calcium, magnesium, and others. he also used instruments to measure the skin's reaction. however, he says that he got more interested in finding out more about the Shivlinga of the temple. "" I used ultrasound machines that have echoes of the frequency. scintillation meters showed that the counter moved automatically when it detected gamma rays. then I wanted to know the origin of these rays."" so he studied the material of the Shivlinga. he found out the age of the Shivlinga through carbon dating method and electron-spin resonance method. ""the material was formed 13000 years ago. this also collates with the Ramayana. there is a popular story, that Rama built this Shivlinga with sand to the chant of Vashishta's Tantra, mantra, and yantra."" at the center of the shiv-linga, radioactive iodine, iron, platinum, palladium are present. ""today, it emits alpha, beta and gamma rays,"" he tells us. he has a lot of interesting information to share with us on a few of city's temples which have a lesser frequency, thus with a lesser crowd. "" I studied them under normal situations and in festivals. Sarasbaug temple's normal energy frequency ranges from 14,000 to 17,000 hertz per minute and with a maximum crowd it is around 21000 hertz per minute.Omkareshwar temple has 16,000 hertz normally and emits 19,000 hertz per minute when there is a larger gathering. the Jejuri temple's energy can be measured up to 25,000 Hertz. energy frequency at Alandi ranges from 10 raised to 53 hertz to 10 raised to 27 Hertz. it can be felt to a span of 50 kilometers."" the same temple can emit different ranges of energy 'vibes', on different days and occasions. ""we realized that sometimes the research findings were not being duplicated. so I modified the instruments. I changed the material of the Bovis pendulum. it is hung around the hand and used for dousing purpose,"" he explains. for the experiment, he measured energy in terms of frequency, the gravitational constant, electrical energy, and electromagnetic energy. ""the pendulum does not get attracted by these forces, except the spiritual energy,"" he says. each rotation is calibrated. one rotation means 1000 hertz per minute. so where has he reached after studying temples, gods and goddesses? ""human beings are the receivers of their energy. at the center, one can find out the human energy and aura with the help of pip camera (polycontrast interference photography) - a scanning technique that reveals your state of well-being and also concerns that can affect you later."" using modern technology at the center, these findings are applied to the principles of yoga and ancient Indian text. experts like Deepa Takawale and IAF wing commander (retd.)

This proves that the so-called tomb was originally a Hindu palace. Like thousands of other buildings throughout India that palace too was pressed into Muslim use. Sultan Altmash‚Äôs son is believed to be buried there. Yet the tomb is not known after him but merely as the ‚ÄúSultan‚Äôs Cavern.‚Äù Scholars have been wrong in believing that the building was built after the prince‚Äôs death. All such mediaeval tombs and mosques are erstwhile Hindu palaces and temples. That is why their decor is entirely Hindu. Historians and archaeologists, hard put to explain away Hindu decor of what they believed to be Muslim buildings, improvised the absurd justification that the building must have been fashioned out of the debris of some Hindu buildings, or that the workmen, being Hindu, built in the Hindu style. Both these arguments are wrong. No building worth its name can be built out of debris. Similarly no workman ever dare or would ever care to fashion a building for which he is hired according to his own taste opposed to that of the owner‚Äôs. In this case, the lintel was plastered over when the building was used as a Muslim tomb because the Islamic conscience cannot tolerate idolatrous images. Such tactics were used by Muslim invaders in all lands they overran, when making use of captured buildings. A Sanskrit inscription was also found in the roof of the building. The building is octagonal in shape which is also a Hindu specialty. This royal Hindu emblem and another found in the Red Fort in Delhi stress the need for historians to look for and collect all such ancient Hindu royal emblems. This is a very enchanting and engrossing task that faces all those who are interested in rewriting Indian history after a millennium of Islam distortion and destruction.

25,"Some Buddhists visit Hindu temples; others don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a common practice in Sri Lanka. I talked to many Buddhists there about various spiritual topics, and they told me that it‚Äôs the norm for Sri Lankan Buddhists to visit Hindu temples, even doing their main annual pilgrimages to a Hindu temple (Kataragama). I myself visited multiple joint Buddhist-Hindu temple complexes where visitors, Buddhist and Hindu alike, went from shrine to shrine, praying or meditating at both the Buddhist and Hindu shrines.

She fought like Hell to live for nine long, and often agonizing years.Very early on, with the use of Chemotherapy to try to extend her life for just a little while longer, Janice lost every hair on her body‚Ä¶scalp, arms, legs, eyebrows, and even eyelashes.Through the amazing kindness of volunteers, who grew their hair long‚Ä¶cut it short for donation‚Ä¶Janice almost looked like a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù human being‚Ä¶instead of one of those depictions of extraterrestrial space aliens.Her ‚Äúwig‚Äù wasn‚Äôt very long, no more than two inches. But, the psychological effect on her emotional health was simply outstanding.I have often wondered if the donation of real human hair, didn‚Äôt prolong Janice‚Äôs life‚Ä¶equally as well as the Chemotherapy‚Ä¶ that took all her hair.Donating hair to Cancer patients is a remarkable and very personal act of kindness, that can never be adequately acknowledged, and can never be properly thanked.On behalf of my sister, I want to thank the person who donated their hair‚Ä¶so my sister could ‚Äúfeel like a human being, again.‚Äù The donation of your hair, meant the world to Janice. I will never forget your generosity, and your kindness.I hope you have a pleasant evening, my friend.",1 follower,Mary Lynch,573,7.2K,11.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-America-not-stop-Covid-19-although-it-has-the-most-advanced-technologies-and-medicine-facilities
