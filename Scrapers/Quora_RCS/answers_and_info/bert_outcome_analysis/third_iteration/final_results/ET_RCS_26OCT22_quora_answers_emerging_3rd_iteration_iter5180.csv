As the Warp is capable of sending people all throughout time, it is entirely possible that there are veterans of the Great Crusade who are currently in the Warhammer 40k present, and are likely not up to date with the latest developments. These may include standard Imperial Army soldiers (not Guard!) and techpriests as well as Astartes. In short, there could be thousands of veterans of the Great Crusade around that few are aware of, and with technology a lot more advanced than that of the present!The problem is thatThe Blade of InfinityTheIn 969.However, it would also have some of the prototypes for the technology later developed further in the Dark Age.So here’s the possibilities:I think the most likely possibility is 1 or 3. If 1, then I’m sorry but I haven’t answered your question. If 3, it suggests that the Imperium’s logistics are so stretched already that the Imperium either cannot find the resources or considers it more practical to stick to what it has.I think that if theAnd if someone suddenly dumped a load of functioning Dark Age ships somewhere? Let’s say 100, and the Imperial Navy can crew all of them. Well, the tide has turned against the Tyranids, the Necrons, and the Xenos, especially the waste of time & energy known as the Tau… Or is it?There is something else to remember: Eldar & Orks, with the Eldar being closer to what we now call the Dark Eldar, have been at war with humanity since it first started expanding from Earth. That means that the Eldar and Orks have seen the Dark Age ships before. While the Eldar generally held back, the Orks were such a threat that they’re the reason the boltgun was invented in the first place. Indeed, they’re still a major threat, as the Beast and other hooligans demonstrate.Further, we all know that if the Imperium has something, then someone else will soon have it too. Either the Orks will somehow overcome all odds, capture one, analyse it, and then create cruder & more comical versions, or Chaos will either corrupt or replicate the ships. Then we’re back to square one.Also, if technology has decayed once, it may decay again…My overall conclusion is that if the Imperium did get a load of Dark Age ships or was able to replicate Dark Age technology, they’d be able to deal with many threat forces easily, but Chaos, Orks, Eldar, and Dark Eldar would still be able to hold their own. You know what Dark Eldar can be like…",1 follower,Mark Stamp,663,3.2K,24.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-happens-if-the-Dark-Age-of-Technology-ships-become-widely-available-for-the-Imperium-in-Warhammer-40k

I'm gonna go the other way and give maybe a simpler answer. TL;DR He probably couldn't because he didn't know how to, and even if he did, the Imperium in 30k probably lacked the industrial base or technical ability to produce it.I think he either legit did not know how most of it worked, or did not know how to obtain the resources or production chains required to build any of it.Firstly, the Emperor is indicated to be vastly better at basically anything he does than a normal human, but he is still more or less human — he has said himself he isn't a god, and its never indicated that he's omnipotent or omniscient or anything like that, and his overall portrayal is of a pretty imperfect super-human. There’s no reason to think his knowledge is perfect - he has been alive a really long time and probably has a good theoretical knowledge in regards to dark age technology, but unless he dedicated all of that time to learning the details of how to actually build that technology, there is no real reason to assume he would be able to.Look at it this way — let's say you have a great idea of how a computer works. You understand how the physical components interact with eachother, how to properly assemble them by connecting CPUs to motherboards and what have you. You know how to program it to do what you want. You probably can't, however, take a pile of metal and silicon and whatever and then form that into computer components — that knowledge is just outside of your area.Secondly, even if the Emperor knows how to build EVERYTHING, he doesnt nessicarily know where to get the base materials or make the required tools.An example for that — Let's say you have built guns all your life and know exactly how to produce an AK-47 from a block of metal. Somehow, you get sent back to the mid-1800s, and you figure you can make it big and alter history by producing AKs a hundred or so years early. You theoretically have the ability to do this, and certainly have enough of a technological basis to produce examples of the gun, but it doesnt mean you know how to build the lathes or stamping equipment required for mass production. Similarly, do you know how to mass produce things the gun will require, like smokeless powder and cased ammunition? Just knowing how an AK-47 works and how to build an AK-47 wouldn’t be enough — you'd have to know how to engineer machinery and draw brass, etc. etc.This is basically the case with the Emperor's situation in the 30k era. Mankind is undergoing a resurgence long after a cataclysmic, civilization-destroying event that was centered on many of the most developed human worlds. While Dark Age technology is still around, everyone directly responsible for it's creation or construction is probably long dead. The Emperor might as well be stuck in a time before much of it even existed, practically speaking.Hopefully that makes sense.I think that even if the Emperor has the capacity to rediscover or reinvent Dark Age technology, he is not particularly gifted at it and it requires a great amount of effort on his part.You can see a little evidence of this in the canon — not only does the Emperor not actually directly invent much, but most of it doesnt really work as planned. The Thunder warriors were flawed. The Primarchs were flawed. Space Marines are flawed. The webway, a potentially fantastic accomplishment, might have worked, but it literally required all of his efforts and attention to put together, and potentially might not have. There isn't really the constantly implied level of perfect genius there, especially considering he's lived through tens of thousands of years of human history — for much of which he is hinted at as being a series of religious and political leaders, not a scientist. Thousands of years after the fall of man is a little late to get a solid education or the skills required to create perfect devices.What you DO see is incremental improvements in his creations. The Thunder Warriors were unstable combat gods. His next attempts were the Primarchs, and perhaps the Custodians — the Primarchs being an improvement in every way, and the Custodians retaining the prowess of the Thunder Warriors but without retaining whatever issues plagued them.Both of these were improvements, but even ignoring the later issues, the Primarchs obviously weren't suited to mass production. It could be pretty easily extrapolated that the Custodians are also too expensive to mass produce, which led to the Emperor's third iteration: Space Marines. Representing the bare minimum of modifications required to make an individual human physically competitive against most of the enemies they will face, they compromise between mass production (and it's a pretty severe compromise) and functionality. The next iteration would be the primaris marines, an improved version created by people other than the Emperor.To me, there is simply not much evidence he could have recreated much of anything.Finally, while the Imperium is vast and has an unimaginable amount of resources at it's disposal, it seems unlikely that it could have produced Dark Age levels of technology on the scale required to be significantly useful during the 30,000s.The infamous saying is that you go to war with the army you have, and that applies here too. The minute the Imperium began to bring new planets and systems into the fold was the minute it began to require resources to control those systems. Even if all you need is an orbital outpost or a regiment of guardsmen, you need to provide the materials or equipment needed to assemble and supply them. You need to be apply to supply this stuff thousands and thousands of times over, at the bare minimum. This is not to mention the vast armies raised from them and required to subjugate them, or the ships to provision them, or any of a hundred other things.This is the type of footing the Imperial economy was on during the Emperor's direct reign. It was geared towards providing for these things, a real war economy, and not for the development of new things. While the investment this allowed in expansion would pay off eventually, and did to a degree, it's unlikely the Imperium experienced immediate benefits from most of it's new annexations. One of the biggest problems they currently face is that they’re still stuck on the war economy setting, and have never had the opportunity to make much for advancements in any other area.I think this is upheld in canon, too. Even if the Emperor were a giftes scientist, it could contribute to the relative stagnation of technological development after the Emperor was wounded — while he was able put the required effort into the development of much of the infrastructure and technology required for war, he had no chance to do much else in those regards. After his incapacitation, humanity was left with even less knowledge of truly advanced technology, and still could not afford to focus on independent rapid development of it or the means to produce it. Ten thousand years later, there is likely enough established control in many areas that an exceptional individual could co-ordinate the required resources, but few exist and none have the Emperors knowledge. The organization required to build this technology simply doesn’t exist. Even where relatively advanced things are produced, such as baneblades or plasma guns, they are unable to be truely mass produced.The value of STCs, even in 30k, seems to almost imply much of this too. Not only do they contain the designs for advanced technology, but they contain the required information on how to effectively mass produce it. Things like the Leman Russ (originally a tractor) and the Terminator armour (a mining suit) indicate that even when the Emperor was active, it was easier to adapt established designs intended for mass production and mundane purposes, than to use the technological insights learned from the STC to redevelop more specialized technology the Emperor may have been familiar with.Anyway, really long ramble.

He will say important deliverable’s are there to submit tomorrow,Take leave on some other day .Trust me, Everyday you will have this deliverable work.You will not get leaves when you want it.6) Politics in Software industries is more than politics in India.

To get entry into the organizations as a fresher, you will need to clear theApart from this there is one more hurdle,So this is process you need to follow to get selected. And because of this kind of people the most of the people who get selected are Non-Technical…people with half knowledge, who know only how to talk, how to sugarcoat, how to speak good English, and bla bla bla. But they are never good at programming. So what these kind of people do at work? and what they want? The answer is Politics. When task is assigned to these people, they start playing politics, they will get the tasks done from other and show it like they have done this. They will not hesitate to show work done by other people on their name.Its not like a person who talks much, talks fluent can deliver good work. This is not how Software development works. Remember, a true software engineer only talks about the domain and technology and he will talk point to point.If you want to hire a Software Engineer, ask him to write a code/algorithm. Again remembering syntax is not necessary. Give that guy a machine and tell him to write the code. That’s it. You will come to know whether he is real or fake. Unfortunately interviewers are interested only in definitions and difference. This again makes a big chance to non technical people to intrude in Software Development Profession.I did one analysis and found around 70% software engineers and around 90% managers are fake, non-technical and idiots.EDIT 1Some of the common phrases used by Non-Technical people:EDIT 2I have seen a comment on this post saying Aptitude test is important to filter out people. So for this I’d say may be for other streams of engineering its required. But for Software Developers, its not. It is true that its a process to filter out the people. But what is the use of it if it is filtering out the main developers? Yes, that's true. Its filtering out the good people in our industry.Instead of this, we can have a written test having some technical questions (Please say no to Definitions, Differences)And yes I agree there are some extra ordinary people who are good at programming and good at remembering the formulas too(Aptitude test). But it will not be the case with most of us.EDIT 3There is a comment saying there could be another part of such people. Yes, that's true. Many people feel royalty when they call themselves a developer. Just by calling, not by action. Just for the sake of royalty or money one should not become a programmer. One should understand his abilities, skills and then should select his career.If you are not good at programming doesn’t mean it is dead end for you. There are other fields like Support/Testing/Admin jobs for you. One can try that too.",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,2.4K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-bitter-truths-of-software-engineers-in-India

That’s just basic and not even close to what is required to code real-life programs.Semester 3:Semester 4 and onwards:The sophistication of programs go on increasing. You also learn Web Technology. You are only taught HTML, CSS, JS. You have to learn php/asp/whatever on your own! Forget about NodeJS and other frameworks!When you reach Semester 6, you have a subject of Compiler Construction. The programs are very complicated, and people who have self-learnt programming or are very interested in the same manage to do it with their efforts.But others just copy the code or take it from the others!Point is, self learning is not encouraged in colleges. They don’t encourage you to dig further, but focus only on completing their syllabus.This is the bitter truth. In India, most engineers don’t self-learn because they are not encouraged to do so, and settle for average pay jobs in companies during placements, and after 1 year, they might get removed!Why such situation?Because, students join Engineering just because they have to get a degree. Computer Engineering is fun for all those students who are really interested in it and are ready to learn things on their own.Colleges cannot teach you everything, they can make you familiar to concepts related to it. Further, you must choose your interests, and start learning!This is the only reason why many software engineers do not have jobs, or fear they might replaced.Edit 1:This is my first answer to cross 4k views! I would like to add some more points:After you finish engineering:You get a placement offer from Infosys, TCS, Accenture or any such IT Company. Package is around 3L. You are happy!You join the company, get through the training, work hard, and start liking your job.Then you get your first major project (not that big, but good enough for a fresher). Your office is somewhere in the city. Everyday it takes around 2-3 hrs to travel one way to/from office.After you start working on this project, you stay late upto 1am in the morning, reach home by 2, wake up at 7 again and run to your office.You work hard for every project you get,Next thing you know, some guy from Mechanical Engineering got a project while you are still waiting…CompetitionYou did not take a placement offer. Went for ME/MTech.2 years for MTech. In the last year, you get the same 3L package during placements.Edit 2:I recently started my 7th semester..Usually in the 7th semester, we start preparing for exams like GATE, GRE or CAT.

And thus, we miss out on attendance during the semester.But it isMy friend told me that in her college, she was not allowed to sit for a company because she didn't have the “75% attendance”.Like attending 75% lectures could do something better for us.Above depicts the story of every average Indian software engineer.",44 followers,Ashish Singh Rajput,819,160,1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-bitter-truths-of-software-engineers-in-India
