The ET beings are telepathic as a natural spiritual ability, they will confirm the reality of the spiritual, including presumably knowledge of lasting souls past death. Little things like that. They will also have records of the time of Jesus. And our origin.Like I said, the biggest revolution ever.

4,"I will give two answers: the first on more solid historical ground, and the second more speculative.First answer: Civilization had to wait for the end of the ice age, which terminated about 15,000 years ago. At that time the glaciers had piled up a lot of good topsoil at its edge, and the melting ice provided plenty of water. Agriculture was developed for the first time in human existence, at first in Turkey. Agriculture is key; it means that not everyone has to hunt and gather, but food can be farmed by specialists. That allows others to becomes tradesmen, businessmen, and physics professors.Continue ReadingI will give two answers: the first on more solid historical ground, and the second more speculative.First answer: Civilization had to wait for the end of the ice age, which terminated about 15,000 years ago.

That allows others to becomes tradesmen, businessmen, and physics professors.Do not underestimate the rapidity of technical innovation during this period. It may seem slow, but that’s because today we take bronze and iron for granted. There were likely enormous advances in farming technology, but the wooden tools and plows used did not last for archeologists to study.The question says that “advanced technology” took place 500 years ago. With the rapid growth of technology, it mightSecond answer (much more speculative, perhaps even whimsical): The true advance of humans came from a human genetic mutation that took place about 3000 years ago. One of my names for it is “the dissatisfaction gene.” This was a gene that made people unsatisfied with their present situation. Animals never developed this; they search for environments that are good enough, and then they are satisfied. House cats are prototypical. But even elephants seem to be happy when they find a place with lots of grass and water.Not humans. Those who had this gene were never happy enough with what they had, and they pushed and developed and worked hard and created an ever expanding civilization.If you too are cursed with this gene (I think I am) then it is difficult to be happy, because no matter what you achieve, you want to do more. For that reason I sometimes refer to it as the “Original Sin Gene.” Like the original sin of Judaism and Christianity, it dooms humans to suffering. No matter how much life improves, we want it to be better.There is a solution that I personally try. I recognize that I must continue to strive to achieve more, and this is my burden. But I also can rise above it, and look at the world, and realize how blessed I am to live in such a wonderful place. Enjoy what we have, but never stop working to make it even better.","135,545 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-would-the-world-look-like-in-10-years-coming-with-the-emergence-of-innovations-and-technology

Take Socrates, Plato, Aristotle.After millennia of books written (at an increasing pace) about love, faith, society, you name it, it almost seems like everything substantial to be written down has been written down. Philosophers of today can only echo what has been said before. Storytellers can only differentiate themselves so far from stories that have come before. If we look at books published today, ask yourself:So. Will the same happen to technology? Will there be a time where every possible innovation has been innovated?ASML is the largest manufacturer of machines that create microchips. Their technologies have become so advanced that they create machines that can work on the microscopic level. And during my visit there, they told me how it became increasingly difficult to work on a smaller scale. In short, ASML was reaching the limits of what is factually possible. ASML is confronted with the limits of the laws of physics. Almost a tragic story.What if that will happen to every branch of technology? What if solar panels reach the limits of efficiency? What if information cannot be transferred any faster? What if lights cannot shine any brighter, robots not faster, computers not smarter?Moore’s Law is slowing down. Patents per person are decreasing. Breakthrough inventions and innovations with global impacts are becoming increasingly rare.“I live in the Netherlands, one of the wealthiest countries in the world. Just about anyone here has a home, has food, water, a job. Basically, anything a human could feel a necessity for. Many people have even more than that in the Netherlands. My point is this. Life as it is here in the Netherlands, with all its current technologies, is about as good as it can get. You are allowed to disagree with me, but in wealthy countries, there is little to nothing lacking in life.This is not fiction. This is already happening. Innovation has shifted from revolutionary change to incremental improvement. As our possessions grow, our necessities shrink. Our ‘needs’ will be less substantial, as will be our innovations.I like to believe that we are far from running out of innovations to be made. We are far from making use of all the wits of everyone on Earth. Yet I’m not sure whether that will be enough against the forces rising against innovation.Thanks for the A2A","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-would-the-world-look-like-in-10-years-coming-with-the-emergence-of-innovations-and-technology

You want to look at market pull based around known problems and opportunities and validated disruption patterns rather than disruption potential of basic science innovations.Here are some of my favorite things to bet on. I'd bet on them if I had anything to bet.Anything that makes urban infrastructure smarterI'll call out the 13th opportunity separately because it is a meta-opportunity with respect to the others.Technology to reinvent capital markets and investmentI have nothing against VCs and angels. Most are extremely smart people. But the world of problems and opportunities is now so complex and fragmented that any system that relies on ""bottleneck star-spotting talent"" (i.e. the sagacity of a small active investor class or inbred entrepreneur-turned-investor class) is doomed to hits its limits in short order. Peer investing, crowdfunding, the transparent processes of AngelList, and bootstrapping are the beginnings of alternate models, but they simply don't move enough money around yet. This is the reason Silicon Valley seems like such a messed up place to outsiders: the world's highest concentration of extraordinary talent is being funneled towards some of its most unimportant problems (and in fact, towards work that exacerbates rather than improves things).People in the Valley, I find, believe in the myth that theirs is an efficient free market economy of investment and that attempting to ""direct"" the entrepreneurial energy will kill it. This is laughable. The system is explicitly set up to direct entrepreneurial attention in extremely non-free ways. The entire region is wired to the capricious opinions of a few key people, who drive not only their own investments, but via imitation, the money of  lazier thinkers. Even if these people were 1000x geniuses with wonderful intentions for the world and preternatural ability to direct money in the right ways, there would still be a huge shortfall in the diversity of intelligence needed to make the money they control truly ""smart"" money. The money may be smarter than average investor wall-street money, but it is nowhere near as smart as it could be.Example: A very simple measure of this is simply the high degree of localization of investment. Ghemawat in World 3.0 tracks liquidity and global flow of venture capital and estimates that the lion's share of investment happens within 20 miles or so of the investor. This happens because the investors mitigate the risks of their own limited knowledge by only investing in companies that set up shop locally, down the street. To get the money, entrepreneurs flood to the location of the money rather than the location of the markets/problems to be solved. Some justify this by pointing to the advantages of high concentrations of talent. While this is certainly valuable, there is a very high cost paid in not being close to the problems and market opportunities. People who have the market intelligence to solve water management problems areThe mis-utilization of talent is so extreme, that if I had money, I'd rather invest in an average hustler and a non 10-x engineer team who are near an actual important market/problem than in a 10x super-star team in Palo Alto. Sure the latter would execute far more brilliantly and with all the latest technical tricks. But they are at a far higher risk of solving the wrong problem and then struggling to find a market. We are reaching diminishing returns from investing in the right team in the wrong place. Investing in even mediocre teams in the right place should provide good returns by comparison, on problems that actually matter and map to interesting markets.There is a just-so excuse I've heard in the Valley lately, that you can't figure out a market before hand, and that a startup is an organization designed to ""search for a business model."" True, but in a way, we've had to invent this whole Lean Startup process to efficiently ""hunt"" for markets primarily because startups are in the wrong place.In a way the Lean Startup is a Californian solution to a problem created by trying to do everything in California in the first place. Steve Blank said at some point that you should get out of the building to be an entrepreneur. I think that's WAY too weak. You have to get out of California. If you've ever tried literally ""walking out of a building"" in SoMA or University Ave., you know that you've basically not left the building at all.Much less efficient models may end up working well if you simply made the ""hunt"" part easier by NOT trying to solve every damn problem while sitting in Coupa Cafe in University Ave. It seems idiotic that I actually have to explicitly argue that a startup focusing on making money by delivering mobile banking services in Africa should, err... be located IN Africa. No amount of screaming that ""all the 10x engineers are here!"" will convince me that Silicon Valley is the right place to solve that particular problem. By extrapolation, I refuse to believe that most of the important business opportunities are somehow magically accessible to people sitting in California. 90% of the opportunities require you to leave the building...err... California I mean.Better geographical distribution of entrepreneurial talent and money near markets and problems is merely one way to make the capital markets ""smarter."" There's tons of others.","246,860 followers",Dushka Zapata,2.9K,8.5K,232.5M,2011,https://www.quora.com/What-would-the-world-look-like-in-10-years-coming-with-the-emergence-of-innovations-and-technology

They bend and twist the truth in the way that most suits the needs of their clients.But this blockchain, it was something else.“This is the first time in history we can verify that something happened at a definitive point in time without depending on an intermediary,” I thought.Until then, records of transactions had to be kept with a 3rd party and would be suspect to tampering. But with blockchain, trust is safely spread out.Another way to look at is by understanding the Byzantine Generals’ Problem. Several armies surround a city. If they all attack at the same time, they can triumph. If they all retreat at the same time, they can save themselves.But anything in between, and there’ll be death. A lot of it.It’s the fundemantal human problem of trust. One general can tell the others that he’ll be attacking, but they can’t know it for a fact until they themselves either attack or retreat.Blockchain, on the other hand, is a public ledger recording transactions with timestamps on a vastly distributed network of computers.

In finance, cryptocurrencies allow for effecting payments in a non-centralized way and without the control of central governments.
