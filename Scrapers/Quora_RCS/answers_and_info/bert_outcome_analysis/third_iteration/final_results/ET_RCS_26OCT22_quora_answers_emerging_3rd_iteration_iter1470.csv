0,"I think that watches just suck in general. The only utility I have seen watches to have is to trick superficial women into thinking you're a fashionable baller.I find it pretty hilarious when smart watch makers like Samsung say ""it's so much more convenient to make a phone call on a smart watch than holding a stupid phone to your head"". Well, that might be true, but it's a hell of a lot easier just to use headphones with your smartphone than to talk into a stupid watch.",356 followers,Gordon Miller,3.5K,10K,165.5M,2014,https://www.quora.com/Wearable-Technology-Do-people-really-think-the-next-smart-watches-are-cool

The lucky ones will die when these cataclysms hit them, the unlucky survivors will be forced to starve to death as the high altitude dust and ejecta blanket the entire atmosphere and plants fail due to lack of sunlight and falling temperatures.Bear in mind that this is 50,000 times more energy than was delivered by the KT event strike that effectively wiped out the dominant life form on the planet at the time, the dinosaurs.Now tell me, how are we going to divert something like that with just a year’s head start?Mind you, we’d deserve such an ignoble end if we couldn’t find such a large body as what’s described until it was only just past the orbit of Saturn when discovered.Give us a century, and we’ll have a fighting chance, but within a year?

2,"The Earth doesn’t have to worry about a thing.The Oort Cloud is a minimum distance of 2,000 Astronomical Units from Earth.

All of them are in stable orbits and accounted for.Even assuming something flew in from closer than 2,000 astronomical units, the premise of this question is nearly impossible—We would almost certainly detect an object the size of Hygia moving at 50 km/sec at more than 10.54 AUs out.Over time, the number of asteroids in the Solar System has decreased as they hit planets. Serious asteroid impacts are still possible, but less likely than they were millions of years ago.","5,084 followers",Bobby Tatro,3.9K,2.2K,45.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-a-250-km-object-from-the-Oort-Cloud-is-heading-towards-Earth-at-50-km-sec-and-will-collide-in-the-next-year-can-humans-do-anything-about-it-using-current-technology-plus-all-of-the-worlds-GDP-and-resources
3,"Under those conditions, we are toast. Too fast (that’s quite fast), too close, too big, too soon.We just don’t have the capability to deliver enough ordnance quickly enough, far enough, and soon enough to sufficiently divert such a object.The long shot would be to basically give Elon Musk a blank check to build starships as fast as possible, stick a “czar bomba” on each one, do an in-orbit refuel, and send them on their way. But fromIt’s the classic software development problem… Just throwing more resources at the problem doesn’t always mean it can be solved moUnder those conditions, we are toast.

12,Better batteries. While wind turbines and solar panels are great sources of power they can’t do it reliably twenty four hours a day every day. We have to store the energy they produce for when they are not producing. That means batteries in some form. Elon Musk has the lead at the moment with his “Mega” battery factories but never underestimate the giant corporations with their financial resources. It’s also quite possible that there will be a breakthrough in battery technology making older batteries obsolete. Renewable energy is totally dependant on reliable power 24/7/365.,"135,530 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Wearable-Technology-Do-people-really-think-the-next-smart-watches-are-cool
