It can do the job, much faster and perfectly.In manufacturing, research and development, and technology India doesn't even stand a chance against China. Comparing the two is preposterous. The pathetic state of Indian manufacturing can be gauged from the fact that 69 years after independence, India can't even manufacture products as simple as earphones. Yes, even your earphones are probably manufactured in China, though they might contain a Made in India tag, to fool the Indians.Comparing the two countries would be a great injustice to China. Most of Chinese people don't want their country to be compared with India, they think of it below their dignity, the same way we think of Pakistan.

It’s not the kind of system a company not familiar with the problem can just jump into. It’s a complex web of laws and standards.

Transferring data by carrying a memory card in the day of Wi-Fi may seem so Twentieth Century, but you can’t hack it from Moscow.In fact, on the technical side, the 2020 election is one of the best we’ve had, according to the government commissions that are part of the Department of Homeland Security tracking such things:Joint Statement from Elections Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council & the Election Infrastructure Sector Coordinating Executive Committees“The November 3rd election was the most secure in American history. Right now, across the country, election officials are reviewing and double checking the entire election process prior to finalizing the result.“When states have close elections, many will recount ballots. All of the states with close results in the 2020 presidential race have paper records of each vote, allowing the ability to go back and count each ballot if necessary. This is an added benefit for security and resilience. This process allows for the identification and correction of any mistakes or errors.There was no fraud in vote processing that I am aware of, and the few “glitches” were mostly clerical errors rather than faulty software.
