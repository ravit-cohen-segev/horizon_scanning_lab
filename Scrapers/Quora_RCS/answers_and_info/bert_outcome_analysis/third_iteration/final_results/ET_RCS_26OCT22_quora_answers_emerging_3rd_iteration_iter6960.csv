0,"I wouldn't make a new technology but if I had to, it'd probably be another execution machine. Many mass shooters will do the damage then surrender, knowing that the worst thing that will happen to them is somebody not liking them in prison. If we make it so 100% of mass shooters die and not just the ones that commit suicide that should reduce the amount of shootings at least marginally. But as it stands, there should be more guards that are competently trained in stopping the shooters rather than running away, maybe have them go through a Marine corps-esque boot camp.",0 followers,Darrell Kuhn,1.4K,2.9K,6.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-will-you-develop-or-create-to-prevent-mass-shooting-or-gun-violence
1,"Robot housekeeper.The robot housekeeper will free up time for the family to spend together. It will do the chores and the cooking. It will help with homework. It will make clothes. The robot housekeeper will be a pillar of stability in a chaotic environment.This will cut down on instability among the youth, which should reduce gang violence and prevent school shootings.",15 followers,Charles Vanderford,3.1K,16.9K,17.6M,1994,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-will-you-develop-or-create-to-prevent-mass-shooting-or-gun-violence

4,"Taking a leap and assuming you mean more than one armed officer or security guard.The chances would be good that fewer people would be killed.Studies show most shooters self terminate when confronted by another person with a gun that wants to stop them.Sure events like the Las Vegas shooting where the shooter is baracaded in a room and in an elevated position could still happen.But may be shorter in duration with fewer casualties, if armed officers were in the building and respond quicker.Imagine if the media were to report the armed citizen that stopped a crime.

With as much attention as they give the criminal.Given that happens far more often than mass shootings.But it won’t because the media is in bed with the politicians who want to disarm the nation. If you think otherwise, your seriously misguided.We need to stop over reporting and glorifying these shooters. It just creates more of them.",0 followers,Dennis Manning,554,18.8K,197.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-will-you-develop-or-create-to-prevent-mass-shooting-or-gun-violence
