1,"Absolutely not. And in fact there are way more “normal” superheroes than Batman.Take for instance,The Ghost who Walks. Note how he doesn’t dick around with this super hero “no guns policy”, and will just shoot people in the face if he has to.The Phantom not only lacks superpowers, he has to trick people into thinking he has them. The guy has crafted a reputation amongst his enemies that he is un-aging and invulnerable. In reality, he is at constant risk of dying, and does actually get killed occasionally.

Thus, unlike other superheroes, he actually has proper stakes and tension, because you don’t know if this current iteration of The Phantom is genuinely about to tragically die and be replaced.Unfortunately,That said, I still have a fondness for the guy. In my local Pitt Rivers Museum - an amazing place crammed to the rafters with all kinds of miscellany - one of my favourite items on display are some shields produced by tribes people in Papua New Guinea.
