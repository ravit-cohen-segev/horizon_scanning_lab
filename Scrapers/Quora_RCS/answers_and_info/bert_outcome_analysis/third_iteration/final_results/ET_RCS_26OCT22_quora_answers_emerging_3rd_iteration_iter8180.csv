Or mind control space witches that manipulate the politics from behind the scene, and yet believe some stupid messiah myth. Or human computers or entire careers of people basically are slaves that require extensive, long-term torture of their loved ones to break their mental conditioning…You have zero problems with any of that. Just suspend your disbelieve and accept it as part of the world-building. But you can’t seem to fathom how Fremen might have diversity in their skin color.I mean… If the Fremen are aliens that come with different skin colors like blue, purple, pink, green… you probably couldn’t care less. But you immediately become uncomfortable and want to know WHY when Fremen might have real-world skin color differences, like you know, from brown to beige.Sure, fine. Let’s talk about sci-fi people’s skin color.Possibility number 1: the original Fremen people have diverse skin colors before they migrate to Arrikas. There’s no reason to believe Fremen are racially homogenous people, to begin with.Possibility number 2: At some point in their history, a genetic mutation created lighter or darker skin people. And since Fremen aren’t fucking racist asshats, they treat their people equally regardless of their skin color.Possibility number 3: The sand cocaine randomly impacts people’s skin color. Some people ended up becoming darker, other people end up becoming lighter. Oh, that’s too much? But cocaine-powered interstellar traveling isn’t?There’s no reason for the Great Houses to be (predominately) white. There’s no reason for the Fremen to be (predominately) black or brown. There’s no reason for any of the groups to be “racially homogenous”.Because RACE IS NOT BIOLOGICAL. Skin color is biological, nose shape, eyelid folds, those are biological. But race is a social construct.Unless the Dune world shares the same fucked up history as 17th-century colonialism, scientific racism, and the transatlantic slave trade, race as a concept does not exist in that world.","29,975 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,1.1K,7.7K,249.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/I-dont-know-Frank-Herbert-s-book-But-in-Dune-2021-the-Fremen-on-Arrakis-are-composed-of-wildly-different-races-such-as-White-while-others-are-Black-with-dreadlocks-Were-they-not-essentially-a-homogeneous-super-tribe

So I won’t say in general we are not a technological innovator.What is missing is the basics like material science, semi-conductors , biological, pharmaceuticals and etc. These things need long term investment , patience, room for error.

Now I am a successful entrepreneur and the succes in business came faster to me than I expected.I think that business is where we can have a lot of advantages. We think about every smallest detail, which is incredibly important to run a successful business. We strive to understand how everything works, what allows us to come up with great ideas that have a big chance of working in real life because we already have the wholes system in our head. We find and solve the problems faster than any other type, which is also a big advantage.The only disadvantage we actually have, is procrastinating to the point where we just don't do anything. We don't believe in ourselves. But once we do, we can be the most successful people. Just a little bit of discipline and passion, and we thrive like no one else.Any INTP reading this - please, get yourself together and become who you really want to be. Begin with action, don't wait for motivation. I see so many answers where INTPs seem to not use the power of mind that they have and its a shame.

Well, actually I was very little then, and my family hadn’t yet moved to the US to live, but NOBODY doubted that Yuri Gagarin had orbited the Earth. It was because of that that President Kennedy launched the effort to reach the Moon. He wanted the US to be first at something in the space race. It was well known that the Russians had an active effort under way to reach the Moon first, and actually, when Apollo 11 landed there was already a Russian unmanned probe on the lunar surface. It was an enormous international competition.Now what technology exactly do you think it was that the US lacked in 1969?Do you think John Glenn never replicated Yuri Gagarin’s accomplishment?The whole “the moon landings were faked” conspiracy theory was invented in order to sell a book written by an English major and a former member of the US Navy: a man employed as a technical writer, and a man who knew bugger all about rockets or aerospace technology.

We all hung on each of the Apollo launches and flights, discussed the science that was behind it all, along with the technology that supported it. Although the computers were slow and clunky, they still worked and did amazing jobs, even back then. They just did things a lot simpler and took a lot longer.I should also add that the ability and skills of people have changed since then.

Although the computers were slow and clunky, they still worked and did amazing jobs, even back then. They just did things a lot simpler and took a lot longer.I should also add that the ability and skills of people have changed since then. I was never great at mental arithmetic; there were lots of kids at school who were quicker than me, and I’ve slowed down a bit over the years. But I can do arithmetic at light-speed compared to my students, even when both of us have a calculator, and I can do approximate computations to test the validity of something in ways and time that they don’t seem to be able to comprehend. So it wasn’t all the technology: in those days the people had a different set of skills that complemented the technology of the day to achieve great things. People did more, but were also able to decide how much was just enough, and do it very well.As has been pointed out, the USA had the technology to do it. They also had the technology to place an ICBM warhead almost anywhere on Earth to a remarkably high level of precision, so scaling that up to a Saturn V and an Apollo missions was a lot less effort than developing the technology in the first place. The radio and TV technology deployed at the time was typical of the best of the day, and there was such a strong following for this huge human adventure that nobody was going to slip one past a global audience.If you look at the development process in the USA, and other rocketry programs around the world, there are a lot of early failures. You try as hard as possible for these to happen on the unmanned launches, and you keep trying. Once you are on the right track, each failure allows you to make major improvements in the overall system and get thing a lot better very quickly. You can see this in a lot of projects (in many places and times) where there is a drive to succeed, even if you are pushing the technology. And clever engineers and scientists can often figure out ways around technological impasses. So the US rocketry program was developing like any other large project with a driven team involved.Finally, if there had been even a shadow of doubt about the Apollo missions, there was another space-capable nation itching for a chance to make fools of the USA. The USSR was carefully monitoring everything, as they were keen to get what technology they could, and if there was the least hint that it was faked, they would have been all over it like a rash. The fact that they didn’t hint that it was fake, and nobody closely interested in Apollo missions ever suggested it was faked, strongly supports the idea that it was very much the real deal.",UNKNOWN,Ernest W.

21,"Q: Do you think the USA had the technology to land on the moon in 1969?A: This is the Atlas rocket family.It started off as satellite launchers and missiles, was used for the Mercury program as well as Agena for the Gemini program, and is still used today for heavy space launches and deep space launches, including the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter which among other things photographed the Apollo mission landing sites.This is the Delta rocket family.It started off as the Thor ballistic missile, evolved into Thor-Delta, and then just became Delta.

Today it’s the heavy lift workhorse in the United States.This is the Soyuz rocket family.It’s still in use today, and for at least half a year or so, probably a few years, is the only way of transporting crew to and from the International Space Station.Do you know what all of these rocket systems have in common?They started as 1950s technology, they are still operating, and they still have consequences from the design choices made then.Do you know what we didn’t have in the 1960s? The film and special effects technology to make a convincing two-hour long continuous shot of a moonwalk. Today, with digital photography, CGI, digital compositing and digital projectors, we can just barely do it, and it would cost about an Apollo mission to do it and probably look dated and faked in half a decade.",5 followers,Jake Williams,9.9K,3.2K,76.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-China-not-a-technological-innovator
22,"Think? Everyone who’s capable of objectively considering the available genuine evidence KNOWS without a shadow of a doubt that the USA had the technology to land two astronauts on the Moon in 1969 — because it DID, and it repeated that technological feat FIVE more times in the period to 1972, until idiots in power cancelled Project Apollo, the most audacious and spectacular human accomplishment since the invention of the flint axe.The two main idiots were a bumbling crook called Tricky Dicky (a.k.a.

Richard Milhous Nixon, 37th president of the USA) and Tom Otten Paine (3rd administrator of NASA), who thought it was a good idea to free up money for the development of two white elephants called ‘space shuttle’ and ‘space station’. Both those projects turned out to be enormously cash-guzzling and effectively killed the USA’s manned exploration of space beyond low Earth orbit. Apart from the amazing Hubble Space Telescope, all that humanity seems to have gained from humans in space since that idiotic decision is videosYour question is like asking whether France had the technology to build the Eiffel Tower in 1887-1889. The only rational response is to objectively consider the available evidence: (1) The tower exists; (2) We have plenty of photographs and first-hand testimony of the building process.Now, Eiffel Tower hoaxnuts who have never been to Paris — because they spend the greatest part of their meaningless lives staring at computer screens in dimly lit basements in Small Town USA — might claim that that impressive edifice as well as all the photographs and testimony thereof are “fake”. They might also claim that anyone who claims the contrary is a “shill” paid by the evil French government to deceive the “sheeple”.How are we to deal with such people, who are so determined to be and remain hoaxnuts? Should we ignore them as irrelevant distractions, should we try to change their minds by presenting them with cogent arguments for and compelling evidence of the tower’s reality, or should we send them to Paris to see for themselves? Even if we did that, they might stand between those four imposing iron feet and continue to whine “it’s fake”, so attached are they to their ludicrous delusion.Back to Project Apollo:Those six Apollo lunar exploration missions landed 12 astronauts on the Moon, who brought a total of 382 kg of Moon rock and regolith to Earth. Since then, independent interdisciplinary teams of scientists in numerous countries have analysed Apollo lunar samples generously provided by NASA and have found them to be authentically of lunar origin.Now, the hoaxnuts — who are NOT capable of objectively considering the available genuine evidence — claim that NASA didn’t get those rocks directly from the lunar surface but from the Antarctic ice-sheet.That’s nonsense for two reasons: (1) the total mass of all Antarctic lunar meteorites ever collected is far less than 382 kg, and (2) lunar meteorites have ‘fusion crusts’ (i.e. the outer layer is melted and charred due to frictional and ram-pressure heating during the rocks’ fall through Earth’s atmosphere) whereas no Apollo Moon rock has a fusion crust, for obvious reasons.This is just one example of how the ludicrous and risible claims of the ignorant and deluded — or, in some cases, delusional — hoaxnuts can easily be demolished by applying simple logic and science.Those who find the hoaxnuts’ claims compelling and themselves become hoaxnuts achieve Triple F status: they are fools fooled by fools.",3 followers,Steve Baker,4.5K,27.4K,163.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Can-an-INTP-ever-become-rich-powerful-and-successful
