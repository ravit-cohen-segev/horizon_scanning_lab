I will give brief description on each topic and you can read in my other answers in Quora somethings more .1.The three big nearby Galaxies are the creations of the three Gods Vishnu, Shiva and Brahma and they are named Sheer sagar, under loga/ Shiva loga and Tripuram /Brahmaloga similar to the current scientific names Milky way , Andromeda and Triangulum respectively . The entire galaxy with four spiral arms is termed as God with four arms .God Vishnu is the Milky way Galaxy with spiral arms with Vishnu in reclined posture which is the inclined bar in the center of the Galaxy as per science .God Shiva is similarly the entire Andromeda galaxy with four arms . The central black hole is the God you cannot see but you can see the Blue haze which gave Him the name Neal Kant .God Brahma in the Triangulum Galaxy was absorbed by God Shiva and God Ganesha is now the creator in this Galaxy . About this incident you will read later . God Ganesha is the first full God as per Hinduism which has scientific meaning .This Galaxy with five wide and short spiral arms resembling the trunk of an elephant gave Him the name elephant God with four arms or Panchamugha Vinayaka (5 faced obs tackle remover) .Milky way galaxy and the inclined barAndromeda center and the Neel KantTriangulum with 5 arms like Trunk of an elephant2.In Hinduism the science is taught in story form and there are 18 Puranas and 2 Itihasas (History ) and various siddhandas (Theories ). In one purana the Gods Vishnu and Brahma were arguing who is big and suddenly they found one big structure rising near them . They wanted to investigate what this is and Vishnu traveled down side and Brahma traveled up side . They could not reach the edges .Then God Shiva of Andromeda appeared and told them how big He is . Now by science we know Triangulum is less than half of Milky way and Andromeda is more than double of Milky way in size and extent north and south (Top and Bottom).3.The Galaxies move and some orbit others .This is an important story which I have not replied in any answer so far . The sons of God Shiva namely Ganesha and Karthikeya were competing to win a special fruit which gives immense knowledge to the person consuming it . God Shiva put the condition that any one who comes first around the Milky way Galaxy (Bhulogam )will get the fruit. Ganesha takes His mouse and Karthikeya His peacock as vehicles .Ganesha goes round God Shiva and Shakti and says all logas are with Shiva and Shakti and going around them satisfies the condition of contest . His brother travels around Milky way and reaches late and loose the contest .Ganesha gets the fruit .This story specifically tells about vehicles Mouse and Peacock which are Triangulum Galaxy in Triangulum constellation which appear as mouse with sharp triangle when the three stars are connected by imaginary lines ,orbiting Andromeda Galaxy and the pea cock is the Sagittarius -D Dwarf Galaxy which is orbiting Milky way . God Ganesha got the creator status and the first full God approval as a reward which is the fruit . I Know People who do not question the story will question my analysis . You have to take the other stories also into account for this .M 33 Triangulum on the Mouse triangle constellation(In green ) travels around Andromeda M 314. Galaxies can collide and stars can be burnt , transferred to other Galaxy.In the earlier story The Triangulum Galaxy God Brahma was trying to find the top edge of the Andromeda and failed and in the Ganesha story the orbit was done but through the center of Andromeda . God Brahma was absorbed in the collision and Ganesha took His place . Many stars were burnt when the Triangulum passed through and stars were taken in Andromeda which is the story of Burning of Tripuram by God Shiva .In Hinduism this is indicated by the icon dancing Shiva called Nataraja with one star in His hand and stars in circle behind in the arch .5.Civilization from one galaxy can interact with another .During the orbit of Andromeda , part of Triangulum Galaxy came near earth and Brahma’s grand sons Prajapatis interacted with humans and lot of stories about advanced weapons , technology transfer etc are available in literature. Even some DNA transfer has happened and few Rishis with great knowledge started clans in their names and it is continuing even today .The exciting thing is the Triangulum will be again near earth during the orbit in 2 billion years .6.Black holes can merge .The fascinating guess work of merger of black holes to day has happened thousands of years before and the account is described as the story of God Shiva burning Tripuram and terminating God Brahma for desiring His own creation Sowrupa group of stars . Today's science is telling us that x- rays are still coming out of the black hole of Andromeda confirming the merger of Triangulum black hole .7.Energy can be transformed to mass and vice versaToday we know that the mass can be transformed as Nuclear energy . In Hinduism it is the core of the philosophy and before any mass formed in the universe it was all energy . They named this energy pack as Adi Parashakti which transformed into mass called Parabrahmam. The mass gets the movement by conversion of mass to energy and they are in equilibrium . It is represented by half male as mass or Shiva and half female as energy or shakti called Ardha nareswara .8 .The universe has millions of galaxies .When the initial single mass formed from energy it divided into millions of creators of galaxies .The three creators of three nearby big galaxies humans have identified and given names . One can worship the initial mass formed Parabrahmam or the divided creators for equal effect since they are one and the same .9.What is inside black hole is in our Sun .The early Hindus know that what is inside our star Sun is inside in all black holes even though you cannot make out black holes shape and density . What goes on inside is by its own will . Even today the science is not able to tell how so much energy is packed inside the black holes and why they are active or inactive sometime . We can see the center of the three galaxies but you cannot see the God since it is not allowing the light to escape from its body . If you want to worship God directly the representative is our Sun which has everything the God has except power of creation of other stars.Hindu religion is a science in continuation . From the large cosmic image it has brought the God to atomic form in every tiny mass which reflects in the image of dancing Shiva from cosmos to Lingam to represent the atomic form available in saligramam stones from Himalayas which gives out heat under water by nuclear energy .When you know all the above scientific facts are hidden in the puranas we should be interested in finding out other scientific facts listed below in the stories .","64,128 followers",Rami Sivan,844,6.4K,81.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/As-Hinduism-evolves-in-the-world-of-rapidly-advancing-science-and-technology-what-in-the-minimum-still-identifies-it-as-Hindu

The creature’s natural lifespan is less than a year, but species can survive decades under a rock in the desert or frozen in ice in the antarctic, get hit with a raindrop, and be up and copulating in the amount of time it takes you to put on socks. We slapped some on the outside of a spaceship for 10 minutes, and 68% of them survived (that’s a lethal dose of cold and a lethal dose of radiation and a lethal dose of nothing to breathe for pretty much everything else living).The reason I’m droning on about this microscopic marvel is that the only advantage humans have over a tardigrade is a fairly impressive brain. We have done a lot with that single evolutionary trait, but it really isn’t as unique as we like to make it out to be. Other species use tools, other species have communities, and other species haveEdit: It is wise to note that every species is equally evolved. It’s not a process with an end goal in mind, it’s ongoing and random. Traits can come and go, some are beneficial, some are not, some are specialized, others are pretty general. Species that survive something like a mass extinction tend to be highly flexible in the biomes they can live in, and it’s a trait we see in many species across the world today. Those species that can survive the largest range of calamities have the best chances at survival, and that’s probably the highest evolutionary trait, if you want to place them in a completely subjective hierarchy.Can you imagine how many species of single celled organisms died off before the first multicellular organism came into being?

12,"Humans are very likely evolving faster today than at almost any time in the past. Sounds crazy, right? How could this be? Let me explain.Most people think of evolution as operating on members of a species with “inferior” traits, thereby reducing their survivability and ultimate contribution to the gene pool. With this understanding, you’d then point to our modern longevity and note that “humans have largely solved the problem of survivability” — which we have. We can remedy poor eyesight, compensate for chronic diseases, vaccinate against plagues, work around infertility, etc. But this understHumans are very likely evolving faster today than at almost any time in the past.

With this understanding, you’d then point to our modern longevity and note that “humans have largely solved the problem of survivability” — which we have. We can remedy poor eyesight, compensate for chronic diseases, vaccinate against plagues, work around infertility, etc. But this understanding is based on a narrow view of evolution.Evolution operates at a species wide level across vast periods of time. And what is it looking for? You might say, “survival of the fittest” or “natural selection”. And that’s where a lot of the confusion comes from. With ever longer lifespans and no natural predators, evolution seems to be way back in the rear view mirror for Homo sapiens.
