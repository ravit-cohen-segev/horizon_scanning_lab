4,"Barak-8 system was developed not specifically against Brahmos, but as a medium-long range surface to air missile. Barak-8 is effective against supersonic cruise missiles because it has reasonable range to intercept a fast cruise missile in time. With 90 KM range, the Barak system will get around 4 minutes make an interception. On the other hand, a point defence system with 10 KM range will get half a minute for interception. In addition, its targeting and seeker are vast improvements on current generation SAMs. So, threatening supersonic missiles can be destroyed at stand-off distances from thBarak-8 system was developed not specifically against Brahmos, but as a medium-long range surface to air missile.

In addition, its targeting and seeker are vast improvements on current generation SAMs. So, threatening supersonic missiles can be destroyed at stand-off distances from the defender.While Brahmos is slated to be the fastest operation cruise missile, it is not the only one with supersonic speeds. In fact many of the Russian cruise missiles, especially ‘club-family’ and their Chinese copies, have supersonic speeds in their terminal phase.Additionally, supersonic missiles are being developed by many nations, and the new trend is quest for hypersonic cruise missiles. Thus, India and Israel faces the need to counter the evolving threats of future, since both of them have to face an enemy with supersonic missiles in futre.Israel already had the expertise to make the missile. India joined Israel to utilise that strength to co-develop, mainly by providing the funding. In return, India could use the indigenous propulsion (in addition to getting the experience in developing such missiles). Additional benefit is that these missiles now can be produced indigenously with components from israel (mainly guidance and targeting and also the associated radars are made by Elta, israel). Israelis get a big market in India, plus potential exports. A good bargain for both the parties.Anyway, just like supersonic cruise missiles, their counter-missiles are also evolving. Whether or not India co-develop Barak-8, others would develop such SAMs (reportedly China is already near to it). So taking a pragmatic step, India joined Israel on Barak-8.BTW India is co-developing Brahmos-II with Russia, which is supposedly Hypersonic, which cannot be countered by Barak-8.",0 followers,Vladimir Nesic,1K,682,1.4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/If-Barak-8-has-been-designed-to-shoot-down-Brahmos-any-thoughts-why-India-helped-Israel-in-joint-development-of-a-missile-killer-for-its-most-potent-short-range-cruise-missile

At long ranges , it is limited by the curvature of earth so ‘flying low’ is the textbook evasive procedure against radars.The radar horizon of a 20 meter high radar comes out to be 16 kms. due to earth’s curvature. This means , a low flying missile will be in radar shadow region until it is 16 kms far from the target.The supersonic missiles, in order to achieve speed, travel at higher altitude where the drag offered by atmosphere is very low. This however, puts the missile on enemy’s radar long before it can reach its target and suitable countermeasures can be taken.A subsonic missile , however, sacrifices its speed for altitude and flies at sea skimming distances. It can travel a long way to its target before any radar picks its approach and thus practically leaves no time for countermeasures.It is believed that Nirbhay missile can traverse as low as 5 metres above sea level.2. RangeThere is always a trade off between range,speed, size and altitude of a missile.A supersonic cruise missile will hardly have a range more than 500 kms. To improve range, it would need to carry extra fuel, which would increase its size. This compromises the maneuverability and stealth design of the missile and is not very practical.For eg. P-700 Granit was built for low altitude purposes. But its a 10 meter ,7000 kgs heavy missile, which can carry a 750 kgs warhead over 650 kms. at Mach 1.6Compare it to the legendary Tomahawk, which is 6.25 meters , 1600 kgs missile capable of delivering 450 kgs warhead over 2500 kms at subsonic Mach 0.73. ManeuverabilityOne of the advantages of using cruise missiles, is the ability to change its path, in-flight. Most of the missiles, nowadays , perform a maneuver before striking the target. This helps them evade the CIWS countermeasures.It is much easier to use subsonic missiles.Endnote:-India is already ahead in supersonic cruise technology, but we desperately need to have our own subsonic cruise missile. The supersonic cruise missiles are still very useful and relevant but we need attacking tactics in all three categories i.e. supersonic , subsonic and hypersonic.Congratulations to all DRDO scientists for their successful launch of Nirbhay missile and lets hope it gets inducted soon.Jai Hind.",1 follower,Max Sharma,512,790,4.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-Barak-8-has-been-designed-to-shoot-down-Brahmos-any-thoughts-why-India-helped-Israel-in-joint-development-of-a-missile-killer-for-its-most-potent-short-range-cruise-missile

BrahMos is just the short range version of Yakhont. The Indians wanted a long range missile but the Russians could not give it because of the MTCR (Missile TechnologyControl Regime) stipulations and so they gave the shorter version (BrahMos) to the Indians.However, BrahMos has a greater tactical value over Yakhont. While Yakhont is an anti-shipcruise missile only and can be fired from ships, BrahMos can be used against any land or seabased target and can be fired from any platform be it land, sea, air or underwater.Russians have there own valid reasons for not inducting the BrahMos missile. It should not be concluded that there is something wrong with this missile or BrahMos is inferior to any other missile.The fact is “BrahMos is one of the most invincible missile in today's world and only missile which can be fired from land, air, sea and sub sea”Any queries……..Please comment.",739 followers,Sreehari Nambiar VV,1.5K,544,3.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/If-Barak-8-has-been-designed-to-shoot-down-Brahmos-any-thoughts-why-India-helped-Israel-in-joint-development-of-a-missile-killer-for-its-most-potent-short-range-cruise-missile

These activities are important too, and science fiction authors do them.Science fiction is first and foremost fantasy writing, but with the goal of being at the edge of knowledge, approaching the possible from the direction of the just-barely impossible.

There was a time when, in this part of the world, we were the only democracy,” Jaishankar said.Dr. S Jaishankar","36,821 followers",Sindhu Satish,2.3K,1.8K,73.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-Barak-8-has-been-designed-to-shoot-down-Brahmos-any-thoughts-why-India-helped-Israel-in-joint-development-of-a-missile-killer-for-its-most-potent-short-range-cruise-missile

Action expresses priorities. India’s first underwater rail tunnel completed ahead of schedule. The entire project is 16.6 km long, out of which 10.8 km runs under the ground. Of this 10.8 km, 502 metres is under the water. The tunnel is being dug 30 metres below the riverbed. The project connects Howrah to the west and Salt lake to the east. Digging this tunnel was the most difficult and critical task in the entire project. The stretch of 16.6 km will have 12 stations, six of which will be under the ground, while the remaining six stations will be on elevated tracks. Congratulate the engineers & employess of Afcons Transtonnelstroy and Kolkata Kolkata Metro Railway Corporation Ltd!! Thanks me later.3. A solar plant of the size and cost of a center table on your rooftop can insure your home against power cuts and halve your electricity bill. Made-in-IIT solar plant powers thousands of rural homes - smaller and cheaper than present installations. At a cost of Rs 20,000, the rooftop plant and storage system can run couple of tube lights, fans, charging points and a TV. The solar inverterless DC system is cost and energy-efficient as unlike other solar power systems, it does not convert direct current produced by a solar installation into alternate current . A 125W solar installation will require 10sqft space, while 500W requires 50 sqft of space. The system comes with a full DC wiring. A wonderful cost effective solution.4. The Made In India BMM300 clay brick making machine is genius. It cranks out bricks laying them in nice straight rows for easy collection. The production capacity is 300 brick/min. It is the world's only Mobile Brick Making machine. Made in Firozpur Bangur village in Sonepat, it stood 19th among 30 innovations that bagged the DST-Lockheed Martin India Innovation Growth Programme awards for 2016. Congratulate Vilas Chhikara and his team. Thanks me later.5.You can have results or excuses, not both. 13-year-old students from Tamil Nadu designed low-cost toilet urinals using 20-liter waste plastic bottles. Finding the stench that emanated from their school toilet unbearable, students at a government school in Trichy district designed low-cost urinals. The project won the ‘Boldest Idea’ award at the ‘I CAN Awards 2016’ organised by Design for Change. As the cost of installing urinals was high, the boys came up with an imaginative solution. Congratulating the students on their idea, the seller handed over used, damaged, and leaking water bottles free-of-cost. Using funds collected from the students and teachers, they purchased other necessary pipes and parts. To flush the urinals after use, they set up a line of drip irrigation pipes above the urinals. Congratulate the 5 member team – Supikpandian, Santhosh, Dhiyanithi, Ragul, and Prabaharan. Thanks me later.I think i answered this question to some extent.

28,"Ever played Minecraft?  It does exactly this.But notice it looks very blocky.  That's the trade off.Games only look as good as they do because the software is programmed to make assumptions about what will be able to move and what won't - and for the things that won't, it can do a bunch of work related to making it look cool, save that down and never do it again, and let the game run fast.

For things that need to move, this work has to be done continuously, so you need to limit the amount of things that can move.If you're willing to sacrifice the stuff that makes things look cool, then you could just have everything move-able and destroy-able.  Although you'd still have to cut down on how far the player can see, since adding destruction adds detail, and detail slows computers down the more you add.We could probably have lots of games where you can destroy everything, if they looked like games from about 10 years ago.  But because good graphics sell, developers and publishers aren't willing to take a hit in the graphics department to achieve this risky endeavor, it rarely happens.And they are right to be cautious - just because you can destroy everything doesn't mean you have a game.  Again, look at Minecraft - it's not really a game, more of a sandbox.  If you can destroy everything, suddenly it's really difficult to make a consistent story and experience.  What's the point of playing through a building full of twists and turns to have a final show down with the boss in the main room, when you can just take a tank and blow a hole in the wall and fight him straight away?  Sure it may be cool, but then you've completed the game in an hour and feel like you've wasted your money.Destroying everything sounds like a cool idea when you're not allowed to do it - but once you can, everything gets boring really fast.That's not to say you can't make a great game where you're required to build and destroy all you can. But it's easier to design traditional gameplay for games where you can't destroy everything.

30,"A few reasons come to mind:1. Splitting meshes is difficult.  Usually when digital assets are created, they are a collection of vertices describing a hollow surface.  To split that surface into many little pieces would require either hand-crafting the inner surfaces, or doing it procedurally.  There are tech demos which have demonstrated the latter, so it's certainly possible, just not cheap.2. Vertex counts will explode.  A cube has 8 vertices and 6 faces.

If we explode that cube into 10 irregular chunks, and each chunk has ~20 vertices (which will look like crap), you now have 200 vertices, which is a 25x increase in geometric complexity.3. Simulation is processor-intensive.  It's not enough to destroy something, you need to make it physically plausible.  Imagine exploding a cube into 10 bits, and those bits just fly apart and fly through each other or fly through walls and floors.  Not very satisfying.  When you explode things, you now need to detect a lot of collisions and apply physics simulations to the exploded bits.  This isn't too bad in the case of exploding 1 cube, but if you're exploding say, a Roman Colosseum, it is now very very expensive to compute and your frame rate will suffer.4. Would the game actually be fun / would having this make a game better?  People take for granted that levels and scripted events were hand-crafted and enforce boundaries for gameplay reasons.  Playing a first person shooter in a Colosseum is fun due to level design, but if that Colosseum were randomly destroyed and you just had a ton of huge stone rubble everywhere blocking every walkable path and obstructing vision, would that still be fun?These are just a few reasons that came to mind.",1 follower,Chris Nash,527,5K,30.7M,2015,https://www.quora.com/If-Barak-8-has-been-designed-to-shoot-down-Brahmos-any-thoughts-why-India-helped-Israel-in-joint-development-of-a-missile-killer-for-its-most-potent-short-range-cruise-missile
