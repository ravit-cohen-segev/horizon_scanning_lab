1,"Heat engines (Includes steam engines and internal combustion). This development accelerated both industrial processes and transport of any kind including cars, trains, ships, and airplanes, thereby making many people’s lives a lot easier and making subsequent technological developments possible.Before heat engines we had to rely on manpower and horsepower mostly and it was all much slower.","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,8.9K,6.8K,91.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-believe-to-be-the-most-important-technological-development-in-history-and-why

Thanks go to Sumeriens who felt the need, for the first time, of a systematic approach to record language. This invention allowed us to generate and spread knowledge throughout the population, connected people who lived far apart in time, allowed us to build on older knowledge, etc. Well, it literally started human history. We could build libraries and stopped forgetting old knowledge. Another boom in cognitive capacity.The third most important tech is the electronic switch: the transistor or the semiconductor technology. It allowed us, well, to create microchips which does all the familiar magical things we all are familiar with. It allowed us to develop computers, algorithms, human-machine interfaces of various types, crazy implementations of mathematical models which are changing our lives dramatically, natural sensory replacements, giving us depression, changing the way our brains operate, etc. All directly effecting our cognitive capacity in “forward direction”, not necessarily badly but evolving forward, into whatever awaits us.","3,298 followers",Kevin Flint,2.7K,1.6K,8.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-believe-to-be-the-most-important-technological-development-in-history-and-why

Whole governments change.Similarly, it is also a medium that can cause cracks in institutions. For example, the latest article published in the New York Times,This is a medium that can make decisions, change stances, and cause social revolutions if it wanted to because it has so much potential with information, and so many ways to exploit loopholes and the lack of a strong set of rules and protocol regarding publishing.

Hence now the tarring is similar to coal power plants without the pollution. The efficiency and simplicity will keep on enhancing .Wind power and offshore power:- wind power on land normally have a max around 2 mega watt turbines. If you put them in the sea there is a lot more wind power and hence bigger turbines can be put up. Some on the newer turbines at sea are giant ones of upto 8 mega watt!!! And increasing..Nuclear Fusion:- upcoming technology its very complex and now since the past 5–10 years R&D is accelerating on its research, the reason it’s so complex as when 2 particles are fused it creates a lot of heat and has becomes a plasma - super hot gas at millions of degrees centigrade like the sun but to hold that super hot gases it has to be contained in a super powerful magnetic field which is very difficult to construct however major breakthroughs are coming about in it however still more developrment is needed in it. Since most of the research is now diverted to fusion, hardly any research is going on in fission research how our normal atomic power plants are made.So these are some of the updates in energy generation.If you like the article plz upvote.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-believe-to-be-the-most-important-technological-development-in-history-and-why
