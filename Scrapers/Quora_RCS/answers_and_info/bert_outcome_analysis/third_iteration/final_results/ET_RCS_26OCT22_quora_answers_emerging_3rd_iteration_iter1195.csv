1,"We need technology that can move us at speeds near the speed of light so astronaut onboard could take advantage of time dilation. But we would not only need to be able to accelerate to and from those speeds but also be able to solve the problem of interstellar dust colliding with a ship moving that fast. Radiation would also be a concern. It would likely be helpful to have artificial gravity. The ship would be massive and would need to be built in space, this already requires better in space construction technology and methods but would also require very significant amounts of space infrastrucWe need technology that can move us at speeds near the speed of light so astronaut onboard could take advantage of time dilation.

2,"Even if Project Orion had progressed far enough to test the concept - which it did not - a spacecraft would still have to be habitable for at least decades and likely centuries. To put it simply, machines in use don’t last that long. Additive manufacturing, a.k.a. 3-D printers, will be a partial solution.

3,"Yes. As soon as we develop a spaceship that can maintain a constant acceleration of 1 g (subjective). According to Isaac Asimov (who worked out the math on this more than half a century ago) time dilation will make the journey to the Andromeda galaxy seem like only 27 years to the people on the spaceship.Of course, 2 million years will have elapsed back on Earth.That’s also assuming that they are not planning to stop when they get there, since, even if they slammed on the brakes, it would take another 27 years to stop, by which time they would have overshot the target by 2 million light-years.Continue ReadingYes.

4,"There are theories about a special device that warps space time to allow us to travel faster than the speed of light without breaking the laws of physics. The catch is that it requires an exponentially increasing amount of energy to run, which is practically impossible to store on a spacecraft.

The work we surrender to the machines, particularly when we (all ~9 billion of us) are free of working just to be free of necessity - which we could be today if only we distributed wealth by sensible proportions - would be, some of it, work we would prefer to shoulder ourselves.The ""inevitable cycle of painful exhaustion and pleasurable regeneration,"" which Hannah Arendt identified as the sole sustainable source of happiness, would be broken if we simply stood aside and had our wishes attended to by intellectual and physical automatons.30 years from now we will define ""industry"" as what we cared still to do, even if we had nothing to do.Humans also have an ingrained preference for the imperfect. We prefer a slight variation from perfect pitch and perfect meter, the so-called agogic fringe. We heard its absence in the player piano and the music box: all human performance has at least this one advantage over the synthetic.

You don’t get a similar issue with ZTE, who are far smaller and less popular, because there was a lot less interest in using them anyway.Major competitors for Huawei are ZTE, though being Chinese they share a lot of the same concerns, Nokia and Ericsson, who are long standing providers of this infrastructure who while very good and well respected had been edged out by Huawei in recent years, and Samsung, a huge company in all kinds of business but specifically are growing quickly in network infrastructure. These are all full-stack suppliers, so you could build an entire 5G network using only equipment from a single vendor.Other companies do supply some 5G equipment - such as Cisco, who are big on the routing and switching front, but as far as I am aware do not produce the radio or much of the core equipment. Qualcomm often comes up in these discussions, and they are a key part of the 5G ecosystem, but I don’t think I have seen them sell any network infrastructure. I think they are more involved in the development because the network infrastructure has to be developed alongside the modems that will connect to the network, where Qualcomm is the dominant provider.",256 followers,Priyal Gupta,9.7K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-kind-of-technological-advances-would-it-take-to-travel-to-places-that-are-light-years-away-and-will-we-see-this-in-the-next-100-years
