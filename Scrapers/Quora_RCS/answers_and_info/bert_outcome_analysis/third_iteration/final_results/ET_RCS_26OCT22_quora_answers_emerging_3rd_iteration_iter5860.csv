They cite 108 lumens/watt for a new bulb, and that is no better than a high quality LED. My conclusion: they are making up their claims out of thin air.Nor is a Xenon arc lamp a new technology. They have been used for decades. I did not see anything that markedly distinguishes their bulbs as particularly different than the Xenon lamps that have existed for a long time. The only claim they make about that is that they are more efficient (with no numbers given) than previous Xenon lamps.Nothing wrong with the technology. The light is, I am sure, just as described. High CRI and high lumens per watt. And you can get exactly the same specs with LEDs - with a lot less heat.And most important to many potential buyers, the cost per lumen is about 5X what good quality LEDs cost.So unless you need the infrared, or you need an intense point source, these lights are nothing special and are very expensive.",403 followers,Theo Schmit,3.8K,174,929.5K,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-guys-think-of-this-newly-emerged-XED-lighting-technology-thats-20-more-efficient-than-LED-and-emits-a-very-Sun-like-light

Why not?I think that what we think is technologically advanced civilisation does need some form of way of transferring information from one generation to the next. Unless, maybe there would be a life form, somewhere in the Universe, that would evolve a very long life span that would make it possible to start a technological revolution within the life span of one generation. After that, more advanced technology could be used to store information. If the lifespan of a species is not long enough, like in humans, there needs to be a way for new generations to build upon what was invented by their ancestors. It can be achieved in other ways than what we call writing. Like for example something like the quipu knot alphabet of Incas could be used.Image from Wikipedia.It’s hard to imagine technologically advanced life forms without symbolism but we can speculate a bit.I can imagine some other ways of storing information. Maybe some way of downloading memories from one individual to the next could evolve somehow, in some life form, on some extra-terrestrial world. Maybe they could, let's say evolve some way of connecting their nervous systems. Like in some terrestrial parasitic plants.Image from Science direct. In this case, though, it would not be plants that connect this way but some animals would do in the same way, connecting nervous systems.Another idea would be that the new generation could be like male angler fish that get stuck to the female and become their parasites. In this case, though, the older generation would get stuck to the new generation and transfer their experiences and knowledge to the new generation.Image from Marine Madness.Yet another idea would be if transferring memories between generations would evolve in a similar way like in some cartilaginous fish egg cases evolved. Maybe upon death, the parents would drop their central nervous system for their children to eat it and get their memories?Image from Wikipedia of a skate fish egg case.In some science fiction books, there was also an idea that alien life forms had more complex DNA-like molecules that evolved to carry some learned information between generations in addition to what our DNA does.Image from Rebloggy.Image from Emerj.",51 followers,Ethan Oh,1.8K,172,2.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-guys-think-of-this-newly-emerged-XED-lighting-technology-thats-20-more-efficient-than-LED-and-emits-a-very-Sun-like-light
2,"Of course, the others are correct in that the apes, especially chimps and gorillas would create the most advanced of civilisations, being strong and well suited for advancement, but I will point out that by far the most dangerous species would become the ants.For this scenario, let’s say all ants become hyper intelligent, but remain loyal to the colony and queen ant.Firstly, the sheer number of ants that exist on Earth.

The best estimate I could find (BBC Four) stated that there are 100 trillion ants on Earth and they have spread to every single continent on Earth. Ants are absolutely remarkable and these are some thing they have already done, without the intelligence boost this question gives them.Humans have build cities, and some intelligent animals may have cobbled together a makeshift shelter for safety, but ants have built massive colonies underground, safe from most hazards that lie above, with rooms dedicated to specific purposes like storage, mating, nurseries, farms and even garbage disposal areas like we have with landfills, all connected with tunnels that ensure good ventilation.A group of scientists unearthed an ant colony that covered over 50 square metres of space and was 8 metres deep. The colony must have moved 80 tonnes of soil to build it. This would be a New York City for the ants to build. But, we have discovered supercolonies, built by these ants, most notably the Argentine Ant. One supercolony in Europe spread across 6000 km, formed by multiple ant colonies joining and working together, with billions and billions of workers, basically forming their own countries. That’s not all. Argentine Ants from different supercolonies are sociable to other Argentine Ants from other parts of the world, essentially creating a mega-colony that has spread worldwide.Ants are also the only animals other than humans, to go to war with each other and other kinds like termites. The Army Ants of South America band together into a gigantic unit, moving as a united front and tearing through everything that cannot get away. When the Army Ants start to move, birds take off, insects flee, snakes go into the water or into their burrows, even jaguars and horses turn and run when they spot the ants.Army Ants can eat an entire horse. Compare a horse to yourself. There, you see why everything runs. Army Ants also build things with themselves. Have to cross from one tree to another? Have to cross a small stream? The Army Ants build bridges with their own bodies, ensuring no obstacle can stop their movements.Ants have also been spotted using deceptions. When two ants from different species meet in the wild, they either duke it out instantly or size each other up to see how dangerous that ant is. Ants have been seen standing on higher ground or pebbles to look bigger than their opponent. That’s not all. Ants use tactics in war too. They put the weakest and crippled ants at the front lines to suicidally charge and overwhelm the target before the larger soldiers come in to finish the target effortlessly. This prevents the valuable soldiers from being injured or killed unnecessarily. This brings me to another point. Ants act as a superorganism, not as one. They are absolutely ready to die for the colony’s survival, there is no retreat, just endless waves and waves until the ants destroy the enemy, meaning large colonies almost always destroy other insects or animals. Ant wars are pitted at massive scales, since both sides are suicidally ready to throw out millions upon millions of lives to ensure victory, like the Argentine-Fire Ant War in California, for control of not just a small area, but practically the entire state. This war has already lasted years and to my knowledge, is still ongoing.I have just given you an infodump on just how crazily similar ants are to humans and how they have thrived for longer than the dinosaurs and spread to all continents other than Antarctica. How they construct country-sized colonies and wage massive wars with tactics. How they work as one. Now, imagine they all gain intelligence. Imagine they all become as smart as humans. They would take longer to get to our standards than the apes, but they would easily become the largest threat to all the intelligent animals. The superorganism they act as ensures little room for error and no personal nature will get in the way. They could learn to construct, become deadlier, form armies to attack cities and wherever intelligent animals stay. I assume that the supercolonies could join as one, alliances between ant colonies that consist of trillions of ants could be formed and there would be no betrayal, just a ruthlessness and bravery never before seen. Ants will find ways to be resistant to pesticides and water attacks. All intelligent animals would immediately stop fighting themselves and realise just how dangerous the ants became.Then…I don’t know. Maybe World War Ants happens or something.Sources:Edit:The stretch of the 6000 km supercolony.

3,Writing was our most important invention.It allowed us to learn what others had learned without having to memorize more than just the important parts.

I was triaged in about 10 minutes and from there it took less then 5 minutes to admit me in to a resus cubicle, from there I had canulas put in with 5 connections on them, 4 for infusions of saline, glucose, insulin and potassium and one for blood tests.
