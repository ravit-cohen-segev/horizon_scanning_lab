1,"Tim Ferris makes an excellent point. Above a certain age, working on your strengths is better than your weaknesses.So, if you speak really good Chinese or Japanese, and have sales experience, maybe brushing up on those languages and skills would be better than learning something from scratch.Or if you are already working loads of money from organic traction on YouTube, trying to promote the videos might be the logical next step.That is also the reason why most successful businesses are started by people with experience in the domain.Getting a job first, getting good at it, and then starting yoTim Ferris makes an excellent point.

Transformation, Aggregation & Analysis of data becomes cumbersome if # of rows exceed 1 Mn+. Thats where coding languages like SQL enables an Analyst to analyze and transform data easily. SQL is the first thing you should learn as it enables you to work on data.2. Tableau: After you build your datasets, you need to visualize data to develop your Hypothesis or Insights. Tableau enables you to visualize large rows /columns of data and easily bring insights out of it.3. R: You can do a number of things with R. R not only enables you to perform complex transformations but also you can do data blending, create statistical models or even visualization using ggplot. 4th step of analytics project is to test your hypothesis and thats where having knowledge of R enables you to create statistical model to reject any null hypothesis.4. Python/Hadoop: While Python is a similar language, Hadoop is a software framework for distributed computing. You can do similar things of R in Python. Python is more advanced and universal language which most coders (not just analytics professionals) use these days. Normally python is preferred by data scientists.

4,"I had been wanting to take a stab at this one since a few days, but it always looked like an enormous task, because this question has used too many words. In addition, this is a question on which a lot of people have their eyes, and a lot of others have already written elaborate answers.Let me first re-order all the important words:Imagine that you want to become a data scientist, and work in a big organization like Amazon, Intel, Google, FB, Apple and so on.How would that look like?I had been wanting to take a stab at this one since a few days, but it always looked like an enormous task, because this question has used too many words.

8,"Simple fact: only about 22% of all graduates will work in a field related to their degree.

This is true for STEM and non-STEM degrees alike.The value of a college education isn’t really about the degree.It’s about two things related to the experience of getting a degree:Do you know why Wharton and Harvard Business Schools are “better” than, say, Ohio State University? It is not that the academics are that much harder. It is not that the professors are that much smarter. It is not that they do better research. Indeed, none of those things are really true.What makes them better is that they have alumni associations that are exceptionally active, wealthy, connected and helpful by comparison.Why does that matter? Because when you say “gosh, I’m looking for a first job, I’d like work at Company A” the next question in your mind should be “Who do I know who works at Company A or who knows someone who does?”If you went to Harvard, you contact the alumni network and start the search and you’ll find someone.If you went to Ohio State, your ability to make that same connection is lower. And that makes the degree less valuable.The key to making your degree valuable isn’t the degree. It’s working hard, even when you don’t want to do so, and being as socially active and engaged as you possibly can.If you do those two things, then you will end up with a degree that you can use to start a career.If you don’t, then every degree is equally without value.",423 followers,David Wagle,852,1.4K,1.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-are-the-top-paying-jobs-in-information-technology-in-2014
9,"Absolutely, I forget concepts that I don’t use as often. At the level of a PhD or professor, you’ve probably already learned andFor example, I know right off the top of my head which textbooks I’d use to look up different concepts in semiconductors, solid-state physics, and photonics, or I’ll find relevant papers. So while I may not remember the exact details, refreshing the concept is rather fast (compared to learning it for the first time) and I already know which resources to use.A laAbsolutely, I forget concepts that I don’t use as often.

So while I may not remember the exact details, refreshing the concept is rather fast (compared to learning it for the first time) and I already know which resources to use.A large part of the PhD training is to teach you how to learn new complex things, how to find suitable resources, and then use that knowledge to create something new. This requirement of creating something new takes “understanding” to a whole different level. An undergraduate who tops a class seldom has the same depth or understanding for even the fundamentals as a PhD in that field. The word “So yeah, I may forget things that I haven’t used for a while, but I can learn it rather quickly, and if it will be used regularly from then on, I’ll find a way to integrate that new concept with my existing knowledge in order to aid my research.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-are-the-top-paying-jobs-in-information-technology-in-2014
