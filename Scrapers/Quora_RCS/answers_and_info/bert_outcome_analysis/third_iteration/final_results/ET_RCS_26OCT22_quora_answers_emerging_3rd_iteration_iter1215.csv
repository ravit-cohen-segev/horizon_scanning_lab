The Brick will be a 5,6, or 7G Connection to the internet that will project your own personal WiFi.Everything else will run off that.A device similar to a hearing aid will replace all home speakers to interface with your Personal Digital Assistant. Your DA will handle most things by voice command, like summoning your personal or rideshare vehicle, playing media for home entertainment, ordering food or supplies, scheduling appointments, getting reservations, setting reminders, paying bills or vendors or using machine learning to understand your habits and remind you of things you might need to pick up on the way home based on your consumption habits. (It takes you an average of 4 days to go through a gallon of milk, so you might need to pick up some on the way home today.)When you leave the house, you’ll select a device to carry with you depending on what you need, sometimes the full handheld computer that handles much of the functions of today’s Smartphones, but it will not have its own connection, rather running off your personal wifi for everything, even phone calls will run via VoIP over that wifi, sometimes just a small display screen to visually augment your connection through your earpiece. Sometimes you’ll be fine with just your earpiece and brick.Your vehicle’s internet connection, your TV’s set-top box, all your home internet devices will primarily run off your personal wifi.A small supplementary device left in the home will be needed to keep the home internet devices, like home automation devices, smart appliances, chore-bots like Roombas and other IoT connected while you’re away.When people ask about why net neutrality is important, this is why. The problems lack of net neutrality causes aren’t what most people think of, like having your connection to NetFlix choked by ISP’s greedy for more fees to deliver video streaming.In fact, the problem with lack of Net Neutrality is never technology that already exists, it’s the technology that doesn’t exist yet being delayed because the companies that own the pipelines don’t want to lose their cash cows.Voice over IP should have taken over Land Lines 10 years before it actually did. Want to know why it didn’t? Because the Bush Administration wasn’t interested in Net Neutrality, and the ISPs fought VoIP tooth and nail to hold it back because of how lucrative Land Lines were.Here are just a few examples of ISP Fuckwaddery before Net Neutrality was put in place:So if you think ISPs without Net Neutrality keeping them from being assholes are just going to let you have one single connection to the internet, rather than your SmartPhone, Your Cable TV package AND your Home Internet, Go back and read that article again. And again. And again.

I mean, FFS, it’sThat said, with the benefit of hindsight, we now know that simplified Chinese, for all its efficiency, was ultimately unnecessary. The idea of reshaping entire characters or reducing their strokes to make Chinese easier to write as a whole took off during early 20th century China — a time of great strife andAmid the intellectual push to “reform” Chinese, the education ministry of the Nationalist (KMT) government in 1935 rolled out itsThe character simplification scheme of the Republic of China government, introduced in 1935 but shelved by 1936.No one in power had either the time or energy to revisit the proposal to simplify Chinese characters, although the idea clearly persisted all the way to the late 1950s, when the now-ruling Communist Party, who were already experimenting with “reforms” to the Chinese language while they were insurgents, finally sat down and introduced their simplification scheme, which, unlike the KMT’s scheme, was approved, taught in schools, and promoted until it became the standard in mainland China.The first set of simplified characters of the People’s Republic of China, circa late 1950s. The booklet to the right is an introduction to Hanyu Pinyin, the romanization of Chinese that was also introduced at around the same time.Today, with most Chinese-speaking people living in mainland China and being taught primarily in simplified characters, simplified Chinese is undoubtedly the most common script in the Chinese language. Not only are simplified characters official in mainland China, but they are also official or preferred in Singapore (which experimented with its own set of simplified characters until it went along with the PRC’s simplification in the late 70s), Malaysia, and the United Nations (of which the PRC is a member). Most governments in the world that have diplomatic ties with the People’s Republic of China use simplified characters when they have to communicate in Chinese. A minority of native speakers continue to communicate in pre-simplified traditional characters, most notably Taiwan (Nationalist holdout), Hong Kong and Macau (ex-colonies that came under PRC rule but were allowed to retain their colonial-era scripts), and some Chinatowns (although immigration from mainland China is slowly changing that as well).But looking back, it’s hard to argue why simplified characters were ever needed. With modern technology, plus the counterfactual that is the minority that still uses traditional characters, most if not all the supposed reasons that written ChineseWhile simplified characters may have made writing Chinese less of a headache for everyone who was beginning to learn how to read and write (which included almost everyone in China at the time), and mass illiteracy in China was wiped out, there is no evidence that retention of traditional characters would have led to a different outcome. Almost everyone in simplified-using mainland China is literate, but so is everyone in traditional-using Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau. It could be that these places are small and highly urbanized societies which makes education a lot easier, but the fact that no one there appears to be complaining about traditional characters (all while knowing that there is a simplified system) suggests that if all the people in mainland China were taught in traditional charactersThe best argument for the necessity of simplifying Chinese characters, which is that they are easier to write compared to traditional characters, is not as compelling these days with the computer keyboard, which allows people to type out the same characters in their simplified or traditional forms in the same amount of time. As for writing manually, most people who are accustomed to writing in traditional characters stick to writing in traditional characters, and are no less capable of communicating via writing compared to their counterparts who use simplified characters. If they find writing to be a pain in the ass, they could justIn essence, many of the perceived downsides of writing in traditional characters didn’t have to be addressed with all-out character simplification.Typing in traditional Chinese charactersWhich makes simplified Chinese characters more or lessBut many of us are better off with simplified Chinese characters.Oh well.¯\_(ツ)_/¯","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-greatest-invention-or-technological-advancement-that-will-change-our-lifestyle-dramatically

I think AI will kill jobs, and over time, AI might kill most “jobs” as we know them. I think that people are somewhat complacent in regard to the economic impact of AI, and will likely be ill-prepared for the changes we have to adapt to in the not-so-distant future.First, let's start with the comparisons to machinery and automation. They did indeed put factory workers out of work. In that respect, I agree AI today is similar in many applications, replacing workers who have less specialized skills, perhaps call center operators, office assistants (in a limited extent), and maybe soon, taxi drivers and truck drivers. But I would argue that AI is fundamentally different from machinery or most of the other analogies commonly made when answering this question, because AI is growing and is unlikely to stop growing. It's growing in breadth (of applications and industries), in geographic and economic scope, and in power (it's capacity to address increasingly complex tasks). A more fitting analogy would be machinery in an automobile plant that not only made the parts one day, but then learned how to assemble them the week after, and then how to design cars a year later.I think that there is little that is out of reach for advanced AI of the future. Let's leave the question of the AI singularity alone for now. Instead, I think that deep learning efforts at Google and elsewhere are making AI systems learn faster and faster, with a growing rate of acceleration. Advanced AI can now address increasingly complex tasks including medical diagnosis, stock market trading, weather prediction and human behavioral modeling. Very soon, it will be able to take the place of certain types of teachers, and find a role in education. It can already deal with complex systems in software and mathematics, and seems to be only limited in applications that require interactions with the physical world (sensors are still imperfect), and with people.So without projecting too far into the future, we can ask the question, what jobs will NOT be killed by AI? Jobs that involve labor are already (or soon to be) replaced. Jobs that require logical reasoning are being replaced, albeit at a slower rate. What are the qualities that humans have that cannot be captured by AI? Perhaps creativity, emotional responses? So perhaps researchers in academia will survive longer than most, and artists (though AI stylistic mimicry is already quite impressive and their results enjoyable), and counselors/psychologists/case workers, and decision makers like CEOs who cannot be predictable or error prone. And hopefully software engineers and algorithm designers who develop AI systems.This leaves a very, very small portion of today's jobs intact. Many say: we just need to train people to fill higher level jobs created by AI, e.g. Programmers, ML researchers. But this is no easy feat. The US educational system is struggling to meet the demands created by advanced technology today. This failure is in part responsible for the economic divide plaguing the country today. The challenge of educating the public for a job market that is both decreasing in scope and increasing in complexity, is nothing we've ever faced before.I am far from original in this opinion. But if I had to guess, I would say that AI will put far more people out of work than we can (re)train in time. That will have significant economic repercussions as corporations seeking to minimize cost will do so at the cost of rising unemployment. There will need to be dramatic changes in social policies in order to avert large scale economic disaster, first dramatic rises in minimum wage, then eventually some type of universal income/welfare. It's the kind of change that requires significant leadership in our government, something that seems woefully absent today.","44,298 followers",Kurt Guntheroth,527,13.7K,167.3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-expected-trends-for-mobile-technology-including-devices-over-the-next-5-years
