Our team at Grammarly has compiled a handy list of common grammatical errors to help make your writing accurate, clear, and professional.Ambiguous (“Squinting”) modifiersA squinting modifier is a misplaced modifier that, because of its location in a sentence, could modify either the phrase that precedes it or the one that follows it. In the example sentence, is the subject listening to music slowly or slowly getting a headache? To correct a squinting modifier, move its position in the sentence to clarify to the reader which word you intend to modify.Misuse of lie/layIf you plan to place or put an object somewhere, such as a plate on a table, you should use “lay.” If you intend to stretch out on a bed for a nap, you should use “lie.” The verb “lie” is an intransitive verb, which means it does not need an object. The transitive verb “lay” requires an object.It may take some getting used to this “lay” or “lie” business; after all, misuse of these verbs is common. But if you remember to lay down your fork before you’re full, then you won’t have to lie down later from overeating.Comma splicesHe was very hungry, so he ate a whole pizza.To splice means to connect or join. When a writer joins two independent sentences with a comma instead of separating them with a period or coordinating conjunction, that’s a comma splice.The comma has its jobs to do, but connecting two independent sentences isn’t one of them. Besides, the period gets testy when his sister, the comma, steals his thunder. Periods have their jobs, and so do commas, but never the twain shall meet—unless it’s in the form of a semicolon. Semicolons can also take the place of a coordinating conjunction, such as “and,” “but,” or “so,” among others.Run-on sentencesRun-on sentences, also known as fused sentences, occur when two complete sentences are squashed together without using a coordinating conjunction or proper punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon. Run-on sentences can be short or long. A long sentence isn’t necessarily a run-on sentence.To avoid run-on sentences, see if there is more than one idea communicated by two or more independent clauses. In our examples, there are two complete sentences:Example:Example:Both sentences are complete ideas by themselves; therefore, use a semicolon or a period to indicate that they are separate independent clauses.Using “could of” instead of “could have”“Could have” is always correct; “could of” never is. Writers probably make this grammar gaffe because, when we speak, the contraction “could’ve” sounds an awful lot like “could of.”TautologiesTautologies express the same thing twice with different words. In our example, the word “made” implies that Jack used his own two hands to create the pail. The prepositional phrase “with his own hands” creates a redundancy. Once you know what they are, it’s fun to discover tautologies: dilapidated ruins, close proximity, added bonus, large crowd...The list goes on and on!After reading through this list of common grammatical mistakes, you might be wondering how to remember all these rules as you write.

By splitting the question I get a frame of reference and then the answer becomes fairly straight forward to comprehendThe answer to the first question is straight forward and India is much advanced compared to where we were in 2000. I am not going to elaborate this further because its for us to see. But should we be happy about it? That leads us to my second questionWhile it is true that India has advanced immensely in the last 20 years, the real question is has this made us more dependent on other countries? Most notably the United States and recently China?Despite having a population of 1.3 billion people and being touted as the software superpower (thanks to the IT services industry) not so long ago, India does not have self-reliance when it comes to technology. China created companies like Ali Baba, Baidu and Tencent a parallel to the American tech giants while India (even India’s telecom minister recently) takes pride in being the largest consumer of Whatsapp, and Facebook! Yes almost everyone has a mobile phone in India today and therefore the opportunities for growth is tremendous. But the real question one should ask is, who will be the beneficiaries of these opportunities? The mobile phones used in India are Chinese phones and the software used in these phones are U.S owned. Basically all our data, from our shopping habits to our entertainment preferences are in the hands of foreign technology companies. Now we know IoT is catching up fast and that means more control to these companies and India will be a proud consumer supplying data.One of the many important aspects discussed in Rajiv Malhotra’s latest book “Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Power, Five Battlegrounds” is India’s military dependence on foreign technology. While the manufacturing of Rafale jets will happen in India, the technology is owned by the French and let’s understand when such technology transfers occur between countries, the supplying country will always provide a technology that is one generation behind to the consuming country. That means we are technologically and militarily advanced compared to our previous generations but we are at least one generation behind the innovating countries! In certain areas like military that is not good newsMy last point on this is our pride in our Human resource and how skilled we are! Yes as individuals many Indians are CEOs of big foreign tech giants. But how does that benefit India as a nation? Do we have a stake in the intellectual property of these products? Can we say for instance Sunder Pichai as Google’s CEO holds the same clout in his company as Mark Zuckerberg holds in Facebook? Certainly not! Let’s not confuse individual brilliance with technological advancement as nation.For India to have a grand standing in the world stage as a technologically advanced nation, we need to come out of our consumer mindset and to quote Rajiv Malhotra’s words “be producers of knowledge and technology”.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/With-advanced-technologies-today-also-in-India-education-is-theoretical-not-practical-Why

They have required clerk for their system so they gave clerical type of education.

In our syllabus there is less scope to practical work. More emphasis on theory.Third point of view is that our education system donot allowed new experiment in curriculum. The researches which are already done , the experiments which are already done are regularly repeated. No scope for new invention.Fourth point is that our system is based on British system. They have required clerk for their system so they gave clerical type of education. After Independence we followed that system again and again which gives most emphasis on theory .Fifth point is that if you looked 3 idiot movie then you found that Teachers in India gives more emphasis on remember and write rather than Understanding and comprehension . Teachers required systematic definition in systematic way they don't accept new way and new definition made by students.Sixth point is students also learns only for job . That means they don't have any interest in other school activities. They just want pass and take a job. Also parents compare their children with others. To compare with other child they wants only percentage in study and not in practical. Hence they also enforce their child to study theoretical more.Seventh point is that indian education system is rigid. That means changes in curriculum made after every 10 years. In between these 10 years world changes so vastly and rapidly but curriculum remains old. This is one of the most important reason to promote theory.Eighth point is Teacher in India are rarely change their self as per need of curriculum. They have tendency that old is gold. This new is nothing and they knew everything. This kind of iho is responsible for rigidity in education system. Old teachers don't accept new ways , new ideas of invention. They still remains unchanged which is the barrier.Nineth point is there are no parameters to calculate talent of students. Only theory is measurement tool for students. Other tools are neglected by the students and teachers. Our system doesn't allow other activities and their points to measure someone's output and result.Tenth point is our politician don't have common sense about education system. They thought education is unnecessary part because it don't give revenue to them. This revenue measurement method donor allow innovation and practical experience in education. Students also thoughts that they can prepare their exam only in two or three months hence they also neglect practical experience .Thus I have concluded some factors .",719 followers,Sandip Bhatnagar,629,321,1.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/With-advanced-technologies-today-also-in-India-education-is-theoretical-not-practical-Why

Finally, we had a domestic Tesla, and in 2011 Putin drove a Yo-mobil for the rolling cameras. Everything looked very bright and promising, but nothing came to fruition. No factory was built. No mass production was launched.The grand total of three Yo-mobils were manufactured. Appropriately, the king court’s jester politician Zhirinovsky bought one and managed to drive 300 miles, at which point the car refused to charge. A Mercedes Benz E-class picked him up.142 millions euro invested in the project had magically disappeared.Looks too good to be true? True.Marussia Sports CarFounded in 2007 by Nikolai Fomenko and partners, Marussia Motors set an ambitious goal of producing the first Russian racing car.They beat Yo-mobil and managed to produce forty four prototypes of varying degrees of (in)completion.Hundreds of millions of dollars went down the pipe, and in 2014 the project was shut down at a loss. The same year, Nikolai Fomenko sailed on his super-yacht into Dubai marina for the yacht-show.His super yacht was neither designed nor manufactured in Russia.Mr. Chubais, the head of Rosnano, a state venture fund, is giving Mr. Putin heads-up on how he’s blowing, sorry, spending budget moneyPlastic Logic 100 eBook ReaderThis e-book reader is based on the developments of the German company PlasticLogic. In 2011, it was on the verge of bankruptcy due to its failed product: the electronic book reader Que.But then Rusnano swooped in and the business of the PlasticLogic went uphill. Until it didn’t.Mr. Chubais paid off $50 million worth of PlasticLogic debts, and another $100 million was offered as a loan guarantee to build a plant in Zelenograd near Moscow. He sold the idea to the government that his eBook readers would be used instead of textbooks in all the schools of Russia. $700 million more were poured into the project.To cut the long story short, in 2012, the construction of the plant and the production of devices were abandoned altogether, citing economic inexpediency.Do you think Mr. Chubais got fired? It’s a rhetorical question.Prime minister Dmitry Medvedev said about YotaPhone, new Russian smartphone: “When Steve Jobs heard about YotaPhone, he was worried.”At the end of 2013, CEO of Rostec, owner of Yota Devices Ltd, ex-KGB general and Mr. Putin’s old friend, Sergei Chemezov presented the highly innovative Russian smartphone YotaPhone with two displays to Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.Observe, they always present their prototypes to the supreme leaders and not to the public.In Russia, government is your investor, your marketer, your consumer, your law, your freedom, your bank, and your career. Public doesn't count for much. They only need to be fed buckwheat and macaroni and entertained with TV fluff and parades.For some unbeknownst reason, all the smartphone components were produced in wealthy Singapore, the E-ink display was from aforementioned PlasticLogic, which explains why sale price was so high.In 2013, YotaPhone was sold for 499 euros. Grand total of 40,000 devices were sold by mid-2014.Riding on the back of their success, in 2014, Yotaphone 2 was released, and 22,760 units were sold.In 2017, Yotaphone 3 was released at the price of $450 with even fewer units sold.Hundreds of consumers await the release of the KGB general’s YotaPhone 4.Meet Boris, a man in Alyosha robot suit passing off as a robotIn December 2018, the story of a Russian cutting-edge life size robot that was the answer to Boston Dynamics’ robot, went on all the federal TV channels.During the nationall forum “Projectors” held in Yaroslavl, the life size robot Boris was showing some cool dance moves to the clapping audience.Turned out it was a human pretending to be a robot by wearing Alyosha robot suit.

My neighbor just needed to land good IT job to be considered as a part of a developed house.What is complicated is scaling that development to a massive continent sized nation with a huge hinterland with 100s of millions of people living far away from the sea or any urban development.People often get enamored with city states like Singapore or Dubai, but the fact is it is not hard to build a Singapore. In our own country, Mumbai’s GDP is comparable to Singapore’s. If the government didn’t use its tax money to fund rest of the country it could be having even better roads & infrastructure. Making a city with an excellent port in a major trading route into a rich city is not a big deal.What is complicated is turning a place 1000km from a port with no river, no big freshwater access, very limited energy or school into a developed one. That takes a long time. That is the challenge India has in developing the interior states like UP and Bihar. If turning a city of 5 million people into a developed nation required a brilliant man like Lee Kwan Yew, turning a country of 1400 million people requires 300 such brilliant leaders and the world doesn’t have that much of a supply.I will end with one final analogy. It is quite easy to heat up a small vessel. It takes much longer to heat a large vessel. It also takes much longer for a large vessel to lose heat.",78 followers,Rajan Singh,34.8K,360,25.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/With-advanced-technologies-today-also-in-India-education-is-theoretical-not-practical-Why

Usually, in any culture, the more nationalistic and naïve a person is, the more overconfident they tend to be when it comes to the capabilities of their armed forces.I don’t doubt that a fair number of Russians think their military could defeat that of the United States. Perhaps they don’t know enough about the U.S. armed forces, or about warfare.First, it would be just about impossible for either country to invade the other and get even a foothold. People fighting in their own country to defend it from invasion are more motivated, know the places they’re fighting better, and have much shorter supply lines and simpler logistics, especially when they’re thousands of miles apart.This is the point where someone starts talking about NATO being a sinister cabal created to conquer Russia. Well, that’s wrong, for multiple reasons - the two best are, first, that an offensive war against Russia would be a violation of NATO’s organizing charter and most NATO members would refuse to support it. Second, even if the U.S. was foolish enough to send most of our Army, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy to attack Russia, thereby making them unavailable to do anything else, it would be impossible to keep them supplied once the shooting started. That’s a long way for a high-volume sustained logistical system.Second, I don’t think most of the population in either country would want to fight such a war. In the U.S. that would be enough to shut the idea down right there. Russia’s government is a lot less responsive to pressure from the population, but they aren’t immune either.But for the sake of the hypothetical, let’s posit that the armed forces of the two nations collide and end up fighting in some other place that’s equally challenging for them both to get to. In this case, to Russians who thought their military could defeat the U.S. in anything except insurgent mode, I’d ask them to look at the American military’s ridiculously huge budget, the superior training and equipment, the strong leadership by NCOs and officers, the greater population base to draw on, the cultural factors that make it easier to blend Americans from different places in a single unit (just having a common language is a good start), the vast reservoir of combat experience American ground and air combat elements have gained over the last two-plus decades, the U.S. having an existing network of bases in much of the world,To anyone in either country who thought the other would be easy to overrun, I’d point out some basic military math: for an attacker to overcome even a hastily prepared defense, the attacker needs to outnumber the defender by 3–1 or more - that requirement goes up if you’re going to fight in cities, mountains, forests, swamps, or other places where the environment favors the defense.So for either Russia or the U.S. to try to conquer the other would be a fool’s errand.","12,757 followers",Khalid Elhassan,2.3K,1.2K,38.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-India-have-no-advanced-technology-like-the-US-and-Russia

We are buying advanced defence equipment from Israel, which has no resources to speak of, other than people.What about Singapore or Hong Kong or Taiwan? How are they so ahead of India economically?This is the age of knowledge, the age of excellence. Having one brilliant scientist is better than having 1000 (or 10,000) mediocre ones. Numbers don’t matter, quality does. You see the same thing in Olympics. Countries the size of a city end up getting more gold medals than India.I am not writing this out of self-pity or to sow a seed of despair. Absolutely not. But we need to stare at reality in the face, and not bury our head in sand, shouting slogans about our past greatness (real or imagined).The first thing we need to remind ourselves is that a country’s size is an advantageToday there isHow did USA become so affluent? Every time you buy a laptop, do a search on internet, spend time on social media, or use a smart phone, a tech company like Google, Facebook, Snapchat, Intel, or Microsoft in the US gets richer. Money is transferred from your wallet to these companies directly or indirectlyThat is why Palo Alto is so affluent, but a Jehanabad or Bilaspur is not.But that brings us to the next question: Why is India not excelling in science and technology? After all, there are so many of us. Statistically, some of us have to be intelligent and smart. Is it the lack of resources? Or is our DNA defective?Let us find out. Start with the quality of research in our universities.Here is a hypothetical question: There are two new aeroplanes which have to be taken for a test flight. And you are the lucky pilot. One plane is developed by a team of Stanford scientists, the other by scientists at some university in India, say Kanpur university (or pick anyone you like).Which plane would you choose to fly? I would go for the one by Stanford University, even though I know nothing about the people who developed it. As a pilot, I am putting my life on the line.Some might say I am biased or pro-America or whatever. I don’t think so. I don’t want to die in a test flight.A vast majority of the research done by our Universities is mediocre, or below mediocre. I was a student at IIT and I did not meet too many PhD students fired up to do pathbreaking research. Some PhDs were waiting to clear the relevant exams like UGC/CSIR, get married, and get a safe government job in some college. Somehow publish one or two papers, somehow complete the PhD, somehow do this or that…When I was a student at Wharton, one evening I was talking to some IIT friends, who had become professors at University of Pennsylvania. They were lamenting how sub-par the research coming from India was, including some of the stuff from IITs. This is a widespread perception, not that of one or two.I am not belittling the sincere researchers, whether at IITs or other universities. I am in fact rooting for them. But the reality is that they are a minority.Why is that? Is it the lack of facilities? No. A solid ‘no’. There was a time when we could have blamed it on facilities, but not today. Most (not all) research needs access to internet and computers, and science journals.There might be some differences in technical resources, but that is not the reason why we lag. We are lagging because we lack the quest for excellence. We lack the daring to go all out to do world changing research. We put the friction of bureaucracy in our science institutions. We fall behind because mediocrity is not punished, and brilliance is not rewarded. Survival is what motivates us. We settle for ‘good’ in a world where good is not ‘good enough’. We are happy with the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar award; the thirst for Nobel Prize is not there. We don’t even think we can get there. We give up before we start. We don’t fight.Most of us work for pension and salaries, not because we want to do something. Even in DRDO, for every scientist who sacrifices his life slogging, there is probably another who just chugs along. The hard working souls carry the weight of stragglers, and our bureaucracy.What else do we lack?Risk takingImagine if some college kid in India had suggested giving up a job to launch a startup like Twitter. Parents and families would have revolted. No offence, but most VCs would also have said, “What a stupid thing to do? Sending 140 character messages? Why would you need that? Why not use Facebook or email or blogs?”The reality is that failure is part of innovation. Risk is part of progress. Pain is part of success. It is a package. Take it or leave it.It is about time we start thinking about it. Let us not live in past glory, which is mostly in our head. Let us smell the coffee, and see the world for what it is. We owe it to our citizens who are struggling for livelihood.Teach our children to take risk and go for excellence. Be the best in whatever you do. Ask questions. Don’t accept the status quo.When the teacher doesn’t give marks because your answer doesn’t match his/her answer, don’t bother. Give the right answer anyway. Don’t be afraid.Let us start by ramping up science learning in schools. Stop this rote learning for God’s sake. Encourage students to ask questions. Let us develop concepts. Encourage rigour and problem solving, and not shy away from mathematics. Science does not have to be only animation and fun.Remember: Soviet Union was able to single handedly keep pace with the whole of western world despite its terrible bureaucracy. Why? Just look at any Russian high school book on science and math, and they will blow your mind away. That is why. Even today students in India use Irodov’s Physics book for entrance preparation.Let us not be apologetic about hardcore science learning. Not everybody has to study science or math. Let children pursue whatever they are passionate about. But to those who want to pursue Science - give them the opportunity and motivation to shoot for the stars.Cut the fat out of our science institutions. Bring in the culture of perform or perish. Let high performers go up rapidly, and let the mediocre ones be removed. If the LCA project takes 40 years, heads should roll. Everyone should be accountable.Stop this mediocrity. Stop this ‘it is good enough for India’. Stop this quest for the ‘consolation prize’.Get rid of this thinking that innovation can only come from California. Our scientists and engineers are working in world’s best corporations across the globe. They will come back when they see better opportunities.Our heroes should be scientists, innovators, artists, and people who blaze a trail. Rank and age should not matter, contribution should.This will not happen in a day or a year. But if we start now, in 20–30 years we can change India.China was once just like India. They started low-tech mass production. Now they are going head to head against the US, even in high technology. They are not there yet fully, but are surely getting there. Now they are building and exporting fighter jets.If China can do it why can’t we? Just because we are a democracy? Nonsense. Let us demand more from our politicians and leaders. More importantly, let us demand more from ourselves.India will change if we change. If I change. If many of us change. Not by shouting slogans, but doing things differently in our daily lives.When we work with sincerity and integrity in our daily lives, our children will imbibe our behaviour. This small seedling will one day become a giant tree, which will spread shade and happiness.Will we change?",533 followers,Kushal Sharma,11.8K,100,665K,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-India-have-no-advanced-technology-like-the-US-and-Russia
