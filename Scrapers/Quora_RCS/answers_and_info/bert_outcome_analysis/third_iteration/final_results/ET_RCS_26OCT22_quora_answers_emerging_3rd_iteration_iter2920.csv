Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party. Because radiation from nuclear accidents is apparently scarier than way more people dying of regular pollution constantly and the total annihilation of all life on Earth as the oceans boil away.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-negatives-of-living-in-a-world-with-advanced-technology
4,"How far can technology really go?I think the term “technology” is interesting when one considers it to represent, to us now anyway, a leading frontier of human innovation. Technology during the various ages of human development is often used to define the age too. When the level of technology progresses too much, we usually refer to that as a different “age” in human history.When one considers how rapidly every field of human knowledge is advancing today, we realize we are “breaking the scale we use to measure ages”.

We’re not just creating new inventions faster at this point in human history, we are at a creative and innovation point of development where the “curve of advancing technologies” is starting to appear vertical. We don’t quite know how to describe this situation.I think we need to adopt a more inclusive social contract in society as a whole before our technology can progress beyond what our pop culture science fictions have projected. Frankly, I think “technology” can take us “all the way” beyond being human, but that type of technology is going require several revolutions in our social contracts between one another to happen. We’re spending far too much attention on security and warfare, where that attention spent on more productive activities could have ended any reasons for our geopolitical tensions a generation ago.At this point in our development, with the new technologies curve appearing vertical, the only thing holding us back is our maturity as a species.","68,789 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-negatives-of-living-in-a-world-with-advanced-technology

Not greed of money, but greed of our personal time. Most of the high performing students were interested in getting the best grade for the least amount of effort. Yes, it does not sound flattering, but it actually is a positive attribute. You see, when you are intent on learning the most in the least amount of time, you really focus on the big picture first. You know that if you understand the big picture, you can fill in the details more easily right before a test.For example, if you are studying the cardiovascular system, the best students would always understand the big picture first, how cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, blood pressure, blood flow, and venous return are related and affect each other. At least, if we really understood this, we would probably pass. Just add in a bunch of less relevant details, and you could ace the section.Students that struggled often reversed the process. They would try to memorize a bunch of details, but did not have the big picture as a framework to hold those details. So many times, I would be studying with someone right before the test, and after explaining a “big picture” concept to them, they would have the epiphany. But having the epiphany early gives you a framework that helps to hold the details.So my advice to you, as an aspiring physician, is to be greedy with your time. The first few days of any new subject, be relentless in asking questions until you understand the big picture. Once you have done that, you will not fail. And if you want to ace the subject, just use the rest of your time filling in all the minutia that will earn you a top grade. And realize that the big picture is what makes you a good physician, because that is probably the only thing you will remember. The details are for your personal goals, to get the grades that will allow you to pursue whatever you wish.Best of luck to you all.","68,789 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-negatives-of-living-in-a-world-with-advanced-technology
