In doing so, this is what management should keep in mind:Encourage regular team interactionThe best way to break down silos is to have departments interact with one another on a routine basis. You may already hold regular in-person meetings, Zoom presentations, and conferences to ensure team alignment. Introducing communication platforms allows for immediate interactions as needed, which is crucial to fostering a continual flow of communication throughout the workday.

9,"The choice of words in framing this question is quite amusing.First of all, Sundar and Satya don’t “control” companies the way Mukesh Ambani “controls” his company. They are employees who were appointed as CEOs by the boards of the respective companies, and have a job description that they need to function in accordance with. They do not have unlimited power to make arbitrary decisions.Secondly, they did not take anything over. They have a job to do, and they get up in the morning and go to work just like all the rest of us … the fact that they make beaucoup bucks and work extremely long hoursThe choice of words in framing this question is quite amusing.First of all, Sundar and Satya don’t “control” companies the way Mukesh Ambani “controls” his company.

They have a job to do, and they get up in the morning and go to work just like all the rest of us … the fact that they make beaucoup bucks and work extremely long hours notwithstanding. “Take over” is a totally wrong way of looking at this situation.Thirdly, yes, among Indian immigrants (and among immigrants from other countries too) there often is a wish to do something helpful for their country of origin, and they will act on that desire when an opportunity presents itself. But the conspiratorial tone suggesting that Satya and Sundar are trojan horses sent by India to the US to flood the US with more Indians really makes no sense. The recruitment of H1B IT workers started way back in early 1990s. It was purely a supply-and-demand business decision made by Americans (such as Bill Gates), and had nothing to do with any push by any Indians to get more Indians into the US. Certainly, I don’t see Satya or Sundar or Indra or anyone in that capacity doing anything that will hurt their employer or their personal reputation.Considering that India has 1.3 billion people and the","9,221 followers",Don Dodge,23.8K,137,5.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Who-are-the-top-technology-influencers-in-USA

They are both really good CEOs, but with very different challenges. I think if they switched jobs they would be less effective. Meaning, they are the best CEOs for their respective companies.Both are very smart, quiet leaders, introverted, reflective, and know every detail about their businesses. They are NOT egomaniacs, not loud and extroverted, and not obsessed about winning at all costs. However, they are super focused and driven to succeed.The chaI worked for Microsoft for 5 years and Google for 9 years, and got to see both Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai up close before they became CEOs.

Meaning, they are the best CEOs for their respective companies.Both are very smart, quiet leaders, introverted, reflective, and know every detail about their businesses. They are NOT egomaniacs, not loud and extroverted, and not obsessed about winning at all costs. However, they are super focused and driven to succeed.The challenges at Microsoft and Google are very different. The size in terms of revenue, profits, employees, market cap, etc are about the same. But, Microsoft is an enterprise software company driven by license revenue, while Google is a consumer internet company driven by advertising revenue.One obvious difference is the immediate impact Satya Nadella had at Microsoft, versus the smooth transition Sundar had at Google. After decades of leadership by Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer there was an aggressive, sometimes toxic culture at Microsoft. Satya changed the Microsoft culture dramatically, employee morale improved, and the enterprise market was ready for the move to the Cloud. The product shift had already happened before Satya took over, but the stock market recognition had not. Satya got the benefit of that big move in the stock.Sundar had to deal with big challenges with the EU and other regulatory agencies, political issues, and legal challenges. Competing with Apple iPhone versus Android, AWS vs Google Cloud, and all the challengers to YouTube, Google Search, Gmail, Google Maps, etc is a daunting task. Sundar handled all of them with grace and determination.Both Satya and Sundar are superstar CEOs that any tech company would love to have. But, I would agree that Satya probably had more challenges to deal with when he first started.","3,429 followers",Yasir Chowdhrey,13.1K,77,4.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Who-are-the-top-technology-influencers-in-USA
