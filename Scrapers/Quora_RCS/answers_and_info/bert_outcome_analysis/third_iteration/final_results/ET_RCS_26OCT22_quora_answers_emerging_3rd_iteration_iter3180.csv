3,"Steam railroads. 1,000 years ago all the bits of knowledge needed to build steam engines and rail roads already existed.Really, it’s surprising that the Romans did not hit on the idea. They had very short “Railroads” for launching ships, and could have run those rails from city to city.As a “what if” history. What if the Romans had been able to move large numbers of troops around quickly and arriving, rested to battle. Add to that the trade that they would have had across civilization. Rome might still be the capitol of the world.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-modern-day-advanced-technologies-will-be-considered-ridiculously-primative-in-100-years-time

Yes Xerox, the company that makes fax and photocopy machines is the one that created modern computer interfaces. Who knows what million or billion years ahead technology is lying in some lab somewhere because management can't find a use for it within our current strategy. Even when they do realize how valuable the technology is, if they can't get it in the hands of maximum number of people, it's worthless. Like the digital camera that was invented by Kodak 25 years before it because mass marketed by Sony. Kodak understood its value but didn't want to risk disrupting their film sales business and sat on it for 2.5 decades until the carpet got pulled from under their feet.In the medical field, Ignaz Semmelweis proposed the practice of washing hands before/after medical procedures with chlorinated lime solutions in 1847. It took more than 20 years for doctors to actually start doing it.Glass: was first created in ancient Egypt or Mesopotamia and used by high society to make jewellery and decorate their tombs. Today the same glass is integral to everything from your smartphone screens to test tubes. It's actually unclear how technologically advanced those civilizations really were. But I think it's safe to say that they didn't have a TV in every home and touch screen computers in everyone's pockets.Aluminium: was predicted centuries before it was finally created and even then, once upon a time was more expensive than gold because we couldn't mass produce it. And nobody became billionaires because of its expensiveness as no one probably knew what all to do with it. Today it's used in everything from space crafts to kitchen utensils.Graphene could be the aluminium of our times. Predicted a decade ago and created in small quantities in labs around the world. It's mixed into and used in everything from curved screens to batteries and what not. However the different labs working on the technology is extremely secretive and it will most definitely be another decade (or a few) before we see it used in any real manner.Then there is Starlite. A material claimed to be able to withstand and insulate from extreme heat. It was invented by amateur chemist and hairdresser Maurice Ward. The means of fabricating it was lost with the death of the inventor because of his greed and paranoia that everyone is out to get him. Silly old kook.So to answer your question: Nothing would happen. A lot of someone's are already sitting on millions of years advanced technologies without realizing what it could be, for a lack of imagination or for a lack of ability to market it.Someday we'll live in a Utopia where every invention is freely shared and collaborated upon and we all lived happily ever after, but don't hold your breath.[Edit] Answering further questions from the comments:The Mammoth in the room: None of the technologies described above is a million years old. Can we even fathom what such a technology looks like? Do we even understand what a million years means in terms of technology? Does my answer still stand the test of time? A million (or two) years ago, man (homo erectus) discovered fire. The technology was so revolutionary that myths claim that it was stolen from the Gods. Cavemen used fire for cooking and warmth & light on cold winter nights and to scare off predators. In the later years humans learned to craft metals to build civilizations and empires using fire. Let's agree that fire is a million years ahead technology.“Not all technology needs to be reproduced and shared to be useful”: Let's imagine we can go back in time to the Jurassic period and hand over an eternal torch (literally) to one ancient human (for the purposes of this imagining we might have to go and kidnap some cavemen and women and take them back with us. For science of course). Also the fire cannot be reproduced and shared, so choose your torch bearer carefully and observe. I seriously doubt such an arrangement would significantly change the course of human history. Depending on the number of cave people we kidnap, maybe the dinosaurs will get a taste of human flesh and because of that we'll have man eating chickens now. On the contrary, if fire making is taught to every human in our little study/imagining, the odds of that group surviving and taking over the world is considerably improved.The evil genius theory: what if the technology in question is destructive or the someone in possession of it is a bully. Of course I had assumed the technology would be good and used for good but this is a viable alternative. And I stand corrected.What if someone built a time machine and decided to travel back in time. He/she would inadvertantly introduce infectious diseases that are a million years ahead of its time and wipe out early humans/certain plants/animals and significantly change historyLife will still find a way, adapt and evolve. Hopefully humanity will be a part of that new evolution.References:https://web.archive.org/web/20111024000436/http://www.glassonline.com/infoserv/history.htmlhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_aluminium",449 followers,Avinash Sorab,536,77,1.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-modern-day-advanced-technologies-will-be-considered-ridiculously-primative-in-100-years-time

What you find is things people didn’t want any more: broken pots, bent nails, the local equivalent of lost pennies not worth going back to look for, foundations of abandoned buildings, and the like. We can find fancier stuff on shipwrecks because they were lost involuntarily and couldn’t be recovered, which is how we got the Antikythera mechanism.

I have.My words, my writing, and my opinions have dictated the behavior and the freedom of other human beings in a way that is completely alien to most people. In the small closed off world of juvenile prison, I had as close to absolute power as I suspect that I will ever get again.At first, it made me incredibly uncomfortable. Who was I to exercise so much control over other people? I shied away from being in charge, and I left it to my coworkers to run the shifts in the dorms where we were working. Eventually, I couldn’t get away with that anymore though. I remember the first shift I ever ran. I was more nervous than I’d ever been in my life.However, I’d been observing for close to a year at that point. I steeled myself, walked into the center of the dorm, stuck my hand on my hip, and I made three rules. No movement without permission, no talking shit, and no fighting. Don’t f*** up my day, and I won’t f*** up yours. Every single kid was watching me - trying to get a gauge on whether I’d follow through or not. If you’ve never stood, unprotected, in a room full of people who have made it clear through their actions that they’re willing to steal, murder, commit rape, and engage in general violence simply to get their way, I suggest you give it a try. It’s a singular experience.Nothing went right that first shift. Nothing went too terribly either, but I was being tested. I simply sat back. I didn’t yell. I didn’t get worked up. That night, I failed every single kid in the dorm. It meant that all of their privileges got revoked, and that they were at risk of being held at the facility for longer than their original sentence.After that, they did what I asked. I imagine sometimes that working there must be similar to how a celebrity feels. Even before those shifts, everyone knew my name, everyone knew where I was, and everyone knew what I was doing. Strange rumors were constantly being concocted about me, and my attention was in constant demand. And now, on top of that, I was respected. Everyone knew that I meant business. That I would be nice, but that if pushed too far, I was totally willing to f*** someone up.I’d be lying if I said, that it wasn’t a rush. I tried not abuse the power, but its far easier said than done. The one time I truly crossed the line left me horrified with myself afterwards. Another difficult kid was at the facility. He’d already been in countless fights, caused all kinds of headaches, threatened to kill us all multiple times, and on one particularly amusing occasion I had helped to carry him down the side of a hill to be placed in confinement. At eighteen years old, he refused to walk and subsequently had to airlifted down the hill by myself and a few other coworkers.This particular night, I had been called to the dorm he was in to deal with him once again. He was locked in a cell pounding on the concrete walls with his fists, threatening everyone, and doing his best to punch the Plexiglas out of the cell door window.Every time he hit the door with his fists, it would make a crashing sound that reverberated throughout the circular dorm. The pitch of it was going right through me, and in the face of his out of control rage, I couldn’t help but feel fear. At that point, I knew better than to show it though. So, I simply narrowed my eyes, gritted my teeth, and crossed my arms.A group of us were assigned to enter the cell. The largest man would go first with the riot shield and pin him to the wall. Two more coworkers would take him to the ground, and I would follow in last with the cuffs. These sorts of things sound simple when planned out, but in real life they rarely go seamlessly.Somehow, the cuffs became loose as I entered into the cell, and my coworkers were struggling. As the kid was being taken to the ground, he managed to hit one of the cuffs with his fists. It swung back rapidly on the chain, and I suddenly found myself taking a face full of metal. It hurt. I ignored it.Thirty minutes later, we were still standing in the cell having to pin him down. He refused to relax, he refused to stop threatening everyone within a three mile radius, and he refused to let us sit him up and escort him out of the dorm. To make matters worse, as soon as we let our holds up, he would start thrashing around again, which meant that he was at risk of hurting himself due to the metal handcuffs and ankle-cuffs restraining his arms and legs.As I knelt there exhausted, pinning this kid to the ground, I felt a slow and steady dripping sensation down the side of my face. Blood, and lots of it. My blood, in fact. It was seeping steadily out of the gash that had been opened in my forehead after getting hit with the flying cuffs.I hadn’t noticed it with all of the adrenaline, and I felt an angry rage taking hold. I was tired, I was bleeding, and I had been called a b**** for perhaps the hundredth time that night. My knee was resting on the chain connecting his ankles together. Without stopping to consider my actions, I wrenched the chain back with my leg. This caused the cuffs to cut painfully into his ankles and to cut off his circulation. I knew exactly what I was doing. I did it anyway. It was only after he started yelling in pain that I let up.I walked out of the cell that night with newfound knowledge and insight. Knowledge and insight, that I perhaps would have preferred not having. I was not incorruptible. If pushed far enough, I would snap and abuse the position I was in. I was no better than any of the people I was judging. That newfound knowledge was as humbling as it was frightening. I had just as much of a capacity for violence and selfishness as anyone else. If you met me in my day to day life, you would probably like me. I have large innocent looking eyes, I speak fairly softly, and I have a reputation for being extremely kind. None of that stopped me from caving into my darker side though that night.Unchecked power corrupts. At least, in my experience. I try not to seek it out now.

The loss caused by corruption in the United States is much higher than that in China. Don't think I'm joking - after reading this article, you will understand the operating mechanism of corruption in the United States.If there is such direct corruption as ""ordinary people give civil servants money in exchange for civil servants to make it convenient for you"" in China, there is basically no such kind of direct corruption in the United States. Even if there are sporadic cases, the civil servants who take bribes will soon be arrested and jailed. The punishment of direct corruption in the United States is very severe.When I first arrived in the United States, I found that the government, the government, and so on all worked in the United States. They will do whatever the laws and regulations say. They won't give you any trouble on purpose, and they won't ask you for a card. At that time, I thought that the United States was really a clean country. However, with the increase of my life experience and the gradual contact with the top of society, I found that corruption in the United States is systematic and ubiquitous.If we only regard direct corruption as corruption, then the United States is one of the cleanest countries in the world. But in essence, corruption is the trading of power and money. By this standard, the United States is extremely corrupt.The transaction of power and money consists of two parts, the first part is bribery, the second part is the abuse of power for personal gain.Let's talk about bribery in the United States. In the United States, it is a serious crime for ordinary people to give money to civil servants. But there are thousands of ways to bribe. Many of the answers to the question of campaign donations are actually the most superficial form of bribery. In fact, the campaign funds can not be put into the official's personal account. One of Trump's scandals was that he used campaign money to pay hush money to a pornographic actor he had called. Michael Cohen, his private lawyer, was jailed for that.In fact, the simplest way to bribe is to invite a speech. For example, if you want to bribe an official, you can't directly charge money, so you invite him to give a speech in your company for half an hour and an hour, and then legally give the official hundreds of thousands of dollars in appearance fees. These are the personal legitimate income of officials. For example, from 2013 to 2014, Hillary Clinton gave a speech at Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank, and the appearance fee for each speech was as high as $225000. A total of three hours of speech, 675000 dollars into the account. Nikky Haley, a Republican, also paid more than $200000 per speech after leaving office.Another way of offering bribes is to set up charitable foundations. For example, Clinton and trump have charitable foundations named after themselves. If interest groups want to bribe Clinton and trump, they will donate money to their charity foundation. In fact, these foundations are essentially small private coffers controlled by Clinton and trump. They can only spend a small part of their daily expenses on charity. For example, Clinton and Hillary's daughter, Chelsea Clinton, is directly the president of the Clinton charity foundation, and receives huge salaries from the foundation. In this way, interest groups can not only pay bribes openly, but also beautify the process of bribery as ""donation"" and ""charity"".There are also many American politicians who, before taking office or after leaving office, serve as executives, board members, consultants and other positions in large enterprises. Many jobs earn millions or even tens of millions of dollars a year. This kind of seamless connection between enterprise executives and government officials is called ""revolving door"" in the United States. For example, Trump's first Secretary of state Tillerson was once the chairman and general manager of Mobil group. Another example is George W. Bush's younger brother, Jeb Bush (Jeb Bush), who became a director of a pharmaceutical company after retiring as governor of Florida. Although these companies do not directly bribe the incumbent government officials, under this kind of unspoken rule, the officials are directly the people of those companies. Under the expectation that ""after retiring from office, they will be able to return to large enterprises to receive high salaries and enjoy the glory and wealth forever"". During their tenure of office, those officials will ""voluntarily and fairly"" formulate policies in favor of those large enterprises.Of course, only paying bribes without abusing power for personal gain does not constitute a complete transaction of power and money. And the way that the United States uses power for personal gain is far more hidden than bribery. More than 90% of Americans can't understand the way the United States uses power for personal gain. (these people think that the U.S. government is not abusing its power for personal gain. Hillary Clinton's speech is expensive only because she is a star, while Tillerson was the CEO of an oil company, which proves that he is capable and qualified to be Secretary of state.)The way for the United States to abuse power for personal gain is to take money to legislate. To sum up, it can be divided into two kinds: legalizing unreasonable things and making reasonable things illegal.To legalize unreasonable things is to legalize things that are illegal and unacceptable in any society, so that interest groups can obtain huge profits.The most obvious example is the legalization of drugs. Marijuana, a less hallucinogenic drug, is just a little fun. Smoking marijuana is as common as smoking in the United States. The most serious drug problem in the United States is actually opiates. Millions of people in the United States now smoke more than one class of opium! That is, about 3% of Americans are smoking opium. In contrast, there were only 3-4 million opium addicts in China in the late Qing Dynasty. The number of opium smokers in the United States is three times that of China in the late Qing Dynasty. Most of the opium drugs that Americans take are actually ""painkillers"" sold in the United States. Pharmaceutical companies in the United States, in the name of ""painkillers"", legally sell opiates. Many doctors in the United States, seeing that every patient in pain, prescribes opiate painkillers at will and poisons them. Do you have rheumatoid arthritis? Take opium to relieve pain! Do you have lumbar disc herniation? Take opium to relieve pain! Do you have muscle soreness? Take opium to relieve pain! So many people become addicted to opium after taking painkillers as prescribed by doctors. However, they can only go back to see a doctor and ask for more painkillers, so the doctors and the pharmaceutical companies can make a lot of money without any legal consequences. As a result, more than 70000 people in the United States die from drug overdose every year.One of the most notorious pharmaceutical companies is Purdue pharma. Oxycontin, the Opium painkiller produced by the family, has caused numerous people to become addicted to opium. The Sackler family, the founder of Purdue pharmaceutical, used a small part of the money they earned from drug trafficking to buy cultural relics and donate them to museums, so as to turn themselves into cultural philanthropists. There is also a secler Museum of Archaeology and art in Peking University. I also know the granddaughter of the seclerian family, who have been active in the upper classes of New York.Another example is the legalization of usury. The Chinese government stipulates that loans with interest rates over 15.4% are usury. However, local laws in Taiwan Province of China stipulate that the maximum interest rate of loans should not exceed 20%. In the United States, when you go to any big store, or even when you pay online, businesses will ask whether you want to apply for a ""credit card"" to borrow money and spend ahead of time. The interest rates of these credit cards are all around 25%. If various ""handling charges"" and ""fines"" are included, the actual interest rate will be higher. According to China's standards, there is no doubt that there is a proper usury. As you know, Americans can't add, subtract, multiply, and divide, let alone index interest. Therefore, these businesses first bombard with advertisements to promote consumerism and stimulate the desire of ordinary people to consume. Then, they downplayed the interest rate of usury, or deliberately misled them, saying that ""only 50 dollars a month"" was paid, which made many Americans who were poor in mathematics fall into the trap of usury and the abyss of bankruptcy.Another way for the United States to abuse power for personal gain is to outlaw what is reasonable. This is the most secretive form of corruption in the United States. In detail, in the name of protecting the people, protecting the environment, and protecting culture, the legislation establishes extremely strict rules and regulations for all walks of life to eliminate market competition, so that the monopoly interest groups controlled by a small number of white and Jewish people in Western Europe can obtain hundreds of times of profits permanently and legally.Limited by space, I would like to give only one example here, that is, medical care in the United States. The medical industry in the United States is the largest interest group in the United States. At present, about 18% of GDP in the United States is spent on medical care, which is the highest in developed countries, while the medical level in the United States is the lowest in developed countries. The life expectancy and other indicators of the United States are similar to those of developing countries such as Lebanon, Cuba and Turkey. In contrast, China's medical expenditure accounts for less than 7% of GDP, and the per capita medical expenditure is about one tenth of that of the United States, but life expectancy is only about one year lower than that of the United States, and is still rising.Why is it like this? Because the United States through a variety of stringent legislation, artificially create scarcity and monopoly, so that the medical system can obtain huge profits. First of all, through the ""prescription drug system"", so that patients can not take their own medicine when they are sick, they can only go to the hospital. I remember when I was a child with an inflammation of my throat. My parents went to the drugstore downstairs and bought me a bottle of antibiotics for a few yuan, and I was cured. After I arrived in the United States, I had a sore throat and needed to take half a day off. I was waiting in the clinic for a few hours. The doctor talked to me for about 30 seconds and prescribed 10 identical Chinese penicillins. For this bottle of antibiotics, I have to spend hundreds of dollars on medical expenses, including about 1000 dollars of work lost in half a day. My throat was inflamed once, and I lost 10000 yuan.Ironically, the U.S. animal husbandry industry is seriously abusing antibiotics. In order to make the cattle and sheep less sick, the livestock farmers add antibiotics to the feed every time they feed. So there is a magical phenomenon in the United States. Now in the United States, animals take antibiotics every meal, whether they are sick or not. Even if human beings are terminally ill, they cannot buy antibiotics without doctors. What's more, I'm now in the United States, where I can buy marijuana at will, but I can't do anything about antibiotics.Corresponding to the strict prescription drug system is the strict control of prescription right and the shortage of manufacturing. In the United States, if an ordinary person wants to become a medical practitioner and get the prescription right, he really has to go through 9981 difficulties. In China, the college entrance examination is directly applied for medical undergraduate and master's degree. After five years, you can go to many hospitals to become a doctor after taking the certificate of practice. In the United States, to become a medical practitioner, you must have a medical doctor's degree. To apply for a doctor of medicine, you must have an undergraduate degree. But there is no medical education in all American universities. So you have to waste four years of your undergraduate education and get an undergraduate degree in chemistry or biology. And then it takes another four years to get a medical doctor's degree. You still don't have the prescription right at this time. It takes you three to eight years to become an intern to get prescription rights. That is to say, from the time you graduate from high school, even if you didn't choose the wrong major and didn't leave school to prepare for the exam, you also found a internship position with only three years, and it would take you at least 11 years to get the prescription right.Moreover, in order to reduce the number of doctors, the United States deliberately controls the number of medical school admissions. In the past 20 years, the population of the United States has increased by tens of millions. As a result, only about 90000 medical students are recruited each year. Compared with the number of medical students in China, the number of medical students per capita is about two times that of the United States.Corresponding to the difficulty of becoming a doctor in the United States, it is forbidden for Chinese to practice medicine. Even if you are an attending physician in a top three hospital, you cannot legally practice in the United States. (a lot of discrimination is implicit. Every year, a very small number of Chinese doctors can apply to the United States for internship, so don't use it.) However, in the United States, Chinese people are forbidden to apply for medical doctorates. (Chinese people can apply for PhD in medical school, but those with prescription right can't apply. Not only Chinese applicants, but also many Chinese who have green cards will suffer from a lot of hidden racial discrimination.)Therefore, the United States through this layer upon layer of sophisticated system design, deliberately create a shortage, all Americans as hostages, any pain can only be treated with a huge amount of money. Let medical interest groups make a lot of money.When you see this, you may ask, don't experts say that American democracy has the function of error correction? Will there be less and less corruption in the United States? I can say for sure: absolutely not. Corruption in the United States will only get worse.Western democracy is not a panacea. In the final analysis, western democracy is the common decision-making of citizens. Democratic government represents neither justice nor honesty. When 78% of Americans think China is responsible for the outbreak of the new crown, it is hard to say that there is any link between democracy and justice in the United States. When the vast majority of Americans are poor in logic and mathematics, the United States will never be able to solve the problem of corruption in the United States.The root cause of American style corruption is actually this kind of democratic system in the United States. I call it the ""fool democracy"".That's a bit abstract. Let me give you a few examples. Suppose I run for Congress and say, ""I support issuing green cards to doctors in China's top three hospitals, so that they can come to the United States to practice and reduce the cost of medical treatment in the United States."" My opponents will incite racist prejudice against China by bombing the media: ""doctors in backward countries like China can treat Americans. Are you a Chinese spy who puts American health at nothing?""If I say, ""I support the abolition of Harvard's discriminatory admission system, students must be admitted according to uniform examination results."" The other side would bombard me with media: ""do you not support the all-round development of students? Do you want all Americans to be able to only get high marks and low abilities in exams? ""So my campaign for Congress ended.For another example, if I run for mayor of New York City and say, ""I support lifting the airbnb short-term apartment restrictions in New York City."" Opponents will attack me: ""do you want people to rent their houses to foreign tourists, so that local people have no room to live in!""If I say: ""I want to free up the restrictions of the New York City Housing Authority, so that small developers and even small landlords can participate in the housing construction, rather than being monopolized by big developers like Trump. This willincrease the number and quality of New York's homes and lower house prices. "" My opponent would say, ""you want to let go of the Housing Authority restrictions. Are you going to let New Yorkers live in coffin houses like Hong Kong? Can we New Yorkers live in decent homes? ""So my campaign for mayor of New York ended.As you can see, under this kind of covert American corruption, the correct policies I put forward to benefit the people are not intuitive and can only be reached through reasoning. My opponent's attack on me, though wrong, was direct and inflammatory. And the level of American voters is very low. As a result, even if the United States can produce a smart and kind-hearted candidate like me, he will surely lose the election and even be criticized as a disgrace and social death.I've been in the United States for eight years, and I've focused on American politics. There is no politician who talks about the root causes of corruption in the United States and tries to solve the fundamental problems of the United States. Yes, none of them.No matter how hostile they may be to each other on the surface, the two parties in the United States are actually keen to avoid corruption in the United States. Instead, they discuss all kinds of irrelevant topics, and even incite racial and ideological antagonism to divert attention.For example, the legalization of marijuana, transgender access to women's toilets and so on. It's a very inflammatory and meaningless issue. For example, when it comes to the rotten medical system in the United States, the two parties in the United States never discuss the fundamental issue of eradicating medical monopoly interest groups, but rather discuss such irrelevant topics as medical insurance and universal health insurance. People who have a little bit of common sense of probability know that when you buy health insurance, your expected expenditure (average expenditure) on health care actually increases instead of falling. Discussing whether the insurance is not insured and who pays the insurance premium cannot fundamentally solve the medical problems in the United States. But many Americans are poor at math and can't understand it at all.For example, trump advocates Anti China and anti yellow race racism. Those white fascists at the bottom poured out all their feelings of revenge on the Chinese and the yellow race because of corruption and poverty. All kinds of racist attacks against Chinese increased sharply. Naturally, the Chinese in the United States can't pay attention to the corruption problem in the United States. We're all going to the concentration camp and shower, so we don't have the leisure to care about the future of the United States.Another example is that the two parties in the United States incite ideological confrontation. The two parties in the United States like to pretend that their conflict is an ideological conflict between socialism and capitalism. (in the American context, ""capitalism"" is used as a synonym for free market economy.) In fact, the social and economic system of the United States is Indian style, which increases the monopoly economy of enterprises, and is not related to socialism and market economy. As soon as the Democratic mayor of New York and governor of California came to power, in the name of anti capitalism, they banned Uber mobile phone taxis in the West and airbnb short-term apartments in the East. The housing environment, city appearance and public order of San Francisco Bay area and New York City are deteriorating year by year, but house prices are rising year by year. As soon as trump of the Republican Party came to power, he claimed to reduce state control and improve economic freedom. In fact, none of the Democratic Party's evil laws were abolished, but he reversed hands to liberalize usury, and allowed large companies to pollute the environment without punishment. The Democratic progressives, such as Sanders, Warren and AOC, who seem to be a little bit anti system, will only talk about the solution of increasing taxes on the rich rather than the root cause.Thus, the Republican Party came to power and legalized killing people and stealing goods. The Democratic Party came to power and legislated in the name of social justice, blocking the rising space of the bottom of the society and expanding the monopoly capital. The corruption in the United States is increasing day by day between the rotation of political parties.You may ask, is this American style corruption less harmful than direct corruption? On the contrary, American style corruption does more harm to society than direct corruption.I put forward a theorem here: most of the time, the harm of direct corruption to society will not exceed the sum of the profits of bribers and bribers. (Li Xinye's first sociological theorem) because when bribers and bribers don't need to camouflage the behavior of power and money transactions, they have no motivation to do more accidents to harm others.For example, suppose an official and a businessman conspired to embezzle state-owned assets during the restructuring of state-owned enterprises. Businessmen bribed 50 million yuan and embezzled 100 million yuan of state-owned assets. Then the officials will make a profit of 50 million and the businessmen will make a profit of 50 million. The state lost 100 million yuan. At this point, the two are equal.Let's take another example, hypothesis (just hypothesis!) I had a sore throat in the United States, bribed a pharmacist for $100 and got antibiotics without a prescription. I was cured. At this time, because I didn't have to pay the doctor and I didn't miss work, I made a profit of $1200 and a pharmacist made $100. And there is actually no harm to society. In fact, I didn't have to queue up in the hospital for an afternoon because I didn't have to. I can work half a day longer and pay hundreds of dollars more tax to the U.S. government, which is actually beneficial to the society.American style corruption is not the same. In order to improve the bewilderment of the public, American style corruption distorts the market through various kinds of evil laws, resulting in idleness and waste of the whole society. The harm to society far exceeds the profit of monopoly capital. Let's take American Medical as an example. If those hospitals are directly corrupt and receive huge state subsidies to enrich their own pockets, the harm to the country will be limited. Now, in order to deceive the American people, the medical system has distorted the entire medical industry in the United States: more than 300 million Americans are difficult and expensive to see a doctor, and many talents are unable to practice medicine. This kind of American style corruption causes waste of social resources and harms the society far more than the profits of the interest group itself.The above-mentioned example that direct corruption may be beneficial to the society also explains why the United States has suppressed direct corruption so seriously. Because for the white Jewish ruling class in the United States, it can legally corrupt and obtain huge profits. Under the evil law, direct corruption is actually taking the cake of interest groups. Therefore, the entire ruling class in the United States is extremely hostile to direct corruption, and we must eliminate it quickly. The sikler family's Purdue, which poisons Americans, is still a member of the upper class. When Mexico and Central America are selling drugs to the United States, the United States brazenly launched the so-called drug war. Mexicans should not be allowed to rob their drug trafficking business. However, several Chinese synthesized fentanyl drugs and wanted to take a share of it, which was written by trump in his denunciation of launching a trade war and a scientific and technological war against all Chinese people.Almost all industries in the United States are extremely inefficient and uncompetitive because of various kinds of bad laws. The only bright spot in the U.S. science and technology industry is actually because it is an emerging industry and has not been eroded by American style corruption. In fact, the root cause of the decline in the U.S. manufacturing industry is not because of the high wages in the United States, but because there are too many bad laws in the United States, which are hard to return and the bad business environment. Although labor is expensive in the United States, its land is cheap and its electricity consumption is also cheap. It is close to the terminal market. In fact, the labor cost has been offset. Entrepreneurs such as Cao Dewang and Guo Taiming did not understand the situation of the United States. They calculated their accounts and found it profitable to open factories in the United States. After a few years of trying to invest in the United States, they all failed.When I understood all this, I was desperate for the future of America. This system of the United States ranks first in the world in maintaining stability and brainwashing people. Therefore, it is estimated that the United States will not be able to cause chaos. But in this extremely bad business environment, the U.S. economic recession, from the world's first position is also an inevitable thing. I am in the United States, has been ready for the continued decline of the United States, was overtaken by domestic students, ridicule psychological preparation. Just like those who sold their houses on Huaihai Road in Shanghai in the 1980s and immigrated to the United States. I hope that other Chinese Americans can adjust their mentality, face the reality and live hard.",0 followers,Hatice Aslan,570,164,11.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-modern-day-advanced-technologies-will-be-considered-ridiculously-primative-in-100-years-time

While some do and have, not many land based snipers get taken down. They study the opposition’s habits, tools, techniques and technologies (weapons). So to does the U.S. Submarine Service.From hiding under a thermocline to going from rigged for Patrol Quiet to rigged for Ultra Quiet, we would do our best to look like another part of the ocean. We didn’t want them to be looking for a needle in a haystack; we wanted them to try finding a specific needle in a huge stack of needles. Because the ocean is a very big place.Proof of that is those two relatively recent commercial airliners. They are being very difficult to find, even with some very sophisticated undersea detection methods. And those items are stationary right now; they aren’t on the move trying to sneak away the way we would be.","91,606 followers",Roland Bartetzko,6.4K,3.4K,314.6M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Which-modern-day-advanced-technologies-will-be-considered-ridiculously-primative-in-100-years-time
26,"There are anti-weapons to everything/ a military solution for every weapon that an army have. That's why we spend so much money researching for the next big weapon that won't have a countermeasure prepared by the enemy in time. Hence, despite its vulnerability, a submarine still serves many important roles such as gathering information or a missile platform.Although there are submarine detectionThere are anti-weapons to everything/ a military solution for every weapon that an army have.

27,"Weapon designers not only find new technologies to weaponise, they work on countermeasures: anti this and anti that.  Submarines keep becoming more stealthy with quieter cavitation from their propellers, the ability to run silent and deep.  Sea water is also a very layered thermal environment with moving water going in eddies, swirls, currents and distinct temperature gradients and variations at various depths.  Add in turbidity and different concentrations of salt and it all makes for a jumble for sensors to sort through.There are many sophisticated sensory arrays for tracking submarines.Weapon designers not only find new technologies to weaponise, they work on countermeasures: anti this and anti that.

Add in turbidity and different concentrations of salt and it all makes for a jumble for sensors to sort through.There are many sophisticated sensory arrays for tracking submarines.  Putting it all together in a database and running the algorithms through to make sense out of the scatter is the nifty engineering, software and mathematics trick. As both the submarines develop new countermeasures to defeat the tracking sensors, and sensors and their applications become more sophisticated to create an active realtime picture of the marine environment in which they are operating, it remains a ""cat and mouse"" game with a degree of practical ""educated guesses"" thrown in by experienced sonar men in the subs and the tactical officers on the bridges of the vessels trying to defeat them.So long as both sides of this equation can keep throwing in variables that have to be sorted out and calculated into the algorithms which can tell if its a school of fish or a mini-sub from the DPRK, good practical seamanship and the experience that comes from it provide the edge in this constantly changing underwater environment.",0 followers,John Carlton,567,3.8K,9.5M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Which-modern-day-advanced-technologies-will-be-considered-ridiculously-primative-in-100-years-time
28,"Any war machine can be detected and destroyedThe most effective way to detect submarines is using sound, and to destroy them is using torpedoes, both of which have a relatively short range. In contrast, submarines can attack aircraft tens to hundreds of kilometers, and land and ships thousands of kilometers away from them using missiles and satellite intel (they themselves cannot be detected by satellites unless they are surfaced) .Of all the powerful war machines,Any war machine can be detected and destroyedThe most effective way to detect submarines is using sound, and to destroy them is using torpedoes, both of which have a relatively short range.

30,"Why didn't submarine become obsolete when there are advanced technology to helps enemy to detect them and handle such threat - anti submarine weapon?The detection range against submarines is much shorter than the detection range against surface vessels. Typically, the submarine will know that the surface vessels are in the area long before the surface vessel detects the submarine. The surface vessel's best detection tool against a submarine is active sonar, which is a dead giveaway that somebody's hunting subs.
