1,"Firstly a bit of context; the United States’ longest range air-to-air missile is the AIM-120D, which has a range somewhere in the region of 100nmi (~185km), with the exact maximum range being classified for obvious reasons, as well as dependent on the airspeed and altitude it’s launched.Above: An AIM-120C (externally identical to the AIM-120D) on the wingtip rail of an F-16C, with an AIM-9 on a pylon below it.Russia’s longest ranged air-to-air missile is the R-37, which has a range of potentially as far as 400km. This missile however is nearly 4x heavier than the AIM-120 and is not really desiFirstly a bit of context; the United States’ longest range air-to-air missile is the AIM-120D, which has a range somewhere in the region of 100nmi (~185km), with the exact maximum range being classified for obvious reasons, as well as dependent on the airspeed and altitude it’s launched.Above: An AIM-120C (externally identical to the AIM-120D) on the wingtip rail of an F-16C, with an AIM-9 on a pylon below it.Russia’s longest ranged air-to-air missile is the R-37, which has a range of potentially as far as 400km. This missile however is nearly 4x heavier than the AIM-120 and is not really designed to intercept fighter aircraft or cruise missiles; instead it’s designed to go after large, sluggish aircraft like AWACS and tankers. Russia’s longest-ranged air-to-air missile thatAbove: A MiG-31 carrying long-range R-37s under its fuselage, medium-range R-77s on the inner wing pylons, and R-73 short-range missiles on the outer wing pylons.China is similar, with a very long ranged air-to-air missile sometimes referred to as the PL-21, or PL-XX, or just VLRAAM; this missile is long and slender, but like the R-37, is only designed for taking out larger and more sluggish targets; this missile is new and is likely only still in development currently, but will likely be fielded fairly rapidly, as enemy tankers are a high priority target for China. China however has also fielded a missile called the PL-15, which is similar to the AIM-120D, but is a little bit thicker and uses a dual-pulse (vs boost-only on the AIM-120D) rocket motor to achieve a range that’s claimed to exceed 300km.Above: The PL-21 / PL-XX / VLRAAM.So why has the United States not kept up?For one thing, the US doesn’t have much need for an R-37 / PL-21 equivalent; neither China nor Russia operate anywhere near as many tankers and AWACS as the United States, and what ones they do operate can just be handled by the large number of stealth fighters that the US operates (the USAF alone now operates more than 400 F-22s and F-35s).As for the PL-15 vs AIM-120D; the US has constantly been working on new air-to-air missile technologies through programs such as JDRADM, NGM, T-3 and LREW, but not decided to fund an AIM-120 replacement until recently, simply because the PL-15 didn’t exist until recently and the newer AIM-120 variants were enough to exceed the capabilities of the Russian R-77 and Chinese PL-12.Now that the PL-15 has appeared on the scene, the US has flipped a switch and is rapidly testing and fielding the AIM-260 JATM air-to-air missile, which will replace the AIM-120. Not much is known about the AIM-260 (it’s being kept fairly classified for now), but it’s not air-breathing like the Meteor and will still fit the same bounding volume as an AIM-120D so that it can fit inside the F-22 and F-35, and yet will have a notably longer range than the AIM-120D (how much longer is classified).Despite only being announced last year (in 2019), the AIM-260 will begin flight-testing next year in 2021 and is slated to enter service in 2022, with the F-22 and Super Hornet being the first two aircraft types to have it integrated (other aircraft like the F-35 will get it soon afterwards).",223 followers,James Smith,511,670,6.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Russia-continue-technical-collaboration-in-aircraft-technology-with-China-Why-do-they-not-realize-that-soon-China-will-replace-Russia-in-fighter-aircraft-export
2,"One thing to remember about US weapon and aviation designs…There’s a large difference between what’s prototyped and tested in the US vs. what’s actually flown by the military. There’s always prototypes being thought up, tested, and sometimes scrapped by various US companies—both in accord with a military requirement and for commercial or international markets.Even when the US manufacturers have a government request, the government typically puts out a set of requirements and requests and invites everyone to come show them what they got…Here are the YF-16 and YF-17 prototypes.The YF-16 won andOne thing to remember about US weapon and aviation designs…There’s a large difference between what’s prototyped and tested in the US vs. what’s actually flown by the military.

Because there’s usually more “depth” to the field in terms of fielded types than many other forces, they often don’t try to eke out the maximum of a type and don’t do much with canards.Other than this big old bastard that was only a prototype…..and this thing that was a prototype……another prototype which I’m not sure even flew without being tethered.So, I guess the point is, the US producers and military are not averse to the idea, just haven’t found any aircraft ready to adopt that really have them as a key feature at this point.","1,451 followers",Jacob Baumgardner,774,295,9.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Russia-continue-technical-collaboration-in-aircraft-technology-with-China-Why-do-they-not-realize-that-soon-China-will-replace-Russia-in-fighter-aircraft-export

China doesn’t use guns and planes and brute force like Russia or US love to do, but that doesn’t mean it is weak or indecisive.There is also some sort of “old father” feeling. Modern China is like a mighty and successful son of now-frail Russia (USSR). When China was in poverty and devastation, we helped them with engineers and teachers and machines despite also being devastated (“Russian and Chinese are brothers forever” - USSR slogan from 1949). Chinese were wiser, and they didn’t let their country collapse. China is now powerful, and we Russians see a bit of our legacy in it (while main reason was of course Chinese people and government).Now Russia turns to China once again. While there are fears of crippling annexation of the Far East, i think they are ungrounded. If China is allowed to have a buisness there, why would they do something stupid like invasion? Their mentality differs from American and to some extent Russian, Chinese people don’t value brute military force as Russia and US.And if i were to choose whom i want to see as world leader, i would pick China. Just because millennia-old civilisation is wiser that 300 years old nation of gung-ho adventurers.(I admit there is a charm in American mentality, but they are too aggressive and power-hungry to rule the world, Chinese are more balanced)Also Chinese and Russians prefer tea to coffee, and Russia got its tea-drinking culture from China.

The F-35 is also being made in large numbers. At the moment, the USA has more F-35’s than all the stealth fighters in China and Russia combined.

Let’s run through a watered-down synopsis, though warning — even the brief version is somewhat long.Early History (1900–1940s):Mikhail Borodin, Soviet adviser to the fledgling Republic of ChinaMemorial to the Soviet Volunteers GroupTurbulence (1950s—1970s):Destruction of Buddhist temples during the Cultural RevolutionRecovery (1980s—2000s):Renewal (Post 2000s):China is grown and mature now, but she still remembers Russia as 'big bro' — he was the first to help China reclaim her family estate, the first the help China stand on her own two feet, the first to pioneer the techniques that China went on experimenting with. Without Russia’s example and Russia’s help, China would never be the big girl she was today.Just where did they go wrong? Perhaps it was time to re-evaluate their relationship?Perhaps they could be more than just 'friends'?Today:Conclusion:China's is Russia's career-oriented, independent girlfriend — able to keep the home running smoothly and efficiently.Russia is China's adventurous, body-builder boyfriend — able to reach out into the unknown and challenge any and all threats.The two have a turbulent relationship behind them, with many memories and lessons to share.They could gain so much by working alongside each other, as they fill each others’ weaknesses almost to perfection.Yet both of them have lingering commitment issues… and just can't seem to settle down together.…It doesn't help that both wants to be on top.But then — unlike the lopsided, US-led NATO alliance where power flows only one way — Russia and China exhibit far better traits for a healthy, lasting relationship:Mutual respect for each others’ priorities, plus different perspectives that plug each others’ blind spots.Anyone who studied marriage can see: there is true potential here. If only the two could work it out.FootnoteRussia and China would do well to remember the words of Halford Mackinder:“Who rules the Heartland commands the World-Island; who rules the World-Island commands the world.""The Heartland theory is deeply flawed and I can poke holes in all day, but it nevertheless highlights an important point for this relationship.
