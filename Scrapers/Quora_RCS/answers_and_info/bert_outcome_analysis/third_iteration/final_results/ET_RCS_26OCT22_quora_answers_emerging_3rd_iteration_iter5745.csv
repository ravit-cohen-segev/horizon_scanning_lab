1,"Yes and no.The Yes comes in the form of the business model of gaming. Creating AAA games is just becoming obscenely expensive, and those costs aren’t going to go down. This means that game studios rely on investors and publishing houses in order to make money.(One of the biggest publishing houses out there.)However, this means that the game HAS to make tons of money. They can’t just break even on the game because if they do, they’ve actually lost money. They have to pay back the investors, and the publishing house takes a cut as well. So, if a studio spends 150 million dollars to make a game (Yes and no.The Yes comes in the form of the business model of gaming. Creating AAA games is just becoming obscenely expensive, and those costs aren’t going to go down. This means that game studios rely on investors and publishing houses in order to make money.(One of the biggest publishing houses out there.)However, this means that the game HAS to make tons of money. They can’t just break even on the game because if they do, they’ve actually lost money. They have to pay back the investors, and the publishing house takes a cut as well. So, if a studio spends 150 million dollars to make a game (that’s an obscene amount, but games are definitely reaching this point, if they haven’t already surpassed it), they need to at least double it in order to make any money.And because they NEED to make money, they rely on following formulas that work. This is why so many games these days feel the same. Because the last time the game came out, with a different title, it sold exceptionally well. One of the most well known culprits of this is the Call of Duty franchise.Of course, sports games are the same, but for a slightly different reason. The games themselves, in real life, don’t change much aside from team rosters. This means that the games can only innovate by adding new mechanics or refining older mechanics so they feel better than they used to. But with Call of Duty, the very “samey” feeling, with slight changes, is very much intentional. They know they’re gonna make money, so why rock the boat and risk having to lay off a ton of their staff?This need to make money also plays into micro-transactions. When a game comes out and only costs 60$, and that price has stayed stagnant for decades, while the price of making the games has gone up, they need to sell MORE copies in order to make money. Of course, that means that the player base needs to expand drastically, and unfortunately it does not. So, to make up for the losses, they add micro-transactions. In-game purchases that allow the companies to continue making money off the game while they develop the next one.(They could just cut the salaries of the highest team members like the CEO, COO, CFO, and so on, but why would those fat cats do that when they can just rely on the ignorance of the masses and blame the devs, subsequently firing them and being able to keep those fat paychecks?)The no comes in from exactly everything I just said. Games are getting better and better as time goes on, seriously go try to play some NES or Atari games and realize how shit they were.The controls are always wonky and barely responsive. The hitboxes for deaths are rarely super accurate. Mechanics need to be timed EXACTLY or you’ll fail to grab the rope over the pit and fall and die.There were no game design principles being followed. There was no concept of what makes a good video game. Any singular idea that a dev had could be made relatively cheaply and they were pumped out en masse without any thought about making them good.But nowadays, we have exceptional graphics, great gameplay mechanics that could blow your mind.(Prey 2017)The Videogame industry is not going down hill. But it does have some problems to sort out, which unfortunately I can’t see ever happening.","7,456 followers",Ben Minch,1.1K,3.4K,62.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-see-emerging-technologies-changing-the-video-game-industry
