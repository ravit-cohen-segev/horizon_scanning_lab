5,"It’s the 24th century, and a new form of transportation has been invented, and after initial testing, is now widely available to the public, including young families.This new technology is called “Jaunting,” and is a form of instantaneous transportation that allows people to teleport anywhere in the Solar System. With this revolutionary technology, humans have successfully colonized the entire Solar System, allowing them to travel from Earth to Mars, to back again with relative ease. What once would have taken years to travel to, can now be achieved in a matter of seconds.Sounds easy-peasy rigIt’s the 24th century, and a new form of transportation has been invented, and after initial testing, is now widely available to the public, including young families.This new technology is called “Jaunting,” and is a form of instantaneous transportation that allows people to teleport anywhere in the Solar System. With this revolutionary technology, humans have successfully colonized the entire Solar System, allowing them to travel from Earth to Mars, to back again with relative ease. What once would have taken years to travel to, can now be achieved in a matter of seconds.Sounds easy-peasy right?Well there is a catch, of course!YouIf you are conscious while Jaunting, you will go insane, your consciousness doomed to an eternity of oblivion.Imagine being left to only your thoughts, in an endless field of white, for what would feel like billions of years, your sanity slowly disintegrating and mind starting to auto-cannibalize itself.“How long in there, in terms of years? 0.000000000067 seconds for the body to Jaunt, but how long for the unparticulated consciousness? A hundred years? A thousand? A million? A billion? How long alone with your thoughts in an endless field of white? And then, when a billion eternities have passed, the crashing return of light and form and body. Who wouldn't go insane?”For this reason, every person who goes under the Jaunt must be asleep and unconscious. The solution to this is to put everyone under general anesthesia before take-off.But what happens to the poor unfortunate souls who don’t go to sleep? Here is what happened to little Ricky, who held his breath while the attendants administered the anesthesia.The thing that had been his son bounced and writhed on its Jaunt couch, a twelve-year old boy with a snow-white fall of hair and eyes which were incredibly ancient, the corneas gone a sickly yellow. Here was a creature older than time masquerading as a boy; and yet it bounced and writhed with a kind of horrid, obscene glee, and at its choked, lunatic cackles the Jaunt attendants drew back in terror. Some of them fled, although they had been trained to cope with just such an unthinkable eventuality. The old-young legs twitched and quivered. Claw hands beat and twisted and danced on the air; abruptly they descended and the thing that had been his son began to claw at its face. ""Longer than you think, Dad!"" it cackled. ""Longer than you think! Held my breath when they gave me the gas! Wanted to see! I saw! I saw! Longer than you think!"" Cackling and screeching, the thing on the Jaunt couch suddenly clawed its own eyes out. Blood gouted. The recovery room was an aviary of screaming voices now. ""Longer than you think, Dad! I saw! I saw! Long Jaunt! Longer than you think-""It said other things before the Jaunt attendants were finally able to bear it away, rolling its couch swiftly away as it screamed and clawed at the eyes that had seen the unseeable forever and ever; it said other things, and then it began to scream, but Mark Oates didn't hear it because by then he was screaming himself.So remember kids, always go to sleep, so you don’t turn into a creep.In all seriousness, this is probably one of the creepiest technologies available because it combines my 2 biggest fears:It just seems so tempting too. It’s like the elephant game. Tell someone not to think of an elephant. Then they probably automatically think of elephants! Same theory goes with Jaunting, I am sure after being told not to be awake during Jaunting only helped to increase Ricky’s curiosity. And I can relate to that.Also, the Jaunt technology opens up all sorts of sinister possibilities. The Jaunt is purported to have been used by tinpot dictators to get rid of political dissidents, and imagine if someone with connections kicked you awake into a Jaunt portal, while closing up the other exit, leaving you screaming in limbo for eternity….Anyways, I got a flight to catch, see you on the other side of Io, loser.The Jaunt - Stephen King (large text for mobile).pdf",0 followers,Tamara M,2.1K,101,14.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-science-fiction-technologies-are-most-feasible-within-the-next-100-years

Technology revolutionizes our daily lives and there are several technology trends that will help you in the years to come, and which should be known. So let's find out exactly what Technology Trends related to this technology that will improve standard of communication and improve on standard of living in Cities and daily lives brought on from enhanced research and development and education with 5G and related technology;1. Artificial IntelligenceAI is about all intelligent machines that will artificially act like talking, reading, watching, recognizing things and emotions like humans. Using algorithms and code, the machine can perform tasks that are very burdensome for us. And that too with accuracy and efficiency. AI began to be used well everywhere from health services to banking. It can be used on gadgets too. Various voice assistants such as Google Assistant are operated by Artificial Intelligence (AI).Today, many researchers and companies will work in this region to really help us in our daily lives. AI has created possibilities in specific ways , in areas as AI in health services .2. Machine Learning, Robotic and mechatronic applicationTrends in Machine Learning technologyAnother interesting and emerging technology is machine learning. This is an integral part of AI, which can be a machine's ability to understand, analyze, and track itself. In other words, placing skills to be understood in machines or computers is Machine Learning, which offers the ability to know data. That's possible through algorithms.The possibility of hand held device might come out with diagnostic models due to fast data processing allowing AI to be integrated in such areas will see faster and even accurate option of better healthcare or even or in most areas of application that requires computing solution that can be provide thru high speed data acquisition and computation allowing for better developed software to make use dedicated equipment able to acquire data acquisition to enable higher response rate and data processing( available on googleplay and Amazon kindle - AppleIbook - Dwayne Anderson )3. IoTInternet of Things technology trendsIoT is one of the fastest growing technologies in recent years. ""Internet of Things"" is just a concept or concept through which all smart devices can connect to each other using the internet.The Internet of Things is a network that uses applications, electronics, and the internet to really help connect devices, gadgets, or equipment to each other. Once they are connected, they can communicate and exchange information. Radio frequency identification (RFID), sensors, wireless, and QR codes are IoT applications. Similarly, AI and Machine Learning will also be connected with thinking about the Internet.If you are aware of Smart Homes and Home Automation, IoT is the main idea behind the device and the type of equipment that makes your home Smart.Smarter cities will then include integration of smarter facilities and also smart homes into a smart digital hub for everybody to live , work and play4. Augmented RealityAR is increasingly being applied today. Already used in various activities including art, entertainment, trade, education and the army. And also available on your own smart device. Augmented Reality (AR) improves user experience with sound overlays, videos, graphics, etc. On the real things. Unlike VR, AR develops the facts by enveloping digital elements on it which could act as interactive sensor that allow data manipulation and communicationThe Augmented Reality application is growing rapidly. It is important to realize that it has an extraordinary ability to change our perception of humans.AR is also used in industries such as health, public safety, tourism and many other industries5. 5G Technology5G is the next generation mobile network technology that will provide much faster speed than today's 4G LTE network .there are 2 major manufacturer namely Nokia and Huawei both working and competing for '5G First'. Similarly, phone manufacturers focus on devices prepared for 5G. However, 5G technology may be commercially available in 2020, but has Huawei has push and started launching in China and in the UK when recently USA started tariff related trade war with CHINA , and was try to put up technological restraint especially on HuaweiWorld Gone mobile with 5 G mobile for SmartphoneThe trend of mobile technology in 2019 is much more excited than the previous year. However, in 2018 many new concepts and things related to the latest mobile technology emerged. We started talking about 5G technology and eSIM. Similarly, some phones come with a wave of multiple cameras on the back, front unlocking and top-notch screen on the smartphone.Yes, it is true that the 5G wave has spread in the smartphone market. In addition, network companies have begun to think about the release of 5G. Although it will take more time, it may be up to 2020, but the focus of phone manufacturers is on this. And the next phones can be released this year with 5G compatibility. One of Samsung's main mobile phones has announced its 5G phone model: Galaxy S10 5G.Not all, but some of us can enjoy 5G speed smartphones. The reason behind this limitation is the execution of 5G. It seems that in 2019, 5G can only be implemented in some states of the world.","135,499 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-science-fiction-technologies-are-most-feasible-within-the-next-100-years

He taught himself programming from about age 12. His early fortune in what became PayPal was built on those skills, along with tenacity and business sense, and an understanding of a relatively new networking technology that would make PayPal viable, i.e., Secure Socket Layer (SSL). SSL has its roots in public key encryption (PKE), which by that time had matured for a couple of decades. It would be interesting to know what exactly caused Musk to drop the Physics Ph.D. program at Stanford after being there for only two days, and instead plunge into the niche of software that became PayPal. The answer is likely to evolve around emerging technology and opportunity; this combination usually has a limited time window. So while he did not hold a degree in computer science, something told him that the time was ripe to capitalize on this particular technology.","2,465 followers",George Zaharoff,2.2K,163,11.5M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-science-fiction-technologies-are-most-feasible-within-the-next-100-years

So the chance that you will find an investor is basically zero, which is part of the reason why SpaceX started as a private company.You will also have to pay staffers, offices, berthing, launch costs,… and that will add up. Even Elon himself as an established millionaire already well off from PayPal struggled at first with SpaceX, and at one point it was near bankruptcy.Companies the likes of SpaceX requires highly skilled personnel, and for a project this ambitious, you can’t do it alone, either, even if you’re the best god-damn aerospace engineer on the planet, you will still need an impressive team to get from concept to a working rocket.Which exacerbate the problem: With the salary of a rocket engineer, combined with the zero interest investors would have over a rocket company, you’re not going anywhere nice trying to open one.The second thing is that rocket engineers -In the beginning, theYou as a SpaceX staffer would be very demoralised from how your works keep on exploding and the company was rolling closer and closer to an ultimate demise - something that the medias and naysayers have been predicting for a long time.Rocket engineers will not have the tenacity nor the charisma to keep staffers motivated, hell, they’ll even give up the entire project at that point.Elon was betting his net worth after a series of failures before theNormal people wouldn’t evenOnly this guy did.And from what we have seen, it had paid off.

We should really focus on extending life by many years it's a complete and utter waste of time to tinker with the small details. Looking at an extension of one month is kind of like saying are you going to go on holiday for one month or two? It's just not enough to really be worthy of significant discussion the key here is to extend life by many years and set the goal is high but at a level which is achievable.People need to look at the situation and realise that aging is extremely bad for people! Not only is it a cause of suffering it is degrading to people who feel they are dependent on others for their basic day to day needs. I had an aunt who died at 85 a few years ago who started having falls, then she got trapped in the bath for 7 hours, after this she was OK for a few months then fell again and became hospitalized and was transferred to a nursing home where she could not deal with even her basic hygiene requirements. Mentally she was 100% competent right to the end so the question has to be asked can this be right when millions of old people are in this position and we are close to being able to intervene and do something about it? The answer to this is clearly we need to do what we can because sick elderly people are extremely costly to governments and obviously by extension tax payers and therefore keeping them active and well will be an extremely cost-effective route, not only that but many countries such as Japan which have a falling population and the number of people available for work is rapidly declining if you were fit and healthy for decades there would be no reason to retire. If people do not suffer the declining years of old age, healthcare and the economy will benefit very significantly from a situation where aging becomes a manageable condition.So in essence my answer to Gary is shoot much higher for a much bigger and more substantial outcome and let's aim to resolve the nightmare of aging without worrying about a month or two here and there.","220,549 followers",Franklin Veaux,628,47.3K,782.4M,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-science-fiction-technologies-are-most-feasible-within-the-next-100-years

I think the truth of demographics indicate that there will be financial incentive for more investment from both medicine and technology in gerontology. A key question is whether society will allow people once thought to be beyond their prime to be significant contributors later in life than was the case earlier. We don’t need people to live longer living off government programs. We need to allow them (and yes, ageism is very real) to continue to be contributing many years longer than in the past.","24,006 followers",Shanks Wang,5.7K,183,13.3M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-science-fiction-technologies-are-most-feasible-within-the-next-100-years

Even if not, this is still a major step forward towards generating organs to order, without fear of rejection. Even if the heart is rejected and the donor dies, what we learn from the process will enable us to succeed the next time. I reckon this will become the mainstream way we get spare parts by the end of the decade in an optimistic scenario, by the end of the next decade in the pessimistic one.Either way, the moment is as groundbreaking as December 3rd, 1967, when the first human heart ever was transplanted, ushering the era of organ transplants of today. That patient died after 18 days, I hope this guy does better.","28,755 followers",Ray Schilling,608,8K,102.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-science-fiction-technologies-are-most-feasible-within-the-next-100-years
