As manyThe vehicleSo far, Kim and his team have developed an operating model of the C-1's flywheel-based stabilization system, along with a full-scale fiberglass mock-up of the vehicle itself. They are now working on a hand-built steel uni-bodied working prototype, which should reportedly be complete within about three months. Plans call for an initial run of production vehicles to be available at a price of about US$24,000 by late 2013, with that price going down to $16,000 once full production gets under way in 2014.Lit Motors' C-1 electric motorcycle will stand up for itselfKeeping connectedAs with many existing newer cars, the vehicle will also utilize various connectivity protocols to stay in contact with the internet. This will allow its driver to be continuously aware of factors such as traffic, construction, and adverse weather conditions - where applicable, alternate routes will be suggested.Some fairly big names have become interested in the project. While Daniel was first developing the C-1 as a student at the Rhode Island School of Design, it caught the attention of Robin Chase, co-founder and former CEO of Zipcar, the world's largest car-sharing service - she has since become ""a huge proponent"" of the vehicle. The MIT Media Lab also provided assistance in its design. More recently, Jason Hill, lead designer with the now-defunct Aptera Motors, signed on to work on the final design of the C-1.",UNKNOWN,DurgaPrasad (దుర్గా ప్రసాద్),546,183,3.5M,2016,https://www.quora.com/what-are-the-New-technologies-Existing-or-Upcoming-that-can-improve-transportation-and-safety-and-most-advanced-than-older-one
1,"Hi Pradan,New tech in transportation includes self driving vehicles; we had a look at semi-self drive vehicles like the Tesla Model S in 2015, only that it was ridiculously expensive. But 2016 will see a rise in self driving vehicles. Also, we have already seen how google has already put 46 ""self-driving"" taxis into service.Talking of safety, every self driving vehicle uses ""image analysis"" of the input it receives through an externally connected camera. Practically speaking, a combination of a number of cameras and proximity sensors aid the vehicle in driving on its own. Computationally speaHi Pradan,New tech in transportation includes self driving vehicles; we had a look at semi-self drive vehicles like the Tesla Model S in 2015, only that it was ridiculously expensive. But 2016 will see a rise in self driving vehicles. Also, we have already seen how google has already put 46 ""self-driving"" taxis into service.Talking of safety, every self driving vehicle uses ""image analysis"" of the input it receives through an externally connected camera. Practically speaking, a combination of a number of cameras and proximity sensors aid the vehicle in driving on its own. Computationally speaking, any self drive program algorithm will instruct a vehicle to immediately take safety measures and move away from the other. So, theoretically, considering a pool of self-driving vehicles, any accident should be impossible.This enhances safety for sure, but in the real world, a self-drive has to take into account the precise turns and road textures, or too many 'speed breakers' if it's in an asian country. All this does make the algorithms overly complex but yes it will soon be a reality.If you look at tracking tech, its already so widespread that one does not need to talk about it but yes, if you are interested in the latest upcoming tech, don't forget to subscribe to my blog:",719 followers,Sandip Bhatnagar,629,321,1.4M,2016,https://www.quora.com/what-are-the-New-technologies-Existing-or-Upcoming-that-can-improve-transportation-and-safety-and-most-advanced-than-older-one

3,"Hi friends,This is some great example declare with you, i hope you are saw that and know about old technology.1.The ARCHIMEDES SCREW-The Archimedes screw , allegedly invented by the ancient Greek scientist Archimedes is used for removing water from the hold of a large ship. One form consists of a circular pipe enclosing a helix and inclined at an angle of about 45 degrees to the horizontal with its lower end dipped in the water; rotation of the device causes the water to rise in the pipe. Other forms consist of a helix revolving in a fixed cylinder or a helical tube wound around a shaft.The ArHi friends,This is some great example declare with you, i hope you are saw that and know about old technology.1.The ARCHIMEDES SCREW-The Archimedes screw , allegedly invented by the ancient Greek scientist Archimedes is used for removing water from the hold of a large ship. One form consists of a circular pipe enclosing a helix and inclined at an angle of about 45 degrees to the horizontal with its lower end dipped in the water; rotation of the device causes the water to rise in the pipe. Other forms consist of a helix revolving in a fixed cylinder or a helical tube wound around a shaft.The Archimedes Screw is still used today in some limited applications (usually electrically-powered), and can range in size from a quarter of an inch to nearly 4 meters (12 feet) in diameter. A large screw or banks of screws may be used to pump rainstorm runoff or to lift water or wastewater, for example.2.THE BATTERY-The Baghdad Battery, sometimes referred to as the Parthian Battery, is a clay pot which encapsulates a copper cylinder. Suspended in the centre of this cylinder but not touching it is an iron rod. Both the copper cylinder and the iron rod are held in place with an asphalt plug. These artifacts (more than one was found) were discovered during the 1936 excavations of the old village Khujut Rabu, near Baghdad. The village is considered to be about 2000 years old, and was built during the Parthian period (250BC to 224 AD). Although it is not known exactly what the use of such a device would have been, the name ‘Baghdad Battery’, comes from one of the prevailing theories established in 1938 when Wilhelm Konig, the German archaeologist who performed the excavations, examined the battery and concluded that this device was an ancient electric battery. After the Second World War, Willard Gray, an American working at the General Electric High Voltage Laboratory in Pittsfield, built replicas and, filling them with an electrolyte, found that the devices could produce 2 volts of electricity. The question remains, if it really was a battery, what was it used to power?3. THE CALENDAR-Research carried out last year on an ancient site excavated by the National Trust for Scotland in 2004 revealed that it contained a sophisticated calendar system that is approximately 10,000 years old, making it the oldest calendar ever discovered in the world. The site at Warren Field, Crathes, Aberdeenshire – contains a 50 metre long row of twelve pits which were created by Stone Age Britons and which were in use from around 8000 BC (the early Mesolithic period) to around 4,000 BC (the early Neolithic). The pits represent the months of the year as well as the lunar phases of the moon. They were formed in a complex arc design in which each lunar month was divided into three roughly ten day weeks representing the waxing moon, the full moon and the waning moon. It also allowed the observation of the mid-winter sunrise so that the lunar calendar could be recalibrated each year to bring it back in line with the solar year. The entire arc represents a whole year and may also reflect the movements of the moon across the sky.4.STEAM ENGINE-Heron Alexandrinus, otherwise known as the Hero of Alexandria, was a 1st century Greek mathematician and engineer who is known as the first inventor of the steam engine. His steam powered device was called the aeolipile, named after Aiolos, God of the winds. The aeolipile consisted of a sphere positioned in such a way that it could rotate around its axis. Nozzles opposite each other would expel steam and both of the nozzles would generate a combined thrust resulting in torque, causing the sphere to spin around its axis. The rotation force sped up the sphere up to the point where the resistance from traction and air brought it to a stable rotation speed. The steam was created by boiling water under the sphere – the boiler was connected to the rotating sphere through a pair of pipes that at the same time served as pivots for the sphere.Some old steam engines are still used in certain areas of the world and in antique locomotives. However, steam power is still heavily used around the world in various applications. Many modern electrical plants use steam generated by burning coal to produce electricity.5.Earthquake Detector 132 A D -Earthquake Detector 132 A D According to court records of the later Han Dynasty, a seismograph was created by the brilliant inventor Zhang Heng (78-140 AD) in 132 AD. Its function is to determine the direction of an earthquake. In 138 AD, this instrument indicated an earthquake occurring in Longxi a thousand kilometers away. It was the first time that mankind to detect an earthquake. Modern seismographs only began development in 1848 in Europe.6.Paper Money 9th century A.D.-Paper money were first developed by the ancient Chinese, who started using folding money at the end of the 8th or beginning of the 9th century AD. Paper bills were originally used as privately issued bills of credit or exchange notes. A merchant could deposit his cash in the capital, receiving a paper “exchange certificate” which he could exchange for metal coins in other cities.Thanks for scrolling,Sandip bhatnagar.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/what-are-the-New-technologies-Existing-or-Upcoming-that-can-improve-transportation-and-safety-and-most-advanced-than-older-one
