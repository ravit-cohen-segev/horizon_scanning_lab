0,"Blockchain is an interesting technology for escrows beause the block chain can be relatively secure (if most of the people are “good actors”). My view as an American is that blockchain gets the attention of capital markets in China because it’s permeable to the Chinese “firewall”, allowing for Chinese nationals to get money outside China. But that is only true as long as the Chinese government doesn’t begin packet sniffing for it everywhere…or decide to invest in owning *most* of the blockchain.","31,157 followers",Phillip Remaker,1.7K,11K,78.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-blockchain-technology-a-revolutionary-technology-and-how-do-you-think-blockchain-technology-gets-more-attention-of-the-capital-market-in-China

You have a heart attack and the paramedic want the doctors to look at your funky ECG, that’s biotelemetry that sends your heart wave tracing across town.You may remember in the Apollo 13 movie where Jim Lovell tears the sensor pack off of his body, exclaiming “I’m tired of the whole Western World knowing how my kidneys are functioning!” The flight surgeon becomes visibly upset seeing Lovell drop off of his screen.Biotelemetry.The first one that comes to mind is biotelemetry.

It paid the salary of Neil Armstrong and the salary of the janitor who cleaned the mission control room. It paid for the label that said “SCE” so that the Apollo 12 astronauts could regain control of their rocket after being hit by lightning during the launch, and it paid for the label that said “Mens Room” at the Johnson Space Center.

You don’t start by saying ‘I’m going to build the biggest, baddest wall that’s ever been built.’ You don’t start there.

Literally these things don’t make difference for being happy because you are searching happiness from external sources.COVID-19 pandemic situation gives a new lesson for all of us. Now we can understand that being alive is the best thing in the world which we have forgot for many years.Focus on peace of mind, spirituality, gratefulness and enjoy the process of your work which you do for living, not the results. Money, success, relationship, possession will come as a by product. If nothing comes, it's okay because you know about your worth, you don't need anything to be complete and most importantly you are happy with your life. Very little amount of money is required to live a simple but happy life.Even If you reach the highest peak of success and fame, still you can not avoid the sufferings, emptiness, aging, diseases and inevitable truth of life. Oneday you will die and leave everything. The world can run without you. So, I try to make each and everyday as a joyful life, leave ego, get rid of attachment, live a fearless life and do what I love.

I wanted to do well in the world. I had a deep need for outer acceptance because I wasn’t embracing myself on the inside.I thought that if I just stayed out of trouble—if I just avoided controversy and did my best to please the people around me—I’d feel safe in the world.Perhaps even wanted.And so I became the nice guy.I let other people come first. I put my own needs aside. I sacrificed my wellbeing.And I was miserable.But in the last years, something changed.I put me higher up the priority list.It’s not that I became an asshole or stopped caring.
