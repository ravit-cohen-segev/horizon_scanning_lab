I will describe four scenarios:1. Local TravelCharge time is not an issue. When I get home in the evening, I plug the charge cable into the car. The car recharges to 80% overnight - more than enough for local travel, low enough to help extend battery life. If I know when I will depart the next day, I can set the car to warm or cool the interior for that time - with the garage door2. Day TripsWe live outside Philadelphia and sometimes make day trips to New York City. On those occasions I set the car to complete its charge to 100% shortly before we plan to depart. The car’s efficiency and battery capacity allow us to make the round trip without a charge stop. Autopilot makes the return trip easier if the day has been especially long. I haven’t tracked power cost for my car. My wife’s Model 3 used $10 of electricity for a Philadelphia-Manhattan-Brooklyn-Manhattan-Philadelphia trip. Almost certainly less than fuel cost for a gas vehicle.3. 300–500 MilesSeveral times a year we drive about 400 miles to Cape Cod, Massachusetts. I schedule the car to charge to 100% before we leave. North of New Haven, we plan a stop at a rest area with a Supercharger. Since the stop is on the GPS route, the car pre-heats the battery for faster charging. We park at an open Supercharger, plug in and walk into the building. Rest room visit, get a fresh cup of coffee, walk back to the car. The car tells us when we have sufficient charge to reach our destination, usually 10 or 15 minutes after we’ve returned.Our previous car, a Hyundai Sonata 2.0t, would have required two gas station stops - one at the start of the trip, a second just before crossing the Cape Cod Canal.4. Over 500 MilesI bought the S from Tesla as an Inventory car - 1,100 miles as showroom, demo and loaner. Also an appealing mileage mark-down, completely debugged and the features we wanted. It was in Chicago, I could avoid $1,000 shipping charge if I drove it home - over 900 miles. A friend and I left his Chicago condo early the morning after purchase with the battery at 100%. Navigation guided us to a Supercharger in Ohio. We plugged it in, walked to a nearby restaurant for breakfast. Before we had finished our meal, the iPhone app alerted us the car had enough charge for the next stop. We had dinner near a Supercharger in Western Pennsylvania. Same story - the car finished its meal before we finished ours. Last Supercharger stop was coffee and a doughnut. That time we had to wait about 10 minutes before there was sufficient charge.The Hyundai would have required three stops, which would have been shorter and featured fast food.5. Bonus - Cost of OwnershipThe Model S has required very little maintenance. I’m still using the original brake pads and rotors after 64,000 miles. Owners are encouraged to bring the car in every two years for a checkup. There are no oil & filter changes, cooling system flush, spark plug, belt or water pump replacements. We sold the Hyundai a few months ago, I recently cleared out the file folder with a thick stack of service records.Conclusion: An ICE vehicle can provide a faster journey if several refuel / recharge stops are required. A BEV saves time in nearly every other scenario because there’s no initial “fill-up” detour.BEV provides additional benefits. Efficiency and off-peak charging can reduce cost per mile. Far lower maintenance and replacement cost further reduce total cost of ownership.","41,155 followers",Craig Good,530,19.7K,90.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-we-not-able-to-advance-technology-to-run-EVS-continuously-charging-vehicles-in-the-same-vehicle-permanently

Meanwhile Rama asked Hanuman to search for his ring which fell down in one of the cracks in the palace. Hanuman went in search of the ring. At the same time, Rama called Lakshman and ordered him not to allow anyone to his room.Rama invited Yama who came as a sage and served him. Yama informed Rama that his time has come. Meanwhile sage Durvasa also comes to warn Rama about the future. Lakshman refused to allow Durvasa inside citing his brother's order. Durvasa left Ayodhya knowing Rama has decided to accept the time.Lakshman got frustrated on denying Durvasa's order and goes to the river Sarayu and leaves his mortal remains and heads to the heavens. Meanwhile Rama followed Yama to the heavens. By that time, Hanuman reached pathala which is being guarded by the serpent Vasuki. He summons him upon the lost ring, Vasuki shows a heap of similar rings and ask him to find the ring he came in search for.Hanuman found that all the rings are to be Rama's and are similar ones. Confused Hanuman asks Vasuki how so many rings came. Vasuki answers that every yuga cycle, a ring falls from the earth and an ape comes in search for it.Hanuman realised that there is no one Rama nor one Hanuman but the entire Ramayana repeats like a play on the wish of Vishnu. Realising the truth Hanuman returns to earth and lives in the memory of Rama waiting for his next arrival!",0 followers,Ben Choucroun,503,1.2K,40.7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Would-India-have-become-a-spacefaring-empire-like-Star-Wars-using-the-advanced-technology-from-Ramayana-and-Mahabharata
3,"That isn’t the case.In the Original Trilogy we see 6 main planets- Tatooine, Yavin, Hoth, Dagobah, Bespin, and Endor. While most of these are not technologically advanced, this makes perfect sense.See, the Original Trilogy takes place in the Outer Rim. This part of the galaxy was technologically behind the core worlds, and as a result is less technologically developed. This is alluded to when Luke says “If there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.”Plus, over half of the locations we see in the Original Trilogy are mostly uninhabited.

This is alluded to when Luke says “If there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.”Plus, over half of the locations we see in the Original Trilogy are mostly uninhabited. Yavin is hidden, secret base, as is Hoth. Endor is inhabited by teddy bears, and Dagobah has a ketamine-fueled frog with terrible grammar. Do you expect these places to have skyscrapers like Coruscant?Finally on our planets list, we have Bespin. Bespin is very technologically advanced. It's literally a massive city hanging in the clouds that’s 400 stories high. Making that is pretty impressive, and is arguably more impressive than anything in the prequels.When it comes to ships, remember that the Rebel Alliance used anything they could find. They stole their Y-Wings bombers and made their X-Wings in suboptimal conditions. The Empire, on the other hand, emphasized fear. Their ships emulated this, by using strong shapes and dark designs instead of sleek edges like on the Naboo fighter.It's also important to remember, when discussing the droid army, that in the Original Trilogy, that it wouldn’t make sense for either faction to use droids. The droid army terrorized the galaxy, and so whoever used them would be villainized in the public eye.The prequels, on the other hand, spend much of their time in the Galactic Core. Here is where most of the credits in the galaxy wind up, and so it is more technologically advanced. The times we do leave we often go to wealthy planets, such as Naboo (whose plasma deposits made them rich) or planets with massive populations (like Geonosis) whose population has the ability to make massive catacombs.Furthermore. The ships we see in the prequels are often direct predecessors of ships in the Original Trilogy. The ARC-170 evolves into the X-Wing, the Venator-class Star Destroyer evolves into the Imperial-class Star Destroyer, and the AT-RT evolves into the AT-ST.In conclusion, the technology of the Prequels often is behind that shown in the Original Trilogy- and when it's not, it makes sense.Stay safe,-Ben*Another answer also noted that Luke’s Prosthetic hand is much advanced than Anakin’s",1 follower,Eric Lowe,1.1K,4.1K,37.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Would-India-have-become-a-spacefaring-empire-like-Star-Wars-using-the-advanced-technology-from-Ramayana-and-Mahabharata

5,"I admitted the undergraduate students to MIT for 28 years, nearly 10 as Dean of Admissions.  It is very difficult to describe how one gets admitted because it is a subjective process based on a variety of factors.But let me say that of all the answers below, Anonymous is closest to the truth.  Simply put, you need a 'hook', which means something so special that it is pretty rare.  (A hook is also known in the admissions business as an 'institutional need', something that the schools want but will never tell the public about.

It is very difficult to describe how one gets admitted because it is a subjective process based on a variety of factors.But let me say that of all the answers below, Anonymous is closest to the truth.  Simply put, you need a 'hook', which means something so special that it is pretty rare.  (A hook is also known in the admissions business as an 'institutional need', something that the schools want but will never tell the public about.  Div 1 athletes, children of major donors or celebrities, best in state, best in nation, academic superstars, someone who is published in a major publication, etc are examples nationally.  MIT has its own institutional needs that their outstanding admissions office works hard to identify and admit.)  Note that this is not just high scores and perfect grades, as most people believe.  It's different.As Anonymous says, for MIT  be world-class at something (accent on 'world class'), crush school (that's right - crush it, no excuses) and build writing and interpersonal skills so you can communicate effectively with others.MIT people are action people so the admissions office is looking for people who regularly make things happen for themselves and others with great self-initiative.  A deeper than normal curiosity is critical because that screams MIT.  And a fearlessness is necessary because not only is MIT the most extraordinary university of its kind on Earth, it's also one of the most demanding.  (There's no place to hide in the curriculum there as one can in Ivy schools.)  Each of these attributes must be represented by actual evidence in the case.  But it's the hook that gets one admitted.If I could tell future applicants anything, it is to understand the culture of the individual school and see if you are a match.  For example, MIT is an action place and so is well suited for action-types and not really that suited for intellectual types.  Also, do not pick a college based on ranking.  That's just ignorance.  All ranking systems have been designed to sell products so they are neither neutral authorities nor really true. You must learn about schools yourself in this era of Big Spin.  That takes work.And most importantly, don't take advice about college admissions from anyone who has never admitted for a living.  Your friends and parents know nothing about such an arcane process and do what we all do - make assumptions about how it appears to work and then act on the assumptions they just made up as if they were true (a process I refer to as M.S.U. - making sh*t up).  That never ends well since it isn't based in truth.I hope this helps.","1,341 followers",Marilee Jones,2.1K,0,0,2015,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-we-not-able-to-advance-technology-to-run-EVS-continuously-charging-vehicles-in-the-same-vehicle-permanently
