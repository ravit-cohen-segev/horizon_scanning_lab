The U.S. practices your old-fashioned socialism in R&D, which is acceptable to the political establishment because they’ve always been Okay with ‘socialize the cost, privatize the profit’. In the 60’s, when the computer, the internet, NASA, etc., were first invented, the US government paid for almost 2/3 of all the R&D in the U.S.Source:Nobody else was going to pay for basic science. But once you have the basic science figured out, people can start developing application science based on the basic science and make money. That’s when industry started pouring money into it. Private money expects a return on investment, you know.The thing is, basic science requires a lot of super expensive capital equipment. The first computers, the linear accelerators, the space technology, etc., were astronomically expensive, for example. Everything is build from self-designed/hand-made/precision/custom parts, so what can you do? So you can’t look at R&D spending on a per-capita basis, because either you have the $billion dollar budget to build the equipment, or you don’t. The scientists themselves weren’t paid that much. It was all experimental equipment. And the US Government opened its wallet for that sort of things in the 60’s and 70’s. Canada simply didn’t have that kind of money.And it’s very likely that you spend all that money, build all that stuff, and it doesn’t work! And even if it does work, what do you get out of it? Well you get to publish some papers on Science or Nature. That’s it. It’s really, really, significant to the scientists, but the other people couldn’t care less. That’s the way it is with basic science. Historically, only rich countries can do basic science. It’s their responsibility to the mankind.To give you a sense of the SCALE of the impact of US government funding:T-date,115There’s nothing else in the world that can even remotely compare with the US government in funding for basic research!",85 followers,Marian Clarke,819,4K,7.8M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-does-the-U-S-out-invent-the-world

The slower the info moves the longer the pilots have to wait. In combat waiting is not good.Software and hardware speed. You cannot have the flight instruments being slow or erratic because a computer isn’t fast enough to process the information. You also can’t have the Blue Screen of death. So testing has to go on and on in every condition and environment until about every bug is found and code Efficiencies are made.Since 2007, the Chinook has received 4 significant software updates. We are due a new version next year. The Army intends to update software every 3 years which is about what has happened. Hardware is more dollar intensive and thus updated diffently. Just One of those Multi Function Displays (MFDs or those “TV screens”) cost $69,000. Small hardware updates are done as components get turned in for rapair. “Major” updates have only occurred twice with the second one in process right now for the next 3 years, when the biggest hardware update is due out.Consider we have some of the best state of the art equipment in the US Military. Compared to civilian Off The Shelf hardware, Military gear is usually 3 years out of date. That is simply because civilian gear is built to lower specification then military gear. Currently, there are no touch screens in existence that can handle the extreme temperatures asked of military helicopters. I understand there are arguments from other services or the airlines on this. I will simply note, their equipment is in air conditioned aircraft. Ours is not.

Super computers and custom chips have no equal in the civilian space. Some of the chips which are used in signal processing and military Radio’s are never going to be seen by you and me in any store.Super computers that the defense forces use are also much more powerful than anything we use mainly because they use custom components optimized for their need built on reliable 10 year old process. Civilian super computers are rather generic. We use GPU’s for number crunching (bit coins, gene splicing, scientific computing and modelling, etc) and general processors for everything else. A data center is unlikely to feature in the top 50 super computers simply because its not built and optimized for number crunching. Its designed and built for large data transactions and as such usually are scalable easily and host large storage space instead of best computing power. Most companies have data centers and not compute clusters. However, biotech and advanced research companies are a different lot. They have compute super computers and still have plenty of data storage. These systems are optimized for computations and they can afford to go with the latest and greatest.So in general civilian technology is usually cutting edge, but also more unstable. Defense systems cannot afford to get the latest 8th gen core -ix and have blue screens. They would rather get a custom high end 4th gen core i7 which are much more reliable and supported very well with all their bugs known and addressed.Military systems and corporate systems are usually completely replaced every 10 years. They are rarely upgraded. It takes 1 year to evaluate and design the specs. then there is a year of tendering process. Finally a company is chosen to build it with what is 2 year old mature technology at that point. It takes another 3 years to build the system, test it, fix plenty of issues and transfer control.

One time we were required to corrupt product that had been shipped to China and it started a major debate about our fiduciary responsibility to the country or to the customer. The issue was that if you sell a security product that you know is corrupted, you are knowingly committing fraud and are liable. As the Product Manager at the time I asked the NSA if they would stand behind us (and me as I might be personally liable) in court if we were discovered. Of course the answer from the NSA was “Hell no.”We were on our own. We then entered into a long debate about how to detect Easter eggs and other corruption introduced into security products unknowingly through another vendor’s corrupted hardware. The issue was never resolved but it should be known that our security source code HAD to be provided to the NSA in order to get FIPS certification and they made certain changes to it.So to answer your question, USA military technology is advanced far beyond anyone’s knowledge to describe the extent.On the other hand, the Chinese probably know more about our technology than we do since they perpetrated the greatest security breach in history by compromising the RSA key technology used by almost everyone in the world.

20,"As a military and aeronautical enthusiast, I would absolutely love to answer this question.First of all,As a military and aeronautical enthusiast, I would absolutely love to answer this question.First of all,The advanced level of the j-20 accord with all the advanced standards of the fifth generation fighter.Let me start with its excellent aerodynamic design compared with other fifth generation fighters.For the first time, the j-20 adopts the extremely complex design of lift body + DSI inlet + full motion canard + large sidebar + tailless delta wing + full motion vertical tail. The overall shape is like a sharp dart, which cuts through the long sky.Let's analyze the aerodynamic layout characteristics of the j-20.About DSIThe full name of DSI inlet is ""diverterless supersonic inlet"". A a new intake concept developed by Lockheed Martin company over ten years, it was tested on F-16 and formally used on x-35 verification machine in 2000.Before the birth of DSI, the most advanced inlet design in the world was the Garrett inlet of F-22. Its scientific name was the double oblique wave multiplication inlet. The shock wave generated by the prism head was used to decelerate and pressurize the air flow entering the inlet, thus eliminating the complex air inlet regulation system like F-14 and F-15, and its stealth performance was better.But the F-22's fixed intake is optimized for the cruise speed of Mach 1.6. When the intake efficiency exceeds this speed range, it has to be adjusted with a large size vent valve. At the same time, it also has a rather complex boundary layer isolation and suction and exhaust bypass system. The boundary layer separation channel forms a large cavity, which is very harmful to the front stealth. Both the suction and exhaust ports of the boundary layer need to be concealed, which not only increases the structural weight, reduces the available space in the aircraft, but also increases the resistance.DSi intake, with a three-dimensional drum instead of all the boundary layer isolation and exhaust system. As a compression surface, there is a pressure gradient difference between the top and the surrounding. When the boundary layer flows through the drum, the high-pressure area on the top of the drum pushes the boundary layer away from the drum and flows to the low-pressure area around the drum. The boundary layer is discharged from the appropriate positions on both sides of the air inlet with the carefully designed forward inlet lip.The flow field of DSI inlet shows that the red boundary layer is pushed away by the bulge and overflows from both sides of the upper and lower lipsThe j-20 is the third type of fighter designed by Chengdu aircraft manufacturing company, which adopts DSI. In a sense, the DSI implementation experience of Chengfei is better than that of Lockheed Martin company, which is the first in the world. All of the previous DSI inlets, including the F-35, are located in the center of the inlet with symmetrical left and right shapes. The drum of j-20 is asymmetric, and the front end is sharper than any other DSI drum, with better high-speed performance. Of course, the design of aerodynamics is more complex. Such an excellent air intake system reduces the structural weight of the aircraft, improves the stealth ability and ensures the air intake efficiency. So I think it is the most advanced air intake system in the current fighter. (the advanced level of the air intake system has a great influence on the maneuverability of the aircraft.）About canardThe unique canard design of j-20 comes from the deep technology accumulation of Chengdu aircraft manufacturing company. As early as 1970s, the j-9 of Chengdu Aircraft Manufacturing Company adopted a complex canard design.The wind tunnel model of the j-9 in 1976 is shown in the top picture, and the j-20 in the bottom picture. Do they look very similar?Today's j-20's canard + sidebar design gives full play to the advantages of balancing and vortex lift. The supersonic maneuverability and high elevation flight ability are the No.1 in the world.Additional Information：The j-20 has 16 aerodynamic surfaces, including canards, strakes, leading-edge mobile flaps, main wings, trailing edge flaps, ailerons, full motion vertical tails, ventral fins, and at least five kinds of vortices. Such a complexity is rare in aerodynamics. To integrate all these elements, flight control law is very difficult.In addition, advanced magazine design,↑j–20 pk F-22↓equipped with gem optical probe and phased array radar. The latest avionics systems are attracting people's attention. The huge fuselage (20.3 meters in length, 12.88 meters in wingspan, 73 square meters in wing area and 39 tons in maximum takeoff weight)gives the j-20 a combat radius of 2000 kilometers. （F-35 only have 1050 kilometers）That's enough to make it the air supremacy of the East Pacific.About the Propulsion.Its weakness used to be propulsion. Russia's AL-31F had a huge lack of momentum. And so, the domestic ws-10b was installed on the j-20. The ws-15 to be installed in the future will have superior thrust over f119-pw-100 (F22 engine).Simulation air war.Using declassified data from the Pentagon, cmano, a military expert, conducted a war exercise between the j-20 and the fourth generation heavy fighter F15,when both sides shut down the radar and did not have the support of the early warning aircraft. The exchange ratio between the j-20 and F15 is 1:23. It can be imagined that when the j-20 with radar on and early warning aircraft supporting gives full play to its electronic advantages, the imbalance of power will be even more.2.As for J20 and F35, I don't think they are comparable. I admit that part of the advanced technology of F35 is better than that of j-20, but their design ideas and tasks are totally different. The j-20 is a super heavy air fighter, and the F35 is a medium and large multi-functional fighter. The role of the j-20 is to destroy local air forces, while the F-35 should take into account ground operations. The engine performance of F35 is the best in the world (the latest improved model officially has a military thrust of 21.5t, which is 150% of the j-20). However, due to the single engine design, the final dynamic performance is weaker than the j-20.In addition, it uses the concept of general fighter platform, which makes it necessary to consider the opinions of the Navy and the Marine Corps,damaging the aircraft's air control performance.◥ Big fat! ◤3. The FC-31 was pitched against the j-20, when the two largest fighter manufacturing companies in China (Chengdu aircraft manufacturing company and Shenyang aircraft manufacturing company) competed for orders of the fifth generation fighter for the Chinese air force, but it lost. Although it has excellent aerodynamic design and stealth capability, its power system is too backward (RD-93 developed by Russia in 1980s, power source of MIG 29).

That’s not what vacuums do.Consider an example where we’ve pumped all of the air out of some box and created a vacuum inside of it.

Let’s say we’re on Earth, at sea level, and we poke a hole in the box. What will happen?Air will rush into the box and fill it. Okay. But why did it do that? Was it because the vacuum sucked the air into the box? No.What’s actually happening there is that the air pressure around the box is forcing air into the space with no pressure. The air that fills the box is being PUSHED by air pressure into the empty space.Vacuums never “suck” air. What they do is present an empty space and then air pressure forces the air into the vacuum.Air pressure is not uniform throughout the atmosphere. The lower the altitude, the higher the air pressure; thus, as you move higher, the air pressure decreases. In fact, at the upper limits of the atmosphere, the air pressure reduces to basically nil.And since there’s no real air pressure to speak of up there, then there is no force pushing the air into the empty space.Now, this doesn’t mean gravity isn’t at work here. In fact, gravity is the reason we have air pressure in the first place. Gravity pulls on the atmosphere, compressing it, and creating pressure.If we could magically turn off gravity then the atmosphere would be released from that compression and spring away from the Earth.So, at the root of it, gravity is the thing that keeps the atmosphere near the surface.

33,"When Marvel and DC started telling stories that showed that their characters all lived in the same universe, it immediately brought up the dilemma of how do you tell stories that focus on a single character – where there isn't a large roster of super-buddies that can come bail them out whenever they get into trouble.  DC's solution was to put each character into a different city.  Batman is in Gotham, Superman is in Metropolis, the Flash is in Central City, the Green Lantern is in Coast City, and so on.Marvel, however went in the opposite direction and put almost all of their characters in NWhen Marvel and DC started telling stories that showed that their characters all lived in the same universe, it immediately brought up the dilemma of how do you tell stories that focus on a single character – where there isn't a large roster of super-buddies that can come bail them out whenever they get into trouble.  DC's solution was to put each character into a different city.  Batman is in Gotham, Superman is in Metropolis, the Flash is in Central City, the Green Lantern is in Coast City, and so on.Marvel, however went in the opposite direction and put almost all of their characters in New York City.  The Fantastic Four live in the Baxter Building in downtown Manhattan.  The Avengers Mansion is also in Manhattan.  Spider-man is in Queens.  Daredevil is in Hell's Kitchen.  The farthest away is the X-Men, and they're only 34 miles away in Westchester.  So When Galactus or Dr. Doom attacks New York in the Fantastic Four comic, it leaves the reader to wonder why Spider-man and the Avengers aren't helping out.We have to remember the psychology that a lot of these heroes are designed to.  They were written (originally) largely for teenage boys in the 1960s – boys whom were raised on a mindset of wanting to be self-sufficient and independent.  These heroes are supposed to be awesome.  Batman should never need to ask for Superman's help.  Iron Man would be ashamed to have to ask for Steve's help.  It would take a lot for them to look at a situation and not believe they could handle it solo.The only answer that works is to say they are busy dealing with their own problems, in their own books.  The Avengers comic was designed such that the Avengers would assemble to deal with Earth threatening incidents.  When those aren't happening, Thor would tend to go back to Asgard, Tony to Stark Industries, Cap would hit the road on his motorcycle, and the Hulk would wander off in a rage and smash stuff in a little desert town, somewhere.  Over at DC Comics, this was kind of a forced result, because they had different editorial teams for each character and those editors were very territorial.  If the Batman editor asked to use Flash in the Batman comic, the Flash editor would likely say no, because they wanted the audience to focus on the Flash story they were telling in their own book.So, for the purposes of the Marvel Cinematic universe, now that the Avengers have assembled in their own film, it is probably best to view the Phase 2 movies (Iron Man 3, Thor 2, and Captain America 2) as happening simultaneously (the Phase 1 movies were chronological because they were building the Avengers up).  So, while Tony was getting his butt handed to him by the Mandarin (in Iron Man 3), Thor was actually home in Asgard fighting his own battles (in Thor 2) and Cap was off dealing with the Winter Soldier (in Captain America 2).  Black Widow and SHIELD are featured in Captain America 2, so she is with Steve.  IMHO, Hawkeye is a useless douche.

The list is much longer than can fit in this answer.It took the Soviet Union only 16 years to send the first man into space after the end of World War II. In 20 years, Russia hasn’t learned to design its own computer, a machine tool, pharmaceutical manufacturing equipment and much more.Local factories have been shut down, and giant Western groups like VW, Citroen, BMW, KIA., etc. have opened factories in their place with ownership, management and technology coming from overseas. The profits are split between the Western corporations, oligarchs and officials.The national currency, the ruble, has jumped from 28.16 to 74.02 against USD with prices rising accordingly, while wages stagnated, as more money hasn’t been printed, possibly to avoid a runaway hyperinflation.Pump price for gas rose by 483% (from 7.2 to 42). In case you didn't know, most of Russia’s revenues come from exporting crude oil.The number of officialsThe population of Russia is roughly the same as 20 years ago, while millions of migrants have received citizenship in that period of time. At least 150,000 citizens, many of whom with excellent education and sellable skills, leave the country for good each year.Russia spends more budget money on defence than on education and healthcare combined.The number of hospitals fell by 50% (from 10,700 to 5,300). This actually points out to a logical conclusion thatThe number of schools fell by 21% (from 68,100 to 41,349). This highlights the fact that most of the country has seen decline in population. People migrate to bigger cities and towns in search of work where they overwhelm the existing schools. The quality of education inevitably suffers.At the same time, the number of Orthodox churches had doubled from 19,000 to 38,649, while the level of religiosity in the population hasn’t risen. Why are they building more churches, then? Because Russian Orthodox Church is a state corporation that exists for the sole objective of making its stakeholders and top management wealthy, which has been proven by photos and videos of high-flying lifestyle of thousands of priests.According to just two polls: median salary is 15k/month or $200/month, and a third of the population don’t have enough money to buy footwear for all members of the family. When asked to comment, Putin claimed that 17k a month is a middle class salary.At the same time, Russia is on the 3rd place in the world by the number of billionaires. The largest super-yachts and most expensive real estate in the world belong to Russian oligarchs.Don’t listen to Kremlebots when they tell you Putin has built a country Russians want their children to live in.

It also is one of the world’s foremost leaders in nuclear energy, building and maintaining plants and selling nuclear fuel and nuclear products for medicine not only at home but also abroad in a wide range of other states. Further, it is the second biggest arms exporter and that is due in large part to the fact that the US jealously guards its no. one spot by slapping sanctions on states that buy Russian arms or at least threatening them with sanctions. Ironically, it was the first major round of sanctions in 2014 that indirectly led Russia to impose its own sanctions on Europe, refusing to continue buying their farm products and launching an ambitious campaign aimed at achieving Russian food security. It was a smashing success and the products that were substituted will never again be imported from Europe. It was a big loss for Europe.In addition, Russia is the world’s no. 2 ship builder and is planning to build ships for export. It also earns revenues from its operation of the Arctic Shipping route, which is considerably shorter than the route passing through the Suez Canal and could eventually replace that route for shipping between Europe and Asia.Russia has also exhibited its breakthrough developments in quantum techonogies, including a pioneering supercomputer.Finally, Russia was the first to come out with an anti-covid vaccine, Sputnik V, which was initially scoffed at in the West.

You know how in most companies people who leave write farewell letters to everyone where they use a lot of words about how it was a great experience for them and they learned so much and it’s been a great honor to work in such a great team and so on and so forth? Surely sometimes parts of it is true but mostly it’s just some sort of a ritual and often these people hate the organization and most other people in it. And everybody knows that. Yet nobody ever replies to such emails trying to expose the hypocrisy. If someone tried, what would he cause? Irritation! And then somebody has a birthday, people go to congratulate the person, and someone stands up and says that birthdays are overrated and all the congratulations are fake. And that kind of stuff keeps happening at every corporate event. Or, worse still, imagine there’s a compensation policy that’s ever so slightly but universally abused. Like you have company cars that are supposed to be used for business but people routinely use them to take kids to school, adding a few miles now and then, or occasionally take small trips out of town. Or at least when they use them improperly, they hide it or invent plausible explanations. And then our grumpy fellow takes such a car and goes on a long vacation across Europe, posting photos on Instagram at every stop. Then somebody tries to talk sense into him, but instead of complying he starts running around yelling how everybody does it. And what if the guy is also a bad performer, adding little useful to the business? If you can’t fire him (and surely nobody can fire Putin), his very presence will soon be a torture to everyone.Politics require a very delicate balance of rules, rituals, hypocrisy, principles, and a lot of other things. If you disturb this balance, you tear the fabric of the world order apart. And become a bad guy. If you also do bad things, they will constitute most of your image.I think that’s why Putin is a very special kind of bad.",0 followers,Tony Bartlett,584,17.2K,48.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-does-the-U-S-out-invent-the-world

The same thing is going on with Crimea now. Businesses were withdrawn from Ukrainian owners and majority of them went down.Same happened in Ukraine in 2014, when Putin sneaked hundreds of trucks with armor into Donbass area, claiming it was “humanitarian help” for Russian separatists. The war started right away and thousands of Ukrainian soldiers got killed in the matter of days. When Putin lied through media to the whole world that “Russian people were harrassed in Donbass and Lugantsk areas and wanted to separate” was just not true. I know it for sure since I’m from Donbass myself and we have always been historically mixed with Russians, never underestimating noone. However this lies served as a reason for Putin to start war and annex these 2 regions to Russia, leaving territories abandoned and people killed or jobless.The corruption is enormous in Russia. The roads in the regions and province are just a mash of mud. There was a funny joke in Russian comedy club about local innovations, such as electric cars. That if you purchased an electric car in Sakhalin, which is very eastern part of Russia, get ready to carry the car in your hands most of the way, since the next electric car power station is thousand miles away somewhere next to Moscow.","43,455 followers",Misha Firer,11.6K,1.3K,133.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-does-the-U-S-out-invent-the-world

There’s a reason why he uses Novichok rather than some generic poison, he wants to make sure that everyone knows it was him. It’s his way of signing his work.

This is a cornerstone to maintaining political stability.Now that’s all the good things about Putin as a leader. Where he falls apart is in his economic policies. This is nothing new. I literally cannot think of a single Russian leader that was known for beingRussia remains one of the slowest growing economies in the world. And given its low GDP per capita base, it’s rather inexcusable for it to be growing so slowly. In 2020, China overtook Russia in nominal GDP per capita terms (though Russia is still ahead in PPP terms).Underlying this slow growth is the declining population. But it’s mostly a matter of the elderly dying early rather than not enough babies being born. The average life expectancy for Russian men is 63. That’s below the retirement age of 65. Declining birth rates are a problem as well. There’s even a national holiday in Russia set aside for having sex with your wife to have babies. No data on how this day off is actually used…But demographics aren’t the only thing weighing on the Russian economy. Sanctions play a big role, as does the lack of foreign investment. It’s just a bad picture all round.Moscow has grown enormously in the past 2 decades, but it is the only city in Russia that’s really doing well. It’s rapid development is largely at the expense of other parts of the country, especially in terms of skilled labor.In Putin’s 20 years in power, he’s overseen mediocre economic growth in absolute terms, but pitiful growth in relative terms.

You can’t say that his military is actually losing, but they no longer have the ability to continue.Russia has taken around 15,000 KIA, and 30–40,000 more non-ambulatory wounded and captured. Over half the units in the Ukraine have lost more than the 10% that is defined as making them non-combat effective. Many units have lost as many as 25% of their strength. Russia is refusing to repatriate dead Russian soldiers and is refusing the IRC letters home from Russian POWs. He had lost thousands of armored vehicles, artillery pieces, aircraft and at least three major ships. He has had at least seven generals and the three-star admiral that commanded the Russian Marines in combat. The Ukrainians are posting pictures of the dog tags of the captured and dead Russian soldiers on social media, so the word is slowly getting back to Russian mothers.Putin has cashiered at least ten generals and arrested his intelligence chief and his deputy. These will likely be executed as such were done in both Chechnya and Syria failures.The Russian economy is in collapse. The ruble is worthless and foreign trade and investment are over, likely permanently. Foodstuffs are seeing over 50% inflation when they are available. Russian foreign reserves are largely frozen or confiscated and the disconnection from SWIFT will increase Russian unemployment to 30–40%. Russia’s GDP was 12th in the world, behind countries like Brazil and Italy. But it is projected to slide to 32nd in the world by the end of 2022.Russia has now expended huge amounts of its more expensive “smart” weapons and has no way to replenish them. Ditto for tanks and aircraft. He can no longer conduct amphibious landing operations due to the loss of most of his landing ships. His military is in disarray from corruption, incompetence, and from following fantasy rather than actionable intelligence. This means that his share of the military goods markets will decline as they did after the Iraqi Army defeat.Oil and natural gas will be a lot harder to sell. This would not mean that much to most countries, but Russia is one of the most two-dimensional economies in the world, based almost entirely on oil and natural gas exports.Russia cannot cozy up to China because China’s economy is ten times the size of Russia’s. With China’s shameless manipulation of its two-currency system, everything Putin sells to China has a 40–50% discount and everything he buys has a 40–50% markup.

This hurts like hell and makes your hand basically unusable or at the least somewhat disables it.It is hard to grab things with an open wound on your hand. It is, in fact, hard to flex your hand at all because you will continually open the wound, which hurts like hell.In the Great British Baking show John gets a cut on his finger and continues working. This widens the wound; it keeps getting worse and before long he’s dripping blood everywhere. And that’s just his finger.The whole cut-your-hand-thing is typically used to display toughness, but every time I see this I can’t help but wince. Hand cuts are awful to deal with, particularly if you need to keep using them. Fortunately in movies, there seems to be no lasting effect from this. They magically heal in the next scene.
