In that time, the US military has embarked on a number of programs like the SPIW and ACR programs that looked into things like caseless ammunition, flechette rounds and a number of other ideas that have yet to offer a sufficient improvement to justify replacing more traditional systems.The US military appears to be considering a new squad automatic weapon that fires 6.8 mm caseless round to the M249. However I would be surprised if anything like that gets adopted in the next 20 years. The M-249 works well enough, and the US military needs to devote its funding to other more pressing needs.The Russian military has been tinkering with counterbalance rifles like the AK-107 in recent y...","16,058 followers",Pavel Fekula,1.4K,11K,118.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Are-the-small-arms-still-advancing-technologically-If-so-what-is-the-latest-technological-advancement-in-small-arms
1,"The question seems to assume that guns are getting “more dangerous” every year as new technology is developed. That is simply not the case. As examples let’s look at two of the most popular media darlings. The AR15 semi-automatic rifle and the Glock pistol.The AR15 was invented in the late 1950’s. That is 60+ years ago. Also, keep in mind that is the specific model we’re talking about. If we want to talk about semi-automatic rifles in general we’d have to go back to about 1885 for the first successful design.

If we want to talk about semi-automatic rifles in general we’d have to go back to about 1885 for the first successful design. Of course technology has changed since then, but it’s changed very little in the last 60 or more years when talking about the core operation of the firearm. What has changed then? Why are there adds for new models of AR15’s and features in every month’s new gun magazines. Mostly they’re features that either add some small amount of functionality, ergonomics, or style. Different forearms to mount accessories like flashlights, a stock that has more adjustments to fit the user. But not really things that change the core functioning of the rifle itself.The Glock pistol entered service in 1982. In those 38 years there have been 5 generations of changes incorporated. Here’s a picture of all 5.Image Source:The most significant and obvious changes appear from Gen 2 to Gen 3. Gen 3 has an accessory rail and a thumb rest. If you look closely, you can see a larger magazine release button introduced in Gen 4. None of these changes make the Gen 5 “more dangerous” for society.Again, note that we’re talking specifically about the Glock because it’s so popular. But like the semi automatic rifles, and as others have mentioned in their answers we’d have to go back well over a hundred years to get to the first semi auto pistols. The first semi automatic pistol to have commercial success made its public debut in 1894. Probably the most iconic and successful semi-auto pistol is the model 1911, which is still a very popular model today.Here’s an image from a WW I sample:Image source:Here’s one you could buy brand new today:Image source:Note the differences: The relief on the frame behind the trigger and the arch at the bottom back of the grip were changes made in 1924. The larger ejection port is a more modern change, along with better sights and a larger thumb safety (on the other side). Again, these changes, as with the Glock are mostly ergonomic and really don’t make the pistol “more dangerous”.But what about things like dangerous “high capacity magazines”. Again, we’re going back over 100 years for pistols with larger capacity magazines (20 round Mausers for example), and the double stacked 9MM magazine has been around since the Browning High Power 1935 introduced a 13 round magazine.I hope this helps with understanding that these tools have been around for a long time in very much their current form.",93 followers,Kevin Oliver,2.4K,13K,18.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Are-the-small-arms-still-advancing-technologically-If-so-what-is-the-latest-technological-advancement-in-small-arms

However, there are no fundamental problems with the idea, it’s just a matter of chemistry/materials and production techniques. If someone wanted to sink the resources into developing it fully it would probably happen.BBPS is a more fundamental mechanical change. Essentially the entire action and barrel are able to recoil inside the weapon frame. This allows an extremely rapid burst of several rounds to be fired in a single recoil impulse. The end result is a burst of rounds fired with the same accuracy as a single shot, and they all strike the target near-simultaneously very close to each other.That’s pretty scary, but luckily the added complexity means it’s found little traction. First seen on the prototype G11 rifle from the 80s it’s only been taken up by the Russian AN-94 rifle.The G11 was notable because it included all three of the technologies I’ve highlighted. It was a bullpup(ish), firing caseless ammo and it could do a 3-round BBPS burst. The US military trialled it in the late 80s and the German forces came very close to adopting it in the early 90s, but then the Cold War ended and everybody was looking for a “peace dividend”.None of these could really be described as “game changers” in that they would render everything else obsolete, but there’s very little else going on in small arms development. The US is still using an updated version of a rifle from the 1960s, and the Russians are using one based on a rifle from the 1940s. All modern assault rifles can draw a direct line back to a German rifle from WW2, and the ammunition they fire hasn’t changed much since the 1860s.If you want to “update” rifle into the 21st century your only real option is to add gizmos to it, which is why everything is covered in rails these days. You can add all the lasers and fancy sights stuck all over , but the bit in the middle ain’t gonna change any time soon.","20,087 followers",Ben Kolber,11.1K,324,21.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Are-the-small-arms-still-advancing-technologically-If-so-what-is-the-latest-technological-advancement-in-small-arms

And room for more apps in future, potentially connected to helmet mounted gear including a sight picture, so soldiers can see around corners using the gun sight. Eventually being linked to unit commanders and battle management computers. Allowing every soldier to be tracked by commanders. And send orders or information.To go with the armies advanced optic, they are also introducing a new SIG Sauer rifle with longer range accuracy using the sights and improved armour penetration.

This helped make the Bitch an effective contact breaker if an SASR patrol was ambushed or encountered a larger enemy force. Some of the SASR troopers also had the barrels of their M16s shortened to produce a similar, although less impressive effect.A front pistol grip was usually added to make the Bitch more controllable during full automatic fire.

It dates back to ancient times but an exact date is uncertain:Why none of these inventions were developed further (Hero’s steam engine was never used for anything other than a toy and a curiosity) is not clear. One hypothesis I’ve heard is that since slavery was so prevalent in the Ancient World people didn’t feel the need to develop mechanical devices powered by steam or other forms of energy. There may be something to this, as the slave holding states in the US before the Civil War were the most economically undeveloped and the South was much less industrialized than the North.
