1,"In my lab at MIT we are conducting an experiment that will easily earn us the Nobel Prize in Physics, at the very least. It is about isolating a cosmic ray in the wild, taming it and teaching it to sing ""Signed, Sealed, Delivered” accompanied by a ukulele. The object is to demonstrate that cosmic rays do not constitute a threat but that properly channeled they can be useful to humanity, either as a source of energy, or to liven up weddings and parties.Science is bananas!Digital art by John SchwegelIn my lab at MIT we are conducting an experiment that will easily earn us the Nobel Prize in Physics, at the very least.

2,"Transfer learning in ML models.Humans are really good at generalizing. We only have to see a few dogs before we can recognize a dog when we see one.Machines are not. ML models require millions of examples before forming a reliable classifier, and that classifier is very specific to the data on which it was trained. If your training data doesn't include dogs with three legs, the model won't recognize them. A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one.

A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one. It's hypothesized that the reason humans learn so quickly is that we are fitting new examples into our existing knowledge rather than forming entirely new categories. If we could teach machines to do the same, they would learn exponentially faster and apply that learning more effectively.Transfer learning is a very hot topic in AI research right now, so I expect major breakthroughs in the next few years. I think this may be sufficient to achieve artificial general intelligence, but even if not, it will dramatically extend the range of tasks that machines can accomplish.","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,631,1.5K,2.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-current-revolutionary-ideas-in-science-and-technology
3,"I will probably get flamed/downvoted for this answer but here is a roundabout way of getting to your answer anyways...first of all, what do you mean by change the world? Do you want to make sure more people have products like iPhone or a flying car? iPhone is an amazing phone but it cant feed hungry stomachs or provide love to orphans. Plus there are lot of stories of environmental and labor violations that the manufacturers of iPhone are responsible for. So change can only go so far...When I was in college in the US, I met a lot of well meaning (mostly white) kids who ""wanted to change the woI will probably get flamed/downvoted for this answer but here is a roundabout way of getting to your answer anyways...first of all, what do you mean by change the world? Do you want to make sure more people have products like iPhone or a flying car? iPhone is an amazing phone but it cant feed hungry stomachs or provide love to orphans. Plus there are lot of stories of environmental and labor violations that the manufacturers of iPhone are responsible for. So change can only go so far...When I was in college in the US, I met a lot of well meaning (mostly white) kids who ""wanted to change the world"". Some thought we needed a revolution following the footprints of Che Guevara. One girl even decided she wanted to empower African Americans living in Chicago projects. She left her comfortable suburban upper middle class confines of the Minneapolis for Chicago to do social work in the ghetto (so far so good) every now and then, and got herself a nice fancy condo with her best (and equally rich) pals in the trendy Lake Shore neighborhood hoping to emulate the lifestyle of Friends sitcom. She even made a few black friends along the way, but when the day was over and night began, she happily made her way back to her hipster neighborhood for parties and left her black friends to their own devices back in the ghetto.The point I am making here is that this work and thoughts of hers, while well meaning and noble, were ultimately useless because she wanted to do things that didn't exact any real price or discipline from her. Changing the world isn't easy. It will exact a price from you. You will be insulted and humiliated and even thrown in prison. That is the price for wanting to affect real change for the better of humanity, not living in a fancy condo with the heart warming assurance that the police always have the backs of the right groups of people. You have to break free of your own preconceived notions of the other and embrace it. Why couldn't she find a room to rent in the south side of Chicago? See what actually happens to people she wants to help in the night time? the police injustices, the gang wars, the redlining etc. Gandhi, MLK, Schindler, JFK helped changed the societies around them for the better, and they paid a serious price for their work. If you make a billion dollars for making an amazing product, good for you. I will consider you very smart and a good businessperson with a vision, but world saver.....not so much. you probably spent a lot of late sleepless nights working your ass off to make a good product but most likely the environment or someone else in a third world country is really paying the price.You could be a doctor working in the slums of Calcutta or a rich doctor working in the comfortable suburbs of Chicago. You could be an engineer showing some poor country in Africa how to tap into acquifer for water and how to preserve these amazing natural resources or you could be a upper middle class engineer working for Google. You could be a social worker listening to spoilt rich kids whine about why their parents didnt buy them another Mercedes for their birthday or you could chose to do social work for people who lost their family in a genocide. You could also make a simple device or devise a process to help people grow more food or help erase an epidemic or get clean water.But there is always a tradeoff...always a price to pay.

As the boy walked, he paused every so often and as he grew closer, the man could see that he was occasionally bending down to pick up an object and throw it into the sea.  The boy came closer still and the man called out, “Good morning!  May I ask what it is that you are doing?”The young boy paused, looked up, and replied “Throwing starfish into the ocean. The tide has washed them up onto the beach and they can’t return to the sea by themselves,” the boy replied. “When the sun gets high, they will die, unless I throw them back into the water.”Change the world around you, i.e. your world; it is already a great start.",UNKNOWN,Eirene .S.,519,0,0,2014,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-current-revolutionary-ideas-in-science-and-technology

With that said, here are the few that comes to mind.DECENTRALIZATIONHere your in charge of what you are doing and have no fear of what could possible happen the next very minute because of some central authorities, govts, grps or individuals who are in control. Here you have an absolute control of what happens and how its happens.AUTONOMYIts a way similar to the above but quite different. You are in charge of your decisions , how you decide to take actions and the level of devotion and use is absolutely at your mercy. No one checks you.PRIVACYYour identity is hidden and no one knows who your are except on some few cases where you have to submit documents for verification like what we have with most of our exchanges. And I believe this would soon be addressed with decentralized exchanges.INCORRUPTIBLEHere, we have ledgers or permanent records of transactions and algorithms shared among nodes or computers all around the word connected to that particular block chain which quite makes it unbackable and incorruptible.IT CAN'T BE SHUTDOWN OR DISTROYEDImagine shutting down the internet as close to impossible, so also very quite impossible to shutdown blockchain.
