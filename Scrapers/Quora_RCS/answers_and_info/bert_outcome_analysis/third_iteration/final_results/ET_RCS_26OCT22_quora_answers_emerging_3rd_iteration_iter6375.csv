Different designs compete with one another for the favour of the people using it. Demand increases for the more successful designs, which prompts increased manufacturing of it, and so designs are “reproduced” to a degree dependent on their success. Very unsuccessful designs are discontinued. ie they go extinct.There are, however, some critical differences between how adaptions evolve in nature and how human technology advances as well.Human designers demonstrate imperfect foresight, while evolutionary processes demonstrate no foresight at all. While human designers aren’t perfect at predicted what new features they put into designs will be successful, they at least make the effort, while evolutionary processes cannot do this at all. Thus we find that changes in human technology, ie “mutations,” are not wholly random in their effects. There is a bias towards changes that improve designs, and we can see evidence of attempts to anticipate future potential challenges in human technology, but in evolution we see no such bias towards mutations that are advantages and no ability to anticipate future changes to the environment. Mutations happen, and then they are tested in the environment during the lifespan of the organism, and likelihood that the mutation will be helpful or not is wholly random.Human designs also demonstrate evidence of discontinuity. Which is to say that every once in a while human designers can eliminate/remove/destroy a part or even a whole design, go “back to the drawing board” and start over to produce a wholly new design (which hopefully is an improvement). We see this in the progression of cars where the originally steering mechanism, based on a ship’s tiller, suddenly gets replaced by a wheel. We see it again in the progression of airplanes where piston engines, which had been steadily incrementally improving for some time, get suddenly replaced by a completely unrelated technology, the jet engine.Evolutionary processes cannot produce such large scale discontinuities. An vital organ cannot simply disappear one generation and then replaced by a new, better organ with a different design the next. An organ either has to transform, step by step, into an improved version, with each intermediate still working (akin to a piston engine transforming into a jet engine by replacing one part at a time, with each intermediate version still being able to fly better or at least equal to its predecessor in the chain), a the new organ has to evolve from some other organ, while the original organ remains fully functional, until the new organ becomes superior to the original, takes over its function, followed by the original gradually dwindling away and then disappearing. And each intermediate possessing both the original organ and the nascent new organ has to be equal to and superior to the original organ alone. This would be akin to a jet engines slowly developing one step at a time, from the machine guns on a piston plane’s wings, while the original piston engine in the nose continues to fly the plane, with the machine gun/jet engine intermediates doingHuman technology further differs from evolved adaptions by being externally replicated, and thus their design does not have to be limited by the need to self-replicate. Cars are made in factories that do not have to remain associated with the cars they produce. Imagine how car design would be limited if every car had to include within it all the machinery necessary to build another car of the same make and model, to essentially have a mini-car factory somewhere inside it. All evolved organisms, on the other hand, must maintain self-replication capacity, and thus any potential alteration can only be added if it can be inserted seamlessly in the pre-existing self-replication mechanism without screwing that process up. (In animals that means its embryological development sequence)Finally human technology differs from evolved adaptions in the possession of external purpose. Human technology functions in ways that benefit a second party, (usually the humans who use the technology) and not necessarily themselves. A bomb’s ability to explode provides no benefit to the bomb itself. Evolved adaptions in living organisms, however, must provide a benefit to that organism. No adaption can exist that exclusively benefits a second party. Adaptions can evolve that benefitThese are some of the hallmark features that separate designed things from naturally evolved things. We see these features in human designs all the time (and we have no verifiable example of any other intelligent designer) but they have never to date been found in any living organism on earth that has not been modified by humans. This is what we mean when we say that life on earth has thus far demonstrated no evidence of non-human intelligent design.",0 followers,Claire Jordan,678,45.6K,295.7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/If-species-evolve-by-random-mutation-and-natural-selection-how-is-that-different-from-human-advances-in-technology-since-both-are-trial-and-error

3,"See, this is a very insightful question. Evolutionary theory could just as well apply to non-living systems, with some inevitable fudging of the details.

Look at, say, motorized transportation. The original “motor” was some sort of draft animal, from dogs to oxen. These were popular, for various reasons, and indeed are found in use today. They have evolved over the years, but have stayed basically similar - the coelacanths of the motorized transport world… Then actual motors were developed - first the steam-powered ones, and then the internal combustion ones. In both cases, different ideas were tried out, and certain forms proved to be more popular for various reasons. These gradually replaced the earlier versions, in much the same way that evolution works in biological organisms - except that living things evolve through the process of reproduction mediated by selection, while non-living things evolve through the process of commercial sales mediated by selection. Steam-powered cars and trucks eventually became extinct, and the internal combustion versions are falling on hard times, but are still very abundant. However, the rise of the electrics is happening in spite of their worldwide dominance.

7,"Your premise is completely incorrect. Plant-based foods are less nutritious, ounce for ounce, than meat. True vegans have to jump through a lot of hoops and do a lot of meal balancing in order to get a complete diet. This is because we are evolved omnivores, not herbivores, and there are necessary nutrients in meat that just don’t easily exist in plants alone. Vegans almost always have to take supplements.

But human beings are extremely adaptable, even with our evolutionary history. Human diet ranges from the almost completely meat-based diets of groups like the Masai or the Inuit, to the very meat-sparse diets of some cultures in south east Asia.For human beings to universally adapt to an entirely plant-based diet will require not only genetic engineering of the plants, but probably also of us as a species. One of the first things we could do is start using CRISPR or something similar to make humans who can synthesize Vitamins C and B-12. But like I said, most people are squeamish about genetic experiments on human embryos (and don't get me wrong, I agree with that squeamishness_!)

Residential areas will be look less autocentric.  There will be massive retail vacancies and some class A office space will turn into a weak B or worse simply because of location.Office AreasWith the elimination of nearby parking as a destination condition, office complexes can be built closer to each other.  Typical non upper midwest/northeast cities have office structures with attached parking.  This is true in urban edge cities like Cumberland in Atlanta as well as Atlanta city midtown.  The land occupied by these parking structures would be more valuable as an office building if parking wasn't needed.  With faSDVs, parking isn't needed.  It will be a mile or two distant.  So office districts will look more like midtown Manhattan (in miniature).  The first non Manhattan picture below shows a streetview with office density and my guess that wider streets will be necessary.  The Shanghai office district picture shows density without cars....only instead of hiding cars close in below ground, they will miles away.​​​Since large numbers of workers will arrive and depart at the same time, the streetscape will be altered to facilitate the rapid dropoff of passengers close to office buildings.  For a cluster of high rise office buildings, there might be a single multi story (3 stories) drop off and pick up facility that is designed to handle thousands of vehicles in a very short amount of time.  The streets themselves might be (counter intuitively) wider to allow dedicated and fast empty faSDV dispersal to distant parking.  Streets might change direction depending on time of day...an outbound street for travel of empty faSDVs in the am might be reversed to allow the vehicles to stage themselves for evening pickup.RetailRetail will concentrate.  With faSDV easy pick up and drop off and co location with ultra dense office structures, retail will tend to see a network effect.  People will pass previously convenient shopping districts for 'better', more attractive and more popular districts.  The streetscape effect will be that of a busy shopping street without the parking garage visual impact.  The place 'everyone' will want to be.  And a lot of places that will fail and be empty but unseen because no one will be 'there'.  There could be 4 to 6 failed retail areas for everyone that prospers.  These areas will eventually transition into central area support (parking) or housing or distribution support (by faSDV delivery companies).Retail districts will look like some of the new shopping centers we see today except that they will lose the parking fields, on street parking and will be more than one street deep.  I think the Jacksonville, FL ST Johns Town Center is a good specific example.​​HomesFirst, the garage disappears.  faSDVs that are personally will be stored offsite.  Home design and streetscape views will be able to increase density without street or off street parking nearby.  Without driveways, the streetscapes will look more traditionally urban.  Actual density might decline.  The concentration of office & retail along with the absence of garages & parking might create enough new space to shift the balance away from mid rise structures (2 to 4 stories) to single family structures up to 3 stories high.Curb side areas might be reconfigured differently to facilitate human and material pickup and dropoff activity (area between curb and sidewalk).  In suburban areas, the driveway might be retained for pickup & dropoff.​​​​==========Note 1:  My scenario continues to expect that people will continue to travel in numbers averaging close to 1.  Individual transport via UBER like rentals or personally owned faSDVs.  I think ridesharing will be way less than what some experts predict.Note 2:  I expect that streetscapes will be different but still 'familiar' and recognizable.  But there will be differences and with time, the differences will be more dramatic.  The massive redevelopment will NOT occur with the introduction of the faSDV.  Redevelopment will occur when faSDVs hit critical mass (50% to 80%).  This is the point that will both free up space (excess close in parking) and will require the alteration of street dynamics to handle faSDV peak traffic.  Critical mass will also be the time when investors have 'certainty' that the cost of 'big' change will be safe.  This is because at this point faSDV inevitability is clear to all.Note 3:  To prevent faSDV congestion, I assume there will be government regulation preventing cruising by faSDVs, requiring pickup and dropoff reservations, requiring use of designated pickup and dropoff areas and requiring other faSDV control mechanisms.  It might include the need for 'permission' (or a toll) to enter certain office and retail districts.  These mechanisms will be largely invisible to passengers and handled by software that communicates directly with the faSDV AI.","527,820 followers",Adam D'Angelo,1.1K,990,33.5M,2016,https://www.quora.com/If-species-evolve-by-random-mutation-and-natural-selection-how-is-that-different-from-human-advances-in-technology-since-both-are-trial-and-error

Also to be noted information is power and some tech is proprietary so somethings may just not see that process.In respect to crime solving and policing efforts must be done to keep the government and private sector pretty close in terms of tech (utilization and comprehension). If for example private sector develops a new payment solution and creates jobs and services around that, there are hundreds of citizens that have studied the technologies and concepts that are used to create this payment system and they may choose to apply their knowledge to stretch the limits of that concept or take it to a grey area all together. (Think scamming a bar with a high ticket drinking tab to be paid by an underfunded prepaid gift card and leaving out of state versus, using magnetic data readers and wipers to change the numbers on a credit card). Two different crime scenarios that may have never existed before and did not exist when the tech was introduced. Over time people understand how things work and may change their behavior to react to societal changes. Even though that proprietary information of the inception of the credit card is not and will never be common knowledge there are tons of educated people that can review learned concepts and apply them to that task. It is the private sectors responsibility to have a good HR department that chooses strong willed and conscientious people. It its the govt and officials responsibility to react constantly to these types of scenarios. Law and government should react to how the people behave again creating early repercussions for ideas and tech that have not been in place for a long time hinders the potential of the tech in the long run.
