1,"Depends on what your definition of a good society. Also, no technology has not existed for 30,000 years or more. You want to look at what humans were like before technology?

People have used deepfake GAN software to create phony porn movies of Scarlett Johansson, for example.More recently, researchers have used a GAN to create a phony deepfake video of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg giving a creepy speech about how much power Facebook has:Bill Posters on Instagram: “‘Imagine this...’ (2019) Mark Zuckerberg reveals the truth about Facebook and who really owns the future... see more @sheffdocfest VDR…”This video is totally fake. It was created by a computer program, following a script written by the people who made it.Deepfakes can be used to show political figures saying or doing things they never said or did, which is potentially very damaging. There is some evidence that Russian trolls may be hard at work creating deepfake videos to spread across social media during the 2020 American election.What can we do? Right now, very little. Combatting deepfakes requires an educated and skeptical population with good critical reasoning skills who fact-check before they believe things.

It can do the job, much faster and perfectly.In manufacturing, research and development, and technology India doesn't even stand a chance against China. Comparing the two is preposterous. The pathetic state of Indian manufacturing can be gauged from the fact that 69 years after independence, India can't even manufacture products as simple as earphones. Yes, even your earphones are probably manufactured in China, though they might contain a Made in India tag, to fool the Indians.Comparing the two countries would be a great injustice to China. Most of Chinese people don't want their country to be compared with India, they think of it below their dignity, the same way we think of Pakistan.

Conservative designs meant longer life. The only innovative thing to come out of Japan is Honda’s CVCC engine that allowed them to operate without catalytic converters for a period of time. Once emissions standards were tightened, CVCC had to be put to bed and Honda reluctantly started using catalytic converters along with everyone else.Looking at the current landscape, you would have to agree that the one automaker that’s breaking boundaries and innovating above and beyond every other automaker is America’s own Tesla. When it comes to self driving technology, the companies at the forefront are Tesla, Waymo, and Uber.

By splitting the question I get a frame of reference and then the answer becomes fairly straight forward to comprehendThe answer to the first question is straight forward and India is much advanced compared to where we were in 2000. I am not going to elaborate this further because its for us to see. But should we be happy about it? That leads us to my second questionWhile it is true that India has advanced immensely in the last 20 years, the real question is has this made us more dependent on other countries? Most notably the United States and recently China?Despite having a population of 1.3 billion people and being touted as the software superpower (thanks to the IT services industry) not so long ago, India does not have self-reliance when it comes to technology. China created companies like Ali Baba, Baidu and Tencent a parallel to the American tech giants while India (even India’s telecom minister recently) takes pride in being the largest consumer of Whatsapp, and Facebook! Yes almost everyone has a mobile phone in India today and therefore the opportunities for growth is tremendous. But the real question one should ask is, who will be the beneficiaries of these opportunities? The mobile phones used in India are Chinese phones and the software used in these phones are U.S owned. Basically all our data, from our shopping habits to our entertainment preferences are in the hands of foreign technology companies. Now we know IoT is catching up fast and that means more control to these companies and India will be a proud consumer supplying data.One of the many important aspects discussed in Rajiv Malhotra’s latest book “Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Power, Five Battlegrounds” is India’s military dependence on foreign technology. While the manufacturing of Rafale jets will happen in India, the technology is owned by the French and let’s understand when such technology transfers occur between countries, the supplying country will always provide a technology that is one generation behind to the consuming country. That means we are technologically and militarily advanced compared to our previous generations but we are at least one generation behind the innovating countries! In certain areas like military that is not good newsMy last point on this is our pride in our Human resource and how skilled we are! Yes as individuals many Indians are CEOs of big foreign tech giants. But how does that benefit India as a nation? Do we have a stake in the intellectual property of these products? Can we say for instance Sunder Pichai as Google’s CEO holds the same clout in his company as Mark Zuckerberg holds in Facebook? Certainly not! Let’s not confuse individual brilliance with technological advancement as nation.For India to have a grand standing in the world stage as a technologically advanced nation, we need to come out of our consumer mindset and to quote Rajiv Malhotra’s words “be producers of knowledge and technology”.",289 followers,Deepak Mehta,1K,3.9K,105.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-advanced-technology-in-automobile-in-India

9,"Have you ever been hunting? Your question certainly makes me think you never have. Hunting, even with a firearm is not easy. There are many more aspects to hunting than just the kill. Even when using a firearm taking home meat and a trophy are far from guaranteed. Hunters take pride in accomplishment. Sometimes that accomplishment is nothing more than getting out and doing something hard, even if they are unsuccessful. Sometimes the kill is easy, but the work to get the meat home is really hard. Sometimes the shot itself is difficult, and can only be made by someone with practice and skill. SoHave you ever been hunting? Your question certainly makes me think you never have.

Sometimes the kill is easy, but the work to get the meat home is really hard. Sometimes the shot itself is difficult, and can only be made by someone with practice and skill. Sometimes the pride is just in the fact that you can do something for yourself that very few people can. Even if the shot is on a rabbit from your back porch, there is still pride that you know how to procure your own food.I would counsel you, dear questioner, to evaluate your preconceptions and excise them of the soft bigotry so often found in the anti-gun/anti-hunting movements. Just because you assume something is easy does not mean it actually is, and slandering a whole group of people, even implicitly, is not a nice thing to do.","91,615 followers",Roland Bartetzko,4.3K,3.4K,314.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Can-a-society-without-technology-be-as-good-as-a-society-with-really-advanced-technology

It is obvious by the outward view of that there were some performance matrices that  GT Advanced Technologies had to achieve and perhaps not achieving certain goals would trigger events.I think it is clear that Apple would have liked to have had the Apple Watch ready for sale in the same calendar year it was announced.  It is unprecedented for Apple to announce a major product with such a long delivery time.  This may be directly related to the availability of high quality Sapphire from  GT Advanced Technologies.It may also be clear that Apple wanted to have an iPhone 6 model using  Sapphire as there are many patents Apple has filed that refer to the advanced strengthening technologies and innovation Apple has been working on.   The iPhone 6 series uses enhanced Gorilla Glass and it may be directly related to the availability of high quality Sapphire from GT Technologies.Thus one can conclude that  GT Advanced Technologies, with an Apple loan commitment of $578 million, perhaps tied to performance, and now  by virtue of a bankruptcy filing, it seems that  GT Advanced Technologies may have lost the Apple contract or at very least has a much smaller role to play in the future.   There is very likely a trigger for early loan repayments where in June, 2014 they had over $333 million and today they are showing $85 million.   If Apple called the entire $578 million loan it is clear that GT Advanced Technologies did something with over $300 million in just a few months.GT Advanced Technologies held very valuable patents and controlled the most advanced processes for high quality Sapphire crystal production.

GT also will eventually have to start paying back the loan. And they may (or may not) have lost their largest customer. Not to mention that the equipment in Apple's factory will stay as collateral.GT then filed for bankruptcy in order to get the protections that this allows them while handling the huge cash-flow and balance sheet fuckup they currently have.
