1,"I've answered this before so I'll be brief. Despite the recent advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning, you will be able to have a long, rewarding career in Radiology for decades to come. Radiology is heavily technology based and as long as you are comfortable with technology, you will adapt to being assisted by these new technologies. It will be “augmented intelligence” long, long, long before it is “artificial intelligence”.",UNKNOWN,Bessie J.

2,"The future of Radiology is bright and wide open with opportunity. Medicine is, of course, a broad domain with clinical, research, educational, administrative and management opportunities. So too is Radiology.Clinical radiology is not going to go away. As mentioned by others, any hands on radiology from fluoroscopic exams to Interventional Radiology will need the human touch and will only be rendered more accurate and efficient by ongoing technology developments. Even the interpretation of diagnostic studies will require a human eye-brain for the foreseeable future. Yes, inroads are being madeThe future of Radiology is bright and wide open with opportunity. Medicine is, of course, a broad domain with clinical, research, educational, administrative and management opportunities. So too is Radiology.Clinical radiology is not going to go away. As mentioned by others, any hands on radiology from fluoroscopic exams to Interventional Radiology will need the human touch and will only be rendered more accurate and efficient by ongoing technology developments. Even the interpretation of diagnostic studies will require a human eye-brain for the foreseeable future. Yes, inroads are being made in computer aided detection and diagnoses but there are tens of thousands of imaging observation/pathophysiology inferences to be made and as yet automated system have attacked only a handful. Yes, this will accelerate but it will take decades to train, test and validate a ‘universal’ medical imaging interpretation AI. So, interpretation work will change slowly but in a way in which radiologists will be able to adapt and continue to add value to patient care.Then, there are always unlimited opportunities for research in medical imaging; new uses for existing modalities, new modalities, new post-processing and analyses and disease inferences.The same is true for opportunities in education, whether in radiology, radiologic technology, anatomy and radiologic anatomy, appropriate use of imaging, etc.Lastly, there are plenty of opportunities to work in the ‘business of medical imaging’, whether running a section, department, (or an institution), or working for a medical imaging vendor.So, I say that Radiology is a great medical specialty with plenty of opportunity and a notably good specialty for those with technical/nerd/coder/hacker background.","135,499 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.5M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-ruin-the-radiology-profession-in-the-next-20-years

5,"I have been a Neuroradiologist for over twenty years. I work at a teaching hospital and trauma center. My primary role is to interpret images reflecting the anatomy and pathology of the brain, head and neck, and spine. Most studies are CT and MR examinations, cross sectional images.I sit in a dark room most of the day. I took the liberty, though, of setting up some great ambient lighting and decorating the workspace in a museum like way. This is less stressful on the eye and also provides a stimulating environment.The studies come through on a PACS workstation.

I took the liberty, though, of setting up some great ambient lighting and decorating the workspace in a museum like way. This is less stressful on the eye and also provides a stimulating environment.The studies come through on a PACS workstation. Often, I am sometimes provided with little clinical history. I scroll through hundreds of images in search of abnormalities. An uninitiated person might look at each individual pixel. This is highly inefficient. A seasoned veteran usually has a search pattern he or she has developed. It is a bit like being a CSI investigator. I look for subtle clues and signs that may reveal a difficult to see lesion, or which may help suggest whether the lesion is benign or harmful.Many of the cases are normal and this sometimes can get repetitive. The interesting cases though make it all very worthwhile. I always tell my friends that you never want me to get to excited when I look at your films. That likely means there is an unusual finding which may not be good for you.I am fortunate to have residents and medical students that I teach. I enjoy sharing with them my methods for detecting abnormalities and for thinking about differential diagnoses.I don’t interact with patients too much, unless on those special occasions when I am performing procedures. I do, however, enjoy meeting with clinicians and residents from other departments. It is always nice to get the real scoop on a case in person. Sometimes I miss the days of being an intern in medicine and making the rounds on the floors. Now, people come to me.Radiologists spend a lot of time sitting. Some of the more innovative departments have standing workstations and even treadmills. Nevertheless, you are in front of a computer and not really going anywhere. To compensate, I have become a rather active endurance athlete, participating and training for triathlons and other races. This Sunday, I will be running my first marathon, in NYC.I find it very gratifying to know that I have used my talents to help people. I am an artist and a photographer, and I have an inherent visual ability. I have no doubt that my powers of perception give me an edge and also make my daily routine very enjoyable.","44,298 followers",Kurt Guntheroth,575,13.7K,167.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-ruin-the-radiology-profession-in-the-next-20-years

And yeah, they’re a hell of a lot better than fighting somebody without one.But, here’s the thing about powered exoskeletons: the person within the exoskeleton limits the exoskeleton’s capabilities. Suddenly, the exoskeleton has to account for a person’s heat tolerance, the types of forces a person can withstand, a person’s range of motion… It’s a mess.Wouldn’t it just be smarter to design a robot instead of an exoskeleton, and man it remotely?

10,"There are several major trends that impact the future of aviation.The first is climate change, and the necessity to change aspects of aviation. I spent 90 minutes recently recording a podcast with CEO Anders Forslund of Heart Aerospace. They have pre-orders for 200 19-passenger electric airplanes, and target of 2026 for certification. They are only one of the many firms engaged in hybrid-electric and alternative fuel airplanes, so decarbonization will be occuring. The transition will be starting within 10 years, so many short- and medium-haul flights will have transitioned.

They are only one of the many firms engaged in hybrid-electric and alternative fuel airplanes, so decarbonization will be occuring. The transition will be starting within 10 years, so many short- and medium-haul flights will have transitioned. Far from a majority, but we’ll be seeing a fair amount of quieter planes in the air delivering passengers.The second is COVID-19. It pushed the world a decade forward into a travel-free business world. Zoom meetings and virtual conferences are here to stay for the majority of people, and they aren’t going away. This means that the current lull in passenger travel will not see a return to the same levels of business travel, possibly ever.The third is also COVID-19. People who used to fly regularly for fun have found alternative ways to enjoy themselves. Many people will remain hesitant to get in enclosed aluminum tubes with strangers even when COVID has been reduced to an annual flu shot.Many of the planes which are mothballed today due to COVID will never return to the air.Less air travel. More carbon-neutral air travel. Less aircraft noise. Less aircraft related air pollution.Better all around.","68,766 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,1.2K,17.3K,413.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-ruin-the-radiology-profession-in-the-next-20-years
