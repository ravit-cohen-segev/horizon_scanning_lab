0,"K Street. Politicians are in the public view and politicians are constantly bombarded by lobbyists (K Street in DC is famous for the numbers of lobbying firms there) representing corporations that design and build military equipment. And those politicians are famous for padding military appropriations both in procurement costs, and in adding pork (getting contracts to firms in their home states) to budget requests. And it takes a very close eye to see when a politician is seeing to it that major contributors to his/her campaign is being rewarded for the contributions by getting contracts. TheK Street.

And it takes a very close eye to see when a politician is seeing to it that major contributors to his/her campaign is being rewarded for the contributions by getting contracts. The temptation is great. Supply the congressman (not infrequently illegally) with a couple of million in bundled campaign contributions, and end up with a twenty- billion dollar contract. And then those contracts keep getting padded with materials upgrades and service contracts over subsequent years. Then get a nice little war going somewhere and make even more money while the politician gets paid off in a bunch of different ways. It isn’t accidental that most pols go into office with a couple of hundred thousand net worth and within ten years are multi-millionaires.","12,288 followers",Angela Stockton,602,25.6K,139.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/In-Eisenhowers-farewell-address-he-warned-against-two-upcoming-problems-the-scientific-technological-elite-and-the-military-industrial-complex-Why-is-it-that-the-military-industrial-complex-gets-much-more-attention
1,"It depends what one means by disruption.Apple has frequently been undercut by copycat products at lower prices, but the company tends to maintain it’s model of dominating the profitable end of the market.Apple is probably pleased this happens, because if they owned an entire market segment, they could be accused of being a monopoly.It’s interesting why no one has even come close to mirroring Apple’s business model. No one has attempted to do the same.No company has set out to make a best-in-category product, price it properly and support it properly.Instead they try something else.

No one has attempted to do the same.No company has set out to make a best-in-category product, price it properly and support it properly.Instead they try something else. Both Windows and Android are software platforms available to multiple vendors. Consumers know that all Android phones are essentially the same.This results in zero consumer loyalty and stickiness to individual brands.So to pick up sales, the vendors then compete aggressively on price. No one makes any money, no one can then afford to innovate, and we end up with a lot of profit-free generic hardware, leaving the top end entirely open for Apple to hoover-up all of the profits.It’s worth noting that both Microsoft and Google have independently seen the light.Microsoft is now making their own Surface branded hardware. And Google is pushing the Pixel phone. But as long as they torpedo their own hardware by licensing the software to OEMs, this is never going to be a workable strategy.","58,988 followers",Michael Wolfe,504,2K,17.3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/In-Eisenhowers-farewell-address-he-warned-against-two-upcoming-problems-the-scientific-technological-elite-and-the-military-industrial-complex-Why-is-it-that-the-military-industrial-complex-gets-much-more-attention
