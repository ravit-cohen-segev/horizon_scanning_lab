My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","220,646 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,783.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-chances-that-a-nuclear-fusion-reactor-will-be-commercially-available-within-the-next-50-years

Hydrogen production was a new feature for HACER and differentiated that power plant design from LANL and LLNL PACER fusion.Above is an artist's conception of a PACER fusion ""energy park ""which shows a large combustion cavern about 1 mile deep and 200 meters in diameter. A deuterium- deuterium fuel charge would be exploded here in the range of a 1 to 20 kiloton TNT yield. The cavity, filled with superheated steam, would absorb and quench the fusion fireball and act as a transport medium to carry thermal energy and by-products.Hacer: A Grand Design for Fusion Powerhttp://wlym.com/archive/fusion/fusion/19801111-fusion.pdfIn the 1950s, after development of the H-bomb, U.S. researchers at LANL and LLNL national laboratories developed a project known as Pacer, aimed at peaceful applications of nuclear explosions. The H- bomb, of course, is typically portrayed as ""uncontrolled"" release of fusion energy using a relatively small fission (A-bomb) trigger. What the Pacer project envisioned was the regular deto­nation of very small fusion bursts optimized for ultra-clean cost effective power generation in carefully designed, steam-filled caverns one mile underground, producing enormous amounts of electricity and, if desired, fissile material for startup of exceptionally clean operating fission reactors like Thorium Molten Salt Reactors or LFTRs.Most appealing about this approach presented by Dr. Seifritz is that there are only minor scientific and technical obstacles to the reali­zation of a Pacer-like power generating systems for harnessing fission-fusion and with only a few additional years of development, pure fusion energy. PACRER fission-fusion power plants could be undertaken immediately, on the basis of field proven existing technology and know-how, guaranteeing com­mercial fusion power within five years in a time frame that matters for solving worldwide climate and energy scarcity problemsWhy were PACER power plants, which would actually been 100X cleaner in terms of production of Minor Actinides and fission product high level nuclear waste, canceled by the Nixon Administration?President Nixon had made campaign promises to the American people to rein in federal spending, and the Nixon Administration searched for ways to trim spending. Leading edge nuclear fusion research, unfortunately, came to the attention of Nixon Administration budget managers and several visionary nuclear technologies then under development including Molten Salt Fission Reactors and PACER fusion were cut as President Nixon tried to keep his promise to the American people in reining in federal spending.In addition, environmental and ""nonproliferation"" arguments were put forward in Congress intending to force discontinuation of the Pacer projects at LANL and LLNL. These arguments, however, lacked technical validity.The underground mounted PACER reactor could be located far away from any community, operate very safely in a conservatively designed underground PACER cavern, and pose no nuclear haz­ards to populated areas of the globe while safely and sustainably producing ultra-clean DD fusion power used to produce commercial electricity.Dr. Ralph Moir led LLL efforts into producing PACER reactors in the mid-1970s.Modern versions of PACER would probably use pure fusion technology.A pure fusion peaceful nuclear explosive (PNE) optimized for ultra-clean power generation is a nuclear device design that does not need a fission ""primary"" to ignite fusion in a secondary stage but rather employs a pure fusion deuterium-tritium primary to ignite a pure deuterium power generating second stage.Pure fusion ICF devices produce small controlled bursts of fusion energy inside of 100 meter deep underground mounted evacuated mini-PACER cavity. When such a small fusion device is initiated inside its stainless steel cylindrical chamber, no shock and no sound is transmitted to the ground above.Vacuum will not permit transmission of sound.Vacuum will not permit transmission of shock.The mini-PACER device produces the Tritium it needs for the DT primary from Tritium produced via the D-D fusion reaction on the preceding shot. Tritium (190 milligrams) need only be supplied from an external source one time on the very first shot. All shots made in the mini-PACER reactor thereafter can be provided from Tritium bred in the reactor from residual Tritium scavenged from the fusion chamber debris left by previous D-D fusion shots. Thus Tritium supply is cheap and sustainable with the modern pure fusion form of PACER ICF; the vast majority of fusion energy produced by the mini-PACER reactor each shot is from cheap and ubiquitous Deuterium fuel separated from sea water.National governments have tended to respond with unreasonable fear to fusion reactor designs that produce power in short controlled fusion bursts. Much less technically mature and more difficult tokamak and stellarator reactors have for decades received funding preferentially over practical demonstrated ICF fusion approaches because they promised smooth power generation from extended continuous fusion burns as opposed to a series of many short, controlled fusion bursts. The reality is that tokamaks and stellarator fusion devices have not in 60 years attained burns producing any significant amount of power for more than a few seconds before the plasma confinement is lost and the fusion reaction stops.Reliable, repeatable, small controlled fusion bursts inside an evacuated chamber designed to safely contain all the radiation generated by fusion reactions is just as safe as the safest magnetic confinement continuous burn experiment. In all cases, the fusion reactions used are the same. Nuclear waste generated are in all cases also the same. Tiny mini-Mike fusion devices are harmless if stolen as they require large stationary lasers or ion beam particle accelerators to ignite them.Underground ICF pure fusion power generation is just as safe as the safest form of fusion that anyone has so far proposed and is a lot more rapidly implementable.Note 1: DOE during the cold war had a well funded and well led program to develop pure fusion experimental devices.(It 	may now be revealed)DOE published in 2001 the following document -RESTRICTED DATA DECLASSIFICATION DECISIONS 1946 TO THE PRESENThttp://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/rdd-7.htmlcontained in section C of that document are the following facts:Information on the DOE's pure fusion program:(1) Fact that the DOE made a substantial investment in the past to develop a pure fusion experimental explosive device(2) That the U.S. does not have and is not developing a pure fusion weapon; and(3) That no credible design for a pure fusion weapon resulted from the DOE investment. (98-15)(Point 3 may be disputed -Note 2:controlled and uncontrolled –but is this really true?Is there in reality two types of fusion?It is said that in uncontrolled nuclear fusion, vast amounts of energy in uncontrolled manner is released causing destruction only—the hydrogenbomb is an example. Thus uncontrolled nuclear fusion is not viewed as something of use for constructive purpose.It is perceived that in controlled nuclear fusion, the vast energy of fusion reactions is released steadily so it can be used for peaceful purposes, say, for nuclear fusion reactors.But is there really a differenceor is it just a perception?Is it perhaps true that there is really only one type of fusion and depending on the technology and the amount of fuel you use, you get a more or less rapid release of fusion energy.The truth is that during the 1950s, fusion program managers wanting to develop fusion reactors like tokamaks and stellarators sought to dissociate themselves and their fusion technology (good) from thermonuclear fusion weapons technology (bad) which the public feared. The notion of controlled versus uncontrolled fusion was largely public relations and spin employed by AEC fusion program managers to enlist wider public support.While the smoothness and the time of release of energy from fusion may be different, the fusion reactions (Deuterium Tritium or Deuterium-Deuterium) are all the same and the waste products produced (helium and neutrons) are all the same.",839 followers,Robert Gauthier,739,10.7K,3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-chances-that-a-nuclear-fusion-reactor-will-be-commercially-available-within-the-next-50-years

It’s far easier not to get into a chain reaction than to get into a chain reaction, since the nuclear fuel of fusion naturally repels each other. So they have to put in a tremendous amount of energy to get these atoms into a fusion chain reaction process. In the case of fusion bombs, they actually initiate the fusion reaction with a fission reaction of uranium or other fissile material. So you get two nuclear reactions for the price of one, a fission one is the primer, and the fusion one is the secondary and larger energy source. In controlled fusion, you can’t just set off a fission bomb to set off a fusion bomb, because you really don’t want a bomb at all as your basic goal.

But if you have enough heat and enough density then fusion only takes the briefest of moments. If a nuclear reaction happens at all it happens very, very fast.Of course the fusion in an H-bomb is, shall we say, “too fast” and “too big” to be controllable or useful. (Perhaps someday we will need an H-bomb or three to shove a comet off its collision course with Earth. That would be a useful thing to do with an H-bomb.)The sun controls the fusion within its core by balancing heat vs density. The extreme pressure in the core of the sun from the outer layers of the sun being pulled in by gravity provides the necessary density. And the extreme heat provides enough speed to the nuclei to overcome the protons’ repulsive force. Fusion increases the heat of the core thus making it expand and therefore lower the density thus controlling the rate of fusion. SeeOne fun fact about the sun is that each cubic meter of the core is generating far less energy than a lawn mower. It’s just that there areSo now that you have seen a couple of example of the heat and density needed for fusion to happen it is time to talk about why fusion here on Earth is so hard to achieve. (Achieve AND CONTROL. An H-bomb is not controllable once it detonates.)So I talked about high temperature and density needed to achieve fusion, but I didn’t put any specific numbers on it. Here are some numbers: The core of the sun “No machine we can build can withstand that kind of heat and pressure, so you ask how can we achieve controlled fusion here on earth? Well a lot of scientists are asking that question too and trying to come up with answers so we can build such a machine.It turns out that you can lower the pressure and therefore density to almost nothing (compared to the sun) and still achieve fusion IF you crank the temperature WAY UP to 100 million degrees Celsius (180 million degrees Fahrenheit) which is MUCH hotter than the interior of the sun. Even tho there is practically nothing there you still need a powerful machine to make that practically nothing — aThere are a couple (?) of human figures there for scale. They’re kind of brown. See if you can find them. This is a HUGE machine. So just WHY is it you need such a big machine?It turns out that the only way you can contain plasma that hot is by using a magnetic bottle. The “bottle” in ITER is a donut shape so you don’t have to worry about plasma escaping from the mouth of the bottle since there is no mouth. ITER is a large example of thePlasma is strange stuff. It does not always want to behave the way we want it to within a magnetic bottle. Plasma can have an electrical current flowing through itself, and said electrical current creates a magnetic field of its own which interacts with the magnetic bottle. So the plasma can start to move around inside the magnetic bottle and even escape the magnetic bottle and touch the metal outside the magnetic bottle. When that happens a small amount of metal is vaporized and flows into the magnetic bottle and instantly cools the plasma and fusion stops.Here is a video showing a run of the COMPASS tokamak. The video is just over a minute but the actual time depicted is about 290 milliseconds, about the time it takes you to blink. You can see the plasma build up, start to pulse, move downward and then quickly flame out at about the minute mark on the video when the plasma broke out of the magnetic bottle.The first high-speed color video from the COMPASS tokamakHowever it turns out that the plasma is easier to control as the magnetic bottle gets bigger and stronger, hence the huge size of ITER and that, in turn, is the main reason which makes fusion outside of the sun and H-bombs so hard and expensive. (And you thought thatThere are of course other problems, big ones, that the scientists and engineers have to solve:The list above is more than just the tip of the iceberg, but fusion is a complex and deep subject with many, many tough problems to be solved. Even so I hope they keep doing the research.Of course all of the above would be negated by some as yet undreamed of miracle discovery. But as of this point in time magnetic bottles are the best we can do, so we have to live with their limitations.PS: Meanwhile let’s start spending some real money to perfect commercial Gen 4 fission reactors for power generation. That would take far less R & D money and yield results much faster.)PPS: See also",457 followers,Jason Heinisch,1K,1.2K,2.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-chances-that-a-nuclear-fusion-reactor-will-be-commercially-available-within-the-next-50-years
11,"No, probably not.So, the main stopping block to nuclear fusion is the lack of homogeneity in the plasma, which is only made worse with a smaller reactor, not better. Let me explain. Most attempts at fusion use a toroid design (a big donut shape) with the ionized gas being accelerated by large electromagnets around the outside.While this process does turn some of that gas to plasma, meaning a dissoNo, probably not.So, the main stopping block to nuclear fusion is the lack of homogeneity in the plasma, which is only made worse with a smaller reactor, not better. Let me explain. Most attempts at fusion use a toroid design (a big donut shape) with the ionized gas being accelerated by large electromagnets around the outside.While this process does turn some of that gas to plasma, meaning a dissociated jumble of ions, it does not turn all of it to plasma. That is problem number one. The second problem is that a plasma now is filled with charged particles that have, you guessed it, their own little magnetic fields. This means that they mess with the other ions in unpredictable and unwanted ways. This lack of uniformity means that you need to have bigger and more expensive magnets to push them back in line and behave. This means that you need a bigger reactor and more power to get the thing going.The last factor that makes size a big deal is just the...","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-chances-that-a-nuclear-fusion-reactor-will-be-commercially-available-within-the-next-50-years

Brushes containing Po-210 are used to remove accumulated dust from photographic films and camera lenses. Static eliminators typically contain from one to tens of GBq of radioactivity.Po-210 emits so many alpha particles each second that the energy released from one gram is 140 watts, and a capsule containing about half a gram wPo-210 is used in neutron sources when it is mixed or alloyed with beryllium.It is also used in devices that eliminate static electricity in machinery where it can be caused by processes such as paper rolling, manufacturing sheet plastics, and spinning synthetic fibres.

Static eliminators typically contain from one to tens of GBq of radioactivity.Po-210 emits so many alpha particles each second that the energy released from one gram is 140 watts, and a capsule containing about half a gram will spontaneously reach a temperature of 500°C. As a result it has been used as a lightweight heat source to power thermoelectric cells in satellites. A Po-210 heat source was also used in each of the Lunokhod rovers deployed on the surface of the Moon, to keep their internal components warm during the lunar nights. Polonium is not subject to IAEA safeguards.MEMS based mirrors are used in image projectors by moving tiny mirrors using electrostatic forces. Digital Light Processing (DLP) is a display device based on optical micro-electro-mechanical technology that uses a digital micromirror device. It was originally developed in 1987 by Larry Hornbeck of Texas Instruments. Advances have been made since then.MEMS-based pico projector displayA solid state fusion reactor consists of a layer of polonium is placed in silicon channels and beryllium sheets are moved into and out of these channels to increase and decrease neutron flux from the system.A milligram of Po-210 produces 185 billion alpha particles per second.

So,Zn-64 + n → Zn-63 + 2 n + (-11.0 MeV) → Cu-63converts that energy to heat, and multiplies the reaction.So, 1 milligram of Po-210 produces 185 billion alphas which result in 370 billion neutrons which result in 1.328 Watts of power.Structuring the Zinc-64 so that there were 10 multiplication is 1.36 kW - The Zinc can be operated separately so that the system had a variable multiplier. That means as the Polonium decayed to 6.8% of its initial activity in 18 months, power levels are maintained.The entire device is housed within a neutron containment built into the chip and the chip is further encased in reflective material.High Neutron Reflector MaterialsThese are built in arrays and last for 18 months when the alpha source required replacement. This involves taking the ‘stator’ array and recoating it with 1 milligram of Polonium and putting the system back together. All in a clean room environment.So, you would trade these things in like LPG bottles.They are the size of a hockey puck and screw into a free piston Stirling engine which produces AC power on a continuous basis for a hybrid vehicle, or a hybrid home - and batteries produce power up to 50 kW for the home or 300 kW for the auto as needed being recharged by the constant 2 kW source.The rotor materials are also analysed and restored as well - prior to reuse.The entire system sits in a hot water tank and is quite efficient, producing 500 W electrical power and 860 W of heat. A bank of four of these provide adequate power to keep your electric auto fully charged, or a similar power train keep your home fully charged as well.Replacement ‘puck’ may be purchased at your hardware store, with a trade-in. The system is designed for owner service.The ‘Mr. Fusion’ device has ‘firing order’ labeled on each puck - 1,2,3,4 and a replacement date - generally - even pucks are every 20 weeks - odd pucks every 19 weeks. Since replacement date is fixed at date of issue - it does not help to stock pile units.Home service centers as well as auto service centers will service your car and home without any worry.",104 followers,Paul Clifford,774,16.7K,9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-detonate-thermonuclear-devices-in-large-deep-bodies-of-water-to-heat-the-water-then-extract-energy-from-the-heated-water-to-generate-electricity
15,"Because the pressures and temperatures required for fusion are extremely difficult to produce. As a material heats up, it wants to expand, this stops fusion from happening. The center of a star has trillions of tonnes of mass squeezing it together, so it’s easily able to maintain the required conditions. A fusion reactor has to use other means to keep the reaction mass together (inertial or magnetic confinement), which is not easy to do.",UNKNOWN,Ernest W.
