This is because they still had the relationship and hence the loan from Apple.However, rumors are that the relationship has gone sour, with Apple calling in the debt owed (which could have been linked to GTAT's own performance). This resulted in cash flow problems for GTAT which wasn't doing very well on the revenue front either (e.g. They had predicted 80% revenue from Apple for 2014). It also appears that the trouble between GTAT and Apple has been going on for some time. In June, they had about $333 million, whereas now they have only about $85 million.So, while the company's cash flow situation was known, the trouble with Apple wasn't evident until much later. So even if there were signs, they were probably underplayed by the market, given Apple's backing.

Technology began to pass both ways, notibly SAAB’s on plug coil system.In the end GM bought SAAB out and presented their horribly flawed platform for SAAB to use in the new 900 to universal scorn. SAAB tried to make it better, they really did, but it was polishing a turd. All traces of SAABness are destroyed by the use of the entire structure of a crap repmobile.The 9-3 was better. The 9-5 much more SAAB-like and a good car. Then the new 9-3 abandoned everything that made a SAAB unique in being saloon (sedan) only, a grave misstep in my opinion. The chassis developments driven by SAAB helped Opel and Vauxhall move from the bottom of the pack to near the top.The old SAAB engine went replaced by a new all-alloy design with lots of SAAB influence.And once again SAAB were falling behind, using old platforms pushed from GM Europe.So a new platform was started to be shared between GMs many divisions and SAAB wanted their voice heard. This delayed development of the SAAB variant and it wasn't ready in time.The global crisis hits, SAAB has nothing new to sell and GM are tanking.GM sells SAAB as a name to bunch of overconfident employees who sell to a supercar manufacturer. Somewhere in there the new 9-5 is actually released and is a real SAAB, but it's too late and too risky in the post-crisis world.SAAB is once again bought by its employees.SAAB restructures as an all-electric car company, crosses its fingers and hopes.I mourn the loss of this great company - I love old 900s and have owned 3.

It started selling stuff, then started to develop their own computer hardware and software for it, then started selling those things to other companies. That’s the division called “Amazon Web Services” and its immensely profitable.So the question becomes (1) how long with Amazon continue to subsidize their sales arm when no-one is making money and the employees make next to nothing and (2) will some other company eat into its core business.I note that Bezos is pretty much on the sidelines now, and that didn’t work out well for a lot of computer companies, including Apple.",167 followers,Kamal Benipal,1.2K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Were-there-any-signs-that-GT-Advanced-Technologies-was-possibly-going-to-go-bankrupt

The Coopers who failed ended up making “dry barrels” that only held produce or things that wouldn’t spoil. There are very few people who know how to make a barrel today. Even Jack Daniels, the biggest barrel maker in the world, uses an automated process now because making them by hand is too slow. The art of coopering is dying. There are very, very few people who know how to make a barrel left in the world and fewer every year, yet barrel making was an advanced technology that changed the entire world for literally thousands of years.Incidentally. the most prolific barrel in the world today is the ASB or American Standard Barrel that hold 53 gallons because America makes more barrels than anyone else in the world. Many used Jack Daniels barrels are re-used to make other kinds of liquor in other parts of the world.Do you know who the highest paid man in the community was in “ancient times”? It was the Wheelwright.Making a wheel from wood with an axle that attaches to a cart and doesn’t fall apart within a mile or two is one of the most “advanced technologies” of all time. Without it, most civilizations would have failed or failed to spread. Cart wheels are complex and the forces must play against each other continuously to hold the wheel together as it rolls. A Cartwright made as much then as a jet airline pilot back does today. In the 1880s when the average wage was $1.50 a day, the Wheelwright was making 90 dollars a week. On the Mayflower they brought one single cart over to America and it was the most valuable thing on the ship manifest, worth more than 10 times the next most valuable thing on the ship.

Just that is visible in the archaeological record as a significant and relatively sudden change.And that’s nothing compared to what our own industrial society has been doing over the course of the past century or so. Things like leaded gasoline, the massive use of fossil fuels, and our toying with atomic energy has left all kinds of easily detectable chemical traces all over the planet. We routinely cut through hills to build roadways. We tear down entire mountains to mine for coal and minerals. We alter the courses of rivers and use dams to make new lakes. And we produce massive garbage dumps full of the broken and discarded products of our technological society with plastics, weird alloys from discarded electronics, and all kinds of other chemicals not found in nature. The changes we make to the environment are profound.So, then, how is all of that going away without a trace? It’s not. It can’t.

Blockchain and IoT, virtual and augmented reality - innovative solutions appear at all stages - from construction to home purchase and renovation.The termBlockchain for transactionsIn the real estate market (and residential real estate in particular), technology can ensure the speed and transparency of transactions. The main advantage of using blockchain is the elimination of intermediaries, which means that the risk of fraud is reduced.The first blockchain transaction for the sale of residential real estate took place in 2016 in Denmark using the Coinfy platform. The cryptocurrency of the transaction was Bitcoin. A blockchain-based deal for the sale of an apartment in Ukraine took place in 2017, at the peak of the heyday of the cryptocurrency market. At the same time, the seller was in the States. The platform for the transaction, according to WSJ, was the American startup Propy.VR and ARSolutions based on augmented and virtual reality allow potential clients to see a home before buying, designers - create an ideal project, and understand how furniture and accessories will look in the interior.Most of the buzz in recent years has been centered on the possibilities of virtual reality and touring spaces remotely using headsets. But for those who can still get to the space in person, augmented reality may be a way to build a deeper impression of a property. Unlike VR, augmented reality more closely mimics the real world but uses picture overlays that appear when viewing space in person.In real estate, augmented reality could potentially save brokers thousands of dollars by no longer having to physically stage a space, says John Passerini, vice president of interactive marketing at Sotheby’s International Realty.
