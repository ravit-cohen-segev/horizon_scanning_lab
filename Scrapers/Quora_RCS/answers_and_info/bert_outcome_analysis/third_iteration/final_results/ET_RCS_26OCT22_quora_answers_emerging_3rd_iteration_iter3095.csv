Finally, we had a domestic Tesla, and in 2011 Putin drove a Yo-mobil for the rolling cameras. Everything looked very bright and promising, but nothing came to fruition. No factory was built. No mass production was launched.The grand total of three Yo-mobils were manufactured. Appropriately, the king court’s jester politician Zhirinovsky bought one and managed to drive 300 miles, at which point the car refused to charge. A Mercedes Benz E-class picked him up.142 millions euro invested in the project had magically disappeared.Looks too good to be true? True.Marussia Sports CarFounded in 2007 by Nikolai Fomenko and partners, Marussia Motors set an ambitious goal of producing the first Russian racing car.They beat Yo-mobil and managed to produce forty four prototypes of varying degrees of (in)completion.Hundreds of millions of dollars went down the pipe, and in 2014 the project was shut down at a loss. The same year, Nikolai Fomenko sailed on his super-yacht into Dubai marina for the yacht-show.His super yacht was neither designed nor manufactured in Russia.Mr. Chubais, the head of Rosnano, a state venture fund, is giving Mr. Putin heads-up on how he’s blowing, sorry, spending budget moneyPlastic Logic 100 eBook ReaderThis e-book reader is based on the developments of the German company PlasticLogic. In 2011, it was on the verge of bankruptcy due to its failed product: the electronic book reader Que.But then Rusnano swooped in and the business of the PlasticLogic went uphill. Until it didn’t.Mr. Chubais paid off $50 million worth of PlasticLogic debts, and another $100 million was offered as a loan guarantee to build a plant in Zelenograd near Moscow. He sold the idea to the government that his eBook readers would be used instead of textbooks in all the schools of Russia. $700 million more were poured into the project.To cut the long story short, in 2012, the construction of the plant and the production of devices were abandoned altogether, citing economic inexpediency.Do you think Mr. Chubais got fired? It’s a rhetorical question.Prime minister Dmitry Medvedev said about YotaPhone, new Russian smartphone: “When Steve Jobs heard about YotaPhone, he was worried.”At the end of 2013, CEO of Rostec, owner of Yota Devices Ltd, ex-KGB general and Mr. Putin’s old friend, Sergei Chemezov presented the highly innovative Russian smartphone YotaPhone with two displays to Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.Observe, they always present their prototypes to the supreme leaders and not to the public.In Russia, government is your investor, your marketer, your consumer, your law, your freedom, your bank, and your career. Public doesn't count for much. They only need to be fed buckwheat and macaroni and entertained with TV fluff and parades.For some unbeknownst reason, all the smartphone components were produced in wealthy Singapore, the E-ink display was from aforementioned PlasticLogic, which explains why sale price was so high.In 2013, YotaPhone was sold for 499 euros. Grand total of 40,000 devices were sold by mid-2014.Riding on the back of their success, in 2014, Yotaphone 2 was released, and 22,760 units were sold.In 2017, Yotaphone 3 was released at the price of $450 with even fewer units sold.Hundreds of consumers await the release of the KGB general’s YotaPhone 4.Meet Boris, a man in Alyosha robot suit passing off as a robotIn December 2018, the story of a Russian cutting-edge life size robot that was the answer to Boston Dynamics’ robot, went on all the federal TV channels.During the nationall forum “Projectors” held in Yaroslavl, the life size robot Boris was showing some cool dance moves to the clapping audience.Turned out it was a human pretending to be a robot by wearing Alyosha robot suit.

For more than a decade we’ve been getting serious warnings as hospitals battled bacteria that have become resistant to virtually all antibiotics.The COVID-19 pandemic is serious, but it too is just a warning.

It used dry cables (the inner core was not grease filled, like marine cables), and the safety design factor was only 2, instead of the normal 6 or so for structures like bridges. In 1997, the load on the instrument platform was increased by 300 tonnes by the addition of the Gregorian dome, which not only increased the telescopes abilities, but also significantly increased the stress in old, degraded cables.It was recognised that the cables were degrading in the corrosive environment, and to that end they were covered in a layer of paint to seal them off from the air, and treated, dry air was blown continuously through the cable cores by fans. This system was not maintained however, and by 2007 the circulation fans were not running. The cable end sockets were also found to be faulty, with multiple flaws detected in the zinc plug material during a 2011 inspection.Individual wire breakages were common, and the operators got used to hearing them during operation. With every breakage, the cable lost 1/160 of its overall strength, and regular breakages should have stopped operation.In hindsight it’s easy to say that they should have done things differently. The obvious one would have been a replacement of the original dry cables with marine grade ones when the major rebuild in 1997 was undertaken. With the extra loading of the new heavy equipment it would seem reasonable to renew them, and upgrade to a higher safety factor. If done so the telescope could still be operating for decades to come, but the curse of all operations like this, money (or the lack of it), meant that they were not able to do what was needed from an engineering viewpoint.When it got to the point where one of the support cables had failed, it was too late to do anything as all the safety factor had been used up, and the structure was too fragile for anybody to work on.","68,777 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-advancing-technology-having-a-positive-or-negative-affect-on-the-natural-evolution-and-ability-of-humans-to-adapt-and-survive-in-the-world
