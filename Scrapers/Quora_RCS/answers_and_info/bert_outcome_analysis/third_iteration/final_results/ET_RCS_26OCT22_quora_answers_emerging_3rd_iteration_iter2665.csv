0,"Asking whether something in the natural world was “meant” to happen is fallacious, and pointlessly anthropomorphises the blind, mindless “forces” (or rather - occurences) that are what we call ‘natural order’. Which is basically stuff that happened to be that particular way when we first looked at it.The world has no purpose. Humans don’t “tamper” with nature, humans are a part of nature.

Lifeforms have settled into forms and survival strategies that worked well enough for their ancestors (which is why they have descendants).Human agriculture, pollution etc. have plainly complicated things for a number of other lifeforms. We have made some species go extinct, because they could not adapt quickly enough to the challenge we posed. Other species thrive in our presence. Dogs, in their current form, would not exist if humans were not here. Even chickens, that we raise to kill and eat, are in their way a tremendously successful species, far outnumbering many other kinds of birds. They have become successful by appealing to the human appetite.Were they “meant” to? Hardly. But this is what worked for them, and for us.As for human technology, history shows that thousands of years passed with quite limited progress. Then we had the industrial revolution, paving the way for more complicated technology later. Now we seem to be heading straight for superhuman computer intelligence at some point in this century, which could be a game-changer in ways that are currently incomprehensible.Was any of this “supposed” to happen?I do suspect that if you infect an earth-like planet with humans, however ignorant, they will after X thousands of years initiate an industrial revolution and produce a high-tech civilization. There is a potential there that will sooner or later express itself. If you could run the experiment over and over, it might however vary enormously how soon the high-tech civilization appeared.Does this mean that humans are “supposed” to create technology? Supposed by whom?Our fingers plainly did not evolve to type on keyboards the way I am doing now. Language did not emerge so that it could be expressed in visible symbols and broadcast over the Internet, the way I am doing now. Our brains did not evolve so that they could ponder questions of metaphysical “meaning” and “purpose”, the way this question invites us to.But our fingers, our languages and our brainsDoesn’t mean it was all predestined and “supposed” to happen.",UNKNOWN,Devin O'Keefe,21.8K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/Were-humans-supposed-to-advance-technologically-i-e-roads-cities-cars-etc-or-was-nature-meant-to-be-untampered-forever

I mean, after getting his hands on an Infinity Stone, he tried to make a robot out of it, so you’re really not going to blow his mind with anything.That being said, the tech of the Star Wars universe is really only impressive for its scale - capital class cruisers, Death Stars, giant combat walkers. The technology itself is somewhat clunky, nothing ever really works properly, and there are armies of technicians pulling levers and pushing buttons. This is an intentional aesthetic choice, to create the “used future” feel and have all the combat based on WW2 dogfights and battleships (i.e. massed combat of many troops operating giant machines).The tech of the MCU is very much about personal combat between heroic individuals, because it’s about superheroes and not armies. And those heroes have to be powered by tech like flying armored suits or personal shrinking devices. So when Tony sees the Chitauri, he doesn’t build a giant airship like the Leviathan, he builds a Hulkbuster suit, or an array of autonomous Iron Man suits. Giant ships like the Helicarrier just tend to be big targets for individual heroes to take down. The battle of Wakanda was fought on foot for the most part, with the bulk of it in hand-to-hand combat.So there isn’t much Tony could use just based on the aesthetic differences between these stories, and he’d never build some kind of giant space cruiser. He’d probably figure out how to slap a hyperdrive, a shield generator, and a pair of AI-controlled lightsabers into his suit and call it a day.","105,668 followers",Dave Consiglio,17.2K,6.8K,91.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Were-humans-supposed-to-advance-technologically-i-e-roads-cities-cars-etc-or-was-nature-meant-to-be-untampered-forever

With the highest midi chlorian count ever recorded, he fulfilled an ancient prophecy, and so wore the mantle of the hero and saviour of the Jedi.'The Chosen One.’As Anakin Skywalker, he was one of the most powerful Jedi that ever lived. After his fall to the Darkside he became something else entirely.Duped into believing that he'd murdered his own wife, coerced into believing the words of a madman, slaughtering his fellow brothers and sisters, and killing children, cemented his future as the lapdog of a tyrant and psychopath.More machine than man, and fuelled by absolute rage and anger, meant that he was virtually unstoppable. Weilding the power of the arcane Sith, coupled with his knowledge of being a Jedi for a lifetime, transformed this once revered hero into a nightmare.The United States Military is no push over, and has proven itself countless times in World Wars and many conflicts. They've assisted countries to overthrow dictators, and remove brutal regimes. The most famous fighting force of all time, lead by generals of steel character and resolve, would have no easy task disposing of this alien threat. And that's how Vader would be viewed.As an alien threat of undetermined species and origin.Thus established, the US Military would approach him with caution, and aim to capture or destroy the sinister black figure before them.Once a name has been given to Vader, after establishing first contact, a threat analysis would be undertaken to determine his intentions, but more importantly, his capabilities.Vader would make his intentions known by all who were about to bare witness.And his capabilities would be painfully obvious to any within reach of his terrible wrath.The next thing to happen would be remembered forever by any who bore witness.Vader would perform his own threat analysis of the situation, and realise that he would have to summon the full power of the Darkside in order to remain the victor.He would unleash the force, and begin slaughtering the US Military en masse.It would be a bloodbath, drowned out by the screams of men, still unsure of what exactly they were seeing.His power would be overwhelming, and most men would be too mesmerised to make sense of it. Cutting a bloody swath through the masses of infantry and heavy support, he would make short work of the initial men who established contact with him. Hurling tanks and support units flying into each other, and choking entire legions of unsuspecting soldiers simultaneously, would be but some of the raw power unleashed.The US Military has never encountered a being such as Vader before, and most men present at this particular engagement would never live to speak about it. Those that did escape his unprecedented massacre, would live with physical and mental scars for the rest of their lives.Analysing said threat, the US Military would respond with extreme prejudice.Mobilising the United States Air Force, would be Vader's greatest threat. After Vader would have more than likely plucked the unsuspecting aircraft out of the sky and destroyed it, the Air Force would presumably begin plans to bomb him.Vader can protect himself with a powerful force shield, that envelopes his body and widthstands even bombs and missiles. Even worse, he can utilise the force to manipulate any deadly projectile flying toward him. The US Military's weapons would be turned on themselves.Even the nuclear ones they dare fire at the Dark Lord of the Sith.Vader would use the force to grab the missiles and bombs coming at him, and guide them back. Vader could even walk through radiated, nuclear waste lands thanks to his environment suit controls, and multiple layers of protection provided by his iconic, black suit.The US Military's bombardment would be relentless, until they were assured that this god-like being was eradicated.And the threat suppressed.Vaders only hope of withstanding the US would be to establish contact with the Empire to assist in his assault, and most importantly, retrieve him.If he could not defeat all of them, then he would have to make his way to the military base his oppressors hailed from. Ripping the doors open to even a Cheyenne mountain complex type installation, would be easy for Vader.Once inside, he would terminate every form of opposition that challenged him. Making his bloody way deeper within the complex to some type of deep space transmission device. This would be his only means of survival.If they didn't have one, he'd be screwed.Vader can put up a fight that is so memorable, that over time, everyone thinks he's a god.Everyone except the US Military.It would be only a matter of time before Vader would be overwhelmed.My grandfather was in WWII, and he always spoke about how my country, Australia, owed the U.S. Military a debt of gratitude. They had joined forces with our country's, and fought back the onslaught, and threat of Imperial Japanese occupation.They had saved his life.They would not sit idly by and let the threat of a lone man defeat them. At the end of the day, the US Military would eventually defeat him. They would lose countless lives, but they would prevail.The bigger question would be; What would happen if the US military drove off Darth Vader, and he came back to settle the score, by bringing the full might of the Empire with him?",38 followers,Bo Miller,2.3K,4.2K,8.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-would-Tony-Starks-reaction-be-to-the-advanced-technology-used-in-Star-Wars

The Chinese started the development of quantum radar and quantum communications, that we know of if the US follows through, does that mean the US stole from China?China, today, is becoming more and more innovative. I think that’s because China has been investing heavily in the sciences and graduating more and more STEM students to their workforce. They are not all going to be Einsteins, but if you even look at the US, there are quite a few Chinese and other Asians in the science and technology arena providing benefits to the US. So, why wouldn’t their cousins in China be as gifted and hard working?Regarding lasers, the original work was by Dr Theodore Maiman who worked at the Hughes Research Laboratory in Malibu. He owns the patents (expired) for the maser which was the father of the Laser.Theodore Harold Maiman - WikipediaAs lasers got further and further developed, power levels increased, applications increased, and costs dropped. Almost every Tom, Dick, and Harry can make a laser. Was that industrial theft? Today, it looks like the Chinese are doing the same thing as the rail gun and magnetic drive, if the news is correct, they are on the verge of making lasers work as a submarine detector. The article further states that the US had done research and (maybe) gave up. If that is true and the Chinese have made it work at depths of 500 feet, I would say that’s quite an accomplishment. So, if so, what did they steal? Research that was publically available is theft?BTW, I do know that we were working on high power lasers over 40 years ago, but it was so big and power hungry, it's used as a weapon was naught. But it was the start and the development improved to today’s laser cannons to be used as a weapon. Quite a few ‘inventions’ are like that.
