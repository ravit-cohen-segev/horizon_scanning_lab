It is only 40 some odd years old country.Not to mention, the modern UAE we see today was 99% built by Expats from India/ Pakistan/Iran/Philippines/Some Asians/Some Arab neighboring countries/ and some western countries.If all expats have to leave the country one day for one reason or the other , the whole country will collapse.UAE only has around 1.4–1.7 local emarati citizens,UAE doesn’t have much industry and is 90%+ reliant on foreign goods.Apart from that , UAE is an artificially beautified country, with barely any history.It is full of beautiful malls, I must say.Another plus I must add to in regards to UAE, you won’t have much problem with language as expats from most countries including emaratis speak English.Other than the superficial facade and oil it has nothing to offer in terms of attraction.Turkey on the other hand is a naturally beautiful country with Mediterranean weather , amazing historical and modern sites, and a very strong industry built mainly by Turkish people of 80 million population.Turkey has many exports apart from agricultural .It has its own textile, technology,automation, tourism etc industry and is considered a developed country.I have great respect for Turkey and Turkish people, as they have emerged as a very progressive open countryThe Turkish nationals/ people are highly developed in medical and technology sector , but you don’t see any prominent and renowned UAE National being a prominent and renowned doctor or scientist in any field. Almost 99.9 % of doctors and technology are from overseas.Turkey has built its country with the love of its people for their country. It has and will have its ups and downs especially regarding economy, but it is the people of the land and their resilience that help them go thru it and bounce back on their feet.I would say Turkey is a beautiful mix of east-West/deep history /culture/nature/ industry which UAE will never be able to match as a whole, even if they achieve a certain level of short lived glamour for expo 2020.None the less Dubai at least made a smart move by hiring and attracting intelligent and skilled workers from all around the globe to fill in their short comings with oil money to built their country. A win win situation for both sides.Here is the CIA report on Turkey being a developed country:The World Factbook list of developed countries - WikipediaWith the opening of the new massive airport in OCT 2018 in Turkey , UAE will be left green with envy, as Turkey will be the major hub for tourists and transit, rightfully so, as it is located in a strategic area of east meets west.The true measure of a developed country is its Human Resources in terms of development and skills.Economy of Turkey - Wikipedia",469 followers,Daniel Cohort,11.9K,377,1.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-Muslim-country-has-more-advanced-technologies-the-UAE-or-Turkey
1,"Iran, incidentally, is the most advanced Islamic country today.In spite of the fact that USA and allies imposed sanction on Iran 39 years ago and still continuing, in spite of the fact that Iran was pulled in a war for 9 years by Saddam Husain in 1980 in which an estimated one million Iranians died, this is the most advanced Islamic country.Iran-Iraq war was openly supported by USA and allies.SincIran, incidentally, is the most advanced Islamic country today.In spite of the fact that USA and allies imposed sanction on Iran 39 years ago and still continuing, in spite of the fact that Iran was pulled in a war for 9 years by Saddam Husain in 1980 in which an estimated one million Iranians died, this is the most advanced Islamic country.Iran-Iraq war was openly supported by USA and allies.Since 1941, Reza Shah Pehlavi, a playboy, was ruling Iran. In the name of Islam, he was carrying out all unislamic actions. There was no democracy, no morals. He was a highly acclaimed global leader because he played to the tunes of USA and Allies, just the way Saudi Monarchy has been doing all these years. He was a King, though kingship has no legitimacy in Islam. It was a muslim country without a practicing Islam.In 1979, Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini felt the pulse of the people and began a revolution with the help of the people. Shah’s rule was overthrown and democracy was established in IranUSA and its allies were displeased with loss of their friend, Shah’s rule. They imposed sanctions on Iran. It did not bend Iran backwards. They then supported their stooge, Saddam Hussain to impose war on Iran. Saddam was given all the armaments of warfare to use against Iran. Iran, somehow, withstood this onslaught for 9 years during which not a single family in Iran remain unaffected.With 39 years of sanctions and 9 years of war, which is supposed to be the longest and deadliest war between two nations in modern history, any country would have been totally destroyed.However, with able leadership of Ayatullah Khomeini and subsequently with Ayatullah Khamenei, Iran overcame all the odds. When global technology, tools and equipment were denied to Iran, when Iran’s money deposited in overseas banks was frozen, when Iran’s payments for oil were frozen, Iran concentrated on education. Today, Iran has a literacy of 98% which was 36.5% at the time of revolution.Iran carried out reverse engineering. It started developing technologies of its own, when world was sharing it with each other. It developed missiles, frigates, fighter planes, computers, etc.Prior to sanctions, Iran imported most of the medicine, today it manufactures all its needs and caters to the health needs of several countries.India with a population of 1.32 billion people has a GDP of $10.385 trillion and per capita income of $7783, Malaysia with a population of 31.92 million people has a GDP of $999 billion and and per capita income of $30430, Saudi Arabia with a population of 33 million people has a GDP of $1.8 trillion and per capita income of $55229, Iran with a population of 81 million people has a GDP of $1.551 trillion and per capita income of $19050. Imagine, what would have been its position had there not been sanctions and the war?Iran has the most transparent democratic system where not a single authority has an absolute control. Every authority is selected through a democratic process.“Since the 1979 Revolution, to overcome foreign embargoes, the Iranian government has developed its own military industry, produced its own tanks [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank ], armored personnel carriers [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armoured_personnel_carrier ], missiles [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile ], submarines [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine ], military vessels, missile destroyer [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_frigate_Jamaran ], radar [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar ] systems, helicopters [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter ], and fighter planes [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_aircraft ].

3,"I will disagree with you here, because a comparison between Turkey and the UAE would be like comparing Monaco and Peru.UAE has an extremely small native population, which makes up about 12 percent of the countries' residents, the rest is made up of expats living in Dubai and cheap labourers, mostly from the Indian subcontinent. That 12 percent of the native population can divide all the oil money amongst themselves, while expats get even richer in Dubai in other ways and the labourers get exploited.

That 12 percent of the native population can divide all the oil money amongst themselves, while expats get even richer in Dubai in other ways and the labourers get exploited. Yeah, those few UAE natives are probably better of economically but their cultural rights are quite restricted.There are for example sharia courts there, stoning and whipping are still punishments for things like being drunk and having sex before marriage, renouncing your religion can get you the death sentence, kissing in public can lead to deportation. Of course homosexuality is a capital offence, and even dancing in public is forbidden. These do not all apply so strictly of course and some rules might be different for non-Muslims, but the fact that they exist is already something.Then we have Turkey. Due to Ataturk, Turkey used to be one of the most secular Muslim countries in the entire world, like Albania, Indonesia and Azerbaijan. In Turkey. Although it is becoming increasingly authoritarian under Erdogan, Ataturk intended Turkey to be a Muslim state where state and religion were clearly separated. That is why until recently the Aya Sophia was a museum since it is still a very important building to the Greek orthodox church, that is also why Turkish women could vote before Belgian and French women could, also hijabs used to be forbidden in public places. Recently I see 3 camps forming in Turkey, you have the central and northeastern parts of the country where Erdogan is still popular and people are more religious, then you have the Kurds who just wanna be free, and lastly you have got the Western coast, European Turkey and cities like Izmir, the most liberal and secular parts of the country. So we'll see which camp gains power in the future but for now Turkey is culturally a lot more secular than the UAE.Economically, Turkey is developing mainly in the major cities like Istanbul and moving forward, bettering people's lives, but it is hard when you have received 3 million refugees into your country. However, I expect the poorer regions to develop as well in the future.In conclusion, for now you're more free in Turkey, but if you are a UAE native, you're on average economically better off. So I believe Ataturk's ideas did work.Peace","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-Muslim-country-has-more-advanced-technologies-the-UAE-or-Turkey

She knew that I would never be ready but could accept what I couldn't change. Next day rained all day. She sat in front of the French doors all day. Next day was beautiful. She and Racer was outside playing and barking and having fun. She was always faster than any pit I've known and could stop on a dime. All of a sudden quite. I tore through this house and in front of the French doors she laid waiting for me. Racer standing over her. We laid beside her and I did so go9d. Talking to her and laughing and not 1 year. Racer was a wreck. Every time I turned around he was digging her up and that 80 pound badass pit bull wanted in that grave.Monster the cat that showed up in out green white blue eyes crosseyed as they come. 9 grand to fix what a so called get caused. I would be surprised to find anyone who did what the new vet did. He has all reason to pat his self in the back. 2 vets on the phone throughout 8 hours of surgery. 4 different operations in 1. It was so bad . Monster had left home to the like cats to. I looked for days is. I watched vultures for days. He didn't die but I've never seen more closer. He couldn't pick his head up as he dragged his body using only his front paws. They had to break his pelvic and he was confined to the dog jail cell but now cat condo. About 3 months later after stitches busted open, blood transfusions, and alot of horror. He gained less than 1 pound and his poop had a little texture and his chapped beyond chapped shinny was doing great although he still protected it. Outside again. We turned that corner and all the guilt just ran off me.Racer had been having a very hard time. He gave the warning the day he tore through the house , stuff coming out every where. I'm giving him mouth to mouth between him puking all over me. Now it's time for the good days verses 5hr not good days. Get came and put him to sleep. He was lookin out them French doors and I could tell he had already been running with Indie in his dreams and ready to get there. 2 days later Monster died in my arm trying to get him to his doctor. I could care less about the money.

She quickly became my best buddy.Several months later (maybe a year), my very young siblings (around 3 and 5) thought it would be fun to ‘play’ with her and get her attention at the same time by taking away her food bowlMum decided she had to go to prevent anyone else from getting bitten. I was devastated. I knew she was never aggressive and in fact so loving, but being so young, I didn't know how to make a strong argument. I watched as she was taken from me. I was so upset for months after.Since she was given to a family friend, we visited once every year for a few years after. Then we stopped.We went to visit again when I was 21, after about a decade of not visiting their home. I didn't expect her to be alive, much less remember me. After all, she would be around 15 years old.When I stepped in, I was so surprised to be greeted by her in the exact same way she used to greet me every day when I came home from school. The only differences were, she had aged considerably and looked frail, and her tail was wagging way more vigorously. She was still biased towards me, sticking to me throughout the whole visit. Her current owners were surprised she even had enough energy to jump up to the couch to sit with me. During the whole visit, she lay her head on my lap and every time she looked up at me, her eyes sparkled with excitement. It was a bittersweet reunion, because I knew it’d be the last time I saw her alive.So, do dogs remember their owners? Absolutely. Even after more than a decade of separation. They’re amazing, and their attention to humans is why they’re our best friends - because we are their world.Edit: Thanks for the upvotes everyone! It’s my first answer on Quora and it’s encouraging to know people actually like my story. A couple things I wanted to add to it.She passed on in October 2016. In her final days, her family called my mum to tell her she was really weak and probably won't last too long. Sadly, I wasn't in town then, but the rest of my family went down to see her in the next few days. After spending some time with them (probably 10 mins I think), she passed on. My family members were the only ones present at the time of her passing. Both families have agreed that she seemed to be waiting for my family to visit before departing. I suddenly remembered this, thought it was pretty interesting that she somehow knew and waited (or maybe it’s just super coincidental) and figured I should add it to my original answer.",389 followers,Lois Clements,13.8K,260,1.8M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Which-Muslim-country-has-more-advanced-technologies-the-UAE-or-Turkey

As I walk in the front door they are all barking and jumping around with joy showing me how happy they are to see me.Each dog has a different personality and various traits. They follow me through the house no matter what room I go into and wait to see where I am going to next. My wife often says to me, “You are a GOD!”None of my dogs will ever know what a bad day in their life is. I would not ever think of hitting one of my dogs no matter what they would do. It is rare when one of my dogs will chew something up that they are not supposed to chew up but no matter what they do chew up, I instantly take blame knowing that had I not left what they chewed up where they could reach it, they would not have had the opportunity to chew it up.As we sit here watching television every night, we get several laughs at the crazy things our dogs do. That is especially true with Hopey. Hopey is a Mini-Dachshund and constantly doing funny things. Hopey is also spoiled rotten not only by us but also by the other dogs. I don’t know why but every other dog in this house will allow Hopey to take anything away from them no matter what it is. This is Hopey.I never get to sit in my recliner alone. As many dogs as can fit on the loveseat at a time will sit there with me. Here is a pic from last night. 5 of them were able to squeeze their way on to the loveseat.I protect my dogs so we have a very large fenced-in area out back for them. We also have a doggie door or I would be a door-tender all day long. Blu, our Blue Heeler pictured below is the only dog permitted outside the fence and only if I am outside with him. That is because Blu is very obedient and will stop on a dime and come back to me instantly if I call his name. Blue is also very protective of every member of our family. If I have Blu outside the fenced-in area and someone pulls up our driveway, I need to hold Blu by the collar before that person gets out of their car. I then need to have that person walk up to me and I shake that person’s hand and tell Blu it is ok and then Blu is fine and I can let him loose.Dixie was a stray. One morning on a very hot summer day I walked out the back door and there was Dixie. She looked like she was going to have puppies any day so I gave her some food and water. When I went in the house and told my wife about Dixie, my wife instantly said, “Don’t even think about it! We already have 6 dogs and we do not have room for another one.”Dixie was still here the next morning and after a little convincing I was able to bring Dixie inside the fence. I then went to Wal-Mart and purchased a children’s hexagon play area and cut one section down so Dixie could jump over it to get inside so she could have privacy from the other dogs when she had her puppies. I also placed a couple of heavy bedspreads in there for comfort. Wouldn’t you know Dixie decided to have her puppies right in the middle of our bed?Dixie had 8 puppies and when they were old enough to be weaned from Dixie, we took them all to a street fair in town and sold all of them in under an hour for $50 each. We then donated the $400 from the sale of the puppies to a local no-kill shelter that we went for 4 of our other dogs. After that, Dixie then had a forever home and she is still with us today. Below is a picture of Dixie.There are times it can be a bit overwhelming when all of the dogs come to me for attention at the same time but I do my best to provide them all with a bit of attention and I would never consider changing a thing.

In other words, there’s no “100,” just a bigger clearing surrounded by more trees.","5,084 followers",Bobby Tatro,3.9K,2.2K,45.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-Muslim-country-has-more-advanced-technologies-the-UAE-or-Turkey

It we lived a billions year—what hell!—and conditions were no worse than they are today then it is most likely that we would continue to continue on.I am part of a religious community that accepts that there is a New Revelation from God in the world right now. Humanity is facing such dire challenges to our existence—existence from the standpoint of climate change, depletion of necessary resources that we all rely on for like and natural disaster that are growing more catastrophic—. We are also facing the challenge of potential enslavement by an Intervention from alien resource explorers who seek to overtake our world and use us as a workforce. The Creator of all like believes that we are capable of overcoming these challenges and has sent a Revelation—larger than any of the previous Revelations—to aid humanity.God will not step in to save us as God has sent each of us to save the world. But the greatest gift that God has given is Knowledge—the Mind of God which all sentient beings across the universe have been endowed with. The only problem is that other than a slight, intuitive connection to Knowledge, few of us have the deeper connection necessary to guide us through these dark times. But the New Revelation contains all the preparation necessary to learn and apply Knowledge.Here is an example of the powerful insight present in this Revelation—over 9,000 pages have been received over the last 40 years on almost every subject you can think of. This revelation speaks directly to the subject you are asking about. All the books and revelations of the New Message from God are free to read online.“You see, people rarely grow and develop on their own initiative. People usually grow because they must, not because they want to. There is complacency that is inherent in intelligent life, and your environment is so easy that complacency is built in. If you lived in a more demanding environment where your choices were limited, then you would value your decisions far more because they would have much more serious consequences.Responsibility is difficult, but it is also very rewarding if it is placed in the proper perspective and given in the right area. You must choose wisely what burden you will carry, whom you will take care of and for what reason. You will be happier if you can provide for others beyond your own choice. For example, if you have children, well, some days you want to be a parent and some days you do not, but you are a parent every day. If you own a business enterprise, you carry that business on days when you like having a business and on days when you do not. Here your rewards are greater and more long term than the freedom to go and have a day off whenever the impulse strikes you.Therefore, in whatever employment you are engaged, concentrate on contributing to people. Do not concentrate on being liked and accepted. Do not concentrate on having the license to express yourself without other people’s disagreement. Do not seek for freedom. Seek for contribution. You are free to contribute in your society to a very great degree. This freedom is worthwhile. When you leave this world, you will not have to feed and house yourself. You will not have to take care of a physical body. You will not have all these trials and difficulties.”",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,17K,996,156M,2003,https://www.quora.com/Which-Muslim-country-has-more-advanced-technologies-the-UAE-or-Turkey

23,"In a few areas, actually. First is infrastructure. The Chinese planned waaaaaaaaaay ahead while building. That’s why there were ghost cities. The developers built huge communities before they were needed, knowing that large factories were coming soon. Above that is public transportation.

Smaller cities have buses available that will take you just about everywhere within the city and bigger cities have subways as well as buses. For going between cities and provinces, China has a high speed rail system in place that is more extensive than the American highway system! For example: I lived in a city called Nanjing in China - about 200 miles/300 km from Shanghai. I could take a high speed train from Nanjing to Shanghai in about 1.5 hours!In contrast, I took an Amtrak train from Detroit to Chicago (about 300 miles/480 km) and it took over 8 hours!Another area China wins at is public utilities. They provide electricity, water, and gas for billions of people for very affordable prices! I paid maybe a total of $20 (US) per month for all utility bills, whereas it cost me over $100 in America! Atop of that is wireless technology (which is considered a public utility in China). I paid 100 rmb ($15) monthly for 16 GB of 4G data, with 1000 texts and 500 minutes of talk (which pretty much meant unlimited everything for me). In America I pay $50 a month for my unlimited plan. Yes, the 4G is a little faster, but that may just be because I’m not trying to access the foreign web here…A third area (kinda related to the second) is how the CCP controls markets and prices so everyone can live a comfortable life. I ate a big plate of food at a small restaurant for between 10 and 20 rmb… ($1.25-2.50).

The labs are required by law to use every reasonable effort to get the taxpayer funded technologies out to the private sector. They have proven and established procedures to do this.Here’s the problem: most technologies developed in the labs solve very unique problems that are not generally encountered outside those facilities because of the primary lab missions - national security.Here’s the unspoken truth: for every engineer and scientist employed at the national labs working on solutions, there is an entire class of colleagues with whom they attended college and graduate school. These people all studied together and learned solutions approaches from the same faculty. They worked together in teams on projects and learned from each other. Now that a few of them are at the labs, there are a bunch of others already in the private sector, or other government agencies, using the same approaches to solving problems. Usually both sets of people end up with fundamentally the same solutions.So the government technologies are for the most part the same as the private sector’s solutions because the people solving these problems are doing the same thing. The difference is focus, funding, and expected return. Private sector solutions have to be cost effective and provide a return on investment. Lab solutions have a budget to work within but never have to provide a return. Often a government solution is used once for a single problem and then discarded into the surplus auction materials to the private sector.Of those unique technologies like secret weapons or software, they are often 20 years ahead of where the private sector is. My job was the difficult one of trying to find a private sector need for a solution for a problem that did not yet exist because the private sector had not yet ADOPTED and ADAPTED technologies into common use. This is generally because investments in technologies have an expected return over a period of time before a company or person will want to invest money for an upgrade. And that time interval can be years or decades depending on the scale of investment.One example is the 3-D printing technology that is becoming more common in multiple uses. I worked on the initial commercialization plans for that technology more than 20 years ago. It is still on its expected growth curve for adoption and adaption by industry. While the people who invented it more than 25 years ago in the lab saw limited uses, the uses for which is was developed, commercial interests were very limited at first. In fact the first company that licensed the technology saw only a few military uses for the first ten years. It took more than a decade in the private sector before other people began to have ideas on how it could be used. And the technology itself had to evolve a bit, particularly with the materials that could be used. Eventually we will see this particular technology everywhere, even in your own home.So was the original development of 3-D printing secret? Sort of, but the engineers who invented it had classmates that could easily have done the same if there had been a need and an investor willing to put up the capital. What really happened is that the government had a need for a solution and the investment capital and time, and paid for it to be invented in house. Then, by law, made it available to the world outside the labs. Which is what happened.The labs had invented ways of analyzing gas plumes in the open environment, initially for gas or bio warfare applications, but these were adapted to environmental monitoring of industrial plant emissions by the monitoring agencies and companies themselves. Another secret technology? Only initially. Now these are in common use.There are software packages that have been made by lab folks that would blow your mind but nobody has been interested in those technologies because companies have developed their own solutions for their specific problems and keep those solutions to themselves. Does this make them secret technologies? Not really. A simple call to any of the national lab tech transfer offices can gain one an introduction to these technologies and their commercial availability - for US companies anyway, not foreign companies.There are new solutions being made available constantly if you know how to access that information. But again, most of these solutions are too early stage for adoption into daily life, and they must be adapted for non weapons or national security applications. This takes significant investment and will not have the kind of whiz bang returns one commonly sees with the latest release from Apple. These solutions have multi decade returns at much lower rates, so most investors go for something that has larger and faster returns. That’s the main reason you don’t see things the government has invented. Nobody really wants them.","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,631,1.5K,2.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-there-is-advanced-technology-to-cure-diseases-such-as-cancer-in-dogs-If-so-why-do-so-many-dog-owners-just-put-their-dogs-to-sleep
