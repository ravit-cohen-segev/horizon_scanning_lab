1,"It's true that in comparison to the hardware/electronics/gadget and other sectors, the Japanese web industry is relatively weak from a global perspective.I think though the industry is better than its reputation. There are three factors at play here: language, market size and the importance of the mobile web.Language:That's one factor why you don't hear too much about web innovation in Japan.Market size:It's true that in comparison to the hardware/electronics/gadget and other sectors, the Japanese web industry is relatively weak from a global perspective.I think though the industry is better than its reputation. There are three factors at play here: language, market size and the importance of the mobile web.Language:That's one factor why you don't hear too much about web innovation in Japan.Market size:In other words, online spend is high (the highest in all of Asia).And those web entrepreneurs who became dollar billionaires (for example, the CEO of GREE, a mobile gaming social network) did so by catering to the Japanese market only.So why go outside your lucrative home market, the reasoning goes.Mobile web:That means that there are many, many companies in Japan that exclusively offer mobile web services and applications. The problem is that the mobile web systems Japan's three big carriers (NTT Docomo, KDDI au, SoftBank Mobile) offer are practically closed and incompatible to other carriers.In other words, no one outside Japan can access services tailor made for these mobile web systems - even innovative services basically stay Japan-only forever.","16,153 followers",Ethan Hein,7.9K,4.1K,12.6M,2010,https://www.quora.com/How-can-a-country-become-a-test-bed-for-innovative-and-emerging-technologies

Instead we have an entire portfolio of renewable energy choices to apply to the problem of cleaning up the electricity grid, transportation, and most importantly construction and agriculture.We are still in dire need of low carbon cement, steel and meat production technologies.Fusion power is always 10 to 20 years distant, so there’s that.

8,"Since according to neuroscience, consciousness alreadyThere is nothing about neural networks, artificial or otherwise, that causes consciousness to magically emerge, at least according to conservative views from neuroscience.

Similarly, there is nothing about organic molecules that if you put enough of them together, you get life as an emergent property; those molecules need to be organized in a fairly specific and complex way.Consciousness is (likely) the result of a fairly intricate set of interlocking mechanisms organized into complex, layered circuits of neurons, systems and subsystems. The details of how it all works have not been mapped out yet. But just as stringing together 3 billion base pairs of DNA isn't sufficient to get a human being, so too will connecting up enough neurons in a network not get you consciousness.In short, ""emergent properties"" are a way of thinking about the whole being greater than the sum of the parts, but they are not a promise that if you put enough parts together you will get a surprising and unexpected whole.In addition, emergent properties do not need to seem magical. A CPU that can run Microsoft Windows is an emergent property of connecting 1 billion transistors in just the right way, but ""just the right way"" is not a simple step; there is immense complexity to the circuit structure that makes up a CPU, and we have only just begun to uncover the complexities of the circuit structures of the brain.On a more positive note, it seems possible that we will eventually figure out circuit structures in artificial neural networks that could produce consciousness, but it will not be an accidental eureka moment; rather it will be the result of a lot of hard experimental and theoretical work.","1,000 followers",Ruben Kusi,3.1K,165,2.2M,2016,https://www.quora.com/How-can-a-country-become-a-test-bed-for-innovative-and-emerging-technologies
9,"15 years would be from 2003 to 2018 (now).I’d say we’ve definitely seen a lot of development in 3D animation, so that’s primarily what I’m going to focus on. I’m gonna use some popular Disney/Pixar movies to illustrate some major breakthroughs.Let’s start with Finding Nemo (2003).One of the biggest challenges for this movie was creating the underwater world, and with the creation of this movie we say a major breakthrough in the animation of bodies of water. We learned how to use mathematical formulas and equations to simulate the movement of molecules of water, and then projected a surface ont15 years would be from 2003 to 2018 (now).I’d say we’ve definitely seen a lot of development in 3D animation, so that’s primarily what I’m going to focus on. I’m gonna use some popular Disney/Pixar movies to illustrate some major breakthroughs.Let’s start with Finding Nemo (2003).One of the biggest challenges for this movie was creating the underwater world, and with the creation of this movie we say a major breakthrough in the animation of bodies of water. We learned how to use mathematical formulas and equations to simulate the movement of molecules of water, and then projected a surface onto that to create this type of movement.Next is the Incredibles (2004).This is really where we start to figure out how to model and animate human beings. The problems we had with modelling people way back when Toy Story was created are solved here—we learn how to animate the movement of hair, and how to move human beings in a way that isn’t stiff or clunky, per se.With Cars (2006), we learned how to better simulate the environment.There was a lot more landscape to deal with as far as the background goes, and since they’re cars racing around, we also had to figure out how to make the friction and stuff work out. With the surfacing on the cars (McQueen isRatatouille (2007), we improve upon the developments made in Monsters, Inc. with Sulley’s fur.Trust me. Learning how to animate wet fur is pretty remarkable.WALL-E (2008) is significant because it built upon the achievements of Cars as far as rust and other imperfections go.And because animation is really what brings life to a character, the animations— the head tilts, the blinks, those little things WALL-E does is another major achievement, too, because it gives an inanimate object a personality complete with emotions like love and compassion.Up (2009) saw new achievements in gravitational simulation.Tangled (2010) obviously meant more hair.More hair means more CGI achievements in the hair department.Wreck-It Ralph (2012) had a lot of different settings in each of the scenes, so I’d say we saw a lot more development overall in terms of the animationNote the various different “styles” that are represented in the movie.Frozen (2013) represents a breakthrough in CGI snow.They actually had to go wade in snow and consult experts on snowflakes to do this stuff. Then they developed something called Matterhorn to deal with it.Big Hero 6 (2014) marked an era of new achievements in lighting.They used Hyperion, which deals with lighting in a different way. It tracks how light rays bounce of multiple different projects all at once. This is definitely more realistic but was previously impossible because of computation limitations.With Inside Out (2016), we continued to experiment with more advanced lighting techniques.Notice the soft glow that Joy has, and how the memory capsules all glow softly.Moana (2017) saw further developments in water/other environmental materials, and with hair.One of their biggest achievements, beyond CGI improvements, was really in creating water that had personality. They also modded Matterhorn to deal with things like lava and sand. Quicksilver was used for hair simulation, and further automated the animation process for hair.So. Yeah. Definitely a lot of progress on all fronts in 3D animation, with emphasis on hair simulation and special effects that contribute to the portrayal of an environment (lighting, reflection, water, etc.).Is computer animation the final frontier? Only time will tell.I’m definitely expecting a lot more in terms of VR or AR-assisted animation, though! Since we’re primarily dealing with 3D nowadays, it makes more sense to be able to actually work in 3D instead of working on a flat 2D screen.And depending on how far we get with artificial intelligence, there’s definitely a lot more things that could be automated.We’ll see.Anyway, thanks for the A2A, hope this helped. Good luck on your animation endeavours!","246,864 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-can-a-country-become-a-test-bed-for-innovative-and-emerging-technologies
