Once you do that I believe you can see the opportunities more clearly, especially related to your current skill sets.

We recently finished construction on their brand new beautiful home that they will personally live in. They wanted the nicest, best quality and very beautiful designs. We delivered and from what they have seen they are incredibly happy with the work we have done. They are supposed to have their first fully finished walk through I believe next Thursday. I’m going to try to be there to walk through it with them. It is truly the most beautiful home I have ever seen which my clients deserve. I’ve had them for years. Every holiday they drop cards off at my business and we’ve never had problems building what they have wanted. They are wonderful to work with and pay top dollar as well.
