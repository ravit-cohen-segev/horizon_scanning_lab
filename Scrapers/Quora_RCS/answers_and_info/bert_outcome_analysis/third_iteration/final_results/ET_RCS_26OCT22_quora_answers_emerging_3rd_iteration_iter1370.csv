Germany is not the most technologically advanced country.

Mostly in the Green Party.

[1] [2] This number is likely to be higher in developing nations. If you live past the age of 60 you have a nearly 30% chance of being killed by some form of dementia.  [3]The prevailing theory used to posit that alleviating socioeconomic hardships would drive down all diseases; while this is true for many diseases of the last century, by virtue of longer life-spans other diseases have emerged, most famously: dementia. Other mental health challenges are also on the rise—Those suffering from Autism Spectral Disorder make up approximately 1 in 132 individuals (and growing) [4], 1–3 of every 100 will experience epileptic seizures in their lifetime,  [5]and a whopping 1 in 10 with mood disorders [6].Biomedical Research: Focus on the BrainIn 2011 nearly a quarter of the National Institutes of Health $32B budget went to ‘neurosciences’ related projects.  [7]The proportion of brain work through this agency has bloomed following new initiatives focusing on breakthrough technological advances from the field [8].While some areas of basic research have legitimate reasons to complain about stagnating funding, medical research cannot. The NIH currently provides 50% greater funding than it did in the year 2000. Much of this growth has occurred in brain research. That being said, it is also easy to say that it isn’t enough to meet the demand and needs of those afflicted with debilitating disease.
