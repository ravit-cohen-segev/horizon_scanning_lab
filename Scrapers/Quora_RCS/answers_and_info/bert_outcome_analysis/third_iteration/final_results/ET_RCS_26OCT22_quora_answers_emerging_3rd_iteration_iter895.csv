Also we as a society are going to need to figure out what to do with displaced workers (taxi/uber/bus/truckers).It isn’t just driving though, knowledge work. Will AI spot cancer more efficiently then trained experienced doctors? What about other complex medical tests?It could be a very big deal.Or there could be hidden limits.Or the next big leap could be from research I’m unaware of (AI really only read CS related papers, I’m not enough of a physicist to figure out what they are talking about, or how it might change the world).It could also be from something that isn’t yet in research…although to go from zero to research to application to world altering in 20 years is pretty quick.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/20-years-ago-it-would-have-been-hard-to-conceive-of-carrying-around-a-mini-computer-phone-TV-in-your-pockets-What-do-you-think-the-next-technological-leap-will-be

What do you think the next technological leap will be?This wholeSmart phones have actually grown in size to support 1080p streaming, but they’re getting too thin to support decent battery life. Laptops are suffering from the same problem. I’ve often said, make my laptop a 1/2″ thicker and fill the space with battery. A smartphone 1/4″ thicker could provide a similar benefit.Until aI think the next major trend will be optical fiber for nearly everything, replacing audio signal cables, HDMI, and even Ethernet. The only reason for there to be copper in a cable will be to supply power if required. I also think that a future version of USB-C will be developed which will overcome the current deficiencies in the design. The current spec for USB-C as a power source is 20V at 5A, giving potentially 100W.For the sake of argument, I’m going to introduce the USB-F* cable. This is still capable of negotiating 100W or more of power, but all communication is optical. The home desktop computer will resemble a large Besser-block covered in heat sinks and fans. All that will be inside will be a maxed-out power supply, the CPU and RAM. One side of the unit will be a huge array of USB-F sockets. The System drive and any other storage will be powered by USB-F and communicate optically running asFor a screen intended to show video, OLED or its successor will replace LCD.Where video speed is not required, Desktops, Laptops, Tablets, and Phones will be able to rely on the energy saving of near-full-color e-Ink. There are already e-Ink PC monitors on the market. Then again, e-Ink might be up to video refresh rates in 20 years. Who knows?I’ve also predicted previously that, for people who want something solid to hold in their hands, discs will be replaced by hard-burned USB sticks that just plug into a socket on the side of the TV, probably also using a USB-F connection.
