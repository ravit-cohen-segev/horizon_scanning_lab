3,"No, because mathematically, using a derivation of the Solow-Swan model in macroeconomics, you need technological progress in order to maintain economic growth.The basic Solow-Swan model states that economic output (Y) can be calculated as follows:Y = AL^aK^bwhere L is the amount of labour in the economy and K is the amount of capital. It is a Cobb-Douglas function, so the indices a and b add up to one. A stands for the level of technology in the economy.Some manipulation can show that gY = gA, so output grows at the same level as technology growth.About 200 years ago, economist Thomas MalthusNo, because mathematically, using a derivation of the Solow-Swan model in macroeconomics, you need technological progress in order to maintain economic growth.The basic Solow-Swan model states that economic output (Y) can be calculated as follows:Y = AL^aK^bwhere L is the amount of labour in the economy and K is the amount of capital. It is a Cobb-Douglas function, so the indices a and b add up to one. A stands for the level of technology in the economy.Some manipulation can show that gY = gA, so output grows at the same level as technology growth.About 200 years ago, economist Thomas Malthus predicted a gloomy vision for the future. He stated that because growth of food production grew at an arithmetic rate and growth of population grew at a geometric rate, eventually population would overtake the amount of food production and people with the least resources would starve, bringing down the population until it regained a sustainable level.But in reality, this didn’t happen, mainly because of the industrial revolution. Steam power, ships, automation, cotton looms, railways, large scale factories and eventually electricity meant economic growth boomed (because A in the Solow-Swan equation rocketed), making every worker more productive.Malthus didn’t envisage this happening, that technological growth would cancel out the effects of population growth.These revolutions don’t happen very often. First, there was the agricultural revolution, which occurred after the invention of the wheel. Then the industrial revolution. Some say we’re currently experiencing the information revolution. Next, we are predicted to experience the green revolution as we work out how to produce everything in a sustainable way, followed by possibly the space travel revolution once we’ve exhausted the natural resources of the earth.Every time we make a technological break-through, we avoid the doomsday scenario that Malthus predicted. So no, I’m not worried about the speed of technological growth as it prevents us from starving.",0 followers,John Vuong,890,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-feel-like-technology-is-moving-too-fast
4,"I don’t really understand the reason for this question, but wherever it came from, I think we all should really be asking ourselves the same. It's not informative to say that technology has evolved over the years, because there's really no proof to butress the idea. However, it's okay to say that technology has improved and still is in progress. For now, I will postulate that the future of technology in our world is mostly uncertain.Basically, everything in our age is being ran by mechanical means not very different from some hundred years ago. It's either automobile or something like that.TheI don’t really understand the reason for this question, but wherever it came from, I think we all should really be asking ourselves the same.

However, it's okay to say that technology has improved and still is in progress. For now, I will postulate that the future of technology in our world is mostly uncertain.Basically, everything in our age is being ran by mechanical means not very different from some hundred years ago. It's either automobile or something like that.There are three distinct phases of the human life.First, a time when humans were all supernatural. When there seemed to be almost no development as a result of the irrational belief in things they could neither see nor understand.The second phase of life is when man becomes more conscious of his surrounding trying to intercept between time and reality. They want to make a model of everything they see or at least something that looks like it. You can as well deduce that this the time in which we find ourselves. Besides, if time travel is possible at all, it's now. Man is so anxious to know everything beyond their reach, to unravel every mystery even when they know it's buried deep inside the heart of the universe. This is one place where my interest lies. This is the age of technology and technological advancements. So yes, to answer your question, technology is improving but not yet evolved. Still new laws and theories are yet to be discovered. I just realised a modern system of engineering known as quantum engineering has been discovered which will soon change the face of our universe. Even then…………..…….The third is what everyone’s been anticipating. It's the reason for everything we do. It's a time coming, when humans will delve deeper into the strange phenomenon behind sentience and intelligence. It's not artificial intelligence. This is travelling right to the very root of existence to discover the purpose of life. As it stands out now, man's greatest mystery is the source, understanding and purpose of both sentient and non-sentient life. Even the most powerful technology will not be capable of ascertaining this reality. For this reason, humans will have to unite with the universe in every way possible. This is what most fictional movies descibe as seeking ancient forces beyond space and time who have been battling, some to sustain the universe and others to twist it to their own will. Until mind and matter become but as one entity, the world will remain a place of impossibilities. Only then will the difficult problems of man be dealt with and so will some of the laws of physics and chemistry. Once we get to understand the complex relationship between humans and the environment, we will be close to bending reality to our own discretion. Yes, there will be consequences but soon everything we can boast of now will cease to exist. We'll no longer look around and be limited by the resources of old. Every science fiction will become a reality, except for those far-fetched. Physics will change, laws will be discarded, theories will become irrelevant….everything will become a reality. Yet to be honest, that will be, but many years from now. There's a lot of science in this speculation, like it or not.Come to think of it, how will those future fellows come to see us of today? They will believe us to be light-headed, pre-mature minded or, primitive people. They won't be far from wrong because that's exactly how we see the people of old.I think I've said enough for now. The revolution of technology has just found its roots and it's here, thanks to our great scientists and mathematicians.
