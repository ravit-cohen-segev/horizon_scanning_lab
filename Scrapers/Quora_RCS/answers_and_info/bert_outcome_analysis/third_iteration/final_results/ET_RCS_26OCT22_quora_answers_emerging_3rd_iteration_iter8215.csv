Our radio sphere represents our “sphere of influence” in the universe. It is within this sphere that humanity’s electromagnetic radiation can be detected.At this point, you’re probably thinking that humanity has a very large “sphere of influence”. I mean, our electromagnetic radiation has been propagating outwards into space for over a hundred years at the speed of light so our radio signals must be all over the galaxy. Right?Heck, our Radio sphere could even span across multiple galaxies right?This being astronomy, I’m afraid it’s now time for a depressing revelation on how infinitesimally small our “sphere of influence” is.Spoiler alert: it doesn’t span multiple galaxies. It’s not even halfway across our own galaxy.This is how far our radio signals have propagated into our home galaxy: the milky way.The little pale blue dot in the image represents our “sphere of influence”. The dot is about 200 light years in diameter. Every radio signal ever produced by humanity (including the ones you used to send nudes to your ex) fall within the little blue dot.If there is indeed anyone outside that little blue dot, they have pretty much no way of knowing about our existence. It’s only within that little blue dot where we can be “heard” or detected.I know you're probably having an existential crisis right now and I’m sorry to add insult to injury here, but there are also over 100 billion galaxies in the observable universe and seeing our harrowing insignificance in our own home galaxy is actually quite dispiriting to humanity’s hopes of someday becoming an intergalactic civilization.So we might as well take good care of our little wet rock.

Yes, you get some nice views, but space is constantly trying to kill you. He said he had no interest in going back; been there, done that, and it was exciting but exceedingly difficult. He suggested that the best way to explore the universe was with robots, like Voyager, not with people.I agree.

The nearest galaxy would be two billion miles away — at this small scale where the sun is a basketball and the Earth is a pea, the nearest galaxy would still be 2,000,000,000 miles away.In Dr. Zeigler’s scale model, Earthlings have sent probes to distances that are a little more than a mile away from our pea.

Modify your own personality or a complete temporary rewrite. Like, say, every at 7 o’clock, poof I “seem” to fall unconscious for a second and instantly “wake back” around 9 o‘clock, while in fact my brain got overtook by an app that goes outside, does 1 hour of strenuous exercise in the local gym (that I never want to do normally), takes a shower, and returns control of my own brain to me. Don’t want to do you taxes? Same thing: poof you just feel like you lost a couple waking hours while your mind got “took over” by a taxes-filling-app personality that has incredible work focus and access to your memories, perfectly filling those taxes in no time. And so on.Ultimately that gets to a point were relationships become quite fuzzy as you never know of you’re talking to your “real” significant other, or to an “temporary overlaid” personality tweak. some people will start having TONS of different personalities and almost never use the “base” one.Need better teamwork? Temporarily merge with say the 3 other coworkers in your work team, to create some kind of gestalt mind that is you-yet-not-you, and is more intelligent, and is able to “see” and “think” and “do” through all of your 4 willing bodies and minds.The concept of individuality starts to erode away, as you can theoretically exist in identical copies in more than one place at a time, and then ‘merge back” the copies memories later, and there is zero difference between a person and its copies. Bodies start being seen as mere support for what the individual is, just like some paper is merely the support for a unique poem.Later on it gets even more insane.Personalities not modified by tons of personality modification programs, are seen as both inflexible (like a stone can’t avoid anything thrown at it), and signs of a “mentally disabled” person.Gestalt-minds become the norm in society. Multi-multitasking is seen as routine and “you” constantly control multiple bodies all at the same time and that is casual. Most of those bodies aren’t even biological or even look remotely human. Those that can’t do it are seen like we seem illiterate people today.You can store your entire life as data, and you can relatively quickly live the lives of others, or think or see things from their perspective.Personality changing is extremely routine, as needs arises, and occurs almost every minute of your life. You stop being who you are, but start being what you have instead. Literally, since most of the objects you own can think and are extensions of yourself.Clones become popular and the line between individual and corporation ceases to be.Aliens living among us, but we are the ones who created them!Eventually, the inevitable conclusion:All of humanity fully joined and connected together in one big huge mind. Biological human bodies make up only an incredibly tiny fraction of that “godly” entity. Humanity looks upon us as we are now, much like current-we look at monkeys. The merge is complete and the line between what is an artificial intelligence and what is a human mind is fully gone.Not humanity’s extinction, per see. More like an evolution into something else.Hopefully it will take a millennia for this process to complete.As for the big “why don’t we see any alien civilizations?”, the answer is simple;The higher our tech, the more it becomes a question of doing more with less. Energy and computing speed become at a premium. This means living closer and closer gives real benefits: better bandwidth, etc. Fewer and fewer people want to live in the boondocks of “meatspace” where things are so slow and boring. Just like humanity went from an agrarian society to living in cities, at some point humanity abandons it’s numerous outerspace colonies (except by automated drones) and “concentrates” back in a very compact area (maybe Earth maybe some big processing cube in space). Smaller is better!So, we don’t see aliens because while their civilization is HUGE in terms of number of minds, they are TINY in terms of their actual “footprint”.

Provided that we continue (a) existing and (b) advancing in technology, by the middle of this century, we will have access to our entire genome, nano-technology (or at the very least, micro-robotics) and AI. Those technologies, if we try really hard to extrapolate their logical course, mean that at some point in the next few centuries, there will be no more homo sapiens. Perhaps a few “museum humans” will choose to remain in their old form, but those beings will live on Earth or space stations, too frail and ephemeral; too needy to package into dense vessels for interstellar travel.If our descendants survive, they will adjust their genome. Maybe it won’t become prosaic until 2125, but at some point very soon, the temptation to remove all “negative” traits will be overwhelming. The temptation to enhance with some genetic coding from other beasts will become overwhelming. The temptation to enhance with artificial bits —that connect us to instant information, right to the brain— will be overwhelming. The temptation to create new biological features un-imagined by “Mother Nature” wholly invented by us and our super-advanced computer technology (maybe a new cell wall, completely re-engineered mitochondria, or a cell part that we cannot imagine today) will become overwhelming.At some point, after sufficient changes, we won’t be human any longer. We certainly won’t be homo sapiens. We’ll be something else … IF “we” survive that long and continue advancing technologically. A global disaster could destroy our civilization but leave a few hundred thousand of us thrown back the equivalent of five millennia. But if we survive and continue advancing, then homo sapiens is done in a few centuries at the longest; a century at the shortest.At some point in time, the advancing technology will unlock self-assembling, self-making robotics that leverage exponential growth that will either be our end or our elevation to the pinnacle of abilities in this cosmos.

That’s the idea that a spaceship could maintain acelleration constantly by “scooping up” combustible interstellar hydrogen using a huge scoop… A force-field.The idea was that the ship could acellerate continuously towards it’s goal without requiring on-board fuel, then turn around at the halfway point (and reverse the force field) to decelerate/brake for the second half of the journey so as not to overshoot.Very high fractions of lightspeed could conceivably be attained by constant 1-G acelleration.",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,541,9.4K,195.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-future-technology-is-seen-in-Sci-Fi-that-is-possible-in-the-near-future

They’d dumped everything that had no immediate cash value, including all the client files and work in progress, into the dumpster behind the shop.So we…decided to contact all the clients and go into business.We made a deal with the owners of a computer store called Amazing Computers: free office space in exchange for a steep discount on doing the computer store’s advertising.The store was owned by two guys, partners, one of whom was exactly what you’d expect from a guy who owned a computer store (a geek’s geek) and one of whom was an ex-cop who loved fast cars (he owned two Acura NSXes, one black and one white, he called “salt and pepper,” and a very fast boat, and a private plane).The ex-cop made me super uncomfortable from the day I met him. I could never put my finger on why, but being in the same room put my hackles up. I never felt safe around him and felt extremely uncomfortable being in business with him.We made a go of it for a while, but I could never shake the fact this dude constantly put me on edge whenever he was near.It kept getting worse and worse until finally my friend and I were like “something’s wrong. I don’t know what or how, but something’s wrong. We need to get out.”So we packed up our belongings and cleared out of the office one day.A week or two later, Geeky Guy comes into the computer store to discover Ex-Cop has cleaned out the safe, emptied the company bank accounts, cleared out the inventory, and disappeared. No sign of him.Shortly after that, we pick up the newspaper to find Ex-Cop in the news, being arrested with his private plane packed stem to stern with cocaine.",84 followers,Gaye Bockman,1.3K,76,172.2K,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-depressing-things-about-space-exploration

Apparently she had phoned in sick and did not expect to return for a few days. She was a lovely lady but we were not particularly close emotionally or professionally. I began my day in the usual way, but couldn’t stop thinking about her and some of the short conversations Tammy (not her real name) and I previously had when we casually met in the kitchen or bathroom or wherever. As I tried to concentrate on my work, things started to feel a little “off”. But why? Everybody is entitled to take some sick time, and it was rare for Tammy not to come in. Thoughts of planning my day vanished as I started to feel a sense of urgency. I phoned her. No answer. At that point I felt an overwhelming desire to pay her a visit. The Personnel Dept had her address and, reluctantly gave it to me, sensing my unusual insistence that I HAD to see her, even without a valid reason.Arriving at her home, it appeared that no one was home. The blinds were pulled shut and it was eerily quiet. There was no answer to my loud and insistent knocking. More alarm bells, but logic told me that she was probably at the doctors office. The sense of impending doom overrode my logic as I raced around the back of her home. I found a sliding door that was locked, but leaving a very small opening. I learned later that it was just wide enough for her large cat to use but not large enough for anyone else to enter. I, however, was small enough to squeeze through with a great amount of effort, so I did. Nobody downstairs. I literally run upstairs with my heart pounding by this stage. There she was. In bed and unconscious. But alive - just. The ambulance I phoned for arrived within minutes.Tammy had tried to commit suicide and had gone to extraordinary lengths to ensure the desired outcome. Another few minutes and she would have succeeded. She was admitted to a facility appropriate to her needs and remained there for several months.I did not keep in touch with Tammy, especially after she made it very clear to me that my interference was not wanted and, at the time, she really did want to die. I somehow “know” that she is now grateful for her life and is doing the remarkable things she was always meant to do. I believe we all have a purpose in this life and that her experience, although probably negative at the time, has allowed her to become a blessing to others and a positive motivation for people who find themselves in her situation.For me, I continue to listen to that small inner voice. Is it intuition or coincidence? I believe it is the Universe, God or a higher power that is willing to guide me, and everybody willing to hear, along our path in this life. I’m learning to trust more and more as I walk through this fascinating story we call our life.After thought: I have had a couple of comments that have prompted me to add a post script, below. This is a copied response to a much appreciated reader.“Hi Mors, thank you for your response. I felt it important to let you know that Tammy completely recovered, mentally and physically. I was so grateful to hear from a mutual acquaintance some time later that she did eventually realise that she had two boys and a fiancé who loved her dearly, as she loved them, and did in fact “live happily ever after”. However, I totally respect your views. I too would like to have a choice when or if the time comes and it is appropriate. My mother had a DNR (do not resuscitate) document in place when she died and it was followed. I believe every one of us has free will, but on this occasion Tammy’s decision was “temporary” due to circumstances. Had that not been so, I do not believe the Universe would have sent me on such an urgent mission.”",0 followers,Jennifer Wulff,10.5K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-depressing-things-about-space-exploration

My intuition was right.After a block of driving without it’s lights on, they put the lights on again. I don’t know, did they think I wouldn’t notice and maybe think it was just a new car? I passed my house and drove straight to the police station, with the car still behind me. Only when I pulled into the police station parking lot, did the car speed away. I waited in the police parking lot for 5 minutes, watching for them to come back, but they didn’t. I drove to my house and sat inside with my dog in the dark, watching for them to come back but they were gone.This was before cell phones were a thing. Had this happened today I would have had the police on the line. Im still grateful to this day that I listened to my intuition.

My little sister said something that I wished I would have listened too. She said “I feel like she is taking our brother away from us!” Everyone was said something like, ‘no, they are in love’ and ‘it’s normal for people in a relationship to want to spend more time with each other than with they’re family’.Their relationship was already on rocky terms but my brother loved her with everything he had and didn’t want to throw away all of the time, money, blood, sweat and tears that he put into the relationship. He wanted to go through with the wedding and was willing to be absolutely miserable for the rest of his life for her. He had multiple mental and emotional breakdowns because of this.Anyway, way too long of a story short, they got engaged Christmas Eve of that year and started to plan the wedding with the date set for mid October. My sister and I were asked to be the token bridesmaids. The whole wedding planning process was horrible, with the colors being changed what felt like every 2–3 weeks and she couldn’t make a decision to save her life.Wedding date was closing in fast and my brother had a life changing revelation, that what our little sister had said almost a year ago was true. She had been emotionally manipulating him for years and was guilt tripping him into staying in the relationship with her.He broke off the relationship about a month before the wedding and we (his family) couldn’t been happier. He did go through post break-up depression. I had absolutely no doubts that he loved her but I had every doubt whether she loved him.Moral of the story - when your little sister, who only sees the best in people, says that someone is a bitch and is taking her brother away, listen.",3 followers,The Ash System,2.5K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-depressing-things-about-space-exploration

She really would have been my ideal caregiver.Daycare 2, the caregiver seemed nice but her childcare area which was on the split level of her house looked bare, red flag 1. The carpet was extremely worn down. She claimed that she doesn't have any kids under her care now since they all started school…all of them? Red flag 2. She also claimed that she had a daycare in another town nearby but decided to close that one, red flag 3. I just had a bad feeling & decided to keep looking. She later called me to see if I was still interested & I told her that her carpet was dirty...lol. She got upset but that's the first thing lame excuse that popped into my head.Daycare 3, the caregiver was friendly, lots of toys & kid friendly furniture in her garden room which was setup for childcare. References checked out. She was a widow who raised 5 kids on her own, her older daughter sometimes helped her. She was my babysitter until my daughter went to school & I still occasionally talk to her. She would confide in me all her family problems & I helped her with minor things usually technology related or getting references for handyman etc.Well about my instinct, I was talking to my babysitter about daycare 2 & she happened to know that lady as they were from the same ethnicity, same religion, same business & lived 2 streets away. My babysitter said that daycare 2 used to operate in another town just as that lady indicated & had to close it due to 2 children being injured/died in her care. Daycare2 did not disclose that pertinent information during my interview. Allegedly one baby died from SIDS during nap time & the “caregiver “ didn't check on the baby for hours. The 2nd incident was when a little boy fell down from a short wall during outdoor play & later died in the hospital from his injuries. I don't know how she can still operate a daycare but I'm glad I didn't go with daycare 2. Not that going to school is going any safer with stupid kids threatening to blow up the school which just happened yesterday.",0 followers,Laura Temple,22.7K,216,448.1K,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-depressing-things-about-space-exploration

I pulled off the road to get out of their way as they passed me.As I was still pulling over, and cars were still flying by, I came around a wide turn in the road. I realized at that moment that a tractor trailer was jackknifed across the entire highway. It was totally obstructed. All of the cars that had been passing me were sliding this way and that. Cars ended up stopped and spread all over the highway.My final evaluation of the situation is that if I hadn’t passed everyone and then slowed them all down (to their annoyance I’m certain), the people at the front would have never had time to stop and an accident was likely.

Hmm, well ok but I will call in a bit to talk with dad and make sure that is OK with him. NO I’ll have him call you.I left and got most of the way home but was feeling disquiet. Daughter’s friend seemed jumpy, daughter seemed bewildered as if she was questioning the change in plans and friends reaction to my questions. NOTE: After the move we had long discussion about the need to meet parents and know where she would be in a new town. At this time she did not have a cell phone and knew few people in the new town.I turned the car around and went back to the friends house (about 10 minutes after having left) and saw an old junker in the drive. I was a bit surprised as the dad had a great job and hubby said he was the type of guy that got new cars frequently. I knocked on the door and a young man answered the door. He looked nothing like the friend. My daughter jumped up and came to the door immediately pulling me out the door. Right then, the friend came running from the back of the house closely followed by a much older boy.I asked which boy was her brother and they both stammered. I asked if “dad” was back from the grocery yet, again fish face and no answer. Daughter said we should leave. I said we will but I wanted to know what was going on first.It seemed “friend” wanted to hang out with her much older (18 years old) boyfriend but he had a friend with him that day. Daughter’s friend decided to invite her for the day to keep boyfriends friend busy while she entertained her boyfriend in her room. Brother was not home, Dad was not home. I told daughter’s friend that the boys needed to leave and that I would be calling her parents.She said that she would have dad call me. He did and was FINE with his daughter and her much older boyfriend. My husband was not happy with our daughter being put in that situation and of course he forbade her from being around that friend. Friend’s dad felt that was wrong and had the nerve to speak to hubby at work. It did cause a conflict!Things were said and some of them very rude about my daughter and myself.

Daughter had expected to see other girls come over to hang out.

As the winch on the vessel began to tighten the line I had an uneasy feeling. I asked one of the linemen if the lines ever broke and he laughed saying, ""That's a one inch steel cable."" And walked off down the dock. But the feeling became stronger and I started backing up. Suddenly the line snapped and whipped through where I had been standing. It struck the warehouse on the pier and cut halfway through the twelve by twelve inch corner post. If I had not moved I would have been literally cut in half.

She told me she had always had her whispers, too, so yes, Mama knew.I remember a significant whisper from when I turned eight. I wanted a two-wheel bike in the worst way and on my eighth birthday, there it was. It was apple-red with a bell on the handlebar and a basket on the front —it was just as I had always hoped for.Daddy said we could start to practice riding it the next day right after breakfast. He didn’t have to work until the night shift, so we had most of the day. He hugged me and said he didn’t want me to get discouraged. Balancing was something that might take a lot of practice.I was so excited that I didn’t care how long it took. Then I heard a whisper that said, “Don’t worry, I will teach you how to balance.”That night when I went to sleep, I dreamed about my bike. There was a very small “male being” who taught me very quicklyWhen I woke up the next morning, I told Daddy I rode my bike in my dream the night before and it was so much fun!

Also the order was already paid online so at first I wasn’t overly excited about it because in cash payment orders usually They tip us a couple of dollars or so… So yeah I’m just here tryna deliver but I actually over heard one of the guys saying “the bloke is working hard, give him something” that’s when I realised I was gonna get tipped big! So the delivery took about 15–20 mins coz I had walk back and forth to my car and the house. So then after the last round of delivering like 4 pizzas I was told to wait! There were about 6 families there with 16 adults and all very friendly!

He handed me the phone to call. I wasn’t sure what to say. “Just call. You’ll figure it out”, he responded.The overwhelming feeling that something was very wrong wouldn’t let up. I called our daughter. She laughed and said everything was fine. I asked her to humor me and just go check. She said kids were asleep, so I asked her to go check the kitchen. Still chuckling at me she checked the stove and oven and declared them turned off. She looked about the rest of the kitchen until she turned in the direction facing the front doors. We have a large arctic entry so there are two front doors on each side of it so we come in from the cold and close one door and then open the second door to come to the house.“Oh my God!” She cried out, and the phone went dead. I frantically tried calling back.When she finally answered again, she told me both doors were wide open, so she called her Marine brother to come down from the upstairs apartment and he raced down. He did a security sweep of the house then the perimeter where he found evidence of bear on each side of the house. We question if the door was slightly ajar and the bear just pushed the doors open and started to come into the house until the phone rang.That same mom vibe served me well when my Marines were deployed. I always seemed to know when to pray. It got to the point that whenever there was an incident, my other Marine son said he wouldn’t worry. Even when trapped in a doorway during a fire fight for five hours… because he knew his mom “knew” and was praying. Oddly enough, he was right.

No doubt these guys would fail miserably if they rush to save Fire Lord Ozai.Thor is basically a human at peak physical condition, even more so than Captain America, as a depowered god. Wipes out other other physical condition humans without a sweat. Sure he’s 1500 years old, so I guess he wasn’t the best example, but I couldn’t think of anyone else.Never mind, here’s a great example. I don’t recall this guy taking combat classes in his first movie before the super serum. After super serum, he’s taking down a battalion like he’s done it his whole life.Next door neighbor girl isn’t the most beautiful yet a kind person the male protagonist doesn’t like romantically at first, but they look like this:Or thisShy next door neighborhood girl is supposedly unattractive yet they cast a beautiful woman with incredible bone structure who can easily pass as a supermodel or celebrity. Bonus: she doesn’t even know that she’s beautiful or doesn’t put much effort in her appearance yet you can tell by her perfectly manicured hands or carefully tousled hairstyle that says otherwise. According to movies, she’s not “beautiful” or anyone’s top list simply because she keeps to herself.Take off your glasses and style your hair, and suddenly you’re the most attractive person ever clicheFrom dorky sweet and introverted journalistTo super hunk with massive muscles.From unpopular dorky girl with glassesTo beloved royal beauty with no glasses.Female assassin who was orphaned at a younger age, grew up on the streets, tormented or scorned.All of these women had bad handouts in life so they had to toughen up. Yet every “hardened” female killer you see in movies, tv shows or video games have the same sad backgrounds in different phrases as if you have to have a shitty life to become a trained killer. Movies don’t stray from this. Some people don’t have shitty lives yet still killed people in their lives just because they can.Tiny slender woman beat down a whole group of buff dudes effortlessly while looking like a model doing so.Let’s be honest, men can easily overpower women. Yet you see 110–120 pound actresses beat down 10+ guys who are physically fit without messing up their hair or hardly getting scratches. When I was sparring with guys, they were holding back to avoid severely injuring me because one full power punch or kick would end me.The useless military and police clicheAlmost every movie that show the military or police force make them look like total idiots with high tech and guns. While in real life (there are some idiots in the police and military ranks) when it comes to dangerous situations they generally aren’t panicking or clueless. Similar to my useless guards, they are shown to be overpowered easily. Also, they’re shown to be unnecessarily aggressive or clueless as if they can’t think for themselves or why should they listen to the protagonist as they’re in a bloody war zone.For example, when Captain America was ordering the police to protect civilians at a certain location, the leader automatically retorted why should he listen to him. Um hello? Aliens are invading and terrorizing civilians, civilians you should be protecting instead of just pandering around. Only after Cap beats up a bunch of aliens in front of him is when he finally orders his men to do what Cap ordered him to do so.Either movies vastly underestimate how powerful and effective military weapons and air strikes are or they purposefully depower them when it comes to the military combating aliens or zombies, rendering their weapons almost useless.While we don’t know how advanced aliens would be in real life, it shouldn’t be that easy to wipe out the whole military force on Earth. Who knows, maybe it is.If there’s one thing all governments don’t fail to do unanimously, they spend a lot of money, time and effort into weapons of mass destruction. With the modern age evolving, it’s only natural for weapons to evolve as well and the more technology advances, so will our weapons. Those same weapons should have no problems wiping out walking flesh bags (zombies) and the world shouldn’t become an zombie apocalypse due to the military constantly evolving and scanning for threats.The government is pretty good at keeping things contained and hushed. If there was a zombie outbreak from their lab, it was probably most likely neutralized already and we didn’t even know it. Movies portray the military as inadequate to keep things contained and being virtually powerless or too late to stop them despite their arsenal while we know in real life it would be the opposite.","5,598 followers",Shruthi Sailesh,2.1K,1K,6.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-depressing-things-about-space-exploration

Just in time to give her a haircut to cover up the emotional reconnection. The whole room leaves them alone for one magical haircut. Come on people. Did you need to pile all that on together? “People love that!” you say? Unless it’s been shoved in our faces.Just because it worked in a previous movie doesn’t mean you need to do it in every movie. It jolts you out of suspension of disbelief. It breaks that fourth wall “There’s the writer trying too hard!”Later on after winning the match Billie is ecstatic, she’s overwhelmed by the crowd, the interviews and she has an interview coming up with a famous news caster in a few seconds and then…What do you know, she ditches the whole thing to have a good cry in the abandoned bowels of the stadium. Yep, nobody there but her and her tears. Did that scene need to be shoved in there? If it had happened in real life then please at least try to make it a bit more realistic. And then when she comes out nobody even notices her, Billie Jean King, the woman who just won the battle of the sexes, the woman people all came to see and was hyped up on television for weeks…nope, nobody but her costumer notices her, and he gives her some life coaching advice about how love of every kind will be accepted one day.Wonderful advice. Why oh why did they pile on all that other unbelievable crap on top of it? And let’s make Bobby Riggs look like he’s pouting his way off the court and sneaking out of the stadium! What a loser! Right?Yeah, didn’t happen.I can see the producer now: “We gotta add a scene in there where she breaks down, people love it. The adversary has to be broken and act like a petulant child! Yeah, that will make her victory even better. We have to add a scene in there where she gets some good solid uplifting words from an admirable gay man who’s seen it all! The gays’ll eat it up! We just have to have her run away from the biggest tennis match of the decade and have a nice breakdown! The audience will be crying their eyes out at that point!!! Oh trust me, I know movies.”oooooR: The audience will role their eyes and think “Oh pulleeaaze”.Puuuulllleeeaaazzze!Such a great movie ruined in the last few minutes by someone (producer? writer? director?) who felt they just had to throw everything they had at the audience.And if you watched Bohemian Rhapsody you’ll know what I’m going to say next.After all the glory, all the parties, all the gumption and grit, the talent, the record producer holding them back, Queen and Freddie get to take the stage in a stunningly mirror image portrayal of the real Freddie Mercury at Wembley Stadium for the Live Aid show….but first, in one glorious morning Freddie has to get his drug addled life together, reconnect with a gay lover who will become the love of his life, take that man to his parents’ house, confront them about his life, his career, his sexuality, make amends, take the whole entourage back stage to watch all of this happening ALL WITHIN ABOUT TWO HOURS ON ONE MORNING!Really!?AYFKM!?","3,350 followers",Eduardo Marqués Collado,4.2K,943,11.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-depressing-things-about-space-exploration

That’s the beauty of society: it evolves.If you’re going to attempt to create authentic Victorian or Medieval characters—write them accurately.
