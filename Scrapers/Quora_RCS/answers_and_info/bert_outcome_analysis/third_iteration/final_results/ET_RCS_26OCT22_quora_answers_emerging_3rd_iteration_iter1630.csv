Artificial Intellig#5 G related technologies will change Higher Education within 10 yearsIn recent years, this technology has emerged and has grown to become very popular. Technology revolutionizes our daily lives and there are several technology trends that will help you in the years to come, and which should be known. So let's find out exactly what Technology Trends related to this technology that will improve standard of communication and improve on standard of living in Cities and daily lives brought on from enhanced research and development and education with 5G and related technology;1. Artificial IntelligenceAI is about all intelligent machines that will artificially act like talking, reading, watching, recognizing things and emotions like humans. Using algorithms and code, the machine can perform tasks that are very burdensome for us. And that too with accuracy and efficiency. AI began to be used well everywhere from health services to banking. It can be used on gadgets too. Various voice assistants such as Google Assistant are operated by Artificial Intelligence (AI).Today, many researchers and companies will work in this region to really help us in our daily lives. AI has created possibilities in specific ways , in areas as AI in health services .2. Machine Learning, Robotic and mechatronic applicationTrends in Machine Learning technologyAnother interesting and emerging technology is machine learning. This is an integral part of AI, which can be a machine's ability to understand, analyze, and track itself. In other words, placing skills to be understood in machines or computers is Machine Learning, which offers the ability to know data. That's possible through algorithms.The possibility of hand held device might come out with diagnostic models due to fast data processing allowing AI to be integrated in such areas will see faster and even accurate option of better healthcare or even or in most areas of application that requires computing solution that can be provide thru high speed data acquisition and computation allowing for better developed software to make use dedicated equipment able to acquire data acquisition to enable higher response rate and data processing( available on googleplay and Amazon kindle - AppleIbook - Dwayne Anderson )3. IoTInternet of Things technology trendsIoT is one of the fastest growing technologies in recent years. ""Internet of Things"" is just a concept or concept through which all smart devices can connect to each other using the internet.The Internet of Things is a network that uses applications, electronics, and the internet to really help connect devices, gadgets, or equipment to each other. Once they are connected, they can communicate and exchange information. Radio frequency identification (RFID), sensors, wireless, and QR codes are IoT applications. Similarly, AI and Machine Learning will also be connected with thinking about the Internet.If you are aware of Smart Homes and Home Automation, IoT is the main idea behind the device and the type of equipment that makes your home Smart.Smarter cities will then include integration of smarter facilities and also smart homes into a smart digital hub for everybody to live , work and play4. Augmented RealityAR is increasingly being applied today. Already used in various activities including art, entertainment, trade, education and the army. And also available on your own smart device. Augmented Reality (AR) improves user experience with sound overlays, videos, graphics, etc. On the real things. Unlike VR, AR develops the facts by enveloping digital elements on it which could act as interactive sensor that allow data manipulation and communicationThe Augmented Reality application is growing rapidly. It is important to realize that it has an extraordinary ability to change our perception of humans.AR is also used in industries such as health, public safety, tourism and many other industries5. 5G Technology5G is the next generation mobile network technology that will provide much faster speed than today's 4G LTE network .there are 2 major manufacturer namely Nokia and Huawei both working and competing for '5G First'. Similarly, phone manufacturers focus on devices prepared for 5G. However, 5G technology may be commercially available in 2020, but has Huawei has push and started launching in China and in the UK when recently USA started tariff related trade war with CHINA , and was try to put up technological restraint especially on HuaweiWorld Gone mobile with 5 G mobile for SmartphoneThe trend of mobile technology in 2019 is much more excited than the previous year. However, in 2018 many new concepts and things related to the latest mobile technology emerged. We started talking about 5G technology and eSIM. Similarly, some phones come with a wave of multiple cameras on the back, front unlocking and top-notch screen on the smartphone.Yes, it is true that the 5G wave has spread in the smartphone market. In addition, network companies have begun to think about the release of 5G. Although it will take more time, it may be up to 2020, but the focus of phone manufacturers is on this. And the next phones can be released this year with 5G compatibility. One of Samsung's main mobile phones has announced its 5G phone model: Galaxy S10 5G.Not all, but some of us can enjoy 5G speed smartphones. The reason behind this limitation is the execution of 5G. It seems that in 2019, 5G can only be implemented in some states of the world.",0 followers,Glen Boston,655,71,1.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-three-technology-industry-predictions-do-you-have-for-the-next-year

13,"To some extent, hopes are mere emotion, and so that’s a personal matter, and a quite large one.

Yes, we have a lot of hope available to find, even if such requires some amount of searching for. Attitude seems somewhat key there, and that involves perception, and knowledge, and a fair amount of consideration of a number of factors.Around 1896 Arrhenius gave us something about the greenhouse gas parts of climate change.if the quantity of carbonic acid increases in geometric progression, the augmentation of the temperature will increase nearly in arithmetic progressionAlthough that’s not much for the rest of global warming, the land-use changes part, or what to do about it. But this isn’t a new field.Around 1908, he also suggested this wasn’t necessarily a bad thing.We often hear lamentations that the coal stored up in the earth is wasted by the present generation without any thought of the future, and we are terrified by the awful destruction of life and property which has followed the volcanic eruptions of our days. We may find a kind of consolation in the consideration that here, as in every other case, there is good mixed with the evil. By the influence of the increasing percentage of carbonic acid in the atmosphere, we may hope to enjoy ages with more equable and better climates, especially as regards the colder regions of the earth, ages when the earth will bring forth much more abundant crops than at present, for the benefit of rapidly propagating mankind.Which essentially is what seems to have occurred, even if the influence was not as great as has been thought. So even more than 100 years ago some people were brilliant interdisciplinary scientists and visionaries. Perhaps some hope can be located within that, stemming from a time when the science wasn’t “settled” (Arrhenius and others were still working on it) and when the comparatively sparse samples of glass thermometer air and water bucket measurements were but three or four decades old. The first climatologies so to speak.But assuming that climate change is a problem to be solved, what might occur in the next 25 years to do so? If we go with the last 25, not much has necessarily gotten better with the climate since 1993. At least in the sense of the rise in the global average temperature anomaly trend. At least in amount of carbon dioxdie etc in the air and water, changing chemistries and physical behaviors. However, since 1993 there has been an increasing heightened awareness of the environment, improvements in pollution control and fuel economy, reforestation efforts, waste management focuses, advances in biofuels, wind, water and solar power, and many governments, scientific organizations and people focusing on the impacts that more and more people have on their nations, if not the planet.So what does now until 2043 hold for usThat’s as clear as many of the scenarios of what happens climate-wise by then, it can go many ways, there are a number of factors (thought of and unthought of) that could happen as expected, or less, or more, or be unexpected and unplanned. The future is notoriously difficult to accurately divine ahead of time. Humanity has a terrible track record at doing so too.As far as pronouncements of doom, humanity has not perished from disease, run out of food, run out of oil, or exploded itself out of existence so far. The future might hold the same as the past has.The answer goes two ways.The more pessimistic is that scientific, technological, economic, and social sorts of advancement will not be able to keep up with more people and more stuff, and things will get worse.The more optimistic is that advancement will outpace growth, and things will get better.There’s a third I suppose, in that the changes to humanity over the next 140 years will go much the same way as the last 140 years; they’ll change. Some will be better, some will be worse, but all in all, things will be more pleasant by and large for a large number of people.The answer is at least somewhat dependent upon what world population does, and what those working on solutions accomplish. Mostly not those researching causes, or trying to categorize nuances, or arguing about their biases, will solve anything. That will be those taking perceived problems and investigating and weighting potential solutions, and then working on methods to implement the most practical and promising solutions.The science (body of knowledge itself) isn’t just “settled” (mostly agreed upon by most that are qualified to comment) it’s largely meaningless as compared to the science (investigation, acquisition, correction, and integration).As long as people are working on the policy and implementation of policy in an economic, social and political framework, there is certainly hope. For whatever aspect of the future in whatever time frame.Yet of course some will be unable to find that hope, for whatever reasons they fail to.","1,185 followers",Greg Freemyer,2K,3.1K,4.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-three-technology-industry-predictions-do-you-have-for-the-next-year

The single thing we can all individually do toThis comes back to population as being the biggest single driver of our problems. No matter what we do with technology, if we cannot get our population under control, it won’t matter. There was hope that population growth was beginning to flatten out over the last few years. But some recent statistics I saw the other day suggest that the growth rate is heading back up again.Of course, there is a lot we can do with technology to mitigate and perhaps delay some of the impacts - though I think the focus needs to be on using less energy, less resources generally, and generating energy without burning fossil fuels or non-sustainable bio-fuel. I don’t see large scale carbon sequestering techniques, for example, making a big impact. Equally important in my view is doing all this in a way which stops destroying bio-diversity in nature.Along with that, we need to use technology to be able to tolerate the climate changes and keep ourselves civilised through whatever happens.I suspect in fact though, that our biggest risk as a species is not specifically climate change. But it is the effect we are having on the natural world, upon which we rely for the long term future. If we destroy our bio-diversity, we will not be able to get that back in a hurry!

16,"When I think of the magnitude of the effort that would be required in order to mitigate or solve climate change by any form of technology or engineering, I think of what sort of effort it would take to cork a volcano so that it was stopped from erupting.The answer is - no hope.The main issue with considering a technological solution to curbing climate change is that the technology would need an immense amount of energy. What the people of the Earth need to do to decrease the advance of climate change is to use less energy.","16,657 followers",Lee Thé,699,10.1K,80.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-three-technology-industry-predictions-do-you-have-for-the-next-year
