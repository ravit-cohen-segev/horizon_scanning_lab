So, Israel today, has the talent, the concentration and the genetic presence to give Israel;the Jewish Country -the best input, from the best of science and technology.Israel is a Western nation. It is a free economy, a democracy and has many companies that have serious R&D units.2/3 of all households have internet, all businesses have high-speed internet, the telephone network is excellent, and new Start-ups are the standard, and impressive. Most high-school kids and 80% of all adults have smart-phones.For obvious reasons the Military industries are very advance and support our High-Tech Army. We have portable computers with most field-companies, drones overhead, the latest jets in the air and our satellites in the sky.Our tanks are technological wonders. The technology for tanks to fire, at a pin-point target while on the move-at 50 Km/h is made and used in Israel.We have robot boats, tunnel -destroying technology and face-recognition cameras in most ‘hot-spots’.The technology to shoot down enemy rockets-while in the air-over the enemy side of the fence is made in Israel and well applied.Our computerized and radarized anti-‘car-crash’ system is now sold all around the world.In medicine, We have the latest technologies and we have developed many of them....","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Currently-what-new-needs-are-emerging-as-a-result-of-technology-advancement

Thaaaank you!Other than surveillance and aerial mapping, the Tello could also be used to survey or access a locked-in house for a possibly incapacitated patient.This drone is more stable within buildings, and was actually made for indoor photography:This idea has been lifted for hostage rescue situations for identifying point persons (hostages, combatants), but since our job is more of rescue and medical management, the tactical need for a quiet drone may be dismissed, as its rotor blades make a bee-like ruckus when in flight.Don't worry, no showering citizens were captured in it's utilization, ever. I swear.Now, for rescue situations that are more hair-raising, say a fire in a high-rise building, or a reported accident in a land-inaccessible area, the bigger drones come out to play.Why the bigger drones you ask? They can fly longer, higher, and are more stable in open air situations where wind could be catastrophic to lighter models.Also, they can be used for other tasks other than surveillance and identification. For fires in high places, there's even a drone made specifically for firefighting purposes, when hoses and ladders can't reach:If only this puppy was cheap and on the market, oh you'd better believe I'm gettingYou could also take it to a local pool party for the coolest water gun in town!On second thought, don't do that – you didn't hear that from me okay?What about if somebody flops down onto the pavement in the middle of a bustling street in Sweden?This neon yellow drone delivers an automated external defibrillator (AED) upon calling EMS. Bystander CPR plus AED use increases the chances of survival of said flopped citizen, or at least gives them a fighting chance until the EMTs arrive.And I'm happy to report that nobody's shot down one of these like a parcel goblin looking for Amazon loot.These are but a few of the wonderful applications of drones in the my field of work. And quite frankly, I'm still looking for more.Ingenuity stops when there's no more problems to solve, and from what we've seen so far is just the tip of the iceberg.Don't be surprised to see drones do more for EMS, and you'd probably see me at the front of the line, giggling in anticipation, once a new one comes out.Ehhhhh, once the paycheck comes in.And when another obstacle or challenge rears its head on our watch?Gandalf's words just might ring true:Fly, you fools!","246,860 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.5M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Currently-what-new-needs-are-emerging-as-a-result-of-technology-advancement

But introduction of mass-produced automobile like the ‘Model T’ from Ford virtually replaced horse drawn carriages and is considered ‘disruptive’.Social perspective“The plan is like this, we first take the night train to Madurai, reaching there in the morning”.“Ummm….”“Then we take a car and straight go to Kodaikanal, we reach by noon”“Ummm….”“You know where I have booked up this time? Guess what, karlton”.“Ummm….”I realized that my teenage daughter was not paying attention. Her fingers were busy dancing across the Smartphone, typing out text messages.“Why can’t you listen at least, I took so much of pain and trouble for arranging this holiday. You are not even interested”. I was visibly upset.“Ummm….”.“What ummm?”“Ohh papa I am listening”.One more time Smartphone proves to be smarter than a dumb parent.Medical perspectiveWhen I joined my third year of medical curriculum, during the surgical posting, 9 out of 10 general surgical procedures would be some kind of surgery for peptic ulcer. A part of the stomachs was removed with cutting off the vagus nerve (which triggers off the gastric acid secretion) a technique called ‘gastrectomy’ and’ vagotomy’. Faster the surgeon more was his status. By 1980 Prof James black discovered a novel kind of drug that blocked the receptors in the stomach that resulted in profound reduction of acid secretion. It was a new concept, acting like a wrong key in the lock. The receptor, like the lock got essentially jammed by the drug, making the real key useless and the lock failed to work. Acid in stomach came down. The implication of the discovery of H2 bolceker drugs (Cimetidine and Ranitidine) were such that by the time I was doing my MD in medicine, routine peptic ulcer surgery became history. Disruptive technology at work in medicine.Blocked artery in the heart, birth defects, as well as heart valve disease, beyond a stage, were once considered treatable only by open heart surgery, Today with the advent of percutaneous catheter based interventions majority of them go home cured without a scar and anesthesia.
