0,"Fusion would not require all the extra energy to make fuel, would be cheaper but it would be offset by the tremendous expense of fabrication such as supercooled magnets to create magnetic field to contain the plasma for fusion. Fusion does not create as much radioactive waste as spent fuel from fission but it does give off radiation. As to efficiency well it takes a lot of energy to maintain the magnetic fields needed plus the coils have to be supercooled plus to move the heat to a conventional type turbine in order to turn a generator, well it is difficult to say it would be more efficient.

Today’s fission plants are limited by the turbine cycle more than the primary of the reactor. Good questions, but realistically at this point not a lot of good answers in my opinion.",0 followers,Ace Grushkin,592,763,1.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Theoretically-would-nuclear-power-generation-be-better-if-we-were-able-to-utilize-fusion-power-generation-rather-than-fission-If-so-would-it-be-a-more-efficient-power-source-than-what-we-have-right-now
1,"Aside from “inertial confinement fusion” (which is a fancy way of saying you blast a target with lasers and the fusion happens before it has time to explode), almost all potential fusion power schemes involve using electric and magnetic fields to confine an extremely hot plasma. You may have seen photos similar to this, the KSTAR tokamak reactor in South Korea:(Interesting fact: the brightly glowing plasma around the edges is actually cooler than the stuff in the middle)The plasma must be heated to millions of degrees, but if it touches the walls of the container, it will cool rapidly.

So keeping it confined with powerful magnetic fields is the primary challenge.The problem is that plasma isFluid dynamics, the study of gases and liquids in motion, requires very powerful computers to model with fine enough detail to be useful. This is why supercomputers have proved so essential in fields like aerodynamic design and weather prediction.Now, try to imagine how challenging it is to model a fluid that experiences turbulence and convection and all the phenomena that gas does, but is moving far faster, is far hotter, and is simultaneously influenced by and creating electromagnetic fields and electric currents. The mind boggles.Still, progress is being made. Some very smart people are chipping away at understanding how fusion plasma works and how to control it, but as you can see, they have their work cut out for them.Edit: To elaborate a bit since this is getting views, the success of magnetic confinement fusion is often measured with a metric called the “triple product.” This is confinement time x density x temperature. All of these are of course important. Temperature and density both affect your power output; higher densities and temperatures yield more energy per cubic meter, which is important as far as getting more energy out than you put in.So, why am I focusing on confinement? Heating the plasma isn't difficult, it's keeping it hot (which means keeping the most energetic nucleii from wriggling through your confinement fields). And higher density also requires stronger confinement fields. So both density and temperature are contingent on keeping the plasma contained. Stability is more important than field strength, too: instabilities can build and overwhelm the strongest fields. Hence the importance of understanding the minutiae of magnetohydrodynamics, and the incredibly complex modeling and math required.Again, progress is being made. Confinement times used to be measured in fractions of a second, while today fusion plasma (not just plasma but plasma undergoing fusion) has been confined for over 100 seconds at a time.","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Theoretically-would-nuclear-power-generation-be-better-if-we-were-able-to-utilize-fusion-power-generation-rather-than-fission-If-so-would-it-be-a-more-efficient-power-source-than-what-we-have-right-now
2,"Why do most of our methods of power generation rely on turning turbines? Is there no better way to get energy from things like nuclear fission?Apparently not.Turns out, heating water into steam is a very simple and reasonably cheap way to transfer energy from a heat source to a mechanical device. Turbines are a good solution for turning steam (and other liquids, but mostly steam) into mechanical motion.Burning fossil fuels (especially cheap natural gas) in a gas turbine is another cheap way to produce mechanical energy.Turbines are an all-round good solution.","29,974 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.7K,249.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Theoretically-would-nuclear-power-generation-be-better-if-we-were-able-to-utilize-fusion-power-generation-rather-than-fission-If-so-would-it-be-a-more-efficient-power-source-than-what-we-have-right-now
3,"The question must be about thorium power, i.e., the use of thorium in fission reactors or similar devices. Never say ""never,"" but this is very, very unlikely.

I'd place my bets for future automotive energy systems on hydrogen fuel cells, where the hydrogen is generated elsewhere, probably by electrolysis or other process -- biological? -- from water.For that hydrogen generation, many approaches are possible, including solar electric, satellite solar power, eventually cold fusion may prove practical (not so far!), or ... thorium reactors are possible. Still, of nuclear options, only cold fusion would be clean (the known reaction produces only helium as a product). Hydrogen as a fuel, i.e., a way to transmit energy from original production to application, is totally clean, producing only water as a product, from hydrogen and air.For a different opinion, seeNote that the author believes these batteries exist, ""my recent information is that the U.S. and Russian militaries are  already using these nifty batteries in their most sacred and secret  programs.""OrWith a photo of Eugene Mallove,Hence I can be sure that the sources on thorium batteries are not careful researchers of any kind. They misrepresent what is in the public record, repeating rumor as fact. If anyone has reliable contrary information, I'd love to see it! But what I'm seeing in searching is only conspiracy theory.
