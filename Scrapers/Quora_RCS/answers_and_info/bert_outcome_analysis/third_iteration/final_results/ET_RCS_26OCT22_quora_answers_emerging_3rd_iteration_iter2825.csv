Such an agent might not merit that description from its own point of view, much less from that of an even more advanced agent.It depends, then, on how far you extend the notion of a god.If you mean an immensely knowledgeable and powerful agent, one able to create new universes comparable to this one in which we find ourselves, or even better than this one, for example, then I think the answer is yes, that is possible in principle. Why shouldn’t it be possible?If, however, you resort to the notion of God with a capital “G,” and press it with abandon to the limit, to the point at which God is absolutely this and absolutely that, all-knowing, all-powerful, and whatever else you feel an urge to throw in, then, I think, the answer is no, it is not possible to reach any such height. Here is the reason:There is no such height, in that if you press the notion of God that far, you have rendered it simply nonsensical.Overall, then, my answer is yes, by any reasonable definition, we can become gods by means of knowledge, understanding, and technology.There is one qualification, however, and it is important:After humans pass a certain ill-defined point on the path upwards, it no longer makes sense to call them human. The gods that appear do indeed deserve to be called gods from our point of view today, but they are not human beings.If you are interested in the broad question of man as God, you might do well to look into the work of philosopher Ludwig Feuerbach (1804–1872).",3 followers,Mark Bradford,12.8K,579,2.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-you-were-approached-by-aliens-and-they-were-willing-to-give-you-only-1-of-their-advanced-technologies-what-tech-would-you-ask-for-and-why

I had never had any kind of ticket before for any reason (besides parking, which you just pay online), so I honestly didn’t know what to expect and failed at resolving the issue appropriately.When I showed up to my court date, 99% of the other people theI’m a 29 year old white woman with blonde hair and blue eyes.I had to go to court for “failure to appear” because I’m an idiot, and I didn’t realize that when I got a ticket for not displaying my updated registration sticker on my license plate, I had to actually go to a courthouse and show them proof that I fixed it instead of just fixing it. I had never had any kind of ticket before for any reason (besides parking, which you just pay online), so I honestly didn’t know what to expect and failed at resolving the issue appropriately.When I showed up to my court date, 99% of the other people there were Hispanic and Black. I was wearing a well-fitted skirt suit and leather pumps. They were mostly wearing worn out t-shirts and jeans; some wore flip flops as well. Almost all of them pleaded guilty (except for the red light camera folks - they pleaded not guilty on the grounds that they were not the ones in the picture and were all acquitted because of a well-known loophole). Those who pleaded guilty were fined, and those requesting reductions in fines were almost universally turned down.There was a young Black man wearing a suit. It didn’t fit, and his longish hair was in twists. He was really trying to dress and speak professionally, so I thought they would go easy on him. He was charged with the same thing I was: failure to appear. He contested the charge, was treated brusquely, shuffled along, and almost certainly went on to a conviction which included a fine, a misdemeanor, and points on his license.I pleaded guilty. The judge very sympathetically asked, “So why didn’t you show up?” I answered that I made a foolish mistake in not reading the ticket closely. I expressed genuine remorse for wasting the court’s time, but did I really deserve the boon that came next? He dismissed the charge of failure to appear, and I was ordered to simply pay a $25 fine for the original infraction. I was stunned, grateful, confused, and couldn’t stop thinking about all of the other people who were not given the same leniency that I was.My white privilege allowed me to be an idiot and make a mistake, but avoid any real punishment. That $25 fine was basically nothing to me, and the time off of work cost me nothing because of my wonderful employment situation.The other people, the Black and Hispanic people, in that room who were clearly being deeply burdened by having to take time off of work to appear, and who almost certainly couldn’t afford $100-$300 fines, were the ones being most severely punished.It made me sad for them. I learned 2 lessons that day: read the fine print on both sides of your ticket, and don’t underestimate the unfairness of the legal system towards People of Color.Like I said, 99% of the people in that room were Black or Hispanic. That tells me that there’s a problem from the ground up; all the way from law enforcement up to judges.EDIT:Quite a few people have suggested that perhaps my being a female was more significant than my being white. I don’t recall the Black and Hispanic women, whether they apologetically pleaded guilty (2 did, one was Hispanic, the other was Black, both were very polite and soft spoken) or not, getting any special treatment. Their charges certainly weren’t dismissed. Sure, I don’t know their history, but is it really constructive to assume they were all repeat offenders?",6 followers,Mats Andersson,4.4K,20K,369.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/If-you-were-approached-by-aliens-and-they-were-willing-to-give-you-only-1-of-their-advanced-technologies-what-tech-would-you-ask-for-and-why

I was once assaulted by the police for speaking my language (Hebrew) on the phone with my mother. I have been physically assaulted for being a Jew numerous times, and once had a knife pulled on me during one of those altercations. Quite a lot of privilege there, eh?Sure, I guess I could pass as white and never have to deal with discrimination if I always keep my hair cut, shave, never speak my language, take off my Star of David necklace, change my name to a nice English one, and whatnot, but the fact that I need to do those things in order to escape overt violent discrimination tells you all you need to know about how privileged we Ashkenazi Jews are.","26,670 followers",Donna Fernstrom,1.1K,9.3K,64.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-become-a-god-with-technology

Just a few names that randomly popped into my mind, a few first-rate 20th century physicists whose contributions are, at the very least, comparable to Hawking’s, but who are probably completely unknown to the public, even when they are Nobel laureates.As to why the world hasn’t had another Einstein… because it is not every day that physics has a “perfect storm”, the simultaneous paradigm shifts of relativity theory and the quantum theory. In fact, I daresay it is unlikely that such a dramatic shift in physics will ever happen again (yes, I know, never say never and all that, but I think we are smart enough to know, more or less, what it is that we don’t know in physics, and that’s why I have the audacity to make this statement.)In other words, if Einstein were a young physicist today, chances are that he’d be doing top-rated physics at a university or research institute somewhere… and chances are that outside the theoretical physics community, nobody would even know about his existence.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.
