Especially in the US that is the worlds largest user of nuclear energy.This needs to be done soon as other countries are planning to build Gen 4 reactor prototypes. Gen 4 Prototypes may give us vital options for low carbon energy.Generation 4 reactors can be much safer, cleaner, cheaper and smaller than current PWR, Pressurizes Water Reactors with Metal fuel rods containing enriched Uranium fuel. Though these reactors are very safe they are highly inefficient, creating to much waste and leaving most of the Uranium fuel wasted when fuel rods are replaced.Generation 4 reactors could use different fuels like nuclear waste, mining waste and even unused weapons material.China is building Next Generation fission reactors using some US research and designs. As US industries and government will not build new prototypes. China has just started operation of a prototype Gen 4, gas cooled, pebble bed reactor. The spherical pebbles use highly heat resistant materials such as carbons, ceramic, silicon carbides and other materials able to withstand heat over 1000 degrees. Heat that would destroy current PWR reactors.China will likely soon have a Molten Salt Reactor, MSR, possibly with Thorium fuel. And sodium-cooled WAve reactor using waste depleted Uranium as fuel. A type of breeder reactor. Breeder reactors can actually produce more nuclear fuel. Some breeder reactors have been developed but are not common.MSR reactors are potentially revolutionary with very high efficiency, little waste, very safe, small, possibly using efficient factory production of small and modular reactors. The US has a number of these designs and has done plenty of past research. Much of which China is using to build there own MSR reactors. One prototype should be in operation soon. With China also breaking records with Fusion reactors the US is being left far behind.A Chinese research Fusion reactor has produced plasma heated to 3 times the temp of the sun for 100 seconds. Temperatures that would melt any known material. Or turn them into plasma itself. The US and China are part of the international ITER Fusion reactor in France. Costing over $10 billion and it should be completed in 2025. But it is very far from producing cheap, low carbon power. Generation power could be far cheaper and sooner.China and India have the world largest growth in energy demand. Large renewable projects are not able to keep up. India and China are planning over 50 new reactors to meet demand. India has large Thorium deposits and want to use that to fuel its new reactors.The world needs safer nuclear technology. And the US should be leading the world. The US has the technology and resources. But large coal, gas and oil companies have powerful lobby groups to stop development.Current US reactors should remain online as long as they are cost-effective and safe. Closing down working reactors is hugely wasteful. And the US needs this vital low carbon energy. But they should be replaced with Gen 4 reactors if prototypes are successful.At the moment prototypes are vital. And could be an important option for low carbon energy.PWR reactors are complicated and need huge amounts of safety features to keep them safe. That makes them very expensive. Most of the expensive and dirty enriched Uranium fuel becomes waste. Years of high grade nuclear waste can now be used as fuel.But the US does not need to build Gen 4 reactors. We can soon be buying them from China.","105,675 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.5K,6.8K,91.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-merits-and-drawbacks-of-the-Polywell-fusion-reactor-design

4,The gov’t “supports” new reactor technology by approving those new designs. AP1000 is a new reactor design and several are in service or being built. Several SMR designs are due to be approved soon. The gov’t (US) also supports new reactor plants with loan guarantees. The DoE also operates several national labs that are working on molten salt and other reactor tech.

5,"Of course. But politicians respond to public sentiment. And with hyped TV series like Chernobyl, that sentiment is going the wrong way. There is a credible conspiracy theory that the US supported HBO in creating this series.

It was eventually discovered that nuclear fusion powers stars.In 1920 British physicist Francis William Aston discovered that the mass equivalent of four hydrogen atoms is heavier than the mass of one helium atom (2He4), which implied that net energy can be released by combining hydrogen atoms to form helium. This provided the first hints of a mechanism by which stars could produce energy. Throughout the 1920s, Arthur Stanley Eddington became a major proponent of the proton–proton chain reaction (PP reaction) as the primary system running the Sun.[1][2] Quantum tunneling was discovered by Friedrich Hund in 1929, and shortly afterwards Robert Atkinson and Fritz Houtermans used the measured masses of light elements to show that large amounts of energy could be released by fusing small nuclei.Rutherford understood what tremendous forces could be unleashed from the atom nucleus. In a famous 1934 experiment that opened the way to present-day fusion research (including ITER), he realized the fusion of deuterium (a heavy isotope of hydrogen) into helium, observing that ""an enormous effect was produced.""The first patent related to a fusion reactor was registered in 1946 by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority. The inventors were Sir George Paget Thomson and Moses Blackman.","220,635 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,783M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-merits-and-drawbacks-of-the-Polywell-fusion-reactor-design
