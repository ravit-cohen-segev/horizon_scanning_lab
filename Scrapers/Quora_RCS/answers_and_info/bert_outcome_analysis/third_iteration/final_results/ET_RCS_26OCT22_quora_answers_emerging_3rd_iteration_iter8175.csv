Linux Powers Japan's Bullet TrainsWe all know about the Shinkansen, (popularly known as Bullet Train), which is the network of high-speed railway lines in Japan. The trains are famous for their super fast speeds of 240–320 km/h. The Shinkansen uses an Automatic Train Control (ATC) system to eliminate the requirement of the trackside signals. Additionally, it uses the Automatic Train Protection system which is a centralized traffic control that networks and computerizes all tasks related to train movements, tracks, stations and schedules. And yes, most of these systems are powered by3.High-Tech Road Traffic Control Running On Linux!How about high-tech traffic control system, which can read and influence the rate of traffic flow, read the time intervals of outgoing and incoming network traffic that can help in making complex network traffic policies and shape the mechanism using a variety of algorithms. Sounds like a super technology? As per Funtoo's report, San Francisco has recently started to use such traffic controllers and yes they are powered by4The In-Vehicle-infotainment (IVI) systems which are used in automobiles is the latest trend in the auto industry which delivers entertainment and information content to the travellers. Although every IVI system has different features, the basic functions these devices perform are managing and playing audio content, utilizing navigation for driving, delivering entertainment to the rear seater like movies, games, social networking, reading out incoming and sending outgoing SMS text messages, making phone calls, and providing access to the network-enabled content like traffic conditions, sports scores and weather forecasts.And one of the largest automobile manufacturers, Toyota is using Linux as the base platform for its IVI technologies! Aren't you proud?5. Linux Powers The New York Stock ExchangeOne of the fastest moving businesses of trading stocks, bonds and derivatives, the world of financial exchanges are becoming Linux friendly. Yes, the largest exchange of the world, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has replaced their Unix based systems with Linux. The systems can generate 1,500,000 quotes and process 250,000 orders every second together with producing acknowledgments of every transaction within two milliseconds. Go Linux!6. Linux Helping In Power Particle Physics ResearchCERN, the largest particle physics laboratory of the world trusts upon our beloved Linux to control its huge particle accelerator. The laboratory makes use of Scientific Linux (SL), the Linux distro produced by Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). Scientific Linux like any other Linux distro is free and open sourced and is based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.7. Linux On Air Traffic Control SystemsThe FAA's (Federal Aviation Administration) Common ARTS software of the United States has been moved to Linux. The air traffic control computer system, Common ARTS (or Automated Radar Terminal System), is used to track aircrafts. It automates the air traffic controllers job by synchronizing various radar and human inputs. Most of the TRACONs around U.S. are using this system.8.Nuclear Submarines Running On LinuxThe U.S. Department of Defense is using Linux in many of its technologies and the U.S. Army is “the” single largest install base for Red Hat Linux. But the most amazing amongst all of these is the nuclear submarine fleet of US Navy which is powered by Linux. This nuclear submarine was delivered by Lockheed Martin to the US government in 2004, and it is powered by Red Hat Linux.9.The Four Web Bigshots, Google, Amazon, Twitter and Facebook; They All Use Linux!The largest search giant Google, the biggest social networking sites Facebook and Twitter, and the most popular e-merchant Amazon they all share your OS, Linux, for various web and cloud services!So next time you tell some one that you are using Linux, say that proudly!source:edit: ThanksIn space, no one can hear you scream at the Windows 8 Metro screenYa even this is powered by Linux.source:",430 followers,Sandeep Gorai,865,86,391K,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-most-powerful-OS-for-programmers

He’s really smart.4. Mr. SinisterMr. Sinister is to biology what Reed and Doom are to technology. He has done everything from taking over a Celestial just to use as an engine for his cloning machines, to creating a trap that causes you to die of cancer ten years before you actually even think of breaking into his labs.5. Hank PymHank created the size changing Pym Particles, the psychic insect control, and the unstoppable killing machine known as Ultron. Pretty damn impressive.6. Tony StarkHistorically I have found Iron Man somewhat underwhelming. It’s mostly in the last decade, when the MCU really began beefing up his intelligence feats that he began to be able to seriously compete in the “who is the most smartest?” contest.7. Valeria RichardsChances are incredibly likely that Val will rise all the way up to the top of this list. She is, just of this writing, an incredibly young girl. A girl who was performing Reed-level super science when she was three, but still quite young. Full potential… look out.8. M.O.D.O.K.His brain is just a giant super computer.9. Bruce BannerBruce Banner, when not a rampaging green monster, is a highly acclaimed scientist. He hasn’t been able to find that one perfect cure for his condition, but that doesn’t mean he hasn’t created dozens of new technologies over the years.10.

When they visit many students and most teachers are arrested. You'd rather just be expelled.Eldar/DarkEldar:They're the school ghost that makes students disappear for no real reason.Orks:They're not lucky enough to be students but they seem happier for it. They run into classrooms, steal everyone's lunches and kick everyone out. There's rooms in the school the police and school board can't get them out of.Tyranid:A pack of wild rabid animals.

Student get addicted and go with them just by being in the same hallway.Tzeentch:The guidance counselor. Whenever things go wrong they're right there, with advice on how to graduate sooner. The school keeps putting up posters telling you not to listen to the guidance counselor, they have no interest in your future, just in keeping the school running, and the advice puts you in terrible danger. The students who follow the advice get taught in a special classroom and most come out with mutations or like mindless shells of what they once were, but every so often a new guidance counselor that was a student emerges and they seem to have made a decent life for themselves. You end up following the advice even when you try not to.Adeptus Mechanicus:It's like they go to a different school in your school. They only learn trade skills.

Now, the operating system cannot be modified and you have a lot of RAM to do things.Finally, add a second hard (or solid state) drive to your computer that contains your information, and a third solid state drive that backups that information upon request. Just in case of ransomware.Now you’re fine. The operating system is fine, because it cannot be changed, no matter what you do (or the virus does). Worst case scenario: It removes your files on the primary drive and you can restore from a backup.Or just remove the secondary information storage systems, and have everything in RAM. Got a virus? Reboot, and it’s gone! Along with all your data, but still!This may be very impractical, but at least you can access the Internet. And maybe memory dump on a USB to extend sessions.OK, now here’s the Prevention method. It offers the most security, and the most like a normal computer, but requires much better specs.Every application that connects to the internet runs in a separate lightweight operating system inside a virtual machine. You can access the files on that virtual machine from your computer, but the virtual machine can’t access your files. Worst case scenario, you lose your files, and need to reinstall the virtual machine(s) (the OS will hopefully do it for you!). The operating system cannot be modified, so it is fine.So, basically, it is incredibly easy to build an operating system that cannot be affected by any attacks or viruses; just make an unwritable disk! However, protecting the files on your computer is up to the user.The problem is not making a box unopenable; it is making it openable to those who need to open it.You can also prevent internet downloads entirely, by keeping them inside a virtual machine permanently. This will make it impossible for the main computer to be affected by viruses.Here’s how secure you can get:This will prevent USB and/or internet downloads affecting anything but each other.

With one exe file that you can run from a USB thumb drive, it is built in javascript, Flash player, PDF reader and torrent app. When you start it in the first time, it will create a folder in the same place as the exe file. This folder is entirely virtual drive. It contains all the registry inputs, all your downloads, cookies. Nothing will be outside that folder. Even if you install plugins, run malicious scripts or viruses, extract zip and rar files, drag images outside the browser to your desktop or simply save them anywhere in your computer folders, you will not see them anywhere outside the virtual folder. If you downloaded music files or videos or whatever, no matter which folder you select (let's say program files folder), you will find them in the virtual folder/c_drive/program files/. Over time, when you got viruses, the browser will crash frequently, all you have to do is to delete the virtual folder after moving your precious downloads somewhere else. And when you start the browser, it will create a blank virtual folder again like nothing happened.The browser can also be used as a testing virtual machine. You can browse folders by typing c:/ in address bar. You can then install programs through the browser. Keep in mind that everything will be written in the virtual folder and will rely on the fake registry in the virtual folder. This means that if the browser is shut down those programs will not run as the virtual drive is not running. I remember that I was eagerly trying to download a software for graphic design from torrent. As usual, I test it before installing it on my windows. So I installed it from the virtual browser Opera. It installed fine and when I run it, a border-less window opened that has a devil image with horns and bold text saying ""you have been infected by a virus idiot"". I wonder who the idiot was. This pop-up window can't be closed as it doesn't have any buttons. Actually, I took that into consideration when building the browser. By closing the browser, any processes running from the virtual folder (drive) will automatically be killed, even if winzip is still extracting, it will die once the browser is shut down.
