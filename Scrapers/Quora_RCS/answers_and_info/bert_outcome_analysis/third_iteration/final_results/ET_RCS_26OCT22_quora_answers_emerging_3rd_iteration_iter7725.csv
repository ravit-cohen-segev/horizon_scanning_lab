1,"I used to work on fusion simulation codes (particle in cell) with the US National Labs when I was at NVIDIA, and I was very interested in seeing if we could solve the problems with fusion and picked the scientist and engineers' brains endlessly. My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators.

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",3 followers,Steve Baker,3.7K,27.4K,163.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-Lockheed-has-solved-the-plasma-containment-problem-what-remaining-technical-hurdles-exist-before-a-power-reactor-could-be-built

So if the reactor produces 3 kW, the car would be limited to a 9mph top speed!However, if the car still had a decent battery pack, the nuclear reactor could recharge it overnight by about 90 miles in 10 hours - which is enough for most people’s commute.Failing that - fitting 10 bowling balls into the trunk of the car would get you a 90mph car without needing batteries…and the reactors would last longer than the car itself, so it would never need refueling or recharging.[[UPDATE]] :But it would take 7 tonnes of fuel rods (which are insanely radioactive) to get enough Americium for ONE of those reactors. The cost of one would run into the billions of dollars range.CONCLUSION:It’s completely implausible to do this in practice.","220,642 followers",Franklin Veaux,550,47.3K,783.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-Lockheed-has-solved-the-plasma-containment-problem-what-remaining-technical-hurdles-exist-before-a-power-reactor-could-be-built

6,"Yes, fusion does emit dangerous radiation but it has different composition to fission radiation. Neutron fluxes are especially high with fusion while alpha radiation is also high since fusion works by fusing heavy hydrogen nuclei into helium. By contrast fission produces abundant alpha, beta, gamma and neutron radiation. Fusion also produces no long lived waste products, the biggest hazard being fugitive tritium with its half life of 12.3 years. While fission creates a host of unstable, radioactive nuclei with half lives ranging from seconds tens of thousands of years.","220,642 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.1K,47.3K,783.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-Lockheed-has-solved-the-plasma-containment-problem-what-remaining-technical-hurdles-exist-before-a-power-reactor-could-be-built

8,"Yes, nuclear fusion releases harmful ionizing radiation.In the “typical” tokomak fusion device, deuterium and tritium (hydrogen with 1 and 2 extra neutrons, respectively) are forced to fuse in a high-energy plasma cloud that is energized and contained by magnetic fields, releasing a total of ~17 Mev in energy, mostly as a high-speed neutron.

9,"Q “Does nuclear fusion release harmful radiation like fission does?”Yes, in that it produced very high energy neutrons. However, it’s not the radiation produced by the reaction (whether fusion or fission) that is the primary concern, as that is relatively easy to contain.

Also, it’s fuel is generally not highly radioactive (perhaps some tritium is involved). The whole thing is therefore a lot cleaner in that respect.Both fusion and fission reactors will irradiate their containment vessels, and render then radioactive to some extent, but even then the fission reactor will be a lot worse.nb.

This difference in plasma ion density between ICF and MCR fusion has real practical impacts on how much energy you can practically produce from a small fusion reactor. ICF fusion using ultra-dense fusion plasma has a clear natural advantage in small fusion reactors if the size of the fusion driver to initiate fusion is made manageable.The issue of producing net energy while simultaneously achieving a high enough power reactor power density are the dominant themes of the near future in selection of which fusion technology is best suited to produce competitive fusion power plants that communities will want to build to produce safe and dependable nuclear power.The ultimate prospects of He3 + He3 fusion in physically small Inertial Confinement Fusion Reactors are goodHe3 + He3 -> He4 + 2protons + 12.9 MeVuses totally non-radioactive fuel and produces totally non-radioative Helium as nuclear waste (and no neutrons - only easily shieldable protons that can be collected and directly produce electricity at very high efficiency exceeding the Carnot efficiency of any thermal power plant)The combined requirements of He3-He3 ICF fusion is only about 40X the combined temperature, plasma pressure, and confinement time requirements of DT fusion. This not an impossibly high requirement and will be reached in future ICF fusion power plants.A graphic by Professor Gerald Kulcinski comparing key fusion reactions (including He3-He3)To be fair, it should also be remembered that the cost of ICF fusion systems tends to be dominated by the cost of the fusion driver. If the ICF fusion laser is the size of several football fields, many of the cost benefits of using an ultradense plasma are at least partially lost. NIF ICF laser fusion still requires a lot of cement and steel to build. ICF fusion power plants will become increasingly cost competitive as the cost and physical size of the fusion driver (laser, particle beam, etc.) is reduced and the sustained recent four decade record of improvement in the power of large fast pulse lasers for ICF fusion is extraordinary. In the last ten years the power of large fast pulse lasers has increased by a factor of 1000X (while the cost and physical size of powerful fast pulse lasers has significantly dropped).He3 based fusion has many significant advantages for small reactor applications directly powering cars, planes, trains, and perhaps rockets to go to the stars.1) Fusion has no critical mass requirement, all that a fusion reaction requires is the right conditions be met (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) to support fusion. As a result, very tiny fusion power plants can potentially be built.Pure He3-He3 inertial confinement fusion power plants in mobile applications like vehicles or tools could use periodic bursts of fusion energy to produce electricity through magneto-hydrodynamic power conversion (no moving parts - near 100% Carnot cycle energy conversion efficiency) to recharge batteries which would propel an exploratory vehicle across the surface of a remote planet.(picture by Paul Dimar)(and the amount of He3 we could potentially manufacture on earth from a modified form of D-D fusion that suppresses the He3 burning side chain while it manufactures He3 is very vast - 2.3 x 10^13 metric tons).A properly tuned D-D inertial confinement fusion reactor may be able to produce He3 on earth (so we may not have to go to the moon for it).D-D fusion is a practical reaction for energy production from inertial confinement (about half of the fusion experiments in history have run Deuterium fusion fuel for part or all of their operational lifetimes).It is proposed (but not yet experimentally demonstrated) that there are a range of conditions (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) that ICF D-D fusion reactors can be operated at that suppress the following D-D fusion side chainHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThis D-D fusion side chain occurs at higher temperaturesand normally consumes the He3 produced inside a D-D fusion reactor. By properly tuning the operating conditions of a D-D ICF fusion reactor, it should be possible to make the ICF fusion reactor produce both fusion energy and He3 fuel.Graph of fusion reaction rates versus temperature for several important fusion reactions.Manufacturing (2.3 x 10^13 metric tons) of He3 worldwide from modified D-D fusion of sea water would open up many fusion application that are now not seriously considered, including fueling nuclear fusion based transportation.Note: The amount of Deuterium in seawater is very vast (4.6 x 10^13 metric tons). The amount of He3 that could be produced from a modified form of D-D fusion that suppresses the He3 sidechain is similarly vast (2.3 x 10^13 metric tons).D-D fusion normally produces He3D-D Fusion of Deuterium fuel produces energy through four reactions:D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeVD + D -> T + p + 4.03 MeV(side chains)D + T -> He-4 + n + 17.588 MeVHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThe net effect of these four fusion reactions taken together is:6 D -> 2 He-4 + 2p + 2n + 43.243 MeVThe relative abundance of He3 in lunar regolith is actually quite low (much lower than the average abundance of Uranium or Thorium in the earth's crust).Because the Moon has been bombarded for billions of years by solar wind, which consists largely of ionized hydrogen and ionized helium, helium-3 is available in the dust of the lunar surface. Even there, however, helium-3 is present only in average concentrations between 10 and 20 parts per billion. Hundreds of millions of tons of lunar soil (more properly called regolith) must be mined and processed to extract a ton of helium-3.The average abundance of Uranium in the earth's crust is 2 ppm and Thorium in the earth's crust is 6 ppm (about two orders of magnitude the average natural abundance of He3 in lunar regolith).",457 followers,Jason Heinisch,1K,1.2K,2.2M,2017,https://www.quora.com/If-Lockheed-has-solved-the-plasma-containment-problem-what-remaining-technical-hurdles-exist-before-a-power-reactor-could-be-built
14,"No, probably not.So, the main stopping block to nuclear fusion is the lack of homogeneity in the plasma, which is only made worse with a smaller reactor, not better. Let me explain. Most attempts at fusion use a toroid design (a big donut shape) with the ionized gas being accelerated by large electromagnets around the outside.While this process does turn some of that gas to plasma, meaning a dissoNo, probably not.So, the main stopping block to nuclear fusion is the lack of homogeneity in the plasma, which is only made worse with a smaller reactor, not better. Let me explain. Most attempts at fusion use a toroid design (a big donut shape) with the ionized gas being accelerated by large electromagnets around the outside.While this process does turn some of that gas to plasma, meaning a dissociated jumble of ions, it does not turn all of it to plasma. That is problem number one. The second problem is that a plasma now is filled with charged particles that have, you guessed it, their own little magnetic fields. This means that they mess with the other ions in unpredictable and unwanted ways. This lack of uniformity means that you need to have bigger and more expensive magnets to push them back in line and behave. This means that you need a bigger reactor and more power to get the thing going.The last factor that makes size a big deal is just the...",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

The reactor itself is more expensive than all the gold that can be mined on it. And so far, obtaining gold in this way cannot justify itself economically in any way, it may be cheaper to mine it on asteroids.In fairness, I must say that some gold is still obtained in reactors, namely the radioactive isotope, gold 198, for medicinal purposes.","74,724 followers",Tiny Nair,548,689,28M,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-Lockheed-has-solved-the-plasma-containment-problem-what-remaining-technical-hurdles-exist-before-a-power-reactor-could-be-built
