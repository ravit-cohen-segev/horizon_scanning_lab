It is far cleaner and more productive—relative to the other sources—and is not dangerous with today’s technology.

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but it really isn’t. Even in the core of the sun, fusion generates only a small amount of net heat. A cubic metre of the sun’s fusing core only generates around 275 watts. That’s less energy output than we give off as body heat for an equivalent volume. The reason why the sun is so hot is because there are hundreds of thousands of miles of insulation (in the form of hot gas contained by gravity) around this heating centre.There’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), and then we have to extract sensible energy without causing the whole reaction to stall and still end up with enough energy to outweigh the inevitable energy losses.I hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be.

Still, many people, including Congress, would like to know for certain if inertial confinement fusion will ultimately work and actually produce net energy from fusion. To answer this question, in the final few years of underground nuclear testing, both LANL and LLNL designed a series of test shots called Halite-Centurion. Halite-Centurion series shots were fusion related add on shots piggy-backed onto shots already on the schedule. These shots were designed to utilize a small portion of the X-rays produced from the primary of an experimental device through a line of sight to a remote fusion experiment housed some distance away in the underground experimental test canister. Lasers and Ion-beam fusion drivers such as were available at that time (1984 - 1988) could not provide the driver energy required to produce fusion ignition - but X-rays from a remotely ignited fission device could provide the driver energy needed (>20 MJ energy delivered into a spot of about 2 mm in a time of less than 3 nanoseconds) .Halite-Centurion fusion experiments in the Nevada desert worked reliably and repeatedly and produced full fusion ignition of small sub-gram samples of DT fuel (in small filled spheres). These experiments were once classified but DOE allowed senior scientist Dr. John Lindl to declassify and reveal about half of the fusion related project information.Inertial confinement fusion is the only form of fusion that has to date been proven to work in actual field experiments (not just theoretically predicted in computer simulations).Once classified Halite-Centurion test shots experimentally proved that small DT filled spheres could be ignited and brought to full fusion ignition using an intense beam of X-rays.ICF fusion is different from Magnetic Confinement Fusion and other forms of fusion as ICF fusion has beenIf fusion drivers are designed that sufficiently resemble the characteristics and performance of X-ray driver used in Halite-Centurion experiments, there is no question that full fusion ignition with fusion energy gain will be practically achieved. Practical fusion is not a matter of guesswork or conjecture but has already been PROVEN in actual field experiments by both LANL and LLNL National Labs in the last years of underground nuclear testing at the Nevada Nuclear Security Site.------While wanting to avoid excessive controversy, I would like to point out the following historical facts.Ivy-Mike fission-fusion ICF technology worked the very first time it was tried in 1952.There was no gradual trail of experimental failures on the road to ICF fission-fusion leading to a final success after many experimental tries.

It's like a more pervasive version of the antivaxxer movement, where antivax is still relatively lunatic fringe, being anti-nuke is extremely mainstream. Just look at how the Three Mile Island event was reported and perceived by the public. Rather than being touted as a success of redundant systems that resulted in a safe shutdown and no appreciable leakage, it was portrayed as a disaster. This made it extremely difficult for new plants to be approved and very few have been built since.","29,974 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.7K,249.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-nuclear-fusion-is-the-future-of-energy

Practical fusion will always be 50+ years ago (not 50 years away). Historically, this early method of producing more energy from nuclear fusion than it took to bring the fusion device to fusion conditions actually worked the very first time it was tried - fission-fusion technology actually never failed to work. Today, pure fusion device technology derived from successful early fission-fusion designs that does not require a fission primary is possible and is a better candidate for peaceful, ultra-clean, commercial electrical energy production from fusion.Inertial Confinement Fusion of Hybrid DT-DD Pure Fusion Devices for Energy Production -Deuterium is a very cheap and abundant fusion fuel. The deuterium in sea water is capable of completely powering planet earth at a the current level of 17 Terawatts for 29.4 billion years. Deuterium-Tritium fusion fuel is however much easier to ignite and requires a less powerful and costly fusion driver to initiate. It makes some sense to minimize the size and cost of an ICF fusion driver (laser or particle accelerator) by using some DT fuel as the first stage fusion primary (the match) while producing the majority of fusion power from ubiquitous sustainable D-D fusion of pure Deuterium.The energy needed to ignite an inertially confined thermonuclear fusion reaction in liquid (or solid) deuterium-tritium (DT) is not that large; it is on the order of not more than 20 MJ or about the same amount of chemical energy stored in about 2.5 cups of automotive gasoline.The problem is that this energy must be compressed in space (focused down to an area less than a 2 mm) and in time (to less than 3 nanoseconds).Conceptual Drawing of a 2-stage DT-DD clean energy optimized pure fusion device.How efficient would a small ICF pure fusion power plant be?Inertial Confinement fusion experiments produce their energy as a repeated succession of short energetic fusion bursts. A two stage DT-DD device has a significant advantage over a single stage ICF fusion target in energy gain.At a power plant level, probably the fairest and best way to express the efficiency of a fusion power plant is in terms of “wall plug efficiency”. How much (electrical) power do you have to draw from the local power grid to produce a given amount of fusion generated electricity?Modern semi-conductor lasers are between 10% to 30% efficient at converting local electrical power into ultra-violet or X-ray laser light (lets say 10% efficient for the purpose of this calculation). To deliver 20 MJ of light energy to the DT primary fusion capsule would require drawing about 200 MJ of electrical energy from the local power grid. Realistically, there are some additional inefficiencies in delivering ultra-violet or X-ray laser light to the fusion capsule -So the best estimate for the amount of electrical energy that has to be drawn from the local power grid to deliver 20 MJ of ultra-violet or X-ray energy to the fusion capsule is 1000 MJ per shot.An energy yield of 250 GJ is equivalent to an energy yield of 250 x 10^3 MJActual commercial second generation ICF fusion power plants will not use fusion heat to produce steam as is displayed in some of the concept drawings included in my Quora answer. It is far more likely that some form of Direct Energy Conversion will be used to efficiently convert fusion energy into electricity. Dr. Friedwardt Winterberg of the University of Nevada has proposed a very high conversion efficiency method for converting fusion energy into commercial electricity[1].How would a Hybrid DT-DD Pure Fusion mini-PACER Power Plant Work?Here is a picture of how a first generation pure 2-stage DT-DD mini-ICF fusion power plant might work.Concept Picture of a ICF power plant -It is widely perceived that commercial forms of nuclear fusion are currently ~30 years away (and always will be) - but the reality is that such widespread and excessive pessimism about fusionPractical fusion will always be 50+ years ago (not 50 years away)[1] -",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,202.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-nuclear-fusion-is-the-future-of-energy
