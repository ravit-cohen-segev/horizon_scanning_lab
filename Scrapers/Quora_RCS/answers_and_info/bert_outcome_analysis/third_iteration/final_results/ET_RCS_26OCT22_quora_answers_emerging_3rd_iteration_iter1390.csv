That is a relatively new thing.So - you are seriously suggesting are you, whether our ability now to communicate to millions of people across the entire planet in realtime - and have actual discussions and conversations with tens of thousands of people you’ve never met (like I am with you) is a bad thing!!!What meaningful conversations did wNo - this question is wrong.For most of mans existence, we have not had books or writing.

3,"Renewable energy is not yet old, and it is still in initial phases, undergoing changes and adjustments to make the sources more efficient and adaptable.You have conventional energy sources for over hundred years now. The technologies kept on improving and today's plants are highly efficient compared to earlier versions.Same will happen with renewable energy sources. Efficiency of both wind and solar plants is increasing by the day, and they are also getting cheaper. In addition, other renewable sources are coming into play. So you can expect advances in different systems in near future.Since eRenewable energy is not yet old, and it is still in initial phases, undergoing changes and adjustments to make the sources more efficient and adaptable.You have conventional energy sources for over hundred years now.

4,"Probably not in the immediate near future. but in 50 ~100 years it’s very possible. I remember in early 1980s when China just opened up(and still extremely poor), Reagan government sent someone to China to evaluate the Chinese education system(because Ronald Reagan wanted to know if the Chinese can be a strong ally against the Russians). The result surprised everyone. The average chinese middle school students outperforms american middle school students in almost all science field, especially in math. The reagan government official went back to report that “the Chinese will rule the world”.",UNKNOWN,Daniel Cohort,11.9K,377,1.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/People-seem-to-be-reading-fewer-books-and-engaging-in-fewer-meaningful-conversations-because-of-technology-internet-social-media-Is-this-the-next-step-of-human-social-evolution-or-is-it-an-evolutionary-dead-end
5,"For sure yes without any doubtsFor example China has 202 Super computers and stays on top of the list ahead of US with 144 Super computers.

Chinese are also leading in the amount of intellectual property patents for design and industrial engineering and again going ahead of US. More than 60% of the papers written in steel industry belong to Chinese research engineers.They have huge technological companies which can go one on one with their equivalent Us ones . For example like Alibaba (Amazon), Baidu (Google), Xiaomi (Apple), Tucent(Facebook), Did Chuxing (Uber),Youku(youtube and Netflix), QQ(Spotify) etc. The list goes on. These companies are financially as strong or sometimes stronger than their American counterparts. Having access to such a large population helps. That the government helps by restricting competition from outside definitely helps a lot.This domination does not end just in technological sector. Siemens and Alsthom had to merge in September this year (2017) to counter CRRC in the high speed rail building industry. This merger will bring a 18billion$ competitor to CRRC which is having an annual revenue of 35billion$. They are very active in infrastructure projects in Africa where the western world is not so involved.The government is stable and enforcing technological advancement with authority (of course it is difficult to enforce such things so hard in democratic countries). Intelligent Steel making , Indistry 4.0 , Driverless Electric buses (running in Taiyuan), Electric Taxis all are examples of Government backed advances. Sometimes experiments fail like the straddling bus in Qinhuangdao. But then such steps help technological advancement.So I would not say that Chinese are the most technologically advanced country yet. But considering the above arguments, in decades for sure it will be.",0 followers,Lance Chambers,660,7.6K,24.4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/People-seem-to-be-reading-fewer-books-and-engaging-in-fewer-meaningful-conversations-because-of-technology-internet-social-media-Is-this-the-next-step-of-human-social-evolution-or-is-it-an-evolutionary-dead-end

Even though China had bouts of war they had a central imperial system and on the other hand the Indian system suffered due to colonialism and their systematic abuse of Indians to weaken the polity.China and India are out numbering the USA and Europeans in churning out graduates from their universities. Untill last year US dominated in number of graduates and now USA is packed in the third place with 67.4 million graduates. The world's number one in terms of graduates is India with 78 million and closely followed by China as second with 77.7 million graduates.Some estimates that the both the educational power houses will be in competition and China will take the lead in 2030.Both the counties are trying to do well in their STEM score and in number of STEM graduates.The world economic forum reports that in 2016 China had 4.7 million STEM graduates while India has 2.6 million and USA half a million.India is missing the opportunity to become the most advanced technology nation. One need to look at the last budget year and the allocations for science and technology areas. Certainly the figures did not make the scientists happy.Modi's vision is to make his nation a science power house in 2030. This means the educational system and the curricular has to be modernized and central and state governments need to make a special effort to achieve this vision.India spends on science and technology a measly 0.9 percent of GDP while China spends 2 percent of their GDP.","68,787 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,514,17.3K,413.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/People-seem-to-be-reading-fewer-books-and-engaging-in-fewer-meaningful-conversations-because-of-technology-internet-social-media-Is-this-the-next-step-of-human-social-evolution-or-is-it-an-evolutionary-dead-end

Manufacturing is often dirty, lowly paid, requires long shifts, is thankless and mindless. Americas still wanted a living wage and a living wage in China is a lot lot less than in the USA. With money to be made in China over 4500 American companies set up in China and another 250,000+ from other nations did the same.Those corporations made a fortune and they continue to do so and China rose up the wealth ladder faster than any other nation.China also has another massive advantage and that is that they are ruled by a body that isn’t voted in but that rather are selected based on merit. This allows them to make very rapid decisions that will be implemented very quickly. In the Western democracies there can be numerous agencies, individuals, government oversight committees, etc., etc. that have a right to comment and delay implementation and as you can imagine nations that have to go through these torturous procedures will and do fall behind when you have a nation like China ready, competent, and driven to grow that is leaving the rest of us in their wake.Please watch these and weep for what we seem incapable of doing that China never stops doing.A short stretch of the Karakoram Highway.One of the three guys from Top Gear.
