1,"How else would you propose someone do it? Remotely? Unfortunately, precision marksmanship requires hands on knowledge, as well as the ability to feel what’s going on around you. Feeling and hearing the wind start to pick up, seeing heat mirage down the flight path, so on and so forth all come into play with the calculations that must be made to accurately place a precise shot (meaning having the round hit where you want it to).",1 follower,Daniel Baker,6.7K,3.4K,7.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-snipers-still-aim-and-fire-manually

However, I’ll relate what I do know.This depends upon what you mean by ‘manually’.If you’re referring to the use of (mostly) bolt-action rifles, a manually-operated bolt is able to load the round into the breech with greater precision than a gas-operated, semi-automatic or automatic weapon.

Why fire three or more shots at a target when the first one has hit centre of mass at 750m or more?If you mean, why haven’t robots taken over the role of snipers? This one has a less black-and-white answer.Snipers - at least, in the British Army - are a part of what’s called a RISTA group (Reconnaissance, Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition). Their primary role isn’t to provide counter-sniper fire, eliminate particular personnel or destroy materiel and or morale (although, we do this rather well too). Their main role is exactly what is entailed in the RISTA acronym. Bear in mind, as soon as you fire one shot at the enemy, they then know to be on higher alert as snipers are nearby.Why hasn’t the sniper role been overtaken by robots? Given the widespread use of drones in modern warfare, they have… kinda.

Or how the Soviet Red Army eliminated 80% of Hitler’s army. but the Americans somehow won the WWII. Or how nobody knows more about everything than President Trump. US/UK domestic propaganda going out to all the ENGLISH-SPEAKING COUNTRIES, but not taken serious by anybody else.The historic reason for the US to establish relationship with China was that President Nixon wanted to get re-elected, and he couldn’t with the Vietnam War dragging on. Here is President Nixon’s announcement to his China Visit in 1971:Good evening:I have requested this television time tonight to announce a major development in our efforts to build a lasting peace in the world.As I have pointed out on a number of occasions over the past 3 years, there can be no stable and enduring peace without the participation of the People’s Republic of China and its 750 million people. That is why I have undertaken initiatives in several areas to open the door for more normal relations between our two countries.In pursuance of that goal, I sent Dr. Kissinger, my Assistant for National Security Affairs, to Peking during his recent world tour for the purpose of having talks with Premier Chou En-lai.The announcement I shall now read is being issued simultaneously in Peking and in the United States:Premier Chou En-lai and Dr. Henry Kissinger, President Nixon’s Assistant for National Security Affairs, held talks in Peking from July 9 to 11, 1971. Knowing of President Nixon’s expressed desire to visit the People’s Republic of China, Premier Chou En-lai, on behalf of the Government of the People’s Republic of China, has extended an invitation to President Nixon to visit China at an appropriate date before May 1972. President Nixon has accepted the invitation with pleasure.…Our action in seeking a new relationship with the People’s Republic of China will not be at the expense of our old friends. It is not directed against any other nation. We seek friendly relations with all nations. Any nation can be our friend without being any other nation’s enemy.I have taken this action because of my profound conviction that all nations will gain from a reduction of tensions and a better relationship between the United States and the People’s Republic of China.It is in this spirit that I will undertake what I deeply hope will become a journey for peace, peace not just for our generation but for future generations on this earth we share together.…Basically the US was stuck in Vietnam with a war it couldn’t win as long as China kept on supporting North Vietnam. The US had already went to war with China in 1953 in the Korean War and left with a bloodied nose, so President Johnson told the US Army “don’t even bomb a toilet on the other side of the border ’cause we don’t want to get into another Korean War again”. China’s demand was 1, recognize “one-China”, 2, get your spooks and provocateurs out of Tibet, and 3, peace negotiation between the North and the South Vietnam. The US demand was 1, China to stop giving material support to North Vietnam and make it go to the Paris Peace Conference, and 2, China to stop supporting all the communist insurgencies outside. Nixon could not get re-elected unless he could pull the US troops out of this unpopular war, and it wasn’t just his one war but there were anti-colonial wars throughout Asia, Africa, and the Middle-East. Even Paris was waving Chairman Mao’s Little Red Book, the US was SO UNPOPULAR! So Nixon did what he had to do, i.e., negotiate for a peace deal instead of the endless war.The onus wasn’t on China to “become more democratic and open”.But what it shows, is thatAlso do you know that when George Orwell wrote about “Ministry of Truth” inPS: The big picture is that during the 1950 - 1970, anti-colonialism was the MAIN STREAM except in the US and among the old imperialists in Old Europe. There was absolute internal logic to de-colonize. Congo, in the 60’s, produced 9 college graduates - 6 as priests, 3 secular degrees. After having the worst national leaders and 2 massive wars, Congo still managed to produce millions of college graduates and doubled their life expectancy. China before the CCP took over had an average life expectancy of 36 years in 1950. Now it’s 76.8 years (2019 data), producing the most STEM graduates in the world, and vastly more wealthy. The idea that somehow the local people lived better under the gentle aristocratic white rulers is revolting.During the Cold War, “democracy” was the code word from the Soviet Union. “Freedom” was the code word from the United States. Vis-a-vis the colonies, the Soviet Union was saying the majority gets to screw the minority colonial rulers, and the US was saying the minority elites have the freedom to screw the unwashed majority. This was the background in the 70’s, so if the US said, China, you should be more democratic, Mao would have replied, do you mean we the proletariat majority should screw the capitalists minority in our country harder?Mr. Trump is the symptom not the disease. There are an appalling number of media and public personalities in English-speaking countries really just like that - they not only don’t read, they don’t feel the need to read, because they already know everything.","3,719 followers",Thomas Pauken II,2K,1K,17.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-snipers-still-aim-and-fire-manually

The Bretton Woods system was the first example of a fully negotiated monetary order intended to govern monetary relations among independent states. The chief features of the Bretton Woods system were an obligation for each country to adopt a monetary policy that maintained its external exchange rates within 1 percent by tying its currency to gold and the ability of the IMF to bridge temporary imbalances of payments. Also, there was a need to address the lack of cooperation among other countries and to prevent competitive devaluation of the currencies as well.”But during the Nixon period (““Because of the massive printing of the US dollar to cover war and welfare reform costs Nixon worried about the strength of his country’s currency.Then came the opportunity, but otherwise for OPEC nations, it was a crisis (“Nixon saw and grasped the opportunity, “Then, the US dollar was tighted up to oil and hence emerged as theColluding with the uncertainty caused by the shifting, a rapid inflation, a deficit mainly resulted from the Vietnam War, etc., caused“What was adding salt to the injury was, the anti-war sentiment swept across the nation,“Then why China?After formal bilateral ties were forged on Jan. 1, 1979, waves of US enterprises and investments began their exploration into China, some succeeded and made their fortunes here; but business is business, no one can guarantee all could successful stories, so there must also be some failed ones.Of course, China also got what it hoped to get, and together with the opening-up to the outside world and its internal reforms since 1978, with the hard work of its people, China made strides in its progress in various fields and rose to the second largest economy now.But, China built itself and is still building it, instead of “being built” by any other country as claimed by some US politicians.When US enterprises and capital came to China, they were not here for charity, but for business, for profits, the higher the better.

The economic opportunity is incentive for China to provide that pressure.It paid off quite well back then, because the Chinese and USSR were stationed million+ soldier on their borders throughout late 1970s and early 1980s.China also spent a decade bleeding Vietnam dry and propping up Thailand, which stopped USSR influence expansion in Southeast Asia.China, along with UK, France and US, also supported Afghanistan during USSR invasion. In fact, much of the military equipment used by Afghanistans against USSR comes from China. (US, UK and France would foot the bill, the Chinese make the equipment and Pakistan delivers them to Afghanistans.)You could say China joining in the containment of USSR is one of the major reasons why USSR economy is in that kind of a state in 1980s.After USSR collapsed in 1990s, US did want to switch to containment of China. There are sanctions after Tiananmen event that still exists even today. There is also the Taiwan strait crisis and later bombing of Chinese embassy in Belgrade, etc.The problem is that unlike USSR, the Chinese has no strategic conflict with the Europeans. The abundance of sea ports along east China coast (comparing to USSR, which has very limited port access that doesn’t freeze during the winter months) means the Chinese had way more trade relationships with other nations. In fact, China’s trade relationship with the Africans started in the 1950s, way earlier than USSR due to China’s advantage in sea ports.This means unlike USSR, majority of the nations isn’t willing to contain China for US’ sake. So alliances similar to cold war camps never materialized.This is all in the history books and quite easy to see.","17,165 followers",Pascal Morimacil,4K,4.3K,34.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-snipers-still-aim-and-fire-manually

In fact, at the time, it was apparent that it was a failure of leadership and at best a deliberate misuse of intelligence.However this post-rationalisation allowed the blame for the resulting fiasco to be shifted to unaccountable persons; and because this is a simple and convenient explanation, this also became the mantra to be enshrined in popular history.In this case the actual “regret” is that China is succeeding beyond our intention, but this is framed in terms of a failure to meet some unstated but noble expectation. This was never part of any deal with China. If it was there wouldn’t have been a deal. At best it was somebodies ideological wet dream at the time. Was it a widely experienced wet dream… I would not know; at that time I was paying too much attention to reality.So to be very nicely wrapped up in our later delusion, our “Biased Regret”, China is not really succeeding, China is actually failing, and our regret is in response to a previous passive acquiescence to events that lead to our ultimate disappointment.If only China had become more democratic and open - we would have welcomed her rise(⸮).",0 followers,Luke Cillessen,3.2K,62,3.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-snipers-still-aim-and-fire-manually
