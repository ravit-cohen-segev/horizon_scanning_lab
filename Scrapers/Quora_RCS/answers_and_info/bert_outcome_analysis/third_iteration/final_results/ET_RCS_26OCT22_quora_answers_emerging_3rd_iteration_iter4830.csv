This allows students who are unable to travel far from home for classes or students who don't have access to computers at home due to financial constraints.Finally, technology can be used as an accountability tool so that teachers have additional tools available when grading assignments or conducting quizzes on classwork. This lets teachers keep track of student progress more easily and ensure that students are performing up to par with their peers across all areas of study within an institution's curriculum.","2,186 followers",Mona Jalal,520,187,598.8K,2021,https://www.quora.com/Would-it-be-possible-to-have-a-tracker-inside-guns-that-sees-if-it-gets-close-to-gun-free-zones-like-schools-and-that-would-lock-the-guns-trigger-to-prevent-mass-shootings

These sites offer free content from experts in their field—from maths problems to biology lectures—that provide students with an opportunity to learn at their own pace and on their own schedule.Another example is the use of video games such as Minecraft and League of Legends, which are often used by children as part of their after-school activity plans in school districts across the country.In addition, technology can be used to provide more opportunities for physical activity by allowing students access to virtual reality environments where they can interact in ways that are similar or even identical to real-life situations without having to leave home or disrupt the rest of their lives with travel time and other costs associated with those activities.Moreover, technology allows educators to provide students with instruction without requiring them to attend classes or face-to-face meetings. This allows teachers to focus on other aspects of their job such as preparing lessons and grading exams. It also reduces distractions for students who may otherwise need assistance from an adult during these times due to their age or disability.Technology can also increase student engagement through online participation rather than just passively listening at a lecture. Students will be able to ask questions about what they are learning which will help them stay focused on the topic being discussed rather than wandering off into unrelated subjects which may result in lost knowledge later on down the road if not addressed sooner rather than later.","21,938 followers",Vidhi Khandel,20K,182,11.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Once-you-have-identified-your-prospective-customer-market-what-do-you-do-next

This helps parents understand more about what their child is learning in order to help them focus on areas where they might need extra support or guidance.Technology also makes it easier for students themselves to access online resources and websites that teach through video clips instead of text-based lessons. This allows students who struggle with reading comprehension skills or dyslexia (a condition that impairs one's ability to read) have an easier way of understanding what they're expected to do in class or how they should approach problems.The technology revolution has transformed the way we learn.

China thinks, China imagines if he was to play it, how would he deal with all these challenges.One day when China has barely that kind money to buy the computer to play the game, China amazes everyone — fewer mistakes, dodges monsters, mad skills. So good that someone even claims that China cheats.Sooner or later China is going to reach the level, like anyone else, where no one has ever been before.There will be no one there to show China how this game is played.How will China deal with it then? No one knows. No one can know.But, what we know for sure is, whatever China does next, is anything but boring.What happens in the next few decades is going to be interesting either way. Whether China fails, because the transformation to a great world power based on new technology didn’t quite clutch with the failing old industrial paradigm; or China succeed in transforming by something industrial-revolution-worthy new technology, something hard for others to imitate, and complete refresh the way people think, live, fight wars, trade, produce.Now, I notices folk in this question mentioned Japan’s anticipation to overtake the USA in the 1980s, and of course that attempt was shattered by the 1989 Plaza Accord. (Although everyone kind of knows it’s massing a huge bubble, the Plaza Accord just kind of popped the bubble prematurely)I just want to add here how Japan’s success story inspired China in the 1980s and 1990s.We are kind of Communist Country (we are not, but…) and we study the Communism Doctrine. And that means we analyze things through the lens of Marxism’s basic pattern of human society evolution. Long story short, before Japan made its success, we were… kind of pessimistic.Why? Because Marx said that to develop a Capitalism, a country must have a primitive accumulation of wealth. The west did it by pillaging and taking over resources from the colonies. Obviously we couldn’t do that any more, the moment had passed. That is why in Mao’s era we were “skipping Capitalism and straight into Communism”. Not because Capitalism was evil or anything (mostly), but because we thought it was not possible to develop capitalism the way the west had (1. we were a victim of such brutal process, we would not do it to some other countries again; 2. even if we get past this moral constraint, the free world would be all over our asses for doing it, because they are hypocrites. They might even resort to military confrontations)Yes, that was kind of a failure, and it was met with a less than delightful ending — the infamous Cultural Revolution.After it had died down together with the dearest supreme leader Mao Zedong. We were confused — where to go?Then Japan came along.What is Japan’s story exactly?After the WWII, Japan was a war marred country in smoking ruins. Americans occupied it, all its glory and dignity gone. No resources, typhoon and earthquake ridden lands…Somehow, it managed to survive. And not just survive, it thrived!Ha, how about that Karl Marx and Adam Smith!Japan grew, and grew. It defied everything taught in the Marxist doctrine.It took the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party some time to study before they get to the slogan that brought us this far today.“Technology is the first tier drive for productivity.” — 1988.You think all Deng Xiaoping did was having some table tennis with Nixon, opened up some ports in Southern China? The leadership back then did a whole lot of things that are not well known in the west.Screw ideology! Screw system! Screw “everyone should be equal”!Really? It surprises you? China suddenly has all that new gizmo and gadgets? Do you think all of that happens overnight?We worked hard for 40 years for today.40 fucking years.And you just noticed it now?It will be interesting to see where China is headed.I witnessed all of that by myself, and I shall continue to witness a little more.","4,660 followers",Muhammed Borhanuddin,1K,147,16.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-can-technology-be-used-to-create-better-learning-opportunities-for-all-students

What about language, surely our distinct language will always be there!Sure, Mandarin is at no danger of fading away. But in the near future, most Chinese that foreigners will come into contact with will be fluent or semi-fluent in English.Rather than waiting for the foreigner to finish the sentence in Mandarin (often in a thick, near unintelligible accent), most of us would rather just converse in English.4. What about the all important - Food?!Well, most cities in the world are already well served by ‘Chinese’ restaurants. The food served in these restaurants is not what is typically consumed by Chinese in China. But then again, most Italian restaurants outside of Italy don’t serve food Italians would consider Italian food.5. What about all those important festivals and occasions!​This is a photo of me popping a bottle of bubbly at my wedding. Everyone in this picture is Chinese.​This is for period films.The urban Chinese middle class is increasing Westernize in their taste. The St Valentine’s Day haunts the Chinese men the same way it does to men in the West. Whilst there is interest in reviving the old ways (as the Great Helmsman Xi commanded), the trend is increasing Westernization.So, are Chinese taking over the world? Well even if we do, things will be very similar to the way they are. You may see more ZTE phones, Haier dryers or Great Wall SUVs. You may even see a Chinese restaurant franchise in your local strip mall. But are we going to rock your world? Don’t count on it.
