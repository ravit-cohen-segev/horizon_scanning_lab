What makes Algorand ( ALGO -0.77% ) so enticing is the role it could play for businesses in the blockchain arena.As I've previously pointed out, Algorand offers no shortage of clear-cut competitive advantages when it comes to speed and scalability. As of December 2021, the network was handling 1,162 transactions per second (TPS) and offered a block finality of 4.36 seconds. The latter means that the sending of files, data, or money reached its destination and was validated/settled in under five secThere are a lot ways digital currencies and blockchain technology-based projects can be winners.

Despite being a relatively under-the-radar project, IOTA brings both of these qualities to the table.Moreover, there’s a crypto which I think it will be a great hit in this year, let’s check out Lumi coin.

[ https://www.quora.com/What-will-the-big-3-cryptocurrencies-be-in-2020/answers/185645607 ]The year 2020 is already shaping up to be a pivotal year in the history of Bitcoin, culminating in the third Halving in its history, scheduled for May. This event will be combined with economic and political events to create the perfect conditions for a very strong increase in the price of Bitcoin during the year.You probably know that, but I’ll remind you anyway: the cryptocurrency market is indexed to Bitcoin. Thus, if the price of Bitcoin increases sharply during 2020, the entire cryptocurrency market will increase. However, not all cryptocurrencies will see their prices increase in the same way.The challenge is to predict which cryptocurrencies are promised the most attractive price increases in 2020. In what follows, I try my luck by presenting you the 6 cryptocurrencies to buy for 2020 and beyond.I detail my choices in depth in the following article: “6 Cryptocurrencies To Buy For 2020 And Beyond” [1]1.

This is because there are well over 1,000 cryptocurrencies in existence, with new ones being created frequently. Here's what you need to know about the current size of the cryptocurrency markets, the major players, and why there's a need for multiple cryptocurrencies.The short answerThere are 1,658 cryptocurrencies, according to Investing.com - Stock Market Quotes & Financial News's current list as of Thursday afternoon. This is up from 1,638 on Monday and less than 1,600 just a couple of weeks ago. And it's up fromIMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.A very top-heavy marketI wouldn't call all 1,658 cryptocurrencies significant, or even legitimate. The method through which cryptocurrencies can be created (known as ""open source""), makes it surprisingly easy for anyone to create their own cryptocurrency -- and in many cases, everyday people have done just that.The total cryptocurrency market capitalization is just under $369 billion as of this writing, which implies that the average cryptocurrency is worth about $222 million. However, this statistic is extremely misleading. In fact, the top 20 cryptocurrencies account for 89% of the total market -- the other 1,638 cryptocurrencies are worth a combined $39.6 billion.A more representative statistic is that the median cryptocurrency's market cap is just $925,000, meaning that half are worth more and half are worth less.The largest cryptocurrencies by market capFor this reason, it's important to realize that there aren't 1,658 relevant cryptocurrencies. Only a select few are worth paying serious attention to. With that in mind, here's a look at the 20 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.

Over the past year, the price of bitcoin has surged by 202%, as bitcoin proved to be a direct beneficiary of slowing supply growth and accelerating demand growth across the cryptocurrency world.Note:On the supply side, the third halving directly effected the amount of new bitcoins coming into market, and led to relatively slow supply growth.Meanwhile, on the demand side, cryptocurrency interest will soared this year after the halving drew media coverage and public attention. Bitcoin demand simply is the “gateway” into cryptocurrencies for new investors.

Thank me Later.PS: This is not in any case of me trying to lure you into anything for my own personal financial gain, i am just innocently sharing so that you could gain one or two things as this has been working for me. You can also make a research on what works for you too1. BTCOne of the best digital currencies, Bitcoin, is the first of its sort to have the most noteworthy esteem. The crypto money targets turning into a completely decentralized and distributed computerized cash without any guidelines. Notwithstanding the unpredictable market conditions, Bitcoin is the steadiest one.Though the name is inseparable from crypto money, Bitcoin’s notoriety and demand are likely to develop much in the coming years. The eventual fate of that is now getting molded with businesses opening to taking Bitcoins for payments.2. EthereumEthereum was the principal crypto money to start smart agreements. They permit developers to make decentralized apps for mobile and desktop platforms. These got powered by blockchain technology.Ethereum has kept up its standing in the top crypto forms of money ever since its launch. It also has a dedicated group of financial backers who vouch for this digital currency. What it implies is that Ethereum has a superior possibility of staying steady.3. LTCLitecoin is a prominent name in this rundown due to its market capital and liquidity status. In contrast to Bitcoin’s 21 million stock, Litecoin remains restricted to 84 million coins with a block prize of 12.5 LTC. It is higher than most other cryptos. For diggers, mining a Litecoin will be quicker than some other digital currency. The regular time for a Litecoin is only two minutes. The developing ubiquity of Litecoins makes them one of the best altcoins.4. CardanoIt is a reasonable digital currency that is turning into a popular option at a fast speed. Since its origin in 2015, it has become a solid part of the market with its Ouroboros blockchain. It means there can be two blockchains rather than one.Here, one blockchain will oversee general customary transactions while the other will oversee contracts. The rationale behind this is the capability of Cardano to stay versatile and quick as two kinds of exchanges won’t back it off. Another intriguing reality about Cardano is that many Japanese people have put resources into this digital money.Cardano is popularly known as Japanese Ethereum as it uses the Proof of Stake calculation. Ethereum has been wanting to do this for quite a while now. A few months back, Cardano nearly hit the USD 30 billion market cap.5. BinanceIf you have either Ethereums or Bitcoins and need to expand your portfolio, you can choose the Binance Coin. Binance, the parent organization, has a solid business history that has made a valuable utility token. The worth of Binance Coin comes from its value and its interest, which is for merchants to utilize Binance Coins to purchase other digital currencies on the exchange.It is good to understand that Binance Exchange is one of the world’s quickest developing digital money exchanges. With each exchange done there through Binance Coins, it is just getting more popular.",0 followers,Jessica Fowler,555,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-will-the-big-3-cryptocurrencies-be-in-2020

The company Block.one created Home – EOSIO Blockchain Software & Services in September 2017 and it now has over 100 decentralized applications or dApps with thousands of daily active users. It enables dApps to be created by software developers. The platform is more scalable than many other blockchain networks, with the ability to process one million transactions per second without any fees.9. Ripple (XRP)XRP is known as a Real Time Gross Settlement System which is a ‘currency exchange and remittance network’ that independent servers validate. The currency traded is known as XRP and transfer times are immediate. XRP can be exchanged for most other currencies with its unique selling proposition being the avoidance of fees and wait times often associated with banks. It isn’t made up of a blockchain but rather a Hash Tree and its currency can’t be mined because there are a finite number of coins – 100 billion. Unlike most of the cryptocurrencies aiming to escape banking institutions, XRP is popular with banks and aims to partner with them.8. Uniswap (UNI)Uniswap ($UNI) is the governance token for Uniswap protocol, used to exchange ERC-20 tokens in an automated liquidity provision manner on Ethereum. Uniswap-v1 is an on-chain system of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It implements an automated liquidity protocol based on a “constant product formula”. Traders pay a 30-basis-point fee on trades, which goes to liquidity providers. Uniswap-v2 is a new implementation based on the same formula, with several new highly desirable features.7. Stellar (XLM)Lumen (XLM) is the native cryptocurrency for Stellar, an open source blockchain payment system. The purpose of Stellar is to connect financial institutions via the blockchain and provide cheap transactions in developing markets. Stellar uses an agreement algorithm instead of a traditional mining network to validate transactions. Since the transfer of lumens doesn’t require approval from traditional cryptocurrency miners, the Stellar network enables quicker transactions than some other blockchain-based systems.6. Litecoin (LTC)Litecoin is a cryptocurrency launched in late 2011 by former Google and Coinbase engineer Charlie Lee. To create Litecoin, Lee copied the Bitcoin codebase, increased the total supply, and changed the speed at which new blocks are added to the blockchain. Only approximately 84 million litecoins will ever be created, quadruple the total bitcoin supply. Litecoin also creates new blocks every 2.5 minutes, four times faster than Bitcoin.5. Cardano (ADA)Cardano has been pioneered by a team of academics and engineers, and is offering a unique approach to scaling and securing a blockchain network. Cardano is a non-profit platform with three separate bodies responsible for maintaining and developing the platform. The cryptocurrency which operated in the Cardano network is called ADA and is, like others, can be used for direct value transfer.4. Polkadot (DOT)Polkadot is a flagship project by Web3 Foundation and is built to connect private and consortium chains, public and permissionless networks, oracles, and future technologies that are yet to be created. Polkadot facilitates an internet where independent blockchains can exchange information and transactions in a trustless way via the Polkadot relay chain. Polkadot aims to make it easier to create and connect decentralized applications, services, and institution.3. Chainlink (LINK)Chainlink is a tokenized oracle network that provides price and events data collected from on-chain and real-world sources. Launched in 2017 by Sergey Nazarov, Chainlink aims to offer a solution to the “oracle problem” or the ability to get the off-chain data needed to operate many blockchain-based smart contracts. The token incentivizes participants to provide and use this data. Chainlink does not operate its own blockchain. Instead, the token protocol is blockchain agnostic and can run on many different blockchains simultaneously.2. Ethereum (ETH)Ether is the cryptocurrency built on top of the open source Ethereum blockchain, which runs smart contracts. The cryptocurrency acts as a fuel that allows smart contracts to run unlike bitcoin, which is meant to be a unit of currency on a peer-to-peer payment network. Ether’s supply is not capped like that of bitcoin and its supply schedule, often described as minimum necessary to secure the network, is determined by members of Ethereum’s community. A majority of decentralized applications are based on Ethereum and the cryptocurrency accounts for the highest percentage of the total funds staked in the DeFi projects.1. Bitcoin (BTC)Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to successfully record transactions on a secure, decentralized blockchain-based network. Launched in early 2009 by its pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency measured by market capitalization and amount of data stored on its blockchain. The Bitcoin software is free and available online to anyone who wants to run a Bitcoin node and store their own copy of the Bitcoin blockchain. Only approximately 21 million Bitcoins will ever be created. New coins are minted every 10 minutes by bitcoin miners who help to maintain the network by adding new transaction data to the blockchain.","1,772 followers",Thomas Y Graham,945,55,4.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-will-the-big-3-cryptocurrencies-be-in-2020

They both have a similar approach to cryptocurrency and similar goals, and if Ripple hodlers get too worried, they may switch sides.And if you’re planning to invest, it could be sensible to start soon. Although the price of Ripple isn’t going to reach the stratospheric prices of Bitcoin, it does look set for a price increase in 2021.According to some cryptocurrency predictions, Ripple is likely to increase steadily throughout the year, reaching potential highs of $2.94 by December.Prices above $2 might not last long though. The same predictions have placed Ripple’s price at $1.72 by the end of 2022, so one investment strategy could be to buy Ripple to sell it before the price slips from its all-time high.Note: 2021 might be a good year to invest in XRP, as its price has dropped 72% lower than its all-time high of $3.40 in January 2017. So, Ripple could still be a good option to consider as your next cryptocurrency to invest in 2021.","1,717 followers",Wilfred Edmund,927,65,881.3K,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-will-the-big-3-cryptocurrencies-be-in-2020

Even if you don’t know much about crypto coins, it is definitely worth your investment in 2020. If Twitter, Uber, and Amazon ever move to a blockchain, the core of their work will definitely be EOS. The EOS system is free of Ethereum problems with scalability and it is ready to replace other competitive blockchains. If Ethereum fails, EOS can level up to 100 USD per token. EOS achievements become possible thanks to the consensus algorithm of delegated proof of ownership (DPoS) and an infinite number of similar blockchains.RippleSome experts call XRP the “king of banking infrastructure”. The successful partnership with major financial market players made the Ripple ecosystem a breakthrough in the crypto industry. Take the latest integration with Western Union and the potential replacement of SWIFT to accelerate and reduce the cost of large money transfers between counterparties. However, do not expect huge profits with XRP in 2020, it is good for long-term investment.

The Celsius crash follows the $60 billion meltdown of stablecoin TerraUSD last month. The events of May have raised legislators’ concerns over the need to regulate the crypto industry, particularly stablecoins.When buying the dip, crypto investors should proceed with extreme caution. While buying the dip may be a good opportunity to key into the crypto market, it’s absolutely profitable investing inSelling Pressure in 2022Many cryptocurrency investors have argued that Bitcoin is a new version of gold for the digital era, a potential flight-to-safety investment and hedge against inflation. But price action in cryptocurrencies suggests the market doesn’t seem to see these highly volatile assets as reliable stores of value during periods of economic uncertainty.The overwhelming focus continues to be on inflation, rising interest rates and the war in Ukraine. The market is void of major positive catalysts right now, so it is not surprising that we’re starting the week off under pressure.Investors are seeking shelter from the potential negative economic impact of the Fed’s tightening, and they just aren’t seeking it in the cryptocurrency market.Final NoteEarly investors in Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies have made a killing. But the cryptocurrency market has a long history of extreme volatility, which is not what investors are looking for in uncertain market conditions.Although Bitcoin has had several deep pullbacks of more than 80% throughout its history, most recently in 2018, I advocate that investors should do the opposite of what everyone is doing right now.

However, this is just one example of how quickly things can change in the crypto market; as shown in the chart below, Bitcoin has seen extreme bouts of volatility over time, and in some cases took years to recover these losses. Furthermore, correlations between cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and traditional assets like stocks and bonds are incredibly unstable, making it difficult to predict whether they will “zig” or “zag” during periods of stock or bond market stress.","99,922 followers",Alcatraz Dey,9K,1.4K,68.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-will-the-big-3-cryptocurrencies-be-in-2020

As a result, the blockchain space is booming with new opportunities like being able to invest on Platform like1. Bitcoin (BTC)Bitcoin is valued around $58,900 right now which makes it by far the most valuable cryptocurrency to buy into. In fact, Bitcoin has no competition, by a long stretch, with any of the other currencies in this list. This exponential value can be credited to Bitcoin’s pioneering track record and longevity. For its adoption rate, Bitcoin returns some very impressive stats. With 45% crypto market dominance, Bitcoin has no plans to slow down as it features on the long-term strategic plans of global corporate behemoths like Facebook, Tesla, Google, Samsung, Apple and PayPal. So, with prospects secured and value riding on a frenzied bullish run, Bitcoin is surely theFluctuation, albeit of a different kind, is also the inherent risk of investment in Bitcoin. The ticklish boost and bust in Bitcoin’s value can unnerve a prudish investor. But, as cryptocurrency is a long-term smart investment, the veering value of Bitcoin shouldn’t concern any intrepid investor. More importantly, investing in Bitcoin is no longer for light-pocketed investors. With value bordering $60,000 to a coin, it is out of reach for most people. Such investors, then, resort to partial buying which has demerits of its own.2. Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR)If there was ever a need to redefine the limits of ‘envy’, it should be modeled after Hedera Hashgraph. Based on ground-breaking asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT) consensus algorithm, Hashgraph has turned the world of cryptocurrency upside down through its elimination of mining in favor of directed acyclic graphs for validating transactions. Hedera’s white-paper, co-authored by Swirld’s Leemon Baird, expostulates the intrinsic inertia of first and second gen cryptocurrencies and offers enhanced speed, transparency at low cost and impervious security protocol. With backing from pioneers like IBM and Google, Hedera is all set to become a genuine leader in crypto and digital currency realm.Currently valued at $0.20, Hedera has more than meets the eye. With its superior technology that empowers lightning-fast transactions at superior security as compared to conventional blockchain, Hedera is undoubtedly a terrific long-term investment. Hedera may become the first crypto to break the regulatory impasse as it is rumored that it will co-develop a digital dollar with the Central Bank. Hedera’s USP is its environment-friendly transaction mechanism. Bitcoin and other crypto spin-offs, as per scholarly estimates, could raise Earth’s temperature by 2˚C due to their parlous mining methods while Hedera’s low-bandwidth consumption make it more friendly to the environment. Apart from these stellar characteristics, Hedera seems to enjoy the trust of major financial players both in the private and public sector.When seen as an investment, Hedera’s sound vision and well-thought out plan is a guarantee of its success and ability to return respectable profits.3. Ethereum (ETH)If the question is what other cryptocurrency can give Bitcoin a run for its money, the answer would be Ethereum. Launched in 2014, Ethereum has become the most influential cryptocurrency within a jiffy. Ethereum’s insane popularity owes itself to the platform’s allowance for all to build upon its blockchain and a wider selection of applications that its blockchain can support. Apart from payments via Ether, its token, Ethereum also sanctions smart contracts and advanced identity management.Ethereum fueled the DeFi (decentralized finance) revolution which birthed the now burgeoning peer-to-peer finance via decentralized technologies. The innovative spirit of Ethereum, hence, is its strongest suit for investors. Only behind Bitcoin in market share, Ethereum is currently valued at $2125 to an Ether, which is on a bullish rally this year and expected to swell significantly. The rapid adoption of DeFi in coming years is bound to augment the acceptability of Ethereum. All of these factors make Ethereum an exciting investment, one which would be envy of any respectable cryptocurrency.","1,717 followers",Wilfred Edmund,927,65,881.3K,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-will-the-big-3-cryptocurrencies-be-in-2020
