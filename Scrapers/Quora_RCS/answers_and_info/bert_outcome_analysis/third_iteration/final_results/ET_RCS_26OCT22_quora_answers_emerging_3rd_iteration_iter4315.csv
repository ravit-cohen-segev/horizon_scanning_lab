I worked on some of these on my own and then turned it over to the government. Some of the stuff I worked on - in prototype, R&D, T&E and deployment and deployment (1990–2005) are only now released and getting any attention outside of the lab. Here are a few you have may not have heard of:All of these are known outside of military circles. Some are being developed for commercial applications. Others require significant investments to develop commercially. Some have limited applications outside of intelligence or military uses. Still, others await someone to discover them or exploit them.This is just a list of what I had some knowledge of or worked on. There are thousands of such technologies like these.There is an extensive federal program to promote the transfer of government R&D into the hands of commercial developers.

3,"No. No. No. No. No. Still no.Fifty years after Apollo, we still haven’t resolved many of the scientific and engineering challenges of sending a crew to Mars and bringing them back, safely to Earth.Any crewed mission to Mars will have to solve problems such as protecting the crew from radiation, decelerating a crewed vehicle and landing it safely on Mars, extracting water from Mars or shipping massive amounts of water to Mars, feeding the crew nutritious foods for the duration, keeping their bones strong, precision landing of multiple modules and cargo vessels on the surface or construction ofNo. No. No. No. No. Still no.Fifty years after Apollo, we still haven’t resolved many of the scientific and engineering challenges of sending a crew to Mars and bringing them back, safely to Earth.Any crewed mission to Mars will have to solve problems such as protecting the crew from radiation, decelerating a crewed vehicle and landing it safely on Mars, extracting water from Mars or shipping massive amounts of water to Mars, feeding the crew nutritious foods for the duration, keeping their bones strong, precision landing of multiple modules and cargo vessels on the surface or construction of such modules and vessels that can traverse the surface, designing a return vehicle capable of the thrust needed to leave Mars, construction of surface habitats, and many more, some still unknown. Engineers can solve those problems with tomorrow’s technology, but not with the technology of today and certainly not with the technology of half a century ago, no matter how many bodies were thrown at it.It took SpaceX 18 years to lift a human off the ground and into low Earth orbit, and that was with all of the data from everyone who had done it before and computers far, far more advanced than anything available in 1970. SpaceX’s greatest accomplishment, the ability to return its first stages to the ground, safely, is only possible because it was attempted in the 21st century. Such a task was not possible 50 years ago - the computer processing speed simply wasn’t possible. Mars is 1000 times harder - it’s a 21st century task, not a 20th century task and will require not just bold revolutionary technologies by also many technologies that have incrementally advanced for a century, within and from outside the aerospace industry.",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,820,9.4K,195.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Although-France-was-the-first-country-to-recognise-the-advantages-of-mechanized-warfare-Germany-was-the-first-country-to-prioritise-this-revolutionary-concept-in-the-history-of-military-science-and-technology-in-the
4,"Yes, but it would have been fabulously expensive.By the time NERVA was cancelled in 1969, “nuclear thermal rocket” propulsion was advanced enough, it was ready to be adapted for integration into the Saturn Rocket.Such a system would have launched on conventional fuels, but with an atomic version of the S-IVb upper stage. For a single mission, multiple Saturn launches would be required to assemble all the parts needed to get a crew to Mars and back, and NERVA would let them get there in as little as four months, making space radiation a manageable concern.But the cost!

The Apollo program had for several years consumed 5% of the entire federal budget. While the irony is that it was cancelled after having paid for the development, just when costs were set to plummet, going to Mars would have put us right back in the developmental frying pan.And let’s be honest. For what? To plant a flag and put another boot print on the front page? It’s worth pointing out—from our historical perspective—that although Apollo contributed to widespread advancements in technology and precision manufacturing, those advances are only now fully integrated into industry, half a century later.Apollo was hand crafted using bleeding edge methods often created as bespoke solutions on the spot. For that reason, it was fabulously expensive, crazy dangerous, and profoundly limited in scope.Looking back, the United States and all of humanity should be justly proud of Apollo, for turning what might have been a Cold War stunt into an historic adventure of discovery. But…a Mars mission in the 1970s? At best, it would have created a little more cutting edge tech even further ahead of its time. At worst, it could have led to disaster.Arguably, NASA might have been better off in the closing days of Apollo, proposing a fifty year program to develop economically sustainable space exploration tech…but that would have brought us here.The ancient Egyptians, without cranes, CAD, or steel, built pyramids unrivalled for nearly two millennia, but they could not have built theApollo was the Cheops pyramid complex of the modern age, and left relics and memories that will far out last the older wonders. But like them, it was so wondrous in part because it was so very far ahead of its time, and we are only now catching up with its vision.Please visit",0 followers,Mark Adler,509,755,2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Can-government-secrecy-for-the-sake-of-National-Security-be-at-the-same-time-hindering-disclosure-of-revolutionary-knowledge-of-new-technologies-that-may-benefit-mankind
5,"No, for a couple of reasons.First, the Apollo missions already stretched the limits of technical know-how, and the almost-catastrophic disaster of Apollo 13 illustrated how inherently dangerous space exploration is. Not to mention the fatal disasters of Challenger and Columbia a few years later.No, we were not ready to reach Mars right after Apollo; still too many design, build, testing, and quality control shortcomings to work out.More importantly though are the biological/psychological challenges.

We KNOW the human body deteriorates in zero gravity after weeks or months in space. We also know what happens when males and females are confined in small spaces over long periods of time. Lastly, the Martian environment is completely hostile to the human body. The intense radiation alone dictates heavy shielding or underground habitation in order to survive, just for starters.A mission to Mars then or now would require enough food, water, oxygen, fuel, and other essentials for each traveler for the duration of the round trip, plus the time spent on the surface.Therefore, from a logistics perspective alone, the first “manned"" mission to Mars will require replicants (humanoid robots) rather than humans themselves. These advanced robots will have most of our dexterity and construction skills required to build and stock human-habitable spaces as advance staging and storage areas for any future humans on Mars.Could this be done by the United States?Sadly….",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,1.4K,9.4K,195.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Can-government-secrecy-for-the-sake-of-National-Security-be-at-the-same-time-hindering-disclosure-of-revolutionary-knowledge-of-new-technologies-that-may-benefit-mankind
6,"Broken Promises.Rover Frosts answer is basically correct but I believe if we would have kept the budget going we would be there by now. Here’s why I think that we probably would have arrived between 2000 and 2010. First, the complex to build Saturn 5s were still in existence in 1969.(Titusville was still a booming community). We were working on a nuclear engine which was coming along nicely. By 1976 we had already landed Vikings 1 and 2 and were orbiting as well and examining the Mars climate. Success after success but then a dismantled agency as it pertained to a manned mission anywhere excepBroken Promises.Rover Frosts answer is basically correct but I believe if we would have kept the budget going we would be there by now.

7,"Yes. The Apollo technology was close to being able to send a crew to Mars under a ‘price is no object’ basis as described. The key would have been the Saturn booster, particularly the S-IV upper stages. Not all of the available technology applicable to a Mars mission was actually applied for lunar missions. Water sanitation was not done for Apollo and that makes a huge difference in life support system mass. An Apollo-era Mars mission would have been very heavy, operationally complex and sticker shock expensive. Very ljkely involving multiple/simultaneous launches and several on-orbit rendezvoYes.

Total payload mass would have been in the million pound level - most being propellant - and the one technology that was barely matured, but not tried operationally, was heat shield technology for atmospheric entry at Mars. Using an Apollo heat shield for something as large as a manned Mars lander would have been prohibitively heavy.

Many interesting anomalies, like “cold fusion” and the EM drive are neglected while red herringslike “Dark Matter” are pursued with expensive and almost desperate resolve.I always like to quote an important historical fact. The Transistor was first made in about 1919. The FET was patented in 1933.However the devices were unreliable and almost impossible to repeat given impure materials and normal oxidation etc. Also there was almost no theoretical basis for them. I have personally spoken to 2 “Cold Fusion” experimenters yearsago and BOTH of them got anomalous results from just a few of the many cells they set up. The problem always was to determine why that cell and not others?Just like the crystal detector with 2 “cats whiskers” and a battery in 1924 which caused a tuned circuit to oscillate for an hour or two!It is the inter-disciplinary zone and the anomaly zones where real research should be concentrated!!!!!",41 followers,Chris Thomas,2.4K,590,1.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Although-France-was-the-first-country-to-recognise-the-advantages-of-mechanized-warfare-Germany-was-the-first-country-to-prioritise-this-revolutionary-concept-in-the-history-of-military-science-and-technology-in-the
