If each one of them had a spore drive, it wouldn't be a question of if one of them might suffer a system failure that would inflict damage on the mycelial network, but when. And it's by no means guaranteed that they could spot the damage in time to arrest it and let the network recover naturally before the next potential universe-ending disaster came along.That gives the spore drive the dubious distinction of being an idea even worse than filling the roads with cars powered by on board fission reactors. Yeah, we could do it, and there would be a lot of advantages we'd enjoy when they worked. But when they inevitably stopped working, the literal and figurative fallout would completely nullify those gains.I will also point out that this wouldn't be the first time the Federation has walked away from a promising technology because developing it further was simply too dangerous to consider. The Omega Particle's use as an energy source arguably makes it an even more valuable discovery than the spore drive. And they expunged the research and made destroying the things whenever or wherever they turned up into a mission whose importance even supercedes the prime directive. If they'll go to those lengths to protect subspace from the Omega Particle, how far do you think they'd go to protect the mycelial network?",232 followers,Neil Sharpson,890,926,2.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-technologies-that-will-survive-the-next-10-years

Relax, with enough technobabble and fanservice I can retcon a rainy day.Okay, here’s what you do. Discovery’s already demonstrated that the mycelium drive is seriously risky tech, explaining why it’s restricted to a few vessels like the Discovery. Now we need to establish why the Federation not only restricted it but BURIED it, so that there’s not even any trace of it in Voyager’s database over a century later. Fortunately, we have precedent for just this sort of thing:The Omega Directive.The Omega Molecule is a particle that is so incredibly powerful that even a single one can devastate sub-space for light-years in either direction, destroying everything and rendering warp travel in that region impossible. In Voyager’s time, their very existence is top secret, and if a Starfleet vessel detects one the whole ship goes into lockdown to force the crew to deal with it. They are considered such a threat to the Federation’s way of life that even the Prime Directive is considered secondary to eliminating the threat they pose.So here’s how you fix this problem;Now you have an in-canon explanation as to why Starfleet shuttered the technology and destroyed any knowledge of it’s existence. You’ll have to finesse things a little (Voyager claims that Omega was first discovered by the Federation in the “late” 23rd century which would put it a bit after Discovery, but what’s a few decades between friends?)",10 followers,Leigh Hogan,725,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-technologies-that-will-survive-the-next-10-years

There were hardly any missiles or aircrafts that flew that high or fast.Q2.Ans. This is speculation at best as there are no real incidents or public information. However, India, France, Russia and a few other nations are capable of performing high speed interceptions. Modern missiles are able to fly higher and are hypersonic with scramjet propulsion and advanced tracking and predictive AI engines. In theory missiles like meteor reach mach 4.5 to 5 and have a no escape range of about 63 miles. If launched from 60,000 ft on a modern fighter within 40 mile range, there is a very high probability of hitting it.The S400 has a 40N6 missile with a range of 400 Kms with a peak altitude of over half a million ft (607,000ft) and accelerates to mach-14. Even the smaller 9M96 missile has an altitude of 98,000 ft and speeds of mach 8.Modern missiles are able to adjust speeds and attack a variety of targets from ballistic missiles to high altitude aircrafts and even low orbiting satellites. So, it is very much in the realm of reality that the SR-71 might have never had a chance in modern AIDZ backed with C4ISR networks.With that being said, India does have a few missiles capable of dealing with advanced high speed high altitude aircrafts. However, these are imported technologies as well and as such do not represent domestic technological capability.","1,078 followers",Don Hollway,7.1K,809,5.3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-technologies-that-will-survive-the-next-10-years

He’s correct that the Blackbird’s cruise speed was officially mach 3.2 and he’s laid out a fairly accurate context for such.Blackbird pilot Brian Shul described a surveillance mission over Tripoli, Libya, in April 1986. Photographic evidence was required for bomb damage assessment (BDA) following a U.S. bombing run in retaliation for the Qaddafi-sponsored terrorist attack on a Berlin disco. Satellites were not available to immediately task over Tripoli for BDA. This was a surveillance mission for which the SR-71 was designed, albeit a quarter century ago.The difference was that by 1986 missile capability had significantly improved. And Libya had them. As the the Blackbird crossed the “Line of Death” into Libyan territory, Shul’s co-pilot warned of ground-based missile launches, Russian SAMs they guessed, capable of Mach 5 flight. Those scary little f***ers were probably the only thing a Blackbird pilot feared.Remember: theStill, flying at mach 3.2 at 80,000 feet is a significant head-start.Shul relates that he and his co-pilot calculated they could *just* make their turn over Libya to accomplish their surveillance objectives, but only if they increased speed. Because the Blackbird surveillance missions are planned to the second with regard to speed, altitude, and fuel load, a speed excursion above mach 3.2 was a pilot safety decision completely outside of pre-flight planning.However, on this day the jet performed flawlessly and delivered the speed asked of it.Turbo Ram-jetAt speed, the J-58 engines operate more like a RAM jet than a turbo jet. It operates more efficiently the faster it flies. TheThe mighty J-58 powerhouse under a Blackbird’s left nacelle. Those six large pipes [three visible here, three on the other side of the engine] bled air stacking up at the fifth compressor stage and dumped it into the afterburner. This is the much-storiedJ-58 engine inlet and nacelle, showing the shock spike extended fully forward, the position for engine start, take-off, and cruise up to mach 1.5. At speeds above mach 1.5, the spike was incrementally pulled back into the nacelle 1.6″ per 0.1 mach increase until retracted a full 26 inches at mach 3.2. This was done to capture the “normal” shock wave in the engine nacelle inlet and slow the air for subsonic delivery into the engine compressor stages.The plane responded with smooth, confident power, delivering speed that was previously the subject of much theory and conjecture. Shul narrates that as more missile launches were detected with “the mach easing to 3.5”, he pushed the throttles full forward against the stops. Shul continued a 500 fpm climb (one-sixth of one degree pitch-up…do the math), while accelerating, to the turn-point. The engines ran “relatively cool”. They took the photos, made the turn, and only when the blue Mediterranean was safely outside their window, he backed off the throttle.To be sure, this was no hopped-up model of the SR-71. This was the standard Blackbird, maintained and flown in top form.So, I presume there will continue much discussion of just how fast the plane could fly. And if it was much faster than mach 3.5, it is a well kept secret, possibly for the national security reasons that Jaren mentioned. Shul’s narrative of flight at or above mach 3.5 is so far the most detailed evidence available of SR-71 top speeds.Here’s the full story, excerpted fromHow a Pilot Risked His Life To Spy On Libya[Edit] The entire fleet of these incredible airplanes was finally retired in 1998 (Airforce) and 1999 (NASA) You can see them on display around the U.S. and one in England. I saw one take-off twice, and fly-by on after-burners at the Osh-Kosh airshow in Wisconsin (itself an incredible, must-see, airshow).An SR-71 on take-off in afterburner?Astonishing and a little frightening.As to the fly-by. Yeah, that’s fun, especially with the afterburners lit. But the Blackbird handles like a pig, and it just made a couple subsonic passes; the SR-71 is limited to 450 knots IAS at all altitudes in normal ops, 500 knots design limit, so that was that.The Blackbird was all about straight-line speed and altitude. Even to this day, no human being is known to have flown faster in any jet airplane.

The Swedish airspace was violated, so two armed Saab JA-37 intercepted. The interceptors observed that the SR-71 was in trouble and the decision was made to escort it out of the Baltic Sea.Saab 37 ViggenThe event was classified for over 30 years.

And that's on top of all the crew, fuel, parts and mechanics just to operate the SR.This is true for operational missions and usually true just for training runs back home as well. The planes were stationed at Beale AFB in California, and there was an entire squadron of tankers stationed there just to support the SR. They also had a squadron of T-38’s there so the pilots could get their minimum monthly training hours (supersonic, cross-country) in each month without having to fly the more expensive SR.So that's TWO ADDITIONAL squadrons of aircraft that have to exist just to support SR-71 training operations back at home station, complete with all the parts, fuel, mechanics, housing, etc., etc. for those extra planes. And that's not even taking into account the specially formulated radioactive jet fuel it used.Contrast that with the U-2 which only need a crew of one, could be forward based, and could take off on a single load a fuel good enough to keep it in the air for 14 hours. For training missions back home just put less gas in it and let the pilot take it for a spin. A refueling plane does not need to be up just for the thing to take off.There really was no technology gap between the SR and other planes like the U-2. The U-2 has been upgraded many, many times since the 1990s when the SR was retired. Cockpit, sensors, cameras and anti-missile systems have all been upgraded. But they would have been upgraded in the SR if it had been kept in service as well.Some people will pontificate that satellites, drones and an increased SAM threat are what cancelled the SR-71. Not true at all. Or even better, that the SR was grounded because of the MiG-25, which is silly.The Russian SAM threat is not an issue. Speaking as a U-2 electronics guy, we currently fly in warzones covered by all of Russia’s latest and greatest, including the S-200,-300 and -400 with the lowly U-2. The SR would have been upgraded with the same EWS suite the U-2 has. If the U-2 can survive in that environment, does anyone really think the SR upgraded with the same EWS suite the U-2 possesses had any reason to fear?Satellites and drones aren't the answer either. Drones didn't exist then the way they do now back in the 90’s and no one was expecting them to come along. We were still trying to get the RAH-66 Comanche off the ground for battlefield recon. Now the -66 really WAS cancelled because of drones, but the SR retired way before that.Credit where it’s due, the satellites are much better than what we had in the 60’s and 70’s. However, we still fly the U-2 around the clock, despite satellites and drones, because it can do stuff on call in a way drones and satellites just can’t. The SR would have been useful for the same reason.The MiG excuse is just as laughable. Contrary to popular belief, the SR-71 never directly overflew Soviet territory. Eisenhower ended that in 1960 when Powers U-2 got shot down over Chelyabinsk. The SR-71 come online several years later and never crossed Russian shores. The MiG would have had to come out into international waters to even shoot at the SR-71, which is how a cold war turns hot and is the kind of thing both sides wanted to keep a lid on.Like I said, it was mostly cost.",24 followers,Arlene Sanchez,1K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-booming-technology

I believe that every Start-ups in Silicon Valley with dreams and expectations, and I believe that they were born to serve our human beings to make a better life.In addition, if you have noticed what Facebook recently did since they separated iMessenger as an independent app. iMessenger has functions for developers to build their applications with simple codes. And the frequent contact Mr. Genius Zuckerberg did with China and what Facebook performs are clues that indicates FB learn something from China.Another example is mobile payment. Actually, since Alipay turns into people’s lives globally, it’s a signal that shows the development of mobile payment of China is leading the world. Taking a look at the development of Payment, the history of Paypal or etc., you will find that China is the first country where you can pay the bill simply taking your cell phone out and clicking few buttons and that’s all done. You don’t need to have cash or credit card around.Companies such as Square, Skrill, Neteller, Barclays Pingit, Zapp and etc., starts to go into this industries these 2 years and did very well. Also, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and all this eWallet did it in another way that changes people’s way of paying, although they are not technologically mobile payments. I’m not sure how mobile payment in western world will be, walking the way as Alipay or Wechat+Wepay walks or switching the direction as nobody walks, the thing I’m sure is that it’s an era of mobile payment.【美团网团购】吃喝玩乐好帮手，专业品质团购网So, it’s not MASS FACTORIES or MASS PRODUCTION in China anymore. It’s IT’s best era in China that you can do anything online as you want. The reason why it develops so well is that Chinese IT has learnt and did well in Software development and without it, nothing can happen. Coding is not a question for Chinese coder to deal with and they can code very well although they might not be able to read, speak, talk or listen English. So what? It’s rationally irrelevant for a IT nerd to speak in fluent English like English major students. They can write a beautiful JAVA, Object-C, php, R, Python or even the simpler one HTTP. It’s ridiculous to say that Chinese is not able to write code in a language they are not familiar with. It’s a lot like you say someone definitely doesn’t know how to judge a refrigerator good or bad simply because of he or she can’t refrigerate foods.","112,405 followers",Yishan Wong,751,1.6K,28.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-technologies-that-will-survive-the-next-10-years
