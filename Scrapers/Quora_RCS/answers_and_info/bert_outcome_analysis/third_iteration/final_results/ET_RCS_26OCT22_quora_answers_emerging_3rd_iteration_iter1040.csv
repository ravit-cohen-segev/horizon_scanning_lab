More people aren’t scared to explore new currencies and payment methods removing them from the stigma of these big corporations that just simply monopolizes and just limiting our options.One project which I think have made an impact as I was checking for alternatives when it comes to payment was NavCoin. I’m amazed how independent this platform imagine an open-source, blockchain based Proof of Stake cryptocurrency. Its design is public, nobody owns or controls it, and everyone can take part. The platform run by its users, for users like us - with an incentivised network of nodes verifying payments all around the world.Just a quickie history about it NavCoin, it is a community-run network that was started in 2014. It initially used Proof of Work, but quickly made the shift to Proof of Stake. With no ICO or premine, NavCoin has always been self-funded to ensure a fair distribution and that everyone has a chance to get involved.In short this platform are just one of the platforms that clearly provides solutions that many of us have been trying to resolved. We want cheap, fast and performance-driven tools and not just because we don’t have any other options.Imagine if there are more blockchain platforms that resolves such issues, I doubt people will forget it.

But I watched this in not one, two but three documentaries.However, if your blood sugar is normal, do NOT take this. I never will advocate taking ANY drug for the wrong reasons, and while we all might wish to live beyond the time we have, this is not the way to do it. I never will advise screwing around with the pancreas (and this will absolutely kill you if you have no issues with it), and believe me, you’ll live longer if you don’t have diabetes. And the type II is much more dangerous; type I means that typically, your pancreas produces zero blood sugar, which is often easier to deal with. Type II is the rogue version, in that it can produce way too much, a lot, a normal amount occasionally, a little, or nothing, with no way of knowing without testing and leaping a strict measurement of it. I have to avoid sugar to be safe, and I am just off enough to require metformin twice a day, right before, during or right after my breakfast and dinner.Even so, I find it interesting that scientists are trying to separate out the telemeride-growth portion of metformin to help extend human life. Personally, I am not one of the people who will take it if it can be safely done (not that there is any proof of this or that it might happen within my lifetime), but because I have long ago made my peace with having and appreciating a finite life.

She’d send away for succulent Virginia hams, bake bread, feed us oatmeal and cheerios with plenty of sugar. We’d clamor for her pancakes and waffles with real butter and real maple syrup. She never exercised. All her life, she was skinny as a rail and so were we.Today, the children are obese as are scads of adults—in most states ranging up to 40%, having doubled between 1995 and 2019. I don’t remember any truly obese children in my schools as I grew up during the 50’s and 60’s. Also, disease affects many more people than it once did and at younger ages. Something has happened.Until recently, I suspected it was something in the food. Only weeks ago I learned the probable truth. It’s what’s NOT in our food any longer—nutrients.In traditional farming, after a crop was harvested, the leaves, stubble and spoiled vegetation were turned over and allowed to decompose for a season in rain and snow, re-enriching the soil. Our foods were full of nutrients, as was our meat and poultry from eating the nutritious crops.When commercial farming arrived, they soon tired of fallow fields. To increase profits, the fields were always under cultivation, continuously depleting the soil. Chemical fertilizers couldn’t keep up.Bottom line, not only do we not ingest the amount of nutrients humans always have needed to fend off illness and disease, but our underfed bodies, seeking nourishment, instinctively urge us to eat more and more and more. On the average diet, we can’t get “full” like we once did.This is a very big problem, not only for our present health, but there are predictions that soil depletion is so rapid that our fields won’t be able to produce food at all at some point.There are actually two different debates going on about this, soil erosion and soil depletion, the newer, but related concern. My points refer to depletion.Is this why we are sicker, obese, and our lifespan is declining?I’m almost convinced the answer is yes.","74,721 followers",Tiny Nair,2.7K,689,28M,2011,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-should-we-expect-cities-to-realistically-adopt-within-the-next-5-10-years-2021%E2%80%932026
