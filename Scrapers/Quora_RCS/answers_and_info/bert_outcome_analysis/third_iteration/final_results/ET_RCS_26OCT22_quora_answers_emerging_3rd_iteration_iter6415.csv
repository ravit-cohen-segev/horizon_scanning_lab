7,"No, it is the exact opposite. Evolution and adaptation need stimulation - the organism evolves or adapts when it has to perform better in challenges of the life in the harsh natural environment. The life in the civilisation lacks these challenges - we don´t have to fight predators and run from them, we found cure to almost any disease, when we need to move something heavy or to get somewhere distant, we use car, when the weather gets bad we easily find shelter, when we are hungry, we don´t have to hunt, we just go to the shop.

Because of that our evolution and adaptation has slowed down, as we have no need to become better. Someone could even argue that we degenerate - as in the last two thousand years, on average our muscle mass, bones density, immune system, IQ level and sharpness of our senses worsened - at least according to many studies. At the same time the civilisation diseases are on the rise, thanks to our unhealthy eating habits and lack of exercise. So I would call it rather devolution and loss of adaptation ability.

20,"If you mean in a civil rights sense, no that will never be an issue. AI isn’t a person in our sense, no matter how intelligent it gets. It doesn’t dream of boobs or retirement, AI is entirely by design. Further, the fact that it’s impossible to make a machine feel pain proves our spiritual nature. So in that sense there is also a clear distinction that rules out any need for rights.
