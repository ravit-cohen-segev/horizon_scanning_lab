There's nothing I can add to previous comments except that I believe people focus way too much on it—as if once we get rid of Creationists, everyone will instantly understand Evolution. They won't. Maybe without opposing forces, Evolution would become dogma for most people, but dogma isn't the same as understanding.Also, opposing forcesNote that there's no Fundamentalist movement against Math. You could argue that Fundamentalism adds to a general anti-intellectual ethos, but few would go as far as to say extreme religious forces are the main reason most kids leave school without any rigorous understanding of the subject.Also, note that in mostly-secular countries, many people still don't understand Evolution very well.Evolution is Counter IntuitiveIntuitive concepts are those which are tied to everyday things we can experience with our senses. Gravity is intuitive, even if people don't understand its mechanics, because everyone drops coffee cups. And that's at least a basis for understanding. It's a starting point.We can't see, hear, smell, touch, or taste Evolution, and that immediately creates a teaching challenge. The closest we can get is noting how different species have similar features. However, that isn't good enough. We know it's not, because the fact that humans and chimps look remarkably alike is far from enough to convince many people. And even many who are convinced have an extremely low-level of understanding.Another challenge is the timescales involved. People have a hard time comprehending timescales in recorded human history, like the fact that the USA has existed for about 200 years while Ancient Egyptian society lasted for 3,000. It's not just that people don't know that (though most don't); it's that in everyday life, almost no one thinks in vast timescales.I tried to tackle that problem, here:It's vital that we help people understand the timescales involved in Evolution, because without that understanding, Evolution seems absurd. ""Really? Something as complex as a human brain or an eyeOur Education Systems SucksHow do schools try to help kids comprehend vast timescales? Answer: they don't.How do they teach other aspects of Evolution. At best by taking kids on field trips to museums where they stare at dinosaur bones; at worst by lecturing them about Darwin, Mendel, Watson and Crick. None of those strategies are likely to lead to deep understanding.First of all, schools need to get kids used to playing with large numbers. This will help them understand biological time scales, geological time scales, historical timescales, and vast distances, such as the massive amounts of space between the Earth and the Moon:* = width of the USADistance between the Earth and the Moon:0 ******************************************************************************** o(If I illustrated the distance between Earth and Mars this way, I'd need 11,598 asterisks when the planets are closest together.)How about taking kids on a field trip where they walk a mile, helping them get a visceral understanding of how long a mile is? Then, after getting them to think of one step as a mile, having them walk to the moon. And then to Mars.Here's another good question kids should be grappling with: what are the chances that if you throw ten coins on the floor, they'll all show heads? And I'mMost people simply don't make a distinction between ""impossible"" and ""takes an absurdly long time,"" and it makes sense that they don't, because, on a human scale, emptying the Pacific Ocean with a thimble might as well be impossible. So we need to help kids understandMore here:And here:When I was a kid, I ""believed"" in Evolution because ""smart people said it was true,"" and I even had a kind of understanding of it. But I didn't have an intuitive grasp of it until I built some simple computer simulations and let them run for hours.In addition to teaching timescales, it would be great to bring selective breeding into schools, and I'm not talking about teenage makeout parties. I'm talking about students doing longterm experiments with short-lifespan, fast-reproducing animals and plants.Someone should design an experiment in which kids work with (for instance) fruit flies andMetaphors that HurtEven amongst people withScientists often make things worse by continually using anthropomorphized language:""Evolution didn't build us to be monogamous.""""The purpose of a duck's feet is to propel it through water.""""The Selfish Gene""This sort of language can be immensely helpful (as shorthand) to people who understand that it's metaphorical. To everyone else, it's misleading.It's even misleading to talk about Evolution as a system. If people talked about History that way, they'd constantly say things like ...""History uses wars to redraw political boundaries.""... and ...But most of us understand that there's no system called History. Rather, there'sEvolution is similar, though almost no one talks about it that way. It isn't trying toIn other words, it doesn't really make sense to say ""Evolution doesn't have a goal"" or ""Evolution isn't sentient."" We say that about rocks and tree stumps, but Evolution isn't like those. It's neither a purposeful thing nor a purposeless thing. It's not a thing at all.Here's what actually happens: a bunch of organisms have various traits. Some of those traits help their hosts to survive and have lots of kids. Other traits are hindrances. If traits fail to help their hosts have kids, they can't pass those traits to the next generation. If traits are helpful, a mechanism called DNA passes them on...We callOne more example. If we talked about horse races the way we talked about Evolution, we'd say, ""The race didn't intend Big Boy to win..."" Instead, we understand that some events happened and we call those events ""a horse race.""Perhaps there's a philosophical level where this is true of any system, e.g. ""There's no such thing as Democracy. It's just the label we give to a series of events that occur when there's a representative government, elections, etc."" And it's probably useful to think the opposite way: to posit Democracy or Evolution as ""things"" that have properties and work according to rules to achieve certain goals. I am not denying the utility of that.But it's equally important to understand what actually",0 followers,Claire Jordan,3K,45.6K,295.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-evolution-widely-misunderstood-Who-what-is-responsible-for-this-Did-scientists-allow-such-a-simplistic-understanding-to-spread-to-aid-the-spread-of-belief-in-evolution-itself-Is-it-good-for-the-field-in-the-long-run

5,"EvolutionEvolutionOne very common misunderstanding is that evolution deals with the appearance of the first living species. No. The appearance of life on Earth is a different concept from what happens to established species as they compete with one another. Interestingly, “creationism” has nothing to do with evolution.Another common misunderstanding is that evolution moves organisms from primitive to advanced. Wrong. There is no push toward advancement. Evolution is about fitness, but “fitness” is not defined in terms of how buff you are at the gym. Fitness is a measure of reproductive success. Mutations in DNA are a random roll of the dice. Then these mutations are subject to natural selection. Success is defined by how many of your offspring survive to reproduce. So if your species spends a lot of time underground, it may be advantageous to lose both limbs and sight. Worms, fungi, and slime molds are no less advanced than humans. They are successful at doing what they do in their own niche. You sometimes hear the question “If humans evolved from chimps, then why do we still have chimps?” Those who ask this question are wearing virtual dunce caps, because the question reveals a basic ignorance about the process. They are assuming that evolution is about moving up a ladder, with humans at the top. Wrong. At one point in time, 5–7 million years ago, there was a species of ape that spit into two species. These two species, as well as their common ancestor, are extinct. But each of these divergent species continued to spin off new species. One lineage eventually led to today’s humans, and another lineage evolved into today’s chimps. Evolution involves a chaotic and random branching, with each species tested by its environment. It is not a predictable ascent up a ladder.The other MAJOR misconception in evolution concerns a basic misunderstanding of what a theory is. A theory is the strongest statement science can ever make. The longer a theory stands, the stronger it becomes. Eventually, theories that have stood the test of multiple challenges become, for all intents and purposes “facts” in the common sense. But science does not deal with facts. You can falsify a theory, but you cannot prove it true. Ever. The misconception is “If evolution is true, then why is it still a theory?” Again, the question itself indicates ignorance. The fact that evolution has stood repeated challenges since 1859 demonstrates that it is perhaps the strongest, best-supported theory that has ever been proposed. There is much more support for the theory of evolution than there is for the theory of gravity. Gravity is a strong theory, and we can test it every time we drop something. But we still don’t understand the mechanism of gravity in the same detail that we understand the mechanism of evolution. Theories never “grow up” to become facts.So the misunderstanding is based on what science IS. Science is a process that humans have devised to answer questions. It follows rules, just like accountants follow accounting principles. Evolution can be tested, and it has never failed a test. We know that Intelligent design is not science, and cannot be called a theory. Whether intelligent design is true or not is an untestable matter of faith that has no connection to evolution or science.","15,557 followers",Gary Meaney,1.5K,758,23.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-evolution-widely-misunderstood-Who-what-is-responsible-for-this-Did-scientists-allow-such-a-simplistic-understanding-to-spread-to-aid-the-spread-of-belief-in-evolution-itself-Is-it-good-for-the-field-in-the-long-run
6,"I think the main problem in most criticism I see is a lack of “population thinking”.Creationists and other people who misunderstand evolution always think in terms of individuals changing, crocodiles somehow “morphing” into birds and naturally realise that is absurd.What happens in evolution is not so much that individuals change but that the “population changes”.This is a fundamental distinction that causes much misunderstanding.","2,780 followers",Jon Therkildsen,1.5K,1.5K,7.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-evolution-widely-misunderstood-Who-what-is-responsible-for-this-Did-scientists-allow-such-a-simplistic-understanding-to-spread-to-aid-the-spread-of-belief-in-evolution-itself-Is-it-good-for-the-field-in-the-long-run

9,"As I am currently working on a paper on the predictability of evolution, this is a particularly interesting question for me.We can, actually, predict the future direction of evolution in extremely limited cases.

However, this is prediction of the form ""there is a 10% chance this population will adapt to this condition via mutation x, a 20% chance it will adapt using mutation y ..."". Currently, this is done through empirical replication. E.g. if you observe an organism adapting to a particular environment 1000 times, you can then have a pretty good guess about the probability distribution of how the 1001th replicate will evolve. This has been done inI am currently working on projects to do this in a large scale in yeast.In systems where we can genetically engineer the organism, it is possible to ask the ""Why"" questions. For example in the yeast paper cited above, the authors find that there are two different adaptive mutations that crop up in the populations, but they are mutually exclusive to each other. Having one mutation makes the other impossible. Judging from what the mutations do, having both mutations seems to create an overdose of a gene that is harmful to the organism when it is trying to adapt to the experimental environment.In studying the evolution of naturally evolving organisms, I am of the opinion that even the ""How"" questions are nearly impossible to answer. AsIn large populations (like microbes), where every mutation can occur every generation, it is almost a given that the population can adapt to the environment, so it may seem reasonable to ask questions of why this adaptation occurred using one method instead of another. E.g. in HIV, under single drug therapy, the population size is so large that resistance occurs very predictably within a few months. These populations are so large that essentially every change that occurs at a molecular level is driven by adaptation to something, either through direct selection or genetic draft. In these sorts of conditions, even scientists use adaptationist thinking, assuming that the population is destined to adapt to its environment, since it is a reasonable approximation of what occurs.I think people tend to think that adaptation and evolution are the same thing. The general public reveres darwin's ideas of natural selection as the only method of evolution, which is simply not true (ignoring the forces of mutation, drift and demography). This gets them to think that everything that evolved was an adaptation to something, and the only question is why it evolved this way instead of some other way. It doesn't help that the only scientific evolution stories that are published for the public in newspapers tend to be adaptation based. Even for scientists, it is way more exciting to find that something is an adaptation than a product of random chance, and adaptation articles get published in much higher impact journals, leading to more exposure.Professional scientists understand that there are both random and adaptive forces at work in evolution, but this lack of understanding leads to some pretty terrible conclusions in the general public. If nothing else, from a public funding point of view (which is where most evolutionary biologists, including myself, get their money from), this mis-characterization needs to be corrected soon.Finally, see my response to this question in an old post:",99 followers,David Johnson,1.4K,25.9K,15.1M,2013,https://www.quora.com/Is-evolution-widely-misunderstood-Who-what-is-responsible-for-this-Did-scientists-allow-such-a-simplistic-understanding-to-spread-to-aid-the-spread-of-belief-in-evolution-itself-Is-it-good-for-the-field-in-the-long-run

We look at the patient information, and it was from a 105 yr old man. We figured whoever looked after him thought he would die before he needed the resection, and the surgery was delayed until it was impossible to put off any longer - and hence, his operation was probably about 1000 times worse what it would have been, had it been done in a timely fashion.We just don't know the future.

I would even consider giving her/him a pacemaker if needed in spite of her/his dementia to prevent often catastrophic falls causing much preventable suffering before death eventually sets in.Excluding a heart attack in an very elderly patient if done in a non  disturbing way to her/him isn't so taxing or overdone at all.Some old people having had a good life to look back on prefer not to have e.g. a big tumor in the belly analyzed, since they fully accept and are at peace with that life will somehow end: ""completed life"".  According to their wishes we would only give them optimal palliative care, preventing pain, anxiety, fear, have them nursed well among others preventing bedsores, helped (but not forced) with feeding etc. and not do any exam at all.A patient with late stage dementia developing a severe pneumonia we would treat with oral antibiotics unless (s)he protest vehemently, but refrain from referring them for mechanical ventilation op the intensive care unit.So, I do agree with you that not everything we see needs to be treated, but someone having had a recent downturn in her/his health, if that potentially could lead to further serious problems, I think it would be humane and wise to get oriented what could have been wrong, after that consider what the best response for that individual patient is.In very elderly patients who are mentally still alert, and are not having multiple physical problems, I think it is right to remove any cause of potential pain or suffering if the patient agrees and it is technically possible, so for some removing a bowel cancer in a healthy 90 to 100 old would be the right decision, since bowel cancer obstructing the bowels - because of it keeps growing - will cause a lot of unnecessary pain and suffering.",2 followers,Zack Martin,1.5K,395,8.6M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Is-evolution-widely-misunderstood-Who-what-is-responsible-for-this-Did-scientists-allow-such-a-simplistic-understanding-to-spread-to-aid-the-spread-of-belief-in-evolution-itself-Is-it-good-for-the-field-in-the-long-run

Where currently we only have a best hypothesis that might end up having to be refined or added to and occasionally even completely replaced.But no “faith” is required. Even for something where our current explanations are not 100% correct, people believe they are the most likely because they are most consistent with the evidence we currently have. If new evidence comes to light, then it either supports the prevailing hypothesis (and increases the probability that it is correct) or it doesn’t and we have to adjust the hypothesis to account for the new evidence.Science is a learning process and the more we do the more we learn. But at the same time, much of what we already know is either pretty definitely correct or at least close enough to allow planes to fly, mobile phones to communicate and medical treatments to make people better again.
