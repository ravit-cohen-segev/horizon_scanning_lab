4,"Most of the really good answers have talked about advances in the aircraft side of things and there have been massive changes (albeit not always blatant like the vapor-craft shown below):So, we're still flying around aircraft that look essentially like the ones we were scooting around in back in the day (though the A380 has reached new levels of ugly not often seen).

As you can read, so much has changed with them that's not always obvious.Another radical change (if you can call incremental changes set over 20+ years ""radical"") is in the air control system. We're in the middle of upgrading to what's called ""NEXTGEN"" and is going to significantly increase the volume of airplanes in the existing airspace. With the advent of GPS and better tracking radars and software, controllers can stack up aircraft much closer, increasing throughput at choke points and airports.The way we buy tickets would be unrecognizable to folks even in the 90s, as would the way we track baggage. The sheer volume of passengers is a subtle sign of the advances of aviation. You can't just upscale existing systems and expect to get the same results; once you reach certain scales, entirely different methods are required, and have been developed. From passenger and crew tracking to catering and waste management, there have been tremendous changes to the aviation system. And the changes are constantly coming at us.And yet, we still have that guy snoring on our shoulder as we sail over Dayton...",46 followers,Ian Lang,905,5.8K,64.3M,2014,https://www.quora.com/What-new-technology-do-hotels-want-developed
5,"My father was an instructor in WW II with the Royal Canadian Air Force. After the war it took him a few years to get back to a flying job but by the time he ended his career in the mid 1980s he had amassed more than 36,000 flying hours. My son has just finished his Commercial License with multi engine and IFR ratings. He has about 250 hours.

In between, and as mentioned in my bio, I am the humble private pilot.I outline this to demonstrate that I’ve been watching the aviation industry pretty closely for nearly six decades and I can assure you, that while the general configuration may not have changed much, and the top speeds haven’t increased much, the technological advancements in engines, airframes, avionics, and safety has been profound. Just the other day I was telling my son about how my father, who died in 1988, would be amazed at some of the tools my son has access to…tools like iPad based flight planning and GPS navigation that were, quite literally, science fiction in the 1960s.In the 1970s my parents flew to Australia for my sister’s wedding. They were on Boeing 707’s the whole route…Toronto, Los Angeles, Hawaii, Fiji, Sydney. Four stops. Earlier this year I did the same trip with one stop, started from farther away, was probably a lot more comfortable, and was undoubtedly safer. I’m sure the airplane was a whole lot more fuel efficient as well. Heck…the entertainment system had a moving map and a heads up display with altitude, ground speed, heading, etc. Imagine what’s on the flight deck.Airplanes went from the Wright Flyer to supersonic flight in 44 years, and to the Mach 3 SR-71 in 60 years. Progress since the sixties may seem slow to you but I contend it has been remarkable, if not as obvious. I think it’s also true that trying to compare the second sixty years of aviation to the first sixty is a bit of a mugs game. The progress in that first 60 years would be virtually impossible to match again.",16 followers,Chandan Bhat,1.3K,0,0,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-new-technology-do-hotels-want-developed
6,"I do not think it is true that there has been no technological advance since the 1960s.Two things are true. Commercial aircraft have not got faster. Experimental evidence (Concorde) is that the cost/benefit of supersonic travel is very poor. I am sure that we could easily build a Concorde replacement if we wanted to. But, as measured by our willingness to pay for tickets, we do not want to. The current Mach 0.9 max speed or so commercial jet represents a sweet spot which appeals to customers wallets.And the broad outside shape of aircraft has not changed much. But then, why should it?

But, as measured by our willingness to pay for tickets, we do not want to. The current Mach 0.9 max speed or so commercial jet represents a sweet spot which appeals to customers wallets.And the broad outside shape of aircraft has not changed much. But then, why should it? You need large flat symmetrical wings, a passenger cabin, some kind of a stabiliser and control surfaces some way from the CofG, and some engines somewhere. The passenger cabin wants the minimum cross section for minimum drag, pressure vessel for pressurization. Engines not to close together, symmetrical, hanging down for easy maintenance. Moving them out on the wing reduces wing loading.All-in-all, there seems little way to improve the overall design. The only alternate configuration that seems to offer any advantage is the Flying Wing, and that seems to have serious disadvantages in lack of windows and serious maneuvering forces on passengers not on the centre line.On the other hand, almost everything below the large scale has change hugely. The materials from which they are built, the control systems, the navigation systems, the engines, are almost unrecognizably different. An engineer jumping from 1960 to 2010 and trying to understand the latest designs would be completely baffled. The internal technology of a 21st century plain would be essentially complete magic. He would understand what was being done, but how it happened would be incomprehensible.",0 followers,Thomas Kolb,1.3K,575,4.9M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-technologies-frameworks-etc-should-I-learn-to-become-a-full-stack-Python-developer
7,"There has been a large advancement. I notice you point to trains and faster speeds. You seem to associate faster speeds with advancement. This is untrue. Under the skin, there have been amazing advancements. The entire cockpit has changed. The materials, engines, technology, avionics, and shapes have all changed. Sure, the tube with two wings shape hasn't changed, but don't expect it to, at least for the next couple decades. Like others have said, avionics have improved by lightyears.

10,"A list of paragraphs, because a bullet list doesn't really do entire technologies and disciplines justice:For Design:For DevelopmeA list of paragraphs, because a bullet list doesn't really do entire technologies and disciplines justice:For Design:For Development:CSS 2 & 3 - same as HTML - know it in-and-out. Learn all the selectors, all the rules, how cascading works, media queries (especially as they apply to responsive design), the box model, positioning, and how these constrain and enable you to translate a design in Photoshop into a working website. Nifty tricks of the trade can come with time and experience, but you'll also want a good idea of which cool new features are available in which browsers, and what the quirks in implementation you'll encounter with the major browsers.Javascript - you must know Javascript well to be successful as a developer. in particular, even if you've already worked with other C-style languages, learn closures, lambdas, and asynchronous programming (especially in regard to asynchronous requests - AJAX). Get intimately familiar with the DOM API. You'll probably end up using a library like jQuery most of the time for DOM manipulation, but you can't use it well until you understand what's going on under the hood. You can probably hold off on advanced topics like Canvas and WebGL if you just want to do websites, though. :)Browsers - know the quirks and differences between the latest versions of Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and the last 2-3 versions of Internet Explorer (which people are less prone to keep up to date than the other ones). This will include feature support for HTML, CSS, and Javascript, known bugs/issues and their workarounds, and other gotchas mentioned above. Learn to use each of their developer tools (and I recommend learning Firebug in Firefox as well, which is technically an extension but still more used than the built-in tools). Also, unless you have dozens of different Android and iOS devices laying around, learn to set up emulated Android and iOS devices using the Android SDK and XCode (respectively) so you can do some basic mobile browser testing. Bonus points if you spend a little time with Opera, IE6 and other obscure browsers.Frameworks: jQuery (DOM manipulation library for JS) and Bootstrap (CSS/Javascript frontend design framework) are pretty much obligatory these days. You should get to know them intimately, because most of the work you do will involve one or both. It's also worth tinkering with some of the less common ones, in particular the data-binding/applications frameworks like React, AngularJS, and Backbone, some of the other DOM libraries (Mootools, Prototype, etc), and some of the other design frameworks (Foundation, 960 Grid, Skeleton). Don't feel like you need to learn all of these thoroughly before you look for professional work; just have a look so you know what you're dealing with when you encounter them and where to find help.Backend: despite wanting to be a frontend developer, you're going to need to know at least a little about what happens on the server side. Try to acquire at least a basic grasp of one of the following: PHP, Python, Ruby, or Java. 90% or more of your work opportunities will be running on top of a platform built on one of those languages. You can leave the crunchy stuff to the backend developers, but you're going to need to know enough to work with them when developing templates and working with the APIs they expose for asynchronous requests, which will be your job to implement on the browser/client side.If you can learn all of this stuff before you seek entry-level work or freelance jobs you'll blow them out of the water and probably make the guy training or managing you a very happy camper. Realistically a lot of this will come with time and experience though. Your #1 priority is to get some working designs under your belt; your portfolio speaks much louder than a bullet-point list of technologies on your CV. :)","82,154 followers",Quincy Larson,547,358,29.1M,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-technologies-frameworks-etc-should-I-learn-to-become-a-full-stack-Python-developer
