This rapidly growing field is one that offers abundant opportunities for mechanical engineers.In the years ahead, mechanical engineers are expected to be integral in using nanotechnology to:BiomechatronicsThe role of mechanical engineers in robotics is taken a step even further with the rapid growth of biomechatronics. This field, which seeks to merge body and machine, involves the design and testing of complex and intricate device architectures that mimic the body’s musculoskeletal design.Mechanical engineers will be primarily involved in the design of mechanical sensors, controllers, and actuators for biomedical devicesManufacturingManufacturing is an ever-evolving field. Mounting pressures to increase production efficiency while minimizing operating costs have fueled demand for new and innovative technologies.Automation and roboticsNon-of the engineering is dead end...Edit:1.0For people in the comment section asking the reason for high unemployment for Mechanical Engineers. To answer the questionThe Problem of unemployment is not only with Mechanical Engineers, but with the whole Industrial Sector.A lot of Electrical Engineers and Electronics Engineers are working in IT Services like TCS, Infosys, Wipro, CTS, IBM etc.Many Civil and Mechanical Engineers are either working in Banking Services or pursuing Teaching in Coaching Classes.Some are selling Credit CardsFortunate Ones are going to US, Germany, Netherland to pursue M.S.The reason for this is, after Independence Indian economy has shifted gradually from Agriculture Sector to Service Sector (be it formal or Informal) leavingAccordingly the Share of Workforce in the Industrial Sector also remained Stagnant.However, Total no of Engineering graduates each year has risen drastically leaving many graduates unemployed.As per National Employability report engineers annual report 2019, Approximately 80 percent of Indian engineering graduates are not employable in the current knowledge-driven economy. This signify the pathetic condition of engineering education in India. Some major initiative in the direction of quality of education, is the need of the hour.What are Future Prospects of Industrial SectorIt has already been perceived our Government that Industrial & Manufacturing growth is the best route for overall economic development.Make In India, Skill Development, Start-up India, Stand-up India, Entrepreneurship Skill Development Program are some of the examples.Under Make in India thrust sectors have been identified to provide a push to manufacturing and Start-up India to strengthen the start-up ecosystem.The Ease of Doing Business initiative aims to create a conducive environment by streamlining existing regulations and processes and eliminating unnecessary requirements and procedures.Foreign Direct Investment policy and procedures have been simplified and liberalised progressively.Hope Future Industrial Sector is Bright, Everyone will be Employed !.Thank you Ayana Vini for pointing this out..Edit-2.0For people contending that the rate of innovation in Computer Science and Electronics is much higher and there is very less innovation in Mechanical engineering.I agree that the rate of innovation in computer science and electronics is far than the mechanical engineering.I totally agree.However, There is a world beyond the computer too. We can not eat data, we can not wear motherboard and we can not brush our teeth with a transistor & we can not drive a mouse.What i mean to say that for the innovations in computer science and electronics to use practically we always have to have a base. Where will we use those innovations ?? We will use these innovation in electronics over a car, or robot, or drone or rocket or spaceship or aeroplane , helicopter, fighter plane or any other equipment which must have a chance of using Mechanical engineering and we can witness the innovations in these technologies, can’t we?The rate of innovations in computer science and electronics is higher because these are new for the humanity. Both came into existence in the later 20th century and innovation has just picked up in the last decade. Hence, everything is new for us and we are able to perceive the little changes in it. Like after every 6 months we see a new smart phone with some new technology. There are millions of Applications releasing everyday. It looks quite fascinating to us, isn’t it ?However, we have been unable to see the innovations in materials. We don’t know about carbon fiber. We have ignored these innovations in Biomechanics.AWe have no idea about innovation in the field of Fluid dynamics because we can not feel it.There are innovations in mechanical Engineering too.The world is dreaming about a flying car, an smart robot, smart machines, and smart materials.There are huge innovation in nanotechnology, robotics, biomechanics going on.And i hope that in the NEXT EPIDEMIC like CORONA virus our worriers will be smart robots equipped with artificial intelligence ( off course credit goes to computer science), who will be carrying the infected to the hospitals and operating them.And in the coming time biotechnology is going to take over both Computer Science and Electronics Engineering as world has started witnessing biological warfare.Where as Mechanical Engineering will keep growing with the slow pace like a tortoise!Regards,ReferenceImage Source -phone gallery & GoogleMechanical engineering - Wikipedia4 Things to Expect for the Future of Mechanical Engineeringhttps://www.gedcouncil.org/sites/default/files/Engineering+Education+in+India+Dec1608-1.pdfDATA STORY | 80% of Indian engineering graduates not employable, says surveyIndia struggles but Bangladesh's GDP rides high on manufacturing, export boomKey Initiatives for Industrial Development Post GST and Demonetisation",46 followers,Chandrasekar Sankar,9.3K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-do-viruses-advance-technology

For many years I have questioned why we need to divide engineering education into different groups - civil, mechanical, electrical, mining, petroleum etc… In my province (BC) we are legally allowed to practice engineering in areas we have proven competence.

It also does not mean that II have hired many engineers over the past 20 years and the two things that I tell a fresh graduate is that the greatest skill you have to offer me is your ability to read and comprehend technical topics very quickly. For many years I have questioned why we need to divide engineering education into different groups - civil, mechanical, electrical, mining, petroleum etc… In my province (BC) we are legally allowed to practice engineering in areas we have proven competence. Being a mechanical engineer does not mean that I am competent in HVAC design or aircraft design. It also does not mean that I am incompetent in Electrical systems design. Once you have an engineering degree, all you have proven is that you can learn technical subjects quickly. The real learning starts on your first day of work. Some of our best process (chemical) engineers are mechanical engineers because they have an excellent grasp of thermodynamics, fluids, heat transfer etc… Similarly, I have seen some very good structural engineers (typically civil) that had mechanical engineering degrees. Mechanical engineers make great controls engineers as they understand the mechanical and process aspects of the system and we also learn most aspects of electrical circuits. Many of our best “programmers” are mechanical engineers where you would have expected a computer or electrical engineer. I used to design building systems and was forced to learn about building codes, mechanical systems and electrical systems. I was equally comfortable specifying beams as I was specifying high voltage feeders or plumbing waste stacks.  Having hired many different engineers over my career, I have learned that mechanical engineers are generally the most well rounded and can do just about anything with suitable training and mentorship. I personally think that we should only have one engineering degree and that it should be based on mechanical engineering. Once you graduate and follow a certain path, then you can take more specialized course for a particular field. I have also hired many technologists who generally get more specialized training in one field; however, I find their ability to expand beyond their base is limited. Sure they know the new lingo and hit the ground running but they stall pretty quick once the technology or conditions change. Young engineers are generally more broad but can quickly grasp the lingo and concepts.Another very important aspect is that engineering is a self-regulated profession. As a profession, we are held to very high standards. After university, we only get two grades. The bridge either stands up or it falls down. The plane either flies or it crashes. If we screw up, people can die. We are not allowed to make mistakes. How is it possible that anyone can get 100% every time. It is very simple, we use proven codes, standards and methods. We use checkers and stringent approval processes. We are registered with the government and take an oath to protect the public and put them above all else. When we stamp a drawing, we are saying that people can bet their lives on our work. We are expected to know and follow the applicable codes and if we deviate from them, we better be able to defend it in court. When you read a code - for example NFPA 85 code for boilers, - it makes reference to every discipline of engineering from civil to mechanical to electrical and controls. We are expected to fully comprehend and translate the requirements into specifications that can be relied upon for the construction of a system that is safe, reliable and cost effective. So in essence, engineers are also technical lawyers. Our job is to understand technical requirements embodied in codes and standards and protect the public. We are held to very high ethical standards. This often brings conflict and forces us to ponder philosophy. Is it ethical for an engineer to develop weapons that could be used to kill children. Is it ethical for an engineer to design machines that contribute to global warming. We are faced with these questions every day.In many ways mechanical engineers are the engine of society. We create and build the systems that everyone relies upon. If someone asks where power comes from and their initial thoughts are the electrical outlet, then we smile and think about all the massive infrastructure that was created by engineers to support power getting to the outlet.Being a mechanical engineer can be very fulfilling. Indirectly you touch many lives and solve problems that benefit society. I am not suggesting mechanical engineering is altruistic but there is definitely an element of philosophy embodied in our profession.I started university at 16 with extreme naivety and just took mechanical engineering because I liked cars. I now look back on my life and career and feel extremely fortunate and truly believe I could not have picked a better profession.So the short answer to what is mechanical engineering is that it can be whatever you want. You are given a toolbox of knowledge that lets you do anything or go anywhere that your heart desires. How you use the tools is up to you.","68,787 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.5M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-are-advanced-technologies-of-mechanical-engineering
