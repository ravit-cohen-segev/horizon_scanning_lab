Many of these uncontacted peoples are in the same situation as the pre-Columbian Native Americans, except much more extreme:There are few people and they rarely have contact with cultures that are radically different from their own in any vaguely constructive way. In a way, not contacting them has stuck them in a practically permanent kind of ‘technological stasis’. Perhaps in hundreds or thousands of years, individual tribes could expand, diversify, and begin discovering new ideas and technology, much like some speculate the Native Americans would’ve done if given a few more centuries on their own.In the case of the uncontacted tribes, however, almost all of them would either run out of room (in the case of islands) or make unavoidable contact with the rest of the world before they reached this point.","2,447 followers",Alex Wineburg,3K,217,7.4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Why-havent-uncontacted-peoples-developed-more-advanced-technology-than-what-they-currently-have

2,"A phone camera has an aperture of perhaps 3 millimeters. That means if the lens and sensor are perfect, it can achieve 167 microradians of resolution.Consider a DSLR with a 2000 mm focal length lens. It can resolve 2 microradians.OK, so you don’t know what that means. I grabbed my phone camera and my 12 year old modest DSLR with kit lens and took a picture under good conditions. Hand held.Cell phone.DSLR. So far, so good. But let’s take a closer look.I zoomed in on the sign in the picture. This is what the cellphone did.

It has 32 megapixels.I did the same digital zoom with my DSLR. Mind you, it only has 18 megapixels. There are a couple of take aways here. With the tiny lens, all those megapixels do not get you a clearer picture. And the cellphone picture is very highly processed to look sharper when it just doesn’t have the detail you would expect from so many pixels. If you are really sharp you will notice that the DSLR did not automatically hide the chromatic aberration in the above picture. That is something usually done in post processing on the computer.Now, I just rotated my zoom lens to a longer focal length and took another picture.You still think that a cellphone image matches up to a DSLR?Look at this building in the cell phone.It’s pretty unrecognizable and the phone went basically to black and white.Here is the DSLR. Can you argue that the cell phone is anywhere near professional quality when we are comparing to a new phone to a twelve-year-old starter DSLR APS-C frame with a kit lens? A flagship Canon full frame DSLR with a prime lens would blow even the bottom picture away. By the way, I did not do any processing on the DSLR images and I have the camera set for minimal sharpening and minimal noise reduction and output jpeg files. If I had taken raw images into Photoshop, the difference would be another quantum leap.Or, in other words, if all you ever want to do is take snapshots for social media, your cellphone is all you need. Wait until balloon fiesta and I’ll show you some comparison photos.I am actually a little surprised that the phone camera came as close as it did.

14,"In a few areas, actually. First is infrastructure. The Chinese planned waaaaaaaaaay ahead while building. That’s why there were ghost cities. The developers built huge communities before they were needed, knowing that large factories were coming soon. Above that is public transportation.

Smaller cities have buses available that will take you just about everywhere within the city and bigger cities have subways as well as buses. For going between cities and provinces, China has a high speed rail system in place that is more extensive than the American highway system! For example: I lived in a city called Nanjing in China - about 200 miles/300 km from Shanghai. I could take a high speed train from Nanjing to Shanghai in about 1.5 hours!In contrast, I took an Amtrak train from Detroit to Chicago (about 300 miles/480 km) and it took over 8 hours!Another area China wins at is public utilities. They provide electricity, water, and gas for billions of people for very affordable prices! I paid maybe a total of $20 (US) per month for all utility bills, whereas it cost me over $100 in America! Atop of that is wireless technology (which is considered a public utility in China). I paid 100 rmb ($15) monthly for 16 GB of 4G data, with 1000 texts and 500 minutes of talk (which pretty much meant unlimited everything for me). In America I pay $50 a month for my unlimited plan. Yes, the 4G is a little faster, but that may just be because I’m not trying to access the foreign web here…A third area (kinda related to the second) is how the CCP controls markets and prices so everyone can live a comfortable life. I ate a big plate of food at a small restaurant for between 10 and 20 rmb… ($1.25-2.50).

Same thing if you write software for processing home loan applications, you need to fully understand how to process home loan applications.How is the robot to know what the software it writes is to do? You would have to tell it or it would have to interview many of the potential end users who would use the software. This is the most complex part of software development, the part where you figure out EXACTLY what the software should do and general this means being in many meetings with end users and upper management and other engineers. Lots of proposals get presented and most of them shot-down and finally some agreement about the scope of the work and the budget and so on. Robots and AI are not nearly this advanced and we don’t see progress in this direction so it is not “just a matter of time” For this kind of work you’d need a truly human equivalent robot and today that is just “science fiction” and might always remain in the realm of Sci Fi. As I said robots and AI are not headed that way.The kinds of jobs robots will do are those with the most narrow focus where the nature of the work is well defined. Today robots can weld car bodies in car factories and operate paint sprayers. They can assemble electronics and the most advanced robots are those self driving cars.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Will-smartphones-ever-be-replaced-by-more-advanced-technology
