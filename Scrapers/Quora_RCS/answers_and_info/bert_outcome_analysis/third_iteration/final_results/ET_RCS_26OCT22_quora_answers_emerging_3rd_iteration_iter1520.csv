It's hypothesized that the reason humans learn so quickly is that we are fitting new examples into our existing knowledge rather than forming entirely new categories. If we could teach machines to do the same, they would learn exponentially faster and apply that learning more effectively.Transfer learning is a very hot topic in AI research right now, so I expect major breakthroughs in the next few years. I think this may be sufficient to achieve artificial general intelligence, but even if not, it will dramatically extend the range of tasks that machines can accomplish.","58,987 followers",Michael Wolfe,504,2K,17.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-will-the-next-wave-of-technological-microprocessor-based-products-be

These focus a lot on communication and interactivity.What Apple Macintosh and IBM PC Clones did in 70s & 80s is likely to happen in Robotics. Where the hobby, industrial and entertainment use are all likely to get fused with one personal robot with which you can attach many peripherals running on the new era Intel - Aruduino/Raspberry Pi.The single Robot on every living room can help your kids learn programming, can help you play in 3D world, can clean up the home, can help you communicate with your friends & officer workers via holographic calls, can convert voice to text  for basic document management and can connect to your TV to stream. That general purpose robot with a number of optional peripherals [like how our grandfathers bought mouse, keyboard etc] controlled by a handful of large companies is likely to be a major investment driver.This ""computer"" can now be hooked into a 3D printer/scanner, just like how people did 2D printing/scanning 10 years ago, printing even new peripherals, applications or just cool toys for you.All of these technologies are available individually, but they are not connected to an ecosystem like how powerful the PC ecosystem came into place a few decades ago.

He can see inputs from every other soldier, drone, armored vehicle, and tactical sensor in the entire area, with appropriate indicators showing who is friendly, enemy, or unknown. (He also gets a feed from a bore-sighted camera on his weapon, and so can fire around corners without exposing his head.) It’s basically an infantry version of an F-35 pilot’s helmet.The tank commander and driver will have something similar, although probably in the form of flat-panel displays, since tanks bounce around too much for helmet mounted displays, at least so far. He’ll be able to see everything on the battlefield at once, filtered by AI’s so that he doesn’t get overwhelmed. This will increase the coordination between tanks, infantry, and other assets tremendously. Like the Navy’s AEGIS, one vehicle will be able to guide another’s weapons and share targeting information.In addition, the driver gets an upgrade too. Tank and other vehicle drivers are getting wrap-around displays which will let them see what’s going on on all sides of the vehicle, in visible and IR. No more trying to drive through small glass periscopes with a lousy field of view.2) Autonomous armored vehicles.Black Knight Prototype Unmanned Combat VehicleThank you,What you’ll see, in a scheme similar to what the Air Force plans, is one manned tank with a pack of 4 to 6 unmanned vehicles, directing their actions on the battlefield and approving fire missions. They’ll coordinate defensive actions and attack strategies, as well as sharing tactical information.The future is going to be very interesting.",2 followers,Bob Alexander,937,1.7K,4.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-will-the-next-wave-of-technological-microprocessor-based-products-be
7,"Likely not much can change. The tank as a concept is simple and very difficult to do differently and done right. The idea is to have a mobile heavy artillery platform with enough armor to survive most combat situations. The tank is at this point so efficient that it's hard to do differently. Star Wars tried with Walkers, but many people have pointed out that besides for commanding view points, they are impractical when compared to tanks in many ways. So at this point, maybe make it hover instead of with tracks, and better crew survivability. But tanks as we know them right now are at the pointLikely not much can change.

12,"The pretty guaranteed method was when it caught fire.Contrary to some myths, fuel wasn’t an issue (you’ll get folk earnestly claiming the Sherman tank was prone to catching fire because it ran on “volatile jet fuel” while German tanks ran on “fireproof diesel” - both used the same petrol/gasoline). It was common to have to drain the (unburned) fuel tanks of burned-out wrecks.What did burn, lethally, was ammunition: a good penetrating hit on a tank would send red-hot shards of metal flying around inside the tank, and if that hit ammunition hard enough to pierce the brass shell case it could setThe pretty guaranteed method was when it caught fire.Contrary to some myths, fuel wasn’t an issue (you’ll get folk earnestly claiming the Sherman tank was prone to catching fire because it ran on “volatile jet fuel” while German tanks ran on “fireproof diesel” - both used the same petrol/gasoline).

That not only put the tank out of action, but made it pretty much impossible to repair. Hence, where possible, tank and anti-tank gunners were taught to “keep hitting it until it burns”.One reason for the myth of “inflammable Shermans” was that while they were initially no worse than any other tanks for catching fire (and by late 1944, pretty much theGerman and Soviet tanks were more cramped, less easy to escape from (especially the T-34) and so fewer crews survived battle damage: also, Nazi Germany and the USSR shared a low tolerance for complaints, so any suggestion that the Panther might have a flammability problem (it was prone to catching fire even without having been shot!) was likely to end with you facing a field firing squad for “sedition, disloyalty and defeatism”.",534 followers,Alberto Amoruso,546,499,1.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Regarding-tank-technology-where-do-we-move-forward-from-here-Whats-the-next-addition-or-improvement-we-will-see-from-tanks-not-just-larger-gun-or-more-armor

14,"Let’s be clear, AI/ML/NN (artificial intelligences, machine learning and neural nets) are NOT what most people think they are and that’s especially true of the fanboys, purveyors and nominal “experts” in the field.

They don’t understand what they are “selling” at a very fundamental level.Read the below and then re-parse every article you’ve read about AI and decide: is this nonsense? Pretty much all of it is.So the core mistake comes from many people with computer science or engineering degrees WRONGLY believing that the human brain is just a computer.All biological brains absolutely, positively are not a computer and really nothing like a computer. But most AI/ML/NN fanatics make promises implicitly assuming the brain is a computer, and presuming the inverse assumption that: if the brain is a computer, then naturally we can make a computer that is or replaces the human brain.So the first assumption is simply wrong because they know NOTHING about how actual human brains work.The second is a fundamental logic flaw of inverse transitive logic - they misunderstand basic cause and effect.Part of what is so frustrating about this stupid delusion is that we’ve been there before: this is actually “AI 2.0”. We had another prior AI 1.0 when all the same people all made exactly the same mistakes for the same reasons.AI 1.0 presumed that the human brain must a rational, predicate logic-based machine - like a computer almost exactly. AI 1.0 ran from 1960 - 1990. The last hurrah of failure was the 5th generation computer project which failed because it could never work due to the flawed assumptions behind it. We actually tried to build a massive logic inference system with all the “facts” we could think of to drive it and let it go. And nothing happened - intelligence or even some semblance of it did NOT arise spontaneously or even with several prodding with ever larger sticks!AI 2.0 makes the same mistake but now they think that “because we’re using neural nets (only vaguely) like the human brain” that fixes the problem. But it doesn’t.AI 2.0 is pattern matching. Fairly nice pattern matching but not actually superior or ultimate pattern matching. There are major flaws in the pattern matching which has been demonstrated by confusing the recognition of a “cat with a guacamole” - i.e. so such a network the picture of a cat, and it reliably says “that’s a guacamole”.Worse, because of the nature of how NN works, you can’t predict when this will happen, can’t explain why it happen, and can’t prevent it from happening. It’s a “non-unique system” in a mathematical sense so it necessarily can’t be “reverse engineered” to explain how or why it works a particular way. Information loss is central to how they work so the very information required to provide such an explanation is already gone and converted to irreversible heat.So on top of this flawed thinking and model of how they work, a lot of bull-shitty claims are made for AI 2.0 exactly as they did with AI 1.0. This is the “echo” many of us hear and cringe at!And it’s almost exactly like the South Park Gnomes’ Business Plan:This is what AI 1.0 tried to do and it failed. This is what AI 2.0 is doing right now! And it won’t work this time either because it’s based on utterly wrong assumptions starting with the wrong fact: “the human brain is just a computer”. It’s “And you are no more likely to get human intelligence this way as you would if you took all the parts of a 747 jetliner, put them into a box, shook it and actually expected a fully construction 747 to be inside the box! It’s literally “Creationist Thinking”Human intelligence did NOT arise that way, and evolution did not either but Creationists make this argument about evolution. But now for the second time, we are getting AI people implying EXACTLY the same flawed logic, but in reverse. The above South Park business model is Creationism-level, faith-based thinking.Of course, you also have “Singularity” following a similar religious cult type of thinking as well -”By 2045 machines will become intelligence because Moore’s Law”! Except they won’t and not even because Moore’s Law won’t last that long. But again because the brain is not a computer and you can NOT “download your consciousness” like a computer because that’s NOT how memories in your brain work. Not even remotely!! There actually is not “place” where a given memory is stored!!But this the Singularity catechism because it’s religious faith-based thinking not even based on reality or real knowledge about how biology and how brains works. It’s a matter of faith only.And in that way Singularity is a “progress/technology” replacement for Christian salvation and nothing more. Can’t be religion-based because that’s “bad” if you are progressive so let’s find a non-religious, “atheist”, progress, technology way of achieving eternal life because we’re still afraid of death. The inevitability of progress replaces the certainty of the 2nd coming. The “good news” of progress replaces the “good news” of Christ. You will all be saved with eternal life if you have faith in our god-savior - Singularity.It would be sad if it weren’t so pathetic.Now the truth is: religion is wired into our brains precisely because that’s how we evolved. So that makes Singularity especially ironic and sardonically funny at the same time.","9,862 followers",Kenzi Mudge,1.8K,1.3K,8.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-will-the-next-wave-of-technological-microprocessor-based-products-be
