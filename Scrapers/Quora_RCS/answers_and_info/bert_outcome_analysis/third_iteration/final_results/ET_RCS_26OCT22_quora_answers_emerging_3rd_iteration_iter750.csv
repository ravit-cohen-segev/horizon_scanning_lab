She said she could have gotten the job without the masters and that Google liked that she was a generalist who could adapt to changes and they felt she had that “googliness”, meaning she played well with others.PS.

3,"Transfer learning in ML models.Humans are really good at generalizing. We only have to see a few dogs before we can recognize a dog when we see one.Machines are not. ML models require millions of examples before forming a reliable classifier, and that classifier is very specific to the data on which it was trained. If your training data doesn't include dogs with three legs, the model won't recognize them.

It's hypothesized that the reason humans learn so quickly is that we are fitting new examples into our existing knowledge rather than forming entirely new categories. If we could teach machines to do the same, they would learn exponentially faster and apply that learning more effectively.Transfer learning is a very hot topic in AI research right now, so I expect major breakthroughs in the next few years. I think this may be sufficient to achieve artificial general intelligence, but even if not, it will dramatically extend the range of tasks that machines can accomplish.","135,506 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-Google-X-Is-it-an-elite-wing-to-create-the-next-technology-Is-it-the-only-one-of-its-kind-around-Where-do-they-hire-from
4,"Driver-less carsI'm going to spend a lot of words below to convince you that no matter what you've thought about this,Driver-less carsI'm going to spend a lot of words below to convince you that no matter what you've thought about this,Before I do, I need to define the termIn the context of driving, the information horizon is how far, in space and time, one can see, and therefore react to, road conditions, obstructions, and alternatives. Today, in space that horizon is typically (95% of the time? 99%?) 1–3 car lengths in any direction. Depending on speed, that can vary in time between 30 seconds and 1 second.I expand on this at the bottom, but in the interest of getting to the social/economic impact of self-driving vehicles, here’s the TL;DR:I believe the change in information horizon will be the dominant behavior effect of driver-less cars, giving anywhere from 3–6x increase in traffic volume/efficiency possible on existing infrastructure. This will combine with effects others have anticipated to yield a 10x improvement: decreased distances between vehicles at speed and congestion, due to faster response times and more consistent response; higher safe speeds for the same reasons; fewer accidents as a result; comfort withOK, so understanding the fundamentals of how traffic flow will change, these are the social/economic impacts:————————————————“Physics” of traffic flow and the Information Horizon:I’m sure I plagiarized/The driving/traffic information horizon can expand dramatically in space or time. On an empty, straight road, the time horizon can extend out minutes, with maybe not a single car in sight. Cresting a hill or a curve, it is often possible to see traffic conditions for many car lengths and minutes in front. Driving a large truck may allow one to see multiple vehicles (at the cost of reducing the horizon of neighbor drivers). Recent innovations in real-time traffic reporting and display on mobile devices have allowed drivers to extend their “long-term” or “strategic” horizon to miles and significant fractions of an hour. That may allow choosing more optimal routes or at least anticipating a slow-down, but is little help in making realtime, “tactical” driving decisions. Generally, the driving information horizon is a few car lengths and a few seconds, and this is what dominates the emergent behavior of vehicle traffic.For sake of illustration, I’ll draw an analogy toSub-sonic flows speed up as they flow through a constriction (Any driver would recognize fluid shock-waves at a constriction: it’s called a traffic jam. Intuitively, super-sonic flows “choke” because information can’t radiate fast enough toDriver-less vehicles will dramatically increase the “tactical” information horizon of each vehicle by hundreds of seconds and car-lengths:Again, it should be understood that the analogy to fluid flow physics is just that. Bernoulli’s principle is based on conservation of energy within the system, and many forms depend on essentially in-compressible fluids (liquids, gases at low speeds). Vehicle traffic corresponds to more complex forms in which density does increase (bumper-to-bumber traffic, accordion traffic), and more importantly seeks to conserve","16,453 followers",Chris Everett,1.1K,11K,78.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-according-to-you-would-be-the-next-big-thing-in-the-technology-arena
