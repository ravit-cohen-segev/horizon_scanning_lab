It just happens.“Sufficiently advanced technology” looks the same. It operates based on techniques and with materials beyond our imagination. We don’t see a way to integrate the technology into how we think the world works.Thus, whether self-driving cars are magic or just advanced technology cannot be determined by someone unfamiliar with either. They are indistinguishable.","68,788 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-does-any-sufficiently-advanced-technology-is-indistinguishable-from-magic-mean

The apprentice, who isno relation to Donald Trump, but is nonetheless a slave whose life is at the mercyof an all-powerful Lord, dreams of a life of leisure, in which others must toil for him,leaving him free to do as he pleases. He chances upon the Sorcerer’s wand, whichhe wields with aplomb, turning inanimate objects into tireless servants, much likehimself. While they do all the work, the apprentice plays—and, like the ersatz Godthat he has become, rests. Unfortunately, they work overtime, causing catastrophicdamage—a Biblical flood—until the Sorcerer intervenes, shuts off the faucet, and aduly chastened apprentice returns to his chores, sadder but wiser. The moral of thestory is politically reactionary: everyone should “know their place,” not try to “changethe system,” or (to quote H.G. Wells, in “The Invisible Man”) “meddle in things thatman must leave alone.” Yet the reassuring message betrays its own guilt and anxietyover the servile status of (alienated) labor, the ongoing threat of revolution, then andnow, and the lies that those in power tell, simply in order to preserve the status quo.The apprentice learns his lesson, but what about the wand—that is, control over thelives, destinies and resources of society as a whole, and the subordination of massesof people to the will of one individual, or a small group of oligarchs, who alone haveaccess to the means required to make everyone else obey their commands? Goethewent on to write Faust, but the industrial revolution and its aftermath made this thedominant problem of the modern era, not just in Europe or America, but throughoutthe world. Arthur C. Clarke’s “third law” [to which you allude] has that in mind, andother things, besides. What was once a dream or an idle fantasy is now a reality formany of us. We live in a world of remote control gadgets, microwave ovens, andpush-button ease. Although advertising hype exaggerates everything, the ovencleaner that “works like magic” is a perfect example of that—a labor-saving devicethat reduces the time spent on housework, thus liberating us from drudgery andenabling us to do what we enjoy, rather than having to perform irksome tasks orenduring the burdens of endless toil. If sin (the knowledge of good and evil) ledto our expulsion from paradise, then magic, which is the ancestor of science, notits antithesis, promises redemption, and an end to divine punishment altogether(“thou shall be forced to labor by the sweat of thy brow”). Unfortunately, thereis a terrible price to pay for our mastery over nature, and the effortless ease thatmakes advanced technology indistinguishable from magic, even as the sourcesof sorcery stem from similar Greco-Roman, Egyptian, and ancient Chinese roots.The price is abject ignorance, or what Langdon Winner calls “license to forget”(Autonomous Technology, MIT Press, 1977). Not only do we consume ratherthan produce the hitech we use, but we haven’t the foggiest notion of how itworks, be it a computer, a TV set, a ‘cell phone, or a nuclear weapon. Nor dowe care, so long as it does, without fail and without interruption. Nor do wecare how these things came to be, or how things were before they existed—or what would happen to us if they ceased to exist, due to a catastrophe ofsome sort, such as befell the hapless apprentice. Even the Sorcerers don’tknow—the ones who wield the wands are as helpless as we are. They maystart a nuclear war and annihilate the planet, but they wouldn’t know howto create an atomic bomb if their lives depended on it (sic). Ecocide is aslikely (if not more so) than a third World War, yet even the gradual decayof life on earth, or at least the extinction of the human species, seems asuncontrollable, and thus irreversible, as sudden death seemed imminentthroughout the Cold War. Nor are scientists of any help, despite whatThorstein Veblen prophesied (The Instinct of Workmanship, The Place ofScience, The Engineers and the Price System), a century ago. Too manyof them accept (and are complicit in) the regimes they serve, or else are“apolitical,” which means, devoid of conscience and thus of commitment.usefulness, and for much the same reason. The Frankenstein effect (witha bow toward Mary Shelley) and the cunning of dialectic (as Hegel put it)have combined to make magic everything we once feared it was, not assupernatural, let alone as mere superstition, but as all-too-human, anddeadlier than anything that Mickey, Walt or even Goethe ever imagined.Clarke’s “third law” is a warning, much as Asimov’s “third law of robotics”was, in science fiction. The parallel with Newton is obvious, but it is notmerely an analogy—it is also a grim pantomime of the human condition.For the more we conquer nature, the less we master ourselves. Don’tfire the apprentice; he is already chained to a rock, without knowing it.Better to abort the mission than to make the galaxy safe for mummies,wandering through time and eternity as untethered, cryogenic babies.Instead, teach Prometheus that freedom and responsibility go hand-in-hand, and that labor without leisure is blind, while leisure without laboris empty. Caliban thanked Prospero for teaching him speech, that hemight curse his enslaved state. Prospero, wiser but sadder, abjuredmagic, drowned his books, and made every third thought his grave.Fortunately, Ishamel lived to tell the tale, and transcend the tyrannyof military-industrial sorcery, on land and sea.","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,631,1.5K,2.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-does-any-sufficiently-advanced-technology-is-indistinguishable-from-magic-mean

Pretty short of a time, really, if you think about it on evolutionary scales.We started out with the most basic of laws there were. Stuff like an eye for an eye kind of things. The Code of Ur-Nammu contains some pretty basic stuff, being the first set of written laws that we know of, as of the Sumerians. The very first thing on it is that, if a man commits murder, he is to be killed. It also has some things about adultery on there, like if a man sleeps with another man’s wife before the husband gets to, basically stealing her virginity, the man is to be killed, but if a wife abandons her husband for another man, then the woman is to be killed.It’s pretty primitive stuff and not exactly what we’d call moral, much less ethical, by today’s standards.From there we move onto Hammurabi's Code, and it starts having more nuanced laws regarding things like trade, slander, and even some surprisingly reasonable stuff about divorce.Moving through time, new things were added, we abolished slavery in most of the modern world, rape’s pretty much the worst crime you can commit now, we no longer have laws about witchcraft, western countries at least don’t kill people for being gay, and we’re constantly updating and revising our laws in general.This has been ongoing pretty much since society began. Heck, you can even look back to the writings we’ve found from Pompeii which shows people complaining about how immoral the young kids are… but the thing is, this means morals are changing over time. What people used to consider abhorrent and worthy of the death penalty, is now considered to be a minor transgression. Petty theft like stealing a loaf of bread to survive isn’t met with execution or having your hand cut off anymore for instance.Even just in the last century, we’ve decided, as a society, that lobotomies aren’t to be handed out to just anyone at the slightest provocation, and we’ve come a long way in dealing with mental illness overall. Some things go up, some go down, and it largely depends upon your perspective as well: our “modern, progressive societies” would look at ancient societies as barbarians, while those same societies would look at ours as hedonistic immoral heathens. The biggest difference is our laws and overall values are much more firmly rooted in logic and ethics, which can be reproduced logically and consistently applied, whereas morals are much more flexible based upon the individual society and its circumstances.Democracy’s still a fairly new idea, as are things like freedom of speech, freedom of religion and other such fundamental things many first world countries now rely upon.So yeah, our sociological technology has advanced drastically over time, and one might even be able to make a pretty reasonable claim that it’s advanced even faster than our more traditional technology. For as fast as computers and such have gained in processing power, our ability to communicate our ideas has jumped ahead even faster. Quora is a sociological technology, just as wikipedia is, or online education in general.You could also argue we’ve slid backwards in some ways, such as how when you had to write a letter by hand and deliver it by horseback, it meant something! Then you got them newfandangled trains where they could ship tons of letters at a time! Then telegraphs! Phones! Instant messaging services! Cell phones! Text messages! …Well, admittedly “lol, can I haz cheezburgr?” doesn’t sound that impressive, but it’s actually an increase in efficiency in communication. Memes and internet shorthand are both forms of technology which allow for vastly more accurate communication of ideas in a shorter span of time. This is us moving closer to the ideal form of communication. You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like. =PThe point is, no, we really aren’t stagnant sociologically, and even most of the things that you might think is us moving backwards, is usually a step forwards. Sometimes, yeah, the pendulum swings too far and we get hit with a classic over-correction on some topics, but for the most part, we’re actually moving ahead sociologically quite well.Of course, if you don’t agree with me, I could just have you executed. …Oh wait, I can’t. Because we advanced sociologically far enough that I can’t do that. Well, turns out that’s even more proof I’m right.",2 followers,Himanshu Chavhan,20.4K,71,659.8K,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-does-any-sufficiently-advanced-technology-is-indistinguishable-from-magic-mean

There is no analog of Science Fiction for “Social Fiction” except that provided within Science Fiction.Poor Understanding of Political and Economic InterdependenceAdam Smith studied Social Philosophy which was an amalgamation of our current social sciences. The evidence for these Social Sciences has largely been observational and limited to what a single human or small team can observe. I believe that “big data” will enable much larger, more longitudinal studies and demonstrate the interdependence of social, political and economic systems.Educational Systems Built for the Industrial AgeAt a social-psychology level we’re still (mostly) training people the same way we were 70 years ago. We “indoctrinate” our youth through education. Some of this is good: skills like reading, writing and basic mathmatical understanding, getting along with others. Within the structure of these institutions is also a current of obedience to authority. I propose that the That’s why we still see the Milgram experiment replicated today (We Are Still Making ProgressWe continue to form bigger and bigger (working) cities.

25,"For the foreseeable future, I think the two fields will stay separate due to three reasons: cultural differences, power/control issues, and regulation.Cultural DifferencesCulturally speaking, actuaries tend to have a more measured and cautious mindset, which is largely driven by the nature of their work i.e. managing risk & uncertainty. Data scientists, however, tend to have a more embracing and free-spirited mindset.

Just witness how quickly data scientists adopt the latest techniques from the machine learning world, while actuaries are only starting to test out the older and more-established machine learning techniques. Neither mindset is inherently better than the other, but bridging them will definitely be a challenge.Power/Control IssuesThe second problem has to do with power and control. Actuaries command tremendous power and respect in their domain. In insurance firms, they’re treated like royalty. Actuaries have their own professional organizations where they get to set the future path of their field. Actuaries are also proud of the special recognition that only comes from years of arduous examinations. So why would they give all this up just to become one of the many sub-categories of data science, especially since data science is not even that well-defined yet?RegulationAnd speaking of the exams, we now have the third issue. While anyone can call themselves a data scientist, only individuals who’ve passed all the actuarial exams and misc. requirements could be considered a certified actuary. This matters because by law only certified actuaries are allowed to sign off on certain regulated items such as rate changes in car insurance. In contrast, there’s no regulatory requirements or standardization in the data science field, at least not yet. So again, I don’t see how the two fields can easily merge any time soon.ConclusionTo sum it up, although actuarial science and data science overlap in certain areas, many fundamental differences between the two fields will keep them apart for the foreseeable future. In the meantime, each field will gladly borrow ideas and best practices from the other.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-does-any-sufficiently-advanced-technology-is-indistinguishable-from-magic-mean

Actuaries are key players in management teams that help businesses plan for the future. The ideal candidate would have strong mathematics, analytics, problem solving skills, as well as knowledge of business practices and computer science, and an understanding of human behavior.Actuaries are at the heart of the insurance industry. Experts in statistics, business and finance, actuaries use their knowledge to assess risk in order to formulate policies and minimize costs of risk for the insurance industry.Data is the essence of the job of an actuary, as they gather, assemble and analyze information to estimate the probability and likely costs of events such as death, sickness, injury, disability, or loss of property. Those choosing an actuary career use data in such areas as pension and other retirement asset management; home, automobile and other areas of the insurance industry. Their expertise is essential in helping insurance companies design coverage plans, and in helping a wide spectrum of companies decide how they should invest their assets in order to maximize returns and minimize risks to those investments.Through their knowledge of statistics, finance, and business, actuaries assess the risk of events occurring and help create policies for businesses and clients that minimize the cost of that risk. For this reason, actuaries are essential to the insurance industry.Actuaries analyze data to estimate the probability and likely cost to the company of an event such as death, sickness, injury, disability, or loss of property. Actuaries also address financial matters, such as how a company should invest resources to maximize return on investments, or how an individual should invest in order to attain a certain retirement income level. Using their expertise in evaluating various types of risk, actuaries help design insurance policies, pension plans, and other financial strategies in a manner which will help ensure that the plans are maintained on a sound financial basis.Most actuaries are employed in the insurance industry, specializing in either property and casualty insurance or life and health insurance. They use sophisticated modeling techniques to forecast the likelihood of certain events occurring, and the impact these events will have on claims and potential losses for the company. For example, property and casualty actuaries calculate the expected number of claims resulting from automobile accidents, which varies depending on the insured person's age, sex, driving history, type of car, and other factors. Actuaries ensure that the premium charged for such insurance will enable the company to cover potential claims and other expenses. This premium must be profitable, yet competitive with other insurance companies.Within the life and health insurance fields, actuaries help companies develop health and long-term-care insurance policies by predicting the likelihood of occurrence of heart disease, diabetes, stroke, cancer, and other chronic ailments among a particular group of people who have something in common, such as living in a certain area or having a family history of illness. Such work of actuaries can be beneficial to both the consumer and the company because the ability to accurately predict the likelihood of a particular health event among a certain group ensures that premiums are assessed fairly based on the risk to the company. Additionally, life insurance actuaries help companies develop annuity and life insurance policies for individuals by estimating how long someone is expected to live.Actuaries in other financial service industries manage credit and help set a price for corporate security offerings. They also devise new investment tools to help their firms compete with other companies. Pension actuaries work under the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974 which sets minimum standards for pension and health plans in private industry. Actuaries working for the government help manage social programs such as Social Security and Medicare.Actuaries help determine corporate policy on risk, for example, and also help explain complex technical matters to company executives, government officials, shareholders, policyholders, or the general public. They may testify before public agencies on proposed legislation that affects their businesses or explain changes in contract provisions to customers. They also may help companies develop plans to enter new lines of business or new geographic markets by forecasting demand in competitive settings.Consulting actuaries provide advice to clients on a contract basis. The duties of most consulting actuaries are similar to those of other actuaries. For example, some may evaluate company pension plans by calculating the future value of employee and employer contributions and determining whether the amounts are sufficient to meet the future needs of retirees. Others help companies reduce their insurance costs by offering them advice on how to lessen the risk of injury on the job. Consulting actuaries sometimes testify in court regarding the value of potential lifetime earnings of a person who is disabled or killed in an accident, the current value of future pension benefits (in divorce cases), or other values arrived at by complex calculations. Some actuaries work in reinsurance, a field in which one insurance company arranges to share a large prospective liability policy with another insurance company in exchange for a percentage of the premium.Work EnvironmentEducation & Training RequiredIncreasingly, companies are requiring potential employees to have passed the initial actuarial exam described in the next section, which tests an individual’s proficiency in mathematics—including calculus, probability, and statistics before being hired.Beginning actuaries often rotate among different jobs in an organization, such as marketing, underwriting, financial reporting and product development, to learn various actuarial operations and phases of insurance work. At first, they prepare data for actuarial projects or perform other simple tasks. As they gain experience, actuaries may supervise clerks, prepare correspondence, draft reports, and conduct research. They may move from one company to another early in their careers as they advance to higher positions.Certifications Needed (Licensure)Four of the first seven exams in the SOA and CAS examination series are jointly sponsored by the two societies and cover the same material. For this reason, students do not need to commit themselves to a specialty until they have taken the initial examination, which tests an individual's competence in mathematics and helps evaluate their potential as actuaries. If candidates pass the initial exam, prospects can begin taking the next series of exams with the help of self-study guides and courses. Those who pass two or more examinations have better opportunities for employment at higher starting salaries than those who do not. These initial exams can be taken while the candidate is still in college.Many candidates find work as an actuary immediately after graduation and work through the certification process while gaining some experience in the field. In fact, many employers pay the examination fees and provide their employees time to study. As actuaries pass exams, they are often rewarded with a pay increase. Despite the fact that employers are supportive during the exam process, home study is necessary and many actuaries study for months to prepare for each exam.The process for gaining certification in the Casualty Actuarial Society is predominantly exam-based. To reach the first level of certification, the Associate or ACAS level, a candidate must complete seven exams, attend one course on professionalism and complete the coursework in applied statistics, corporate finance, and economics required by both the SOA and CAS. This process generally takes from 4 to 8 years. The next level, the Fellowship, or FCAS level, requires passing two additional exams in advanced topics, including investment and assets and dynamic financial analysis and the valuation of insurance. Most actuaries reach the fellowship level 2 to 3 years after attaining Associate status.The certification process of the Society of Actuaries blends exams with computer learning modules and coursework. After taking the initial exams, candidates must choose a specialty—group and health benefits, individual life and annuities, retirement benefits, investments or finance/enterprise risk management. To reach the Associate or ASA level, a candidate must complete the initial five exams, the coursework in applied statistics, corporate finance, and economics required by the SOA and CAS, eight computer modules with two subsequent essays, and a seminar in professionalism. This process generally takes from 4 to 8 years. To attain the Fellowship or FSA level, a candidate must pass two additional exams within a chosen specialty and must complete three computer modules, a seminar in professionalism, and a course in fellowship admissions. Attaining Fellowship status usually takes an additional 2 to 3 years after becoming an Associate.Specific requirements apply to pension actuaries, who verify the financial status of defined benefit pension plans for the Federal Government. These actuaries must be enrolled by the Joint Board of the U.S. Treasury Department and the U.S. Department of Labor for the Enrollment of Actuaries. To qualify for enrollment, applicants must meet certain experience requirements and pass two exams administered by the SOA, as stipulated by the Board.Other Skills Required (Other qualifications)To perform their duties effectively, actuaries must keep up with current economic and social trends and legislation, as well as developments in health, business, and finance that could affect insurance or investment practices.Source: www.studentscholarships.org",0 followers,Hatice Aslan,570,164,11.7M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-does-any-sufficiently-advanced-technology-is-indistinguishable-from-magic-mean
