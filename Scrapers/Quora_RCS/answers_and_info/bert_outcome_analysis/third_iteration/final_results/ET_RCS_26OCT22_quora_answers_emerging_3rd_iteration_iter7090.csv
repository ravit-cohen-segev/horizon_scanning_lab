All your doctor record files, your id‘s, your birth paper and many more things could be available at one place for ever and safe.Only you would have the ability to see them, because of your private keys.

Now add authentication to your Todo app by incorporating passport.7. Protect your routes and make sure the Todos belong to the individual user.You have now built the framework on which to build the rest of your web apps.

They have large companies and (in the case of meteor) venture capitalists funding them. They are not there to help YOU they are there to help themselves make money. Don't become dependent on them.

Even if you could somehow extract the “state” information of the cells, unless you had all the information pertaining to what those cells did in the broad perspective of their function you would not be extracting a “memory”. You’d only be extracting neuronal response-pattern information.Is it possible that we might be able to “see” and localize a memory as it functions? That is, see that a very specific part of the brain is active during the memory? Perhaps - though we are not close to that. This would require great advancements in scanning technology. The trouble would be separating the neuronal activity patterns that represented the memory versus those that represented the reactions to the memory, and other brain activity going on independent of the memory - all of which would be going on concurrently.Is it possible to “erase” a specific memory? Yes, possible - but probably very tricky and dangerous. It would be possible (as in one of the other answers to this question) to destroy very small parts of the brain. If that activity were lucky it might “erase” a memory and not destroy other important information. However, isn’t there a simpler path? Humans have been both forgetting and getting over negative experiences since the species began.

She told me I was the love of her life, and I believed her.And yet, here we are.Sometimes, I wish I could forget her.If there's anything I learned from the movie in the picture above (Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind), it’s that you're not supposed to forget the people you once loved, even if it hurts to not forget them.You’re supposed to learn from them.This sounds nice in a self-help-esque Quora answer, but it’s really hard to do in reality.My ex who I broke up with last year was the first woman who I really loved. It was the first time I really loved a person who isn’t my mom, my dad, or my sister. I know I really loved her because still, after everything we went through, I can’t hate her or even be mad at her.I know I loved her because I kept trying to convince myself that I wasn’t in love.This love was a neurochemical hijacking in a way I had never experienced before, and though the breakup was more than a year ago now, I still miss her a lot.I’ve dated other people since her, but I still miss her. “There are plenty of fish in the sea”, but I miss her.I would take her back right now, even though doing it would be a horrible decision. Even though taking her back would destroy my mental health, drain the life out of me, and break me down, I know that if she showed up at my doorstep I couldn’t resist her.I think that’s love.I’m only 24 and I don’t know that much, but I don’t think love is always rational.I loved this girl so damn much, and I’ll probably never see her again.I probably shouldn't ever see her again.She was sweet and sensitive, yet strong and determined. She had the duality and complexity that I’ve always craved in a partner, and I miss that so much.But she also had this dark side that terrified me. She changed a lot in the time we were together, and eventually, we grew apart.We grew apart, but that doesn’t mean I lost the memories.For a long time, I wanted the “spotless mind”, just like in the movie.I still remember when she held me one December afternoon in Milwaukee and made me feel like I didn’t have to fight my way through every moment of my life anymore. I still remember when we would sit together on Saturday afternoons after Jiu-Jitsu training and read together. I still remember when we went on drives and talked about Nietzsche, Buddha, and Viktor Frankl.I still miss that stuff, but it’s gone now.Anyway—sorry for my sob story.The point I’m trying to make is that sometimes I wish I could just rip these memories out of my head so that I didn’t have to miss this girl who probably doesn’t even think about me anymore.That’s probably the part that hurts the most. I’m sure she’s moved on.I moved on too, but sometimes it doesn’t feel that way.This past breakup forced me to change the way that I approach moving on.In the past, I’d breakup with someone and drown myself in work and training to forget them, just long enough until I stumbled upon the next girl who I could go through the same toxic cycles with.This past breakup cut me so deep that I had to actually grow. I couldn’t lie anymore.I had to forgive her for hurting me. I had to forgive myself for not being good enough and not knowing enough. I had to forgive all parties involved, but I never forgot any of what happened.The ending hurt so bad that I had no choice but to carefully analyze each mistake each of made so that I could ensure that it wouldn...","358,996 followers",Sean Kernan,2.4K,5.6K,727.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Should-we-not-develop-a-technology-for-erasing-memories

It was an AC semi-sleeper and the seats looked something like this(Image source: Google)The bus was full. I also found a senior of my college in the same bus but a little away from my seat. We greeted each other with smiles. A lady with a small kid was sitting beside me. There was a 25–28-year-old man, and an uncle sitting behind me.The time was something around 1:00 AM, I covered myself completely with the blanket and I was in a deep sleep. Suddenly I felt something was being pressed against my lungs so hard that I started feeling difficulty in breathing. I then woke up to see what it was and found a hand on my breast. I was horrified and pulled that hand out and held it real tight to confirm that it was a hand and I was groped by the man behind me. The man managed to pull his hand back from my hands. I wanted to shout with the loudest voice I could but words weren't coming out of my mouth. It took 5 seconds for me to come back to my senses. I then shouted “What the heck do you think about yourself? What’s the matter with you??” The man behind me was resting his head on my seat till then and after I said this, he leaned back. I was continuously shouting, I don't remember what I exactly said but I remember mentioning that I will complain about his behaviour. Then the uncle beside him asked him what the matter was. The man just replied, “Nothing uncle, she is simply creating a scene”. And then the uncle went back to sleep without giving a damn about anything and didn't even bother asking me or listening to me. With his reply to the uncle, my anger grew and asked “Seriously??? You just tou..” and before I could complete the sentence, that man interrupted saying “What did I do? Why are you simply shouting at me? Stop creating a scene!!” I was all numb as I didn’t expect such a reply. I was looking around if anyone at least would bother asking me what happened. Nothing like that!! They were all just ignoring me as if I don't exist including the lady beside me. They were just doing their work. Even the senior! I didn’t want to leave the situation there. I kept shouting. After some time, my senior thought of involving and told that man, “Look, if you have done something wrong, just apologize her. Don’t shout back at her.” in their regional language. (I am not from that place, but I can understand that language). The man replied “Brother, we both belong to the same state. This lady is simply yelling at me in English”. The senior then said, “It’s not about belonging to the same place, if you have done something wrong, apologize to her”. That man reluctant to even apologize me, just changed his seat.I cried all night that day on the bus. I was traumatized by that incident. Every time I travel alone, I remember that day. I couldn’t believe that people around me didn’t even bother to ask me about the situation. I felt I was fighting alone. The trust in the society broke that day. I understood that I should be bold enough to fight for myself and there will be none to help me. I haven’t shared this with anyone including my parents as I am scared that they might not let me travel alone. I am sure that they will travel along with me to the college (telling that they want to see the college) or make sure that I am with my friends and not alone. I will never forget that night! I still regret that I wasn’t able to teach that man a correct lesson.EDIT 1: As per the comments, many are thinking I have mentioned the college tag for publicity, but it’s not for that. I wanted to tell that, me being well educated and knowing how to raise my voice, I was still unable to do anything that day. I believe could have done a lot more. But I didn’t. It was my first experience and maybe I was too scared as I was travelling alone and wasn’t sure if I could protect myself if he had done something violent.EDIT 2: Thank you all for your overwhelming responses. I will surely be bold and will act accordingly next time. :)","1,896 followers",Jalon Fonseca,21.7K,485,5.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Should-we-not-develop-a-technology-for-erasing-memories

So realistically, the only way we can extend our lifespan as a race beyond that of Earth's capability to sustain a welcoming environment is to spread around.From what we know today, we most likely will never break the speed of light as this is fundamentally impossible within our understanding of the physics. Even if we got to within a certain percentage of it, it would still not allow journeys to other star systems such as alpha centauri to be short enough for a reasonable human lifespan. However, we could potentially circumvent this problem by actually bringing these distant places closer to us. By compressing spacetime in front of us and expanding it behind us through devices such as warp drives we would essentially move space around to get closer to these places. A good analogy is that of these walking treadmills in airports. You yourself are not walking faster but the ground under your feet carries you as it moves. This could bring other stars within a few weeks of travel without violating any laws of physics.Amazingly, Dr Sonny White is looking into this at NASA. Initially, to enable such a device amounts of energy equivalent to Jupiter were expected to be required. However, by attributing a toroidal shape to the spacecraft and some other more complex energy dynamics and oscillations, Dr White managed to reduce this amount to 700 kgs... of exotic matter.

Or biology.Science only makes headway when it rules out ""acts of God"" in its causal stream. That (in my thought) does not reflect whether or not there is a God, and whether or not He acts -just that positing His action short circuits scientific thinking, it presents an easy off-ramp from hard problems, and keeps us from following them out all the way to answers.I think it is not a question of definite points of advance that would have been hindered, but that the methodology of science as a whole would be compromised.","14,900 followers",Krister Sundelin,1.2K,23.8K,89.8M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-practical-example-of-use-of-the-Blockchain-and-Distributed-Ledger-Technology-in-developing-countries
17,"Q: Who still believes in Darwinian evolution?A: Creationists.At least, they believe that science is stuck at as it was 160-ish years ago.In the real world, school kids are taught the Modern Synthesis of Evolution – you know, the one that combined Darwin’s theory with Mendelian genetics and the discovery of DNA as gene carriers – already in school.But since creationists has a hang-up on prophet-like authority figures, they never left Darwin’s 160-year old theory, and since they never listened in science classes in school, they kinda missed that the rest of the world moved on.",0 followers,Claire Jordan,1K,45.6K,295.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-full-stack-JavaScript-framework-should-I-learn-For-14-years-I-have-used-Microsoft-technology-stack-for-web-development-I-believe-its-time-now-to-shift-to-full-stack-JavaScript-development
18,"Can you make me believe in evolution?No. If you think evolution is something to believe in like your religion, not something you accept because it’s the most plausible explanation for the origin of species, there is nothing I can say, no argument I can provide that will convince you. Your position simply is not based on rational argument and therefore cannot be changed by rational argument.","220,635 followers",Franklin Veaux,7.8K,47.3K,783.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Should-we-not-develop-a-technology-for-erasing-memories

It works and the search is only directed by the fact that least adapted algorithms are discarded everything else is ideally just random.","3,412 followers",Louis Vaught,4.8K,1.2K,13.5M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Should-we-not-develop-a-technology-for-erasing-memories
