That moment may finally be arriving. Could that be a good thing?”Advanced technologies are developed that can benefit mankindBut these facts can’t be like that, I have feeling likeFuturists and science-fiction writers have at times looked forward to machines’ workplace takeover with a kind of giddy excitement, imagining the banishment of drudgery and its replacement by expansive leisure and almost limitless personal freedom. And make no mistake: if the capabilities of computers continue to multiply while the price of computing continues to decline, that will mean a great many of life’s necessities and luxuries will become ever cheaper, and it will mean great wealth—at least when aggregated up to the level of the national economy.I see the advances happening in technology and it’s becoming evident that computers, machines, robots, and algorithms are going to be able to do most of the routine, repetitive types of jobs. That’s the essence of what machine learning is all about. What types of jobs are on some level fundamentally predictable? A lot of different skill levels fall into that category. It’s not just about lower-skilled jobs either. People with college degrees, even professional degrees, people like lawyers are doing things that ultimately are predictable. A lot of those jobs are going to be susceptible over time.Right now there’s still a lot of debate over it. There are economists who think it’s totally wrong, that problems really stem from things like globalization or the fact that we’ve wiped out unions or haven’t raised the minimum wage. Those are all important, but I tend to believe that technology is a bigger issue, especially as we look to the future.Will this be seen Like this????",UNKNOWN,DurgaPrasad (దుర్గా ప్రసాద్),546,183,3.5M,2017,https://www.quora.com/When-radically-advanced-technologies-are-developed-that-can-benefit-mankind-are-they-likely-not-available-for-the-general-population

3,"Well, there are, but they tend to become roadkill under the wheels of change. I remember, back at the start of the computer revolution, there were large numbers of people who resisted their introduction. The problem from their company’s perspective was that computers reduced costs dramatically, so the people who resisted change had to go.There were large numbers of managers who insisted they had to have a secretary do their typing and filing.

I remember, back at the start of the computer revolution, there were large numbers of people who resisted their introduction. The problem from their company’s perspective was that computers reduced costs dramatically, so the people who resisted change had to go.There were large numbers of managers who insisted they had to have a secretary do their typing and filing. To save costs, the company got rid of all the secretaries. To replace them, they gave the managers computer terminals. When they objected that they didn’t know how to type or file, the company told them they had a choice between learning to use the computer or taking early retirement. Many found themselves taking early retirement.Nowadays, of course, everyone has a smartphone that can do just as much as an early supercomputer, and they use it all the time, so the information revolution has happened and nobody can live without it any more.In wartime, resisting technological change leads to defeat. Having big, thick walls didn’t work that well for Constantinople when the Ottoman Turks brought their new-fangled gunpowder cannons. Having smooth-bore muskets when the enemy had Springfield rifles with 10 times the range didn’t work that well for Robert E. Lee at Gettysburg. Having fixed fortresses on the Maginot Line when the enemy could just drive around them in tanks didn’t work that well for the French when the Germans invaded in WW2. Having more powerful M14 rifles based on the old WW2 M1 didn’t help the US troops much in Vietnam when the Viet Cong had the new Russian AK-47 assault rifles.Neo-Luddites would like to return to the better days of yesteryear, but I was there and it was pretty bad back then. They want to live off the grid, but I lived off the grid when I was young, and it wasn’t that great carrying buckets of water from the well, using kerosene lamps, and running to the outhouse at 40 below. Eating free range chicken eggs was okay, but chopping the head off your free range chicken and watching it run around in circles before it bleeds out so you can give it to your sisters to pluck and cook on the coal stove wasn’t that good.My old school, which they turned into a museum with dummy students.No running water, a coal furnace the teacher had to stoke, and outhouses out back you had to go to at 40 below. Our sports facilities consisted of swings. We could also play Anti-I-Over on the barn: The object of the game is to throw a ball over the roof of the barn yelling “Anti-I-Over”. Less privileged schools didn’t have a barn for the student’s horses.No, computer learning is much better these days. Kids learn computers very fast.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/When-radically-advanced-technologies-are-developed-that-can-benefit-mankind-are-they-likely-not-available-for-the-general-population

Do you think that the US politicians are willing to lose out on all that cash they get handed by big business and other special interest groups? Of course not…they will charge in and claim some non-existent aggression to try and keep china down. Take for example the US torture camps of Guantanamo and abu gharib…this is of course not a problem, to the US…nor is the US invading numerous foreign countries and killing around a million civilians…what matters is the “genocide” of ulghers…although no muslim country is calling it that..and in fact, numerous muslim countries have gone and inspected the palace and claim the opposite of the US…but that hasn’t stopped the US from pushing the propaganda and boycotting the Olympics, and building up its navy on China’s shores, and whatever, now has it?",UNKNOWN,Ernest W.

5,"War is being automated. That means you need fewer and fewer people over time.During WWII, for example, to take out all of the key strategic targets in a certain area might require that 6 bombers fly by and (rather inaccurately) drop their payloads, each bomber carrying a crew of 4–6 men.Today, a single drone piloted remotely by one fat guy eating donuts could do the same and accomplish the mission with greater precision.Don't get me wrong.

Armies still need well trained professionals to expertly wield high-value assets at maximum efficiency and to repair complicated malfunctions. The human factor will not disappear anytime in the next 30 years at least. But yesterday's “war of the barely literate masses” has morphed into “war of the few”.Those few people need specialized training and skillsets. There are many roles that your average high school dropout or liberal arts major could not fill. For that matter, those who get the job demand to be very well compensated.For all intents and purposes, the average guy is unemployable so far as the army is concerned. He'd bring too little to the table and cost too much to keep around. And that's a good thing, because it means the draft probably isn't coming back.","66,675 followers",Dima Vorobiev,1.7K,4.2K,139M,2021,https://www.quora.com/When-radically-advanced-technologies-are-developed-that-can-benefit-mankind-are-they-likely-not-available-for-the-general-population
