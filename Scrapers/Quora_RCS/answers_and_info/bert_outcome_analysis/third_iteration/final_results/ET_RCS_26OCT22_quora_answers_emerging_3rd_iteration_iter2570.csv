Of course we had a good Wifi, cable TV, etc. I had told him before many things about ‘60s and ‘70s.

At the beginning of the ‘70s we had only one TV in my family (of course black and white), in Spain we only had two TV channels, of course, we didn’t have computers, mobiles, etc.But after listening to his question, I told him one thing that made him frown. When I was a kid, we could travel between Paris and New York in three hours and a half (if you had enough money to buy a ticket). You could take a Concorde at 9am in Paris and you could land in New York at 6:30 am local time, with a flight time duration of 3.30 hours. Today, if you want to fly to New York from Paris, the average duration of your flight would be 7.30 hours. Then I told him that the Concorde was designed in the 50s and 60s and her first flight was in March 1969. Here you can see a photo of this first flight:So in the XX century, there was a plane which needed less time to fly from Europe to America than another one in the XXI (at least until now).Then I showed him another airplanes that were designed in the ‘50s and ‘60s and began to fly in ‘60s-’70s:1.- A Boeing 747 the biggest airplane in history (passengers of course) until the arrival of Airbus A380:2.- An outstanding Blackbird; one of the fastest airplanes in history:3.- The Grumman F14:And Finally the superb Saturn V rocket -- the most powerful in history until the SLS begins to fly in the following years.So in the 1960s aeronautics and space engineering lived their golden era. Why? Because NASA had something more important than technology: political will and a lot of money to spend. If the same effort would have been maintained for 50 years, we would have had a Lunar Base, and another one in Mars already.",0 followers,Francisco Muñoz,9.8K,67,267.2K,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-were-we-able-to-put-a-man-on-the-moon-with-the-level-of-technology-that-was-available-in-1969-Did-NASA-have-advanced-technologies-that-were-just-not-made-public

Very few scientific discoveries were required. Isaac Newton taught us all of the physics we needed to know to get to the moon and back. The calculus necessary to calculate the trajectory of a rocket that is accelerating while rapidly losing mass is complicated, but still pretty much what Newton taught us. Nearly every time you hear a question in the form of, “If we can send men to the moon why can’t we…” the ellipses (…) is filled in with a required invention. Curing cancer, or the common cold or achieving world peace are far more difficult. GPS technology is also more difficult since it requires the relativity that Einstein taught us in addition to the physics of motion.The major invention of the Apollo program was the silicon chip that allowed a rudimentary computer small enough to send into space. That was a huge invention from which we are still reaping benefits. The standard computers of that time literally filled up a room. (I worked with one of them until 1992. When it was retired, the memory cards were put on display. An 8 KB card was about 8 x 10 inches. With a 10X loupe, you could see the individual ferrite collar bits.)The other major factor was, as C. Stuart Hardwick stated, “spending a crap ton of money over ten years.” We also marshaled our best and brightest engineers and scientists for the task. I remember going with my parents to a PTA meeting at our grade school where a neighbor asked if we had the facilities to teach our children the science we need to beat the Russians to the moon. Beating the Russians to the moon in the 1960s was just as important as defeating Hitler in the 1940s.Edit: Thanks for the upvotes. The following started as a reply to a comment.I’m not sure I would agree we were more risk-tolerant in those days. We were definitely less risk-aware.

And by relying as much as possible on already proven technology, which isn’t as “high-tech” as you think (more on that below).Q: Did NASA have advanced technologies that were just not made public?Not really. TheyHere are a few examples of how the technology came to be:By the way. NASA wasn’t created to send people to the moon. It was created to assist American aerospace businesses and, in matters of aeronautical or space, the American public and all mankind.The reason we could build a LEM of composites today…the reason Boeing can build a jumbo jet of composites today—is in part because NASA paid to have those materials characterized so they could use them on the payload bay doors of the shuttle. And the reason today’s space entrepreneurs can show off their fancy propulsive landing systems is—in large part—because NASA paid a lot of money to essentially create the practice of Computational Fluid Dynamics, without which neither the shuttle nor these modern wonders could have flown.We went to the moon with what was, at the time, cutting edge, custom-made, sometimes poorly understood, often barely adequate technology. The basic science hasn’t changed much since, but our manufacturing ability has grown by leaps and bounds—in part due to the spur it received from Apollo and the last fifty years of refinement.I said above that the technology that took us to the moon isn’t as advanced as you might think. I mentioned carbon composites and robotic welders and the heavy inertial platform and computer, and the WWII rubber bladders. Apollo also used parabolic dish antennas, both in space and on the ground, though newer ground antennas typically use the more efficient offset Gregorian configuration and spacecraft now often use fractal antennas—which were originally designed for cell phones.[Apollo CSM with quad parabolic high gain antenna by engine and simitar VHF antenna (white) mid-way between and behind thruster quads.][Offset Gregorian radio telescope.]",UNKNOWN,Ernest W.

Both the USA and USSR poured countless billions of dollars into impressing the world, to demonstrate to others the validity of our beliefs. And some of that money went to both country’s space programs.Because at the end of the day putting a man on the Moon isn’t all that difficult. It’s just a series of engineering problems. Build a rocket big enough to leave the atmosphere. Build crew quarters that can let the astronauts survive in space. Build a lunar lander that can escape the Moon’s gravity. Etc…Each step in the space race, from putting a satellite into space, to docking two vessels together, to orbiting the Moon, was a step towards Apollo 11. The lessons we learned from one step made the next one possible.The real difficulty wasn’t the technology, it was the cost. Altogether the Apollo program cost 25.4 billion dollars, or 152 billion in today’s money. Just the Saturn V rocket cost 1.23 billion dollars in today’s money each time you wanted to launch it.Even if it was legal, the general public just can’t build a rocket that big.Of course, NASA did need to develop new technologies to make all this possible. And many of these technologies were eventually made available to the general public.

So a surprising number of the Apollo spacecraft’s critical parts ended up being crafted and assembled by hand, by a vast battalion of little-known and little-heralded workers back on earth.Such ingenuity was mandatory during the Cold War era. As the U.S. and Soviet Union engaged in a tense battle for global supremacy, the goal of being the first superpower to plant a flag on the moon gave the Apollo mission added geopolitical urgency. The Soviets had made the first big splash in space with Sputnik, and then launching the first astronaut Yuri Gagarin. President John F. Kennedy wanted America to re-establish its reputation for leadership in science, technology and engineering. The fact that something wasn’t easily manufactured didn’t slow anyone down.Herein, some of the more vivid examples of cutting-edge spaceflight equipment, painstaking fabricated by hand, that made possible what was arguably the most ambitious, and fantastical, voyage in history.The spacesuitsThe Apollo spacesuits were high-tech marvels: 21 layers of nested fabric, strong enough to stop a micrometeorite, yet flexible enough to allow the astronauts to do all the work they needed to do on the moon.The spacesuits were the work of Playtex, the company that gave America the “Cross Your Heart” bra in the 1960s. Playtex had sold itself to NASA with the somewhat cheeky observation that the company was very familiar with garments that had to be both form-fitting and flexible.In fact, Playtex’s industrial division proved to be an inspired choice. Some of the layers of fabric in the suits were adapted directly from materials Playtex used in its bras and girdles.An ILC Industries employee sews layers of aluminized plastic together during the assembly of a NASA space suit for the Apollo program.But assembling the spacesuits was considered such delicate and critical work that it was done by hand, each layer sewn by women, brought over to Playtex’s industrial division from its consumer-product side. Every stitch had to be perfect if the spacesuits were to perform correctly—and protect the astronauts—in the unforgiving environment of the moon.The lunar roverThe U.S. sent three electric cars to the moon during the Apollo missions, and those ingenious moon vehicles transformed the experience of lunar exploration. They dramatically expanded the range the astronauts could cover—allowing them to venture many miles from the landing sites, to chase down the most interesting moon features and geology they could find. And the astronauts got a great sense of exuberance from zooming along in their lunar rovers across the hilly, sometimes dune-like surface—often laughing out loud at the experience of driving on the moon.",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,3.1K,9.4K,195.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-were-we-able-to-put-a-man-on-the-moon-with-the-level-of-technology-that-was-available-in-1969-Did-NASA-have-advanced-technologies-that-were-just-not-made-public

The engineering is relatively simple, although extremely complex to build. The difficult bit is money.Now, conspiritards always latch onto the fact that we can't go back to the moon using 1960’s technology, because we can't replicate the technology used. This is both absolutely right, and absolutely wrong. They state it's because the technology didn't exist back in the 60’s, or that some other entity supplied it and therefore it's super top-secret, or other such nonsense.What they fail to realise (because the brain size of the average conspiritard is almost infinitesimally small), is that the moon landings were 60 years ago. Companies which made switches, and screws, and diodes, and many other parts used in the construction of the Saturn V, the Rocketdyne F1 engines, the Command Module and the Eagle Lander, are no longer in business, or have been sold and amalgamated into other companies - some of whom have nothing to do with engineering in any way. If I need to buy Button #6 from the Houston Lunar Button Making Company Ltd to make the Lander do something, that manufacturer might not exist any more. The technology to make Button #6 no longer exists. The facilities to make Button #6 no longer exist. Hell, the factory which made Button #6 is probably a Starbucks now.But that's not how modern government procurement works. You don't get a guy walking into a factory and saying “I'm Bob from NASA. We're going to the moon 15 times, so I need 15 x Button #6 please”. No, what you get is a Request for Tender, containing a detailed schematic of Button #6, and an email address to send the bids to.Just because no company on the planet currently makes Button #6, doesn't mean a button company won't see the request for tender and think “hmm, our Button #22 is extremely similar, some minor tooling redesigns and we can make this”. They then estimate the redesign costs, materials costs, profit markup and actual manufacturing costs, and send in their bid. If it's accepted, hooray, we now have the ability to make Button #6 again!Except we wouldn't be using 1960’s technology to go back to the moon. We have over 60 years of technological innovation since then. We can build smaller rockets. We can build safer rockets.

The only reason rockets from SpaceX are smaller than a Saturn V is they are not yet going to the Moon and back.Rocket physics remains rocket physics and the liquid hydrogen liquid oxygen rockets of the Saturn V are still the best rockets we have.It doesn’t take all that much computation to get to the Moon and back. It takes MATH. That’s not the same thing as computation. The computations to get to the Moon and back aren’t difficult. Having a faster computer doesn’t change the rocket.The rockets we have now are better but in 1969 they are already near the limits of the physics. Only the controls are better.The computers they had in 1969 would not count as a joke today. But it just does not matter.

The wildest imaginings of plasma or laser weapons that get thrown around by sci fi dreamers could see realization. It’s impossible to know how small arms and weapons would develop in 800 years but I virtually guarantee you that explosives-based firearms will not feature anymore than swords and spears do today - they will be relics of the past, a once ubiquitous technology left obsolete by the march of time.
