2,"Oh, no question…Dr Beverly CrusherBeverly is the perfect combination which I look for in my real-life medical providers: high level of technical skills with compassion to go with.I simply think that she's the best chief medical officer that we've seen in the franchise.It also doesn't hurt that I would say that she's the ship's doctor who we've seen do the most actual, well,We saw her actually treat a lot of patients and such, as opposed to just being an overall character and doing things like muttering, “He's dead, Jim,” or worry about being a hologram.Oh, no question…Dr Beverly CrusherBeverly is the perfect combination which I look for in my real-life medical providers: high level of technical skills with compassion to go with.I simply think that she's the best chief medical officer that we've seen in the franchise.It also doesn't hurt that I would say that she's the ship's doctor who we've seen do the most actual, well,We saw her actually treat a lot of patients and such, as opposed to just being an overall character and doing things like muttering, “He's dead, Jim,” or worry about being a hologram.","5,254 followers",Janet Ybarra-Nance,989,6.3K,14.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-do-real-accident-and-emergency-doctors-think-of-Sick-Bay-and-the-technology-methods-shown-in-Star-Trek
3,"“Please state the nature of the medical emergency.”The Emergency Medical Hologram had more character development than some of the flesh and blood characters on Voyager. He had a significant arc, he had humor, he had connections. He was an interesting character.“Please state the nature of the medical emergency.”The Emergency Medical Hologram had more character development than some of the flesh and blood characters on Voyager.

4,"You can’t save anything with a sinking ship. Discovery is the worst Star Trek show ever. While Enterprise made some mistakes, it was still leagues superior to Discovery.JJ Abrams hurt the franchise immensely, ignoring the lore in several points. Yes, he changed it to be a new timeline, but that does not alter some critical facts. His change should not affect Klingons to make them be completely different from everything seen before. The new timeline should also not have changed Khan Noonien Singh from a eugenically created man of Indian descent, to one of British Caucasian descent.Ricardo MontaYou can’t save anything with a sinking ship.

The new timeline should also not have changed Khan Noonien Singh from a eugenically created man of Indian descent, to one of British Caucasian descent.Ricardo Montalban made the role. On the left is how he appeared as a young Khan in Star Trek The Original Series, and on the right is the aged Khan as seen in Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan.Yet in JJ Abrams Movie…Lets look at Klingons!Here’s how they looked in Star Trek TOS.But, with a larger budget, Roddenberry changed Klingons to add ridges to their heads and along their spines.Christopher Lloyd actually played the first memorable Klingon role like this, as did his subordinates on the ship.That was in Star Trek 3: The Search For Spock.However, Abrams butchered their appearance.They barely resemble Klingons at all. Klingons preferred having long hair for the most part, only General Chang was the one exception shown until Abrams movie. Why? Hair could be used against them in battle, it could be grabbed. Having long hair tested the warrior and made them work harder to win.Now, an example of a Discovery Klingon.PURPLE. What a travesty, but that’s not the only mistake this new show has made. They have the show give us an example of Klingons which operate aboard a tomb ship. What’s wrong with this?Klingons don’t care about the bodies of their dead, at all. It’s simply an empty shell. Once a Klingon dies warriors around them will open the deads eyes, and howl at the top of their lungs to warn the dead that another warrior was coming. The idea of Klingons entombing bodies is anathema, totally unheard of in any previous lore.Klingons however aren’t the only lore inconsistency in Star Trek DIscovery. Another comes in the form of Michaels, a human woman whose parents were killed and she was raised by Vulcans. I’ve no problem with that concept at all, and it could in fact be fun and intriguing to see it played out, except for the fact that her adoptive Vulcan father is Ambassador Sarek of Vulcan, making Spock her adoptive brother. In no previous show or movie was a sister mentioned, only Spock’s half brother, born to a Vulcan Princess and Sarek.Above is Amanda Grayson, Michaels, and Ambassador Sarek.Furthermore, the Discovery seemingly has the most potent form of space travel ever discovered, a drive that can instantly take the ship anywhere in the galaxy, but somehow the technology is lost and never ever mentioned again. Not even in Star Trek Voyager, when the ship was lost in the Delta Quadrant. If the technology once existed, even if it were outlawed, it would have at least been referenced once. “Too bad we spore drives are illegal.” or “Perhaps there’s a system like spore drives that we can utilize?”No, I don’t think Discovery can save the Star Trek franchise. If anything, it’s another nail in the coffin, it will only harm the franchise further. No true fan of the series would ever fully enjoy the show. STD (an apt acronym for this diseased show) would only appeal to those that know nothing about the lore, it mocks true fans.",17 followers,Rom Lokken,918,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-do-real-accident-and-emergency-doctors-think-of-Sick-Bay-and-the-technology-methods-shown-in-Star-Trek
5,"From a UK perspective there’s a huge amount of difference. When the role of Paramedic was created it was a very basic role, designed basically just to take people to hospital safetly. The main training course was the IHCD which was 12 weeks of extremely intense training followed by clinical placements and nearly a year of on the job learning. To many senior clinicians the ambulance service were not seen as professionals. Now it is a three year full degree.

When the role of Paramedic was created it was a very basic role, designed basically just to take people to hospital safetly.

To many senior clinicians the ambulance service were not seen as professionals. Now it is a three year full degree. I work with people who have masters degrees and we have a few people with doctorates. We still struggle sometimes with the attitude of certain clinicians but these people are rarely in the front line of the emergency department. The range of drugs we give is incredible now. From antibiotics to IV pain relief to tranexamic acids and drugs directly into the bone etc etc. We are able to give drugs based on our knowledge and training now if it falls outside ambulance guidelines. Paramedics are registered clinicians who are able to discharge on scene and involve other pathways other than E.D. There are specialist paramedics who are able to give boxes of medicines, various antibiotics, x ray diagnosis, working in minor injuries clinics and have an amazing level of skill in wound care such as staples or suturing.It is going to be interesting to see how the role is seen in the next five years. More and more paramedics are leaving the service to work in minor injuries clinics, G.P surgeries and alongside consultants. Paramedics are really sought after owing to the level of training, especially examinations. This would never have happened just ten years ago.",66 followers,Ross Cohen,16.1K,2.3K,15.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-do-real-accident-and-emergency-doctors-think-of-Sick-Bay-and-the-technology-methods-shown-in-Star-Trek
