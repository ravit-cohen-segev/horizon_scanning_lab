0,Out of the 5 great nations the Land of Fire is undoubtedly the most powerful of the 5.Mainly because of these 3 team 7.Naruto and Sasuke are the two strongest ninja in the ninja world together they can solo all 5 great nations.I added Sakura to because she's a member of Team 7 and will always side with Naruto and Sasuke besides she's the most powerful Kunochi in the series.Out of the 5 great nations the Land of Fire is undoubtedly the most powerful of the 5.Mainly because of these 3 team 7.Naruto and Sasuke are the two strongest ninja in the ninja world together they can solo all 5 great nations.I added Sakura to because she's a member of Team 7 and will always side with Naruto and Sasuke besides she's the most powerful Kunochi in the series.,360 followers,Han Kami,1.8K,217,2.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-nation-has-the-most-advanced-technology-in-Naruto

Lets take a look at some of his abilities.Naruto is stated to be the strongest shinobi in history, with sasuke being his only rival. Lets take a look at some of his abilities.Now this is naruto at his strongest as a teen at 17This naruto only had half of the nine tails chakra and and a portion from other tailed beast. Kurama even stated to be running low on chakra because of the days fought in the war. Now he can do this justu with another entire half of kurama, and could absorb more nature energy almost instantly. It’s basically on a whole entire scale. Naruto in boruto is now the strongest taijustu user after the time skip, and has notion of being the strongest in the world. Naruto at his strongest is a complete monster.The only beings that can give naruto any trouble would be the Ōtsutsuki Clan. Momoshiki who was stated to possibly be a bigger threat than kaguya. Naruto felt as though he could even take on him and kinshiki by himself.Naruto was even shocked when the other kage and sasuke had arrived. Below you can see naruto casually handling momoshiki with half his chakra absorbed and almost effortlessly.Naruto without a doubt is the strongest most powerful shinobi, and his only rival is sasuke.",469 followers,Daniel Cohort,11.9K,377,1.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-nation-has-the-most-advanced-technology-in-Naruto

5,Let’s go over the fastest weapon we have and it’s destructive capability.M134 Minigun is the fastest weapon currently with a fire rate of 6k rounds per minute. The bullets are 7.62mm. Now the destructive capability of that isn’t anything like our bombs but it is still very effective. Now the M134 Bullets move fast but not fast enough to even hit naruto.Now let’s analyze two things about naruto. His speed and durability.Speed:Remember this?

This was the moment naruto was confirmed to have the reaction time and capability to move at the speed of light.Now to my knowledge this means we have no way of even touching him.Durability:Remember this? Naruto tanked a hit from a beam that proceeded to cut the moon in half like slicing a cake. Now this means naruto can now not even be affected by bullets. Now if naruto goes into his full ninetails mode with the beast out well ain’t no way are we hitting him.Now that you know his speed and durability let me tell you what would go down. If Naruto would consider the earth an enemy. He would proceed to destroy the earth by making tons of shadow clones with a single mission. Kill everyone/thing you can with using little chakra. Now little chakra to naruto is not actually small. It’s just small for naruto because his reserves are massive along with having a tailed beasts reserves to use as well. After we respond with eventually taking out some of the clones the real naruto after observing and sitting somewhere with 5 clones collecting nature energy he deems it time to attack. He quickly heads for a town that he senses a lot of life forces coming from with nature energy then proceeds to throw several rasenshurikens leveling the entire town in seconds. Only seconds of screaming before total annihilation. Then seconds later naruto is gone going to the next town. Now why aren’t we catching naruto? Oh yea because we don’t have vehicles that can travel at the speed of light or even as fast as naruto. We can’t even track him. All we know is he pops up levels a town then goes to the next place. See you guys are trying to lower narutos power or slow him down but he would never stay in one spot long enough to even be hit with a tsar bomb or any bomb for that matter. The only thing that has a chance of hitting him is a bullet. Which even then he can evade that. Also humans don’t have the recognition and response time to react to someone that can move that fast. So good bye mankind.Although realistically naruto wouldn’t do that or just attack us. Infact he would help us get a lot closer to world peace by just helping us snuff out anyone not for the advancement and well being of the human race. Naruto could enforce a utopia on earth.

However, your use of the capital G implies the Abrahamic god, who does have a bit of form in this direction. It’s interesting though, that he looks after those who look after themselves and practice social distancing rather that his own self-proclaimed followers who claim they are protected, ignore instructions, and then catch the disease.If this is the act of a god, it’s no god I want to be anywhere near.
