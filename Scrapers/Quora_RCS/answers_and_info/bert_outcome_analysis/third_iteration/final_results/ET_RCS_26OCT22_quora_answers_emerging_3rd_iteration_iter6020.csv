It’s not going to save the people Stalin was starving to death. It’s not going to save Nanking from the Japanese. It’s not going to stop the invasion of Ethopia by Mussolini.WWII comes at the end of a lot of violence and a lot of deaths because people had had enough.","4,348 followers",Shaun Mootoo,626,13K,26.4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Would-you-stop-WWII-if-you-could-to-prevent-countless-people-from-getting-killed-either-by-direct-extermination-or-as-a-result-of-combat-and-sacrifice-a-lot-of-future-technologies-and-innovations-that-consequently
1,"No because, Changing the past is my unpredictable you don’t want to laugh at my staffing World War II and saving all the people who are exterminated you could save somebody who ends up being worse Hitler they could take over the world and kill a lot more people. Also stopping World War II could have a lot of other ramifications.

Thus, subliminal audios will be like the seed that blooms in the fertile ground of the subconscious mind of the person who wants to achieve a deeper change in any aspect of his life. Subliminal audios are used to face fears such as public speaking, to break deeply ingrained habits that prevent weight loss or stop smoking, or to generate profound changes in personality such as being more sociable, friendlier, less angry and less shy. So if you wonder if subliminal audios work, the answer is very simple: They will work for people who are willing to receive the benefits that modern technology can bring to human psychology”.Not necessarily to clinical psychology?","358,954 followers",Sean Kernan,9.1K,5.6K,726.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Would-you-stop-WWII-if-you-could-to-prevent-countless-people-from-getting-killed-either-by-direct-extermination-or-as-a-result-of-combat-and-sacrifice-a-lot-of-future-technologies-and-innovations-that-consequently

As they approach radar coverage of Sam sites they triangulate the location of the radar array long before it can discover them, or track them if they’ve already been picked up with VHF. During this time a communication signal between the radar array is picked up as well as the response which must be from its command and control center. That location is also now triangulated and known. Now the F-35 sends this battlespace information to joint tactical command where they target said locations with any number of weapons available to the US military or the F-35s turn on their considerable jammers at the targeting radar and hammer it themselves. After the array and CINC is destroyed, they turn on their radars to the ground and begin hunting the launchers. Now your 4 F-35s have just made a hole in the defense zone.In a real conflict they wouldn’t be alone, tons of decoys and long range weapons would be coming in at the same time, adding chaos and noise to their already stealthy and formidable approach.Additionally, having a distributed network, in the case of having highly capable sensor and sharing nodes such as the F-35, makes your side more resilient to the attempts of your enemy to disrupt your networked operations.Let’s talk about the MDFs. Now while most of the public information talks about their ability to decipher signals from radars, there are a few references to them being loaded with the radar pictures of commonly used ground vehicles.

8,It’s a strange question. Jumping from 4 th gen to 6th gen in one huge unmanageable leap.The US was barely able to pull off the F-35 — it stressed the worlds most advanced aerospace company to its limits & you are suggesting that another quantum leap would have been possible in that time period.It just wasn’t feasible.,UNKNOWN,Matt P.,763,19.7K,101.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Would-you-stop-WWII-if-you-could-to-prevent-countless-people-from-getting-killed-either-by-direct-extermination-or-as-a-result-of-combat-and-sacrifice-a-lot-of-future-technologies-and-innovations-that-consequently
9,"All of this “4th generation/5th generation” crap annoys the hell out of me. Its all just marketing lingo, I had never heard of it when I was flying the eagle.But to answer your question, the F-35 is the most advanced warplane flying today. I would never want to face one, and I certainly wouldn't want to face an F-35/F-22 combo. I can't think of anything more deadly in the sky.

11,"9–1–1Recall that when the emergency system was inaugurated in USmerica, we didn’t have universal TouchTone® phones — we had rotary dials. Add the digits in 9–1–1 and get 11, add those in 9–9–9 and we get 27, about 2½ times as long to dial and go through the phone system. Each of those 11 or 27 represented a “pulse” which took about ¼ sec. Time is, literally, money. The longer a call takes (even if only to connect it), uses precious switching capability. Shorter calls means you require fewer switches.At this point, you might wonder why9–1–1Recall that when the emergency system was inaugurated in USmerica, we didn’t have universal TouchTone® phones — we had rotary dials.

Shorter calls means you require fewer switches.At this point, you might wonder why we didn’t get 1–1–1. That is also a matter of recalling the physical (as opposed to modern electronic) system of switching calls.The digit 1 alerted the switch that the call would be a long distance call. That shifted the call to a different set of switches. Then the second following digit (third in the cycle) was in either the set [2–9] or the set [1,0]. If the former, it was a “local”, long-distance call (within the same area code, but to a different switching center); if the latter, it was a long, long distance call (out side the local area code). Thus, dialing 1 (212) 555–1234 got a call to New York City*. Again, it was a matter of speed (9–1–1 was less expensive than 9–9–9 with rotary dialing and mechanical switches. Today, it would make no difference.",99 followers,John Birch,1K,4.6K,3.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Would-you-stop-WWII-if-you-could-to-prevent-countless-people-from-getting-killed-either-by-direct-extermination-or-as-a-result-of-combat-and-sacrifice-a-lot-of-future-technologies-and-innovations-that-consequently
