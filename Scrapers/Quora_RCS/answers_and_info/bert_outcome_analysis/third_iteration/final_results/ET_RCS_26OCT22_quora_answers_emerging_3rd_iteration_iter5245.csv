1,"I believe that the answer to your question is dependent upon whether you are referring to Human Resource functions in a “Fortune” and enterprise class company or that of an SME? Over 30 years ago, I moved from Montreal to Toronto specifically to introduce a Human Resources “Expert System” called Peodesy, designed in the UK, to the Canadian market place. This application was far ahead of its time and could be used to do such things as: help managers shortlist candidates, ask the right questions to hire the best candidate, create new job descriptions with the appropriate skills and competencies,I believe that the answer to your question is dependent upon whether you are referring to Human Resource functions in a “Fortune” and enterprise class company or that of an SME? Over 30 years ago, I moved from Montreal to Toronto specifically to introduce a Human Resources “Expert System” called Peodesy, designed in the UK, to the Canadian market place. This application was far ahead of its time and could be used to do such things as: help managers shortlist candidates, ask the right questions to hire the best candidate, create new job descriptions with the appropriate skills and competencies, do job evaluations, conduct employee performance evaluations, match people to jobs and jobs to people … and so much more. It sold reasonably well in government and para-government institutions but more than often was rejected by private companies as it literally posed a threat to HR practitioners in a company. The common comment after a demo was “This thing can do my job!”In reality Peodesy, could provide HR practitioners time to add more value to their respective companies by empowering managers at all levels with the ability to perform the employee management tasks listed in their job descriptions without the need for involving anyone in the HR department. Truth is, that some Peodesy-using HR departments became responsible for developing the workflows and expert system hierarchies that would provide the managers the advice and information they needed to excel at the people management part of their jobs. Practically, this should have freed up a significant amount of time for the HR practitioners to learn more about their businesses so that they could better contribute to hiring and retaining the best people for their company and maybe even offer cost saving advice by recommending solutions that increased employee productivity and decreased costs; recommending a new piece of machinery that required less training and produced more widgets per hour and reduced the risk of injury to the machinists is just one example.The downside to my story is that many HR practitioners involved with Peodesy did not gain much, if any free time. Many of them chose to use the “Expert System” as an electronic filing cabinet and insure the safety of their jobs. Unlike Peodesy, today’s HR Technology is primarily used to automate HR business policies and processes and track employee information for financial, legislative and reporting purposes. Given that even the “best” users of traditional technology solutions use less than 20 percent of the available functionality, I do not believe that Human Resource functions will be replaced by traditional HR technology any time soon. It would mean a change in company policies, procedures and in the job descriptions of many people in the organization in order for the technology functionality to be used to the optimal benefit of their respective companies. (To support my point, about 8 years ago a major city in Ontario produced an RFP in hopes of finding a company that would rewrite the job descriptions of its employees. The job descriptions would include their use of their use of the city’s new HRMS, how they were expected to use it and if relevant, what reports they were expected to develop and deliver to the appropriate supervisor or manager. The city IT department had to do this because they were unable to deliver the valuable information collected in their 2 million dollar plus HRMS. When such information was requested of someone, the answer was usually “that’s not my responsibility, it’s not part of my job description”. ) This type of change in job description would make HR practitioners more accountable for contributing tangible, measurable results to their organization’s bottom line and while such a change can be found in many Fortune 1000 companies, it has not been adopted by the majority of companies including SMEs.On the positive side, most currently, technology exists that permits the addition of machine intelligence and situational awareness to any business policy or process that an organization might choose to automate with technology, including HR. This new technology brings a whole new meaning to “integration” as it can unite and interpret the data from disparate systems in ways that before were unattainable at any cost. This represents an opportunity that if taken, can allow HR departments and practitioners to shine in ways never before possible.

I'll likely be dead and the current 40-year-olds will be dragged kicking and screaming into this new technology.Banks won't die.

You still knit a sweater, wash the dishes, etc. even though there are machines that will do it for you.

That’s how it works in Amazon’s warehouses.Technology also has never proven better at situations that require creative thinking or common sense.We are tool building species. So our prime motivation is to create tools that improve our lives. Just we prefer not to do that we can create tools to instead we are generally happy to leave to technology (like controlling an elevator). And although many people might be happy for our cars to drive themselves it will still take a long time before they can. And even then some people are likely to still do it by themselves.Should we surpass any need or desire to do manual work, we will likely just devote our time to new ventures. For example, Bill Gates and Elon Musk no longer need to have jobs to earn money, but they choose to, focusing on new things.

6,"I get paid from my teeth to my feet.I heard this a couple of weeks back and it stuck with me. You see every job I've had has been manual labour. Whether lifting boxes in a factory, lifting wardrobes in a warehouse or simply cleaning up on a construction site, each job has been manual labour.But what is it like? Well boring to be honest, most factories and warehouses have you stand I'm the same place and work. Every now and again you might have to rush but it's not often.

Hell even a fast paced job (and I mean fast paced) I had putting a plastic lid on tin cans and I blanked out as I worked. At one point I removed the clock off the wall for doing my head in. You tend to either daydream heavily or (if you're working as a team) chat a lot. Sometimes it's like spending a third of your day laughing and joking with a friend as you work. Other times you're working alone and daydreaming, makes the time pass.As a labourer I get told to sweep up and I'll sweep, you get a little pride out of your work because you see the difference, you know you're actually doing something rather than hitting someone else's deadlines. Plus I don't have bosses breathing down my neck. I get to see some amazing views from small towns to city centres, and I've stood in buildings over a century old I never would have otherwise. I love history, and in a city centre you can smell it.You use your break to rest and nothing, and I mean nothing beats getting home, sitting down with a cup of tea and taking your boots off.

9,"The dean of the aerospace engineering department at my university told us freshmen that the future of air transport was airships.He explained in detail how much more fuel efficient they were and how much more they could carry and how much better they’ll be for the environment including reduced noise and pollution. He encouraged us to become specialists in lighter-than-air technology because he felt that heavier-than-air airframe technology had reached a point of stagnation and wasn't ever going to get much better.SO “WRIGHT” & SO WRONGHe was about 90-95 percent right about airframe technology.The dean of the aerospace engineering department at my university told us freshmen that the future of air transport was airships.He explained in detail how much more fuel efficient they were and how much more they could carry and how much better they’ll be for the environment including reduced noise and pollution.

Since he told us this, there have been only small, incremental tweaks to airframes.But he was wrong about market forces moving lighter-than-air technology to the forefront of our transportation system.The interesting part of this story is that he told us this in September 1968.The Boeing 737 was only three years old. The first Boeing 747 flew just four months after he told us this.Both are still in production today!But you’re not seeing those airships, are you?THE RIGHT STUFFHe was so right about the fact that we’d found the wall in airframe design.Even today, Boeing has an order backlog of 4,500 of 737s, which will take them nearly a decade to build even with no more orders—and no one thinks they’ve received their last 737 order.That means that 737s will still roll off the assembly up to 65 years after they first flew. And with the average lifespan of a commercial jet airframe being at least 25 years, that means the 737 could be in commercial service for up to 90 years after the first one flew.And remember, the 737 is really just a twin-engine 707, which first flew in 1957, which means that the basic airframe will still be in commercial use 100 years after that first flight! Of course the wings have been tweaked and winglet technology has improved efficiency—but nothing major has changed, just decades of small tweaks.So, my aero professor was right in 1968 to say that airframe technology was well enough developed that none of us were going to make major breakthroughs in airframe design during our careers.AND ALSO SO WRONGSo, what happened with the other half of his prediction—that airships would dominate air transport within a few decades?I gotta admit, I’m baffled by this. So I can’t tell you why he was so wrong.BUT HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT HOW WRONG OUR CURRENT SYSTEM ISWe currently have a ridiculous long-distance transportation system.I can’t think of anything else that is stuck at the two extremes of its range with almost nothing in between.One extreme is surface transport, which is based on cars, trucks, rail, and ships. Our interstate highways are clogged and dangerous with all the semi trucks hauling freight, piloted by overworked, sleepy drivers. It’s a ridiculous system. But we almost killed our rail system a half century ago, so we have little choice.And international freight is carried mostly in ships, which is complex and ridiculous. Have you ever thought about the chain of events that delivers a product from factory to your door? Let's follow a widget:Luckily, we were blessed with the man who is now the richest man in the world who created Amazon, which eliminates many of those closing steps. But he’s still missing out on one of the biggest areas for improvement. Here’s how widgets should get to you if Amazon would push for airship technology:SO, WHEN WILL AMAZON BUILD THE AIRSHIP FREIGHT NETWORK?My freshmen college aero professor had this all figured out fifty years ago—in the fall of 1968. It’s hard for me to believe that a brilliant, innovative company like Amazon hasn’t caught up to where the dean of the aerospace engineering department at the University of Tulsa was a half century ago.But one day it will happen—and that’s the answer to your question.",976 followers,Jeff Chatterton,2.3K,621,6.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Can-Human-Resource-functions-be-replaced-with-technology

Not by itself. You need something to generate the power needed to do it by a battery or electric motor.To see how this works. Look at trains and you will see that there is a major diesel engine producing an electric charge to the motors on the wheels. If it were using batteries only the train wouldn’t get very far if get going at all.The same for fixed-wing. At this point, nothing can beat it for the fuel cost, distances, passengers and speed. Once something like this does come along then it will still take quite a while to get it mainstream.People don’t like drastic changes and the new technology needs to be proven to be better not just once in a while but always.So, for now, the answer to your question is no.
