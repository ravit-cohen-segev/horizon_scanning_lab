Also, on the other side, new technologies in solar bring a promise of better generation, more flexibility and innovation coupled with seamless adaptability across various topographies and landscapes.Let us discuss some major solar technologies which have been introduced or are already in the pipeline.Floating solar:Floating solar power plants, or floatovoltaics are solar power plants which are installed on water bodies like reservoirs, dams or lakes. Such installations are more economical by way of capital cost saving as the need for costly land and real estate is substituted when the plant is installed on water.Ground and roof-top installations require more fabrication for mounting the panels compared to installation of a floating plant. This results in savings in cost, manpower and resources.Solar panels lose generation efficiency in high temperatures. Floatovoltaics, due to their proximity to water, have cooler surroundings, hence giving better generation and faster payback time.As a floatovoltaics plant covers the water surface, blocking sunlight, it stops the photosynthesis process, stopping the growth of algae resulting in the water staying clean. This coverage also helps in reducing the evaporation of water which helps in saving this valuable resource.BIPV & BAPV:Building Integrated Photovoltaics serve in a dual-purpose manner, as an outer layer of the façade of buildings and as a source of electricity generation. As they can be integrated during the initial construction of a building, they save on construction costs by replacing certain standard materials. Besides helping in generating electricity, BIPVs do not disturb the aesthetics of a building but merge seamlessly into the design elements.Building-Added Photovoltaics are added during a retrofit. Both BIPV and BAPV do not require the racks and mounting equipment of traditional solar PV systems, ultimately saving on costs.Solar Skin:A very dynamic innovative design by MIT engineers, Solar Skin uses selective light filtering to simultaneously display a vibrant image and transmit sunlight to the underlying solar panel with minimal loss of efficiency. Due to this revolutionary feature, it can blend across variety of surfaces and preserve the aesthetics of the surroundings along with efficient functioning.Solar Fabric:Imagine every fabric of the clothing you wear being able to harness the power of the sun. Such fabric has the potential to keep your winter jacket warm, power your phone while in the pocket, even light up lamps from the awnings and generate electricity from window curtains eliminating the cost of setting up solar structures and mountings. Once this technology is developed and feasible the possibilities of its applications are endless.Solar Powered Roads:Solar powered roads are a reality now. They are being designed and built not only for their ability to generate clean energy but they would also power LED street lights during the night and in cold countries they can be designed to have thermal heating capacity to melt snow.Beginning from ground mounted and roof mounted systems, today solar has come a long way. Solar is now more efficient, more flexible and more customization with better applicability across various surfaces. Solar is here to stay and the future is nothing but bright.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-advanced-emerging-technology-which-is-available-now-or-in-the-near-future
7,"China’s technology ecosystem over the next five years will have matured and will be largely successful in executing a transition from the consumer internet to the industrial internet. Specifically, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and private industry will try to use powerful emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and 5G to revamp and upgrade Chinese cities and traditional industries, such as manufacturing, agriculture, energy, and transportation.This focus will mark a notable shift from the last decade of consumer technologies centered on apps like WeChat, Alipay, and TikTokChina’s technology ecosystem over the next five years will have matured and will be largely successful in executing a transition from the consumer internet to the industrial internet.

Instead, the Chinese tech landscape will likely enter a more capital-intensive phase as it targets industrial applications such as smart grids, dark factories, and autonomous vehicles (AVs).By 2025, China will likely be a world leader in industrial technology applications, but that leadership will continue to depend on access to advanced semiconductors manufactured outside of mainland China. This is predicated on three factors:The rollout of “new infrastructure” in key industrial and urban regions;The rise of a new generation of Chinese industrial tech startups;Progress by China in the design of semiconductors, but enduring weakness in the manufacturing of the most advanced semiconductors.China will strengthen standards domestically and boost the economy, and to have influence globally.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,12.7K,996,156M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-advanced-emerging-technology-which-is-available-now-or-in-the-near-future

To explore more about these technologies, read the following trends that will impact and transform industries in the coming years.1. Autonomous TechnologyAutonomous technology (like robotics, drones, vehicles, and appliances) is a rapidly growing trend, with its broad impact and use in this digitally transformed era. It uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to perform tasks traditionally done by humans. With the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into an autonomous ecosystem, it is awe-inspiring to envision the transformational possibilities that lie ahead for various industries.Use of autonomous technology in several areas are illustrated below:In Space:In Transportation:In Agriculture:At Home:In the future, virtually every application, service and IoT object will possess some form of AI to automate processes.2. Augmented IntelligenceAugmented analytics is a smart solution that every business wants to get their hands on. It enables companies to go beyond just figuring out what is happening in their business and start predicting what’s going to happen in the future.It’s a tiresome and time-consuming process for data scientists to prepare, analyze, and group data before drawing conclusions from them. It means businesses can miss critical insights the data scientists don’t have time to explore. Here, augmented analytics will help data scientists to explore more insights from data. It uses machine learning and natural language processing to expand the automation process.With augmented analytics, data scientists can:In the future, more than 40% of data science tasks will be automated, resulting in increased productivity of data scientists. By adopting augmented analytics, data insights will be more readily available across the business, including analysts, decision-makers, and operational workers.3. AI-driven software developmentAI-driven development focuses on tools and techniques for embedding AI into applications and using AI to generate other AI-powered tools. This trend is evolving in two aspects:Developers that are using predefined models delivered as a service will be in high demand in the market. It enables more developers to utilize the services, hence increasing their efficiency.4. Digital twinA digital twin is a virtual representation of a real-life object, processor system. It bridges the gap between the real world and tech. While the concept of a digital twin is not new, it’s only because of IoT that it has become cost-effective to implement.Today’s digital twins have evolved by becoming more:-How a digital twin works:-Digital twin technology helps companies drive innovation. With its advanced monitoring, analytical, and predictive capabilities, it will better understand customers’ needs. On the other hand, it will enhance existing products and services by improving the customer’s experience.“Digital twins are becoming a business imperative, covering the entire lifecycle of an asset or process and forming the foundation for connected products and services. Companies that fail to respond will be left behind”, says Thomas Kaiser, SAP Senior Vice President of IoT.Tech-giants using digital twin solutions:-5. Edge computingEdge computing is causing significant disruption in industries and business models. In edge network, data collection, information processing, and delivery are placed closer to the local source instead of in a data center. It reduces latency and increases safety and security.The fundamental part of this technology is the seamless integration between IoT and Cloud (between the physical world and the world of computation.) An edge computing application uses:There will be a steady increase in the embedding of sensors, storage, actuators and advanced AI capabilities in edge devices. In general, intelligence will shift towards the edge in a variety of endpoint devices, ranging from industrial devices to automobile power generators.Read more- Optimize system by using edge- IBM and Edge and IoT- IBM6. Immersive technologyImmersive technology transforms the way users interact with the world. Some types of immersive technology extend reality by carpeting digital images on a user’s environment. Others create a new reality by completely padlocking a user out from the rest of the world and immersing them in a digital environment.Types of immersive technology include 360, augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), virtual reality (VR), and extended reality (XR). These technologies will lead to a new immersive experience by changing the way users perceive the world.Immersive Technology used to be something you would read about in Sci-Fi books or watch in Sci-Fi movies. Now, apart from gaming, this technology has many different applications. Some of them are listed here:-In the coming years, 70% of enterprises will be experimenting with immersive technologies for consumer and enterprise use. Conversational platforms, virtual personal assistants and chatbots, will embed enhanced sensory channels to detect emotions based on facial expressions. They are expected to become more conversational in interaction.7. BlockchainBlockchain is a distributed, decentralized ledger, cryptographically signed and immutable transactional record shared by all participants in a network.Every second of every day, businesses exchange value (transactions) with suppliers, partners, and customers. Blockchain for business provides a way to complete these transactions in a fast and precise way. It allows companies to trace transactions. With this, companies can work with third-parties without any need for a mediator (centralized party). It will significantly reduce business friction.Things that make blockchain good for businesses:-Blockchain technology began in finance. Now it has expanded to other sectors as well: government, healthcare, manufacturing, supply chain, and others. It helps to build more efficient enterprise business models, facilitate transactions, and improve cash flow.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,8.7K,996,156M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-advanced-emerging-technology-which-is-available-now-or-in-the-near-future
