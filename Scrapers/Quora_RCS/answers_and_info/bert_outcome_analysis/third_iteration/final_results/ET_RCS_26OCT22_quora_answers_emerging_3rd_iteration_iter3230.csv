1,Well you must have gotten this idea from “PROMETHEUS” I beleive.. but let me tell you something.. nothing in this world can outsmart the one who created it.People have been trying from decades to know about there creator and many even say that they have found him but no one have the proof. We can only try to predict that what it or he is. But one thing i can tell you for sure tht he is way beyond our imagination bcz we can't even understand 0.1% of the things that he created.So now you tell me how can you even imagine of predicting about something even whose creations are unpredictable for us?Well you must have gotten this idea from “PROMETHEUS” I beleive.. but let me tell you something.. nothing in this world can outsmart the one who created it.People have been trying from decades to know about there creator and many even say that they have found him but no one have the proof.

2,"Rather than repeat myself, I’ll just copy/paste my post from another thread:If you take 10 people who believe in gravity and 10 people who don’t, line them up on the roof of a tall building, and push them over, guess what will happen: all 20 will plunge to their deaths. Their belief and disbelief won’t matter. This means that gravity is an objective reality. It had the same effects before people knew it existed as it has now that it’s been defined and quantified.If you take 10 flat earth believers and 10 people who think the earth is round and take them on a space shuttle ride, guess what willRather than repeat myself, I’ll just copy/paste my post from another thread:If you take 10 people who believe in gravity and 10 people who don’t, line them up on the roof of a tall building, and push them over, guess what will happen: all 20 will plunge to their deaths.

Again, objective reality. I don’t need to go to space to test this (though I really wouldn’t mind) - enough people have gone to space and come back with visual evidence, again, always with the same results. Not one person has gone up in space and come back to say they still think the earth is flat.But if you take 10 atheists and 10 people who believe in god (we’ll leave the question of which god out of the discussion for the moment), you can devise any test of the existence of god you can think of, guess what will happen: those 20 people will walk away with 25 different experiences. The 10 religious people will start arguing with each other about whose interpretation is correct, and the atheists will just laugh at them. Which makes faith, religion, god, whatever you want to call it, A SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE.There is no objective reality of god, because objective reality works the same for everyone regardless of what they believe, and god obviously doesn’t.","20,149 followers",Aitijya Sarkar,5.8K,209,11.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Do-our-so-called-conventional-gods-really-have-supernatural-powers-or-do-we-just-worship-some-extraterrestrials-with-highly-advanced-technology

But, it's closed at night, so, we'll have to be careful.”Ever the rebel, I say, “Hell yes. Let's do this.”We made our way to this narrow passageway that led to the lake.My friend had a Duke which was an on-road bike and we somehow managed to clear the barricade and enter.Finally, after carefully navigating the rubble, we reached.There it was.The lake in all its glory.Beautiful to look at, with the moon castingDo you want to go to the lake?My friend asks me this around 8 : 30 in the evening.I asked him, “Which lake?”He says, “Oh, there's one nearby.

Let's do this.”We made our way to this narrow passageway that led to the lake.My friend had a Duke which was an on-road bike and we somehow managed to clear the barricade and enter.Finally, after carefully navigating the rubble, we reached.There it was.The lake in all its glory.Beautiful to look at, with the moon casting a wonderful white glow over the landscape.Lonely and desolate, with no one around. Empty and deserted.We parked the bike and sat on these rocks as my friend lit a cigarette and I played some music.Then there was silence.Nothing but silence with my phone playing Floyd in the background.It was just perfect.Until, we heard it.A desperate, wailing scream.It'd been fifteen minutes by then.My friend and I were talking, when we heard this loud, screeching noise from far away.Both of us heard it.I thought it was my friend's phone. My friend thought it was my alarm or ringtone.Together, we shifted, uncomfortably, but we don't say anything just yet.Then, we heard it again.This time, louder. Closer. Felt like someone was running towards us.I looked at my friend as he looked at me.I said, “Umm, bro, was that your phone?”He looks at me, equally perplexed, and says, “Wait, I thought it was yours. Please don't joke about this.”I said, “I'm not! Wait, did you hear that too?”He says, “Yeah, I did. I thought.....”Before he could finish, we hear it again.Some girl, or something, screaming at the top of her voice.This time, it was even louder. Even closer. Goosebumps all over us now.We sprang to action.Both of us were shaking now.This was real. It was actually happening. Only problem, now, the shrieks were continuous. It wasn't stopping.Something or someone was screaming and with each passing second that thing was coming closer.It was a terrible sound.It was a sound that felt so eerie and unnatural. Utterly miserable. One devoid of hope. Uncanny.There was nothing around.No house. No one. No body.It was desolate for miles and miles.Not a single soul in sight.But, the scream.With each second, running towards us, louder, closer.Within seconds, we run to my friend's bike.He fires up the engine.By now, the screaming is extraordinarily real. It felt like the thing or person was desperately close to us by now.I jumped on the backseat as he immediately revs his bike.It was an on road bike — there was rubble and an offshoot of a gravel road that had to be crossed before we were on the main road.We didn't care.He revved his bike and within three seconds we were doing 50 km/per hour.He was just about to lose his balance and fall but now the screaming felt just seconds away from us.We couldn't stop.Scream.I say, “Go go go man.”Scream.He says, “Fuck, man. It's getting closer.”Scream.I say, “Bhai, I'm serious. We need to leave. Just drive. Just drive. Don't look to your left. Just don't.”Scream.Seconds away from us now.I looked to my left and finally saw it.A figure — something — or someone.But, not a human. That thing, wasn't human. The moon cast it's magnificent light over that thing and it was fully clothed in bright, shining, white.It was still screaming and it was running straight at us. Right at us. Not kidding, literally running towards us.I am shaking now and desperately I tell my friend, “Don't fucking look to your left. Just drive.”We'd just made it to the main road by now as he revved to take us quickly away.I didn't even look back to see where that thing was now.Both of us were shaking by the time we reached — literally shaking — almost in tears.That night, neither of us slept.The next morning, we went to college.One of our friends was from Pune — a localite.We were telling him the story, all of it, and he looks at us with this weird face. One of horror. Utter, sheer horror.It was strange because this guy didn't even believe in ghosts or the supernatural.Just as we finished our story, he asks, quietly, “Wait, which lake was this?”I say, “There's one close to Lohegaon. Do you know it?”That's when he says something that chills us to the core and knocked the breath out of us.He says, “Bhai, that's the infamous suicide lake.”Shaking now, I asked, “What do you mean?”He says, “It'sI've never doubted in the existence of the supernatural, since.","18,451 followers",Nathan Stanish,5K,2.3K,62.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Do-our-so-called-conventional-gods-really-have-supernatural-powers-or-do-we-just-worship-some-extraterrestrials-with-highly-advanced-technology
