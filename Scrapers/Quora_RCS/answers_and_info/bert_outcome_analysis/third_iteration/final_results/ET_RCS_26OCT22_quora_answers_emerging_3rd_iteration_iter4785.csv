0,I believe this concept will work. They need to keep and maintain a fun environment. Part of Toys ‘R’ Us’s original problem was “too much inventory.” There was always a lot of dead stock on the shelves. Kids nowadays are too busy with apps to spend time playing with a million toy variants (like we did in the 70s and 80s). They only need to stock what’s important. Anything else can be ordered via their website or something.,262 followers,Chaz Purlet,2.4K,625,1.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/The-new-Toys-R-Us-plans-to-have-less-toys-and-more-interactive-and-playground-like-environments-Do-you-think-that-will-be-successful

As in any relationship, there are stages to the one you have with your customer. My acronym for those stages is ACES – Attracted, Connected, Embracing, Sharing.If you are to get your customers to share you, your customer must be* attracted *to your brand story because it’s their story. Once attracted, give opportunities to *connect*, (this is where sales offers are effectively made).Once they connect, reinforce your brand story to build the relationship. A customer isn’t a customer until they have purchased more than once. This is *embracing* a brand. The more they embrace, the more loyal they become (even if there is a competitor who undersells you).Embracers are ready and eager to *share.* They become active sellers because they believe in you. Marketing to embracers should include the tools they need to share.Having a communication plan that has something for each stage of your customer relationship is the most important key to effective marketing, yet it’s the most neglected. There is such a pressing need to “sell” we forget to treat customers with the care they yearn for from brands.My clients often say, “Word-of-mouth is the best advertising.” I completely agree. The question I ask them is, “Have you given them the words they need to advertise you?”",576 followers,Dukpa Lotus,50.4K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-great-ways-to-market-a-business-without-being-salesy

And customers are obviously the lifeblood of a business.Making these people happy, is truly what your business is based on.Don’t need to tell you that.But here comes the key question…If you don’t know WHO your customer is, and by extenstion HOW to Market to them…You have don’t have a big chance of making money.And if you did your market research properly….You’d know EXACTLY what they want…and what frustrates these folks to no avail.You’d know WHERE they “hang out”. And I don’t mean this in a physical sense, per se (although that IS also important).More like, what FaceBook groups your ideal customer frequents, for example.Or what books and magazines, they read.(BTW…Market is just another workd for people who are able and somewhat motivated or predisposed to buy your stuff and that you can help with your product or service…But back on track here).You’d know, what mailing lists they’re likely on.You’d know WHO’S MARKETED to them before. And which of those businesses failed in doing so. Which business succeeded with their marketing and sold them a lot of stuff (this is SUPER important!)You can look at your successful competitior’s MARKETING and sell AGAINST their angle!Por ejemplo….Selling Against is powerful way of gaining a stake in the hearts and minds of a niche or bigger, more generic market even…(Pro Tip: Check out “The Dollar Shave Club”).Anyway…I know what you’re thinking right now.No need to feel overwhelmed.It’s possible to get all of this info BEFORE you get into business…And it’s VITALLY important that you do so.You can’t throw money into a business (overhead, ads, personal…) and expect it to make you money, when your business isn’t even based on a deep need within a market.And if you’re “winging” your marketing, then well…You have a very expensive hobby. NOT a business.Remember the formula for success in business…Starving Crowd (unmet desire, unresolved pain point) + Smart & Strategic Marketing = Fun and Profits.On the flipside…Stuffed Crowd (their needs got met my another player in the market) + Sloppy Marketing (not niched down, no coherent sales message, no testing and tracking, no “big idea” or “unique angle”) = Hard, labor-intense, knuckle-dragging UNLUCRATIVE business.So, get clear on WHO your ideal customer is and what they’ve been exposed to from competitors.Ignore this, and you’ll end up like me at one point….Working 14–16hr days, bankers and credit card companies sending their hounds out to squeeze my last $ out of me…Intense, and I mean really intense (to the point of having breathing problem and heart palpitions)...ANXIETY about the future.Because, for the life of you…You can’t FIGURE out why no one wants to buy from you.Well, by researching your market and gettting crystal clear on WHO your ideal customer is, what message they’re most likely to respond to, and how they liked to be treated and helped, so they buy from you again and again…It’s like giving yourself a running start in a race.You know?

Until the commission issue, there will be fixed costs that need to be covered by the professionals in the industry. The diverse laws across just the US alone are a hurdle as well. Compliance with all the different real estate laws is an onerous task if the industry goes to fewer players. There are labor laws, contract, and tax laws, local, county, state and federal housing laws, consumer protection laws, criminal, environmental laws, intellectual property laws, copyright and patent laws to contend with. Real estate is one of the few industries practiced under 100% commission-based compensation. How many buyers/sellers would want to or are able to pay an upfront retainer? That hasn’t happened yet so there is little incentive to pursue it currently.I do find it interesting to engage in these types of wonderment.
