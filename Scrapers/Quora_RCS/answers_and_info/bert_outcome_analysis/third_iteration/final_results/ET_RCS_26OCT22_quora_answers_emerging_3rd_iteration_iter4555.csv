Its discovery resulted in the Nobel Prize for Physics being given “for groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene.”Graphene is classified as two-dimensional: it is one atom thick (not pure two-dimensional but as close as we can come) and this form creates several fascinating properties.So why hasn’t this material exploded?

The very people you think you want to find will find you on your path getting the work in, but only if you’re getting the work in. If you do this you become unique, what I believe the universe intended you to be.I was beaten for years as a child. I didn’t care about what was happening within anyone else’s home. While some of my friends may have had similar experiences, there was no support group. No one stepped in to say, “Billy take a day off, I’ll take the beating today.” I believed that only I could solve my problem, and I did. This is the approach I take with everything from that time to this time.The most valuable thing you can do for your life is to develop the discipline to do things on your own. You’ll find that while developing that discipline the very people you’re trying to find will always find you.Until Next Time.","83,132 followers",Anna Sharudenko,13.3K,199,26.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-find-like-minded-people-engaged-in-social-activities-especially-in-the-educational-field-using-technology
3,"My opinion: Because of the US, Japan became more militaristic as the US perceived the China threat.

It was the US that encouraged Japan to move away from its pacifist constitution to a stronger military footing. Prime ministers like Shinzo Abe are right wing leaning advocates of a strong Japan militarily and the US encouraged that. The same is happening in South Korea. Both countries are becoming enemies of China. China has noticed and taken that into account, though China thinks that is the wrong course of action.I think Abe found the lethargic economy of Japan a challenge and saw an opportunity to focus on the military as a means to create a national reawakening. He hoped for two things. First, he wanted Japan’s economy to rise and grow. ( some call his effort Abenomics) Second, he wanted Japan’s nationalism to rise again. His right wing leaning and backing gave him the power to attempt such a rise. It is not clear today, whether Japan will continue that national awakening, but there is a core of people in Japan that want a reincarnation of imperial Japan.In reality, Abe was a puppet of the US and it was the US that fed the narrative of nationalism that would support its focus on surrounding China with enemies. Japan’s right wing was the right mechanism to initiate that change in direction. US modern arms were supplied to Japan to quicken the pace of its rise as a military force from a purely domestic defensive force to one that could operate abroad. Modernization and growth of the military gave strength to its economy and moved Japan’s nationalists towards seeing Japan once again as a strong military force. The current Prime Minister Fumio Kushida is following in the path of Abe, and tries to tows his strong militaristic line. It seems pathetic that Japan cannot revitalize its civilian sector to awaken its rise and its bias towards its military could cause Japan to have the same failed symptoms as the US. Japan is the only Asian country to sanction Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. For that, Russia has cancelled all talks and negotiations with Japan that have to do with the northern Kurile Islands and Japan’s participation in energy exploration with Russia in Siberia.Having said that, Japan stumbled during the pandemic and continues to this day.

5,Where did that come from? Japan is not under the control of the US. As for military technology the Pentagon wants Japan to develop and produce as many new weapons including cyber-tech as they can.

7,"China’s BRI is about soft power, an ambitious attempt to help develop a very large chunk of the world that had been exploited by colonialism and western powers. But it will not be recognised as such by the West. Instead US expended every ounce of its wisdom calling it a debt trap and trying to convince the affected countries to stay away from it. By and large unsuccessful, as many see it as an opportunity to escape from the poverty trap. Almost 100 countries have signed up, including many from S.America, near neighbours of the US. Is this not ironic?

Is this not ironic? But in the current, it will not be acknowledged as soft power, because the US and UK controlled media will not allow its recognition, and will continue to bad-mouth it, no matter what.China sees trade and investment to be the means to win and influence friends. It recognizes that its political system based on a mix of Confucianism, Chinese culture and tradition, and modernity, is not suitable for every country and made no attempt to export it. It does try to encourage the learning of the Chinese language, setting up some Confucian Institutes. Quite a difficult task as Chinese is a difficult language. Such seemingly harmless institutes are being eliminated by the US government. Even the contributions it made to universities are seen to be a national security threat.Chinese culture is also quite unique. Especially as the world since WW2 is flooded with western cultures, especially American movies, songs, fashionwear, and much else. Not an exaggeration to say that consciously or unconsciously, our lifestyle copies that of the Americans, from Coke to Hollywood. And at the intellectual level, many in the world crave for an American university education. Such is the strength of American institutions, media, and propaganda, juxtaposed on the widespread use of the English language. Despite all the grief that may be attributed to the current administration, US influence is still strong, influential, and widespread.I am not sure Japan can make much boast of soft power. It too has the problem of culture and language. But it does not suffer the wrath of the English language media. And it does not mind playing the second fiddle, hanging on the American coat-tail. So from time to time it receives some praise, sometime sincere, sometime to patronise it. Universally speaking, it cannot be said to have much influence, sans sushi and sashimi. Japanese movies and TV serials are less well known than Korean’s.",100 followers,Nitin Patil,534,985,4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-Japan-was-fully-independent-today-not-under-control-of-the-US-and-fully-engaged-itself-in-development-of-military-technology-industries-and-capabilities-how-powerful-would-they-be

The U.S. then took control of Japan and drafted its Constitution. Article 9 of that Constitution states that “the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation.” This clause outlaws Japan from maintaining “land, sea and air forces, as well as other war potential.” The arrangement means the U.S. must provide for Japan’s defense. Under the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security, America is obligated to station U.S. forces within Japan’s borders and potential conflict zones.But the Japanese reinterpreted Article 9, America agreed, and have been building their own military and are becoming more comfortable with it. In 2015, 71 percent of Japanese said that they were happy with the size and scope of Japan’s Self-Defense Forces. With the U.S. slowly backing away from its defense commitments, China increasingly becoming more belligerent toward its neighbors, and an unstable North Korea in possession of nuclear weapons that could raze Japan, the Japanese are seriously looking to build up their military once again to counter these threats.Thus, yes, Japan has built up her military, but in keeping with the concept of “non-aggression.” It is true that China, which suffered terribly under WWII Japanese aggression, has condemned any remilitarization. This said, Japan is a close American ally; there has been NO American interference with Japan. The U.S. integrates its military with their Japanese counterpart in military exercises, with an eye to Chinese military expansion in Eastern Pacific waters. They sell arms to Japan. The United States, soon after the Japanese War Crimes Trials, ending in 1948, forgave Japan. Unlike with Germany, the U.S. never went after the many war criminals who escaped the net of immediate American wrath post-war.
