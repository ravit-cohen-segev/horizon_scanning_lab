It is hard to work out what was going on in this period due to a paucity of historical evidence. One way to get around that is to look at pottery.

By 500 AD no-one appears to be making wheel turned pottery. No new mortared buildings are being erected. Writing disappears in Anglo-Saxon England in the fifth century and doesn't come back until the return of Christianity in the sixth.Good comparison is between that of a 4th century Roman farmstead at Bradley Hill in Somerset and Yeavering; the royal estate site of the 6th and 7th century kings of Northumbria (see pic below). The Roman farmstead had a tiled roof, contained 3,500 shards of Roman pottery and nearly 78 coins. Yeavering was made entirely of perishable materials which have left no trace. The pottery is scarce and that which remains falls apart very easily.  Little trace remains, despite the site being used over a century by around 100 people – the Roman farmstead was occupied by around 20 people for around 50 years.It is hard to explain something as basic as wheel turned pottery disappearing but a good theory is that the market collapses. There is no market which would require people specialized enough to invest in potters wheels to make pots because to do so they would have to sell more pots. Technologies depend on a market in order for people to put the investment in to train themselves and make specialized tools.It is hard to explain something as basic as wheel turned pottery disappearing but a good theory is that the market collapses.

Were the American people subject to a genocide? Did the Taliban conquer and occupy significant amounts of US territory? Was there a humiliating peace treaty whereby the US was forced to pay large reparations to the Taliban?In Asymmetric Warfare, between a technologically advanced side and a technologically weaker side employing insurgency and guerilla tactics, there is more than just an asymmetry in technology and industrial capacity. There is also an asymmetry in stakes, commitment, and will. The two sides do not have the same degree of interests at stake in the conflict, and so their commitment to the conflict is different. What they are willing to do, and to endure, in order to win, is also unequal.The technologically weaker side only has a chance at victory if the asymmetry in these other aspects is on their side sufficiently to counterbalance the difference in technology and industrial might.In the Boer War, the Boer’s engaged in insurgency tactics against the technologically, industrially, and numerically superior British Empire. The British won in the end by employing tactics and strategies which today we could consider to amount to ethnic cleansing.And that IS the template on how a technologically superior force can defeat an insurgency. The technologically stronger side loses against insurgencies when they are unwilling to go to such lengths in order to secure victory.And the reason they are not willing to go to such lengths is because the outcome of the conflict DOESN’T MATTER ENOUGH to them. The asymmetry in stake and commitment lies on the other side.The Taliban were not and never could be, an existential threat to the United States, and as such, the US people were not willing to allow their military to “take the gloves off” and use the types of tactics that it would have been necessary to secure ultimate victory. On the other hand, the conflict WAS an existential threat to the Taliban, and as a result they were willing to do anything it took to win.What would the conflict have been like if the Taliban actually were, or were perceived to be, a true existential threat to the United States, such that the people of the US were willing to adopt an “our survival versus theirs, we’ll do and pay and suffer whatever it takes to win” mentality?Well we have already seen what the US is capable of doing in such a situation. Look at the fate of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan in WWII. Carpet and firebombing populations without care for civilian casualties? Allowed. Massive military losses on our own side in operations like those on D-Day? Acceptable and even planned for in advance. Suspension of certain individual liberties on the home front? Democratically approved. Conversion of civilian industry to a military footing (ie reduction of civilian commercial production)? Of course!The conflict in Afghanistan would have been over within months, if not weeks, if this had been the case, and the entire country a smoking ruin.",1 follower,John Gallagher,7.8K,850,2.4M,2016,https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-develop-a-good-and-an-advanced-technological-culture

The Royal Navy had only a few Harrier jump jets to defend their invasion force. If the Argentines had had a bit more range so they could have spent more time on target, the British would not have dared send their ships in to unload troops.Since the 17th Century, one of the best gauges of a first line Western power has been the size and quality of its fleet. You could tell whose economy was dominating the continent, who possessed the best technologies and universities, and whose government was best organized, by how many ships of the line that nation could field, assuming it had a coastline and ports.In the 21st Century, air forces are a better gauge than navies. Of course, the world is more peaceful and nations are less competitive now, so some countries have small air forces because they don’t need them. but you can still use the quality of a nation’s air force to help judge how capable that nation is likely to be in defending itself.Navies are secondary to air forces in this regard, but the principle is the same. There is no terrain at sea, save for a submarine, no cities to hide in. Your navy either survives based its missiles and torpedoes and its air cover, or it doesn’t survive.","62,882 followers",Jay Bazzinotti,2.5K,22.2K,179.7M,2016,https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-develop-a-good-and-an-advanced-technological-culture

Total Taliban deaths were 20-35,000 (per Wikipedia).Same story a bit earlier in Vietnam. The US won pretty much every single major battle. 282,000 dead (that’s both US and South Vietnamese—the US alone lost far fewer) against 444,000 North Vietnamese and Viet Cong dead. We left because we had no reason to be there in the first place and as such were unwilling to tolerate the casualties.Another commonality there is that we were fighting in someone else's homeland.Now, a naval war? Ah, now that's different. By the time you get close enough to be a threat we know you're a threat, and you're dead. Soon we'll have stealth destroyers that look like fishing boats on radar and are packing railguns. Have fun with that.The other thing is... in a naval war, it's no one's home. And if it's anyone's, it's ours--we've got naval bases all over the place and we've dominated the seas since WWII.So you're fighting in open warfare, on even terms, against an absurd number of powerful, high-tech warships and aircraft. We have five times more carriers than the next country, and ours are bigger. Our Naval Air Force is the second-largest air force in the world, and number one is our actual Air Force.

Well in this situation if a major disaster occurs and that a collapse of civilization was happening (domino collapse of all the services necessary to maintain the societal mechanism, for example: electricity => IT => money => transport => trade => ...), then there are good chances that strictly no trace will remain of such a societal organization in the future.—Another remark about this idea is that when time goes by, everything in the plain gets completely washed by water, so as to leave hardly any trace on the horizon of say 20 thousand years. This is why when we look beyond 20 thousand years we only find cavemen (the only place where traces remain), so would it be possible that a civilization existed in their time and that those of the caves were a bit like our homeless, excluded from said society? If that were the case we would have made horrible misinterpretations on this topic.It's a funny idea, which I don't take to be true, but the underlying idea is interesting which is why I am presenting it here.—Then the question can even be extended to the galaxy: if an alien society had developed to an ultimate point and then some kind of collapse had happened to them, the question is: in what ultimate form can we imagine that an extraterrestrial society organizes and spreads?A quick reasoning would tell us that a civilization would first try to colonize the other planets itself, and thus becoming a galactic civilization, which is already a lot. But quickly it would become obvious that many biotopes are not habitable by said species, and that terraform then colonize then build something to start again would take from 300 years to a few thousand years depending on the initial conditions on the planet, which in fact a long and laborious process as well as risky.While on the other hand, another method of colonization can be easily imagined: sending kinds of machines, robots that know how to replicate, evolve, adapt, and love to organize themselves in ever more complex and efficient forms. So the extraterrestrial species would have a way of exploring without really taking any risk or being present.So it could very well be that it has already happened somewhere and that the progression of the process is invisible for now, or that it is visible and that what we call ""life"" is the result of this process…",0 followers,Claire Jordan,744,45.6K,295.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-develop-a-good-and-an-advanced-technological-culture

The “ancients” had lots of incredible technology that we have a hard time replicating today. One of the most advanced was barrel making. Do you know anything about barrel making? It’s one of the most advanced technologies of all time. Coopers had to serve an apprenticeship for years. The Coopers who failed ended up making “dry barrels” that only held produce or things that wouldn’t spoil. There are very few people who know how to make a barrel today. Even Jack Daniels, the biggest barrel maker in the world, uses an automated process now because making them by hand is too slow. The art of coopering is dying. There are very, very few people who know how to make a barrel left in the world and fewer every year, yet barrel making was an advanced technology that changed the entire world for literally thousands of years.Incidentally. the most prolific barrel in the world today is the ASB or American Standard Barrel that hold 53 gallons because America makes more barrels than anyone else in the world. Many used Jack Daniels barrels are re-used to make other kinds of liquor in other parts of the world.Do you know who the highest paid man in the community was in “ancient times”? It was the Wheelwright.Making a wheel from wood with an axle that attaches to a cart and doesn’t fall apart within a mile or two is one of the most “advanced technologies” of all time. Without it, most civilizations would have failed or failed to spread. Cart wheels are complex and the forces must play against each other continuously to hold the wheel together as it rolls. A Cartwright made as much then as a jet airline pilot back does today. In the 1880s when the average wage was $1.50 a day, the Wheelwright was making 90 dollars a week. On the Mayflower they brought one single cart over to America and it was the most valuable thing on the ship manifest, worth more than 10 times the next most valuable thing on the ship. Can you make a cartwheel? It’s an “advanced technology” that very, very few people can make today, even with machine tools.What is an “advanced technology”?",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,3.2K,5.6K,427.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-develop-a-good-and-an-advanced-technological-culture

Previously from around 700 AD Damascus steel sword were found to have such carbon nanolayers.“The average diameter of single-walled carbon nanotube found to be about 0.6 ± 0.05 nm. This is the lowest among the single-walled carbon nanotubes reported from artefacts so far and close to the theoretically predicted value (0.4 nm)…” Kokarneswaran, Manivannan, et al. ""Discovery of carbon nanotubes in sixth century BC potteries from Keeladi, India."" Scientific Reports 10.1 (2020): 1-6.The people of ~600 BCE may have added or coated something similar to plant-sap to the inside of the pots, and subject it to the nearly 1100-1400 degree Celsius high-temperature fire treatment as seen in kilns which may have led to the formation of the coating which has likely strengthened the pot and made the coating durable.Experts opine that the ancient Tamil civilisation of this time were aware of, and mastered high-temperature processing, which was evident from the plenty of fine black and red effect was achieved by high temperature firing temperatures at about 1100 degrees in the presence of carbon-rich matter and iron-rich red soils.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2008,https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-develop-a-good-and-an-advanced-technological-culture
