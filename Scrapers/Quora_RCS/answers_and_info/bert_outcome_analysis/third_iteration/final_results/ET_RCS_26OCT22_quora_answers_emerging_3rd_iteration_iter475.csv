History indicates that the University was built during the reign of the Gupta emperor Kumaragupta. The history of the university can be divided into two parts, one was the growth of the university from sixth century to ninth, and second was the gradual decline and dissolution during the ninth century to the thirteenth. The decline of this university was done by the invasion of Bakhtiyar Khalji who destroyed it by fire.The total area of excavation of the Nalanda University Ruins archaeological complex is about 14 hectares. The edifices are of red bricks and the gardens are extremely beautiful. The buildings are divided by a central walkway. The monasteries are situated on the east of the walkway and the temples are situated in the west. Other places of interests are the Nalanda Archaeological museum which lies opposite to the entrance gate of the university. It has a beautiful collection of Buddhist and Hindu sculptures. One can also see the Nava Nalanda Mahavihara and the Huien Tsang Memorial Hall.Facts about Nalanda UniversityBuilt in the 6th century B.C., the Nalanda University was a stand alone International University. It was the ancient seat of learning and various subjects were taught in the university. Chinese travellers are a well known source about the Nalanda University. The University was extremely important and destruction of it led to a major loss. It was attacked thrice by the invaders; Huns, Gaudas and Bhaktiyar Khilji.

Their drinking water system is unfiltered. Their waste systems rely on shipping millions of tons of garbage anywhere from Pennsylvania to China, after they were told to stop merely dumping it in the ocean as they had long been doing.A technically advanced city takes into account all human needs including transportation, communications, utilities, waste management and so forth and emphasizes energy efficiency and sustainability. To have an entire city meet these standards, the entire city would ideally be entirely new, and the West isn’t in the habit of creating whole new cities.The most advanced cities taking these needs into consideration are currently under construction in China as the antidote for old-world cities like Beijing that are drowning in their own waste and fast running out of drinking water.
