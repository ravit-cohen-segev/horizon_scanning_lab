The difference is one wakes up in the year 2018 and the other wakes up in 1818.The latter wakes up chilly, to the sound of a rooster crowing, from a bed of straw he shares with lots of bedbugs. Neither his night shirt nor his bedding is terribly clean, and he splashes water on his face from a bowl to help wake up before looking outside to try to guess what the weather will be like today. He, like all of his family and most people he knows, is a farmer, so the weather matters a lot to him, and any other news will be a long time coming, including that his brother, who lives just a couple towns away, broke his leg a few days back and passed away from an infection. He works from sun up to sundown because he has little machinery and he would probably work longer if he had access to something better than candles to provide light.Our other man wakes up in 2018 to the sound of an alarm clock, he is not hot or cold because his home has central heating. His pajamas and bedding are quite clean because he has a washer and dryer. He is a bit groggy because he can light his home at the flick of a switch so often stays up later than he should. Fortunately he has hot coffee and a hot shower to help him wake up, and he checks his email while drinking that coffee and listening to the news and weather. He already knows his brother broke his leg a few days back, even though he lives a long distance away, and of course he does not die from an infection, he’s just at home bored and probably would welcome a phone call.These are two very different lives. They are separated by three centuries, a dozen generations, and a slew of inventions both major and minor. Those inventions, major and minor, have altered our civilization profoundly during that time. My answer however is not those inventions, but rather the ones emerging nowadays that will change our lives once more, many of which get little notice in the news.Even those emerging technologies that get reported with much pomp and hype often bypass a lot of the simple yet drastic changes they will bring to how we go about our normal day. A survey of technologies that don’t get talked about a lot, but will change the world we live in, requires introducing those technologies and explaining the potential of each. The trick is that technologies that don’t get a lot of fanfare don’t get it because their value and applications are not too obvious. Fundamentally, technology is about making our lives better, safer, and more convenient. To talk about the impact technology will have on our lives we need to go deeper than just what the technology does, like how a fusion reactor makes electricity cheaper and renewable, an obvious benefit, but also how it alters our day to day life. Cheaper electricity is awesome, an energy source that doesn’t run out or cause environmental problems is awesome, but it is easy to overlook all the other benefits that come along with them.We need to cover several such technologies. So to do this we will walk through a day in the life of two people, Sam, who lives nowadays in the year 2018, and Hannah, who lives just a few generations from now inOkay,What’s interesting about Sam and Hannah’s lives is that they both live in a pretty automated and high tech civilization.We spend a lot of time on this answer talking about futures in Hannah’s Era or even centuries further ahead, and we tend to focus on big things. New spaceships, new energy sources, giant constructs we could build around our own star or other stars and the ships that will get you there. Not today though, for today it does not matter that Ted was actually playing golf in a rotating habitat orbiting the Earth, complaining about how the spin throws off his normal swing. We care that his golf partner was actually lying down at home on his bed playing with him in virtual reality, and that he, Ted, and Hannah were thousands of kilometers apart, but all felt like they were in the same environment chatting, even though they were not in the same place and quite possibly all saw different environments. We don’t care that they have rocket ships with big fusion powered drives that can get to Mars in a week, we care about them having cars they can sleep in, fully relaxed in the knowledge that it could drive through a blizzard without a risk of accident and that if one did somehow happen, a dozen safety systems would pop on deploying airbags and restraints before the vehicle even hit the target, and that if somehow even that wasn’t enough, an automated ambulance would be on the scene in moments with robots controlled by experts hundreds of kilometers away piloting them, and already knowing from the vehicle monitors exactly what happened and where all the injuries were and how severe. We also don’t particularly care that Hannah’s son can do classes online, we already have ever-improving technology allowing that. We care about the automated interactive aspects of that, something called Affective Computing, or computers and systems that can recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human body language and affects. Fundamentally it is this sort of technology that holds the strongest potential to revolutionize our lives.Sure, a student can watch a recorded lecture and pick from several variations of it by other people covering that same topic, just as you can do now on YouTube for instance. But it is aThe Uncanny Valley, our tendency to respond more negatively to things which seem closer to human than further away, is a big hurdle to making such simulations, but if you can get past it, you open the door for books that don’t just get read aloud by some cold disjointed voice, but can be real-time performed like a TV show or interactive virtual environment without needing actors. It’s a lot easier to learn the history of the world when instead of a book or lecture or even historical TV drama, a person can land in that environment where the bits they find boring can be seamlessly detected and altered, so they remain focused on the important knowledge while enjoying themselves. It’s nice to have a test that doesn’t need to have questions checking your reading comprehension, because it already knows what that was from monitoring you while you read, and even nicer if most text can adapt as you’re reading it to rephrase the information or the question to better communicate to you as an individual. It’s like the automatic translator that doesn’t just hear what someone said in another language and translate it word for word, but instead can convert all the idioms and expressions into another language and its own idioms and expressions. It will be even cooler if one day we can just download knowledge and skills into your head, like in the film theWe didn’t focus on cool new power production methods like fusion today, we focused on ways to conveniently get power. Wireless energy transmission by magnetic induction or energy beaming, smaller and better batteries and solar panels, or harvesting energy right from the person. Leaching just a little energy away from every motion, maybe even putting devices in the body that could steal a bit of energy from your own food to transmit it to devices in or on you. IPredicting the future of technology is always a hit and miss game, often in hindsight the stuff is obvious, but can’t be predicted in advance. Some technology and its impact is easy enough to predict, but what makes them inaccurate in most cases is all those tiny secondary advantages and changes and those tend to focus on human desire and convenience. It’s not that hard to predict faster computers, the internet, satellites, or cell phones. What’s hard to predict is people using those to post a picture of what they ate for lunch. Once you do, you can imagine that a lot of restaurants will advertise online and show photos of the menu. It will seem obvious in hindsight that someone is going to make a piece of software that can look at that image and make some smart guesses about its nutritional value and calorie count. It will seem obvious in hindsight that as we get more Affective Computing able to monitor your reactions, your computer will get better at showing you bits of stuff on your social media newsfeed that you’ll enjoy, and that advertisers will be able to hit you with an ad showing a picture of pizza with the toppings you like when you are just getting a little hungry and haven’t had pizza recently, and tomorrow you’ll get shown sandwiches instead. It’s predictable that 3D printers, and fast, cheap, delivery might put a dent in classic retail shopping. It’s predictable that automated vehicles, not needing expensive drivers, will make it much cheaper to deliver things or take a taxi, so that fewer people might own individual vehicles.It’sHowever, it is very easy for us miss a lot of those secondary applications that can quietly sneak in there to revolutionize our lives just as much as landing on the Moon did, or going to Mars will.Have a great day (10 april 2018) !","51,711 followers",Chris Ebbert,1.1K,11.4K,278.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-awesome-upcoming-technologies-that-can-bring-a-big-change-in-our-day-to-day-lives

Humans already (mostly) live in a world without individual biological purpose (most of us here take food and safety for granted).We still have the advancement of our species, however, and this is something important. We also have the individual struggles that come with trying to think of the right thing to say.Imagine a world where, when you wondered about something to make someone feel happy, Google would drop the answer right inside your brain? No effort involved. The words aren’t yours… they’re an AI’s.I don’t believe that AI will destroy the world or become self-aware like many predict. I believe that AI will slowly conquer every struggle that humans deal with, and so, slowly conquer every visage (aspect) of purpose.That isn’t to say that there isn’t hopeIronically, that hope fades a bit right alongside this answer, as the AI named “The Quora Distribution Algorithm” slowly stops spreading this answer to your feeds…",UNKNOWN,Sougata Pal (Сугата Пал),4.6K,524,2.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-awesome-upcoming-technologies-that-can-bring-a-big-change-in-our-day-to-day-lives

At the age of 29, she gave birth to the third child. Just 7 days before the child was born, she lost her husband. She was never supported by brothers in law and they treated her very badly. She couldn't pay Rs. 45 as fees of her daughter’s school. Neither was given a penny to purchase books for her further education. So she was alone with 3 small kids. But never did she give up.At the age of 30,she gave B.A exam and cleared it. At the age of 31 cleared B.Ed . And started teaching in school. She also completed her M.A next few years. At the age of 32, she realised the importance of education and decided to come back to Maharashtra for giving the best education to the young ones. Stayed with her parents for a year but then decided to stay Independently. Stayed in 1 room with the 3 young ones.This was the biggest step for a lady who used to stay in a home which had 25 rooms and 17 helpers. Travelled 35 kms (one way) and was teaching in a school. She is the former teacher of that school. At the age of 36, she decided to shift to Pune. Single parent and mother of 3 and affording to stay in Pune was a very big deal. She never took help from anyone and is a women with a very high self esteem and willpower . At the Age of 41, she received an award from the ex-home minister R.R. Patil.

Slowly, the answers written by top Quorans started to fascinate me.Specially, the English language part.I so wished to write like them. I began writing in April 2017, but most of my answers got collapsed. My poor language skills and lack of knowledge somehow hindered my writing. Disappointed, I continued the journey as a mere reader.However, things changed rapidly in October ’17, and I was hit by severe depression after going through a series of traumatic experiences which, for obvious reasons, I can't talk much about.Note that I'm using the word ‘depression’ here with utmost responsibility.I gained considerable weight. I stopped going out, meeting friends, and spent sleepless nights. At times, I would go without eating for days.Never in my life had I felt that miserable before.The worst part was that I was away from my family. Having lost interest in everything, and with no one to share my feelings with, I felt helpless. I was stuck in a vicious circle.Unable to take it anymore, I reached out for help. My best friend, while suggesting different things, also encouraged me to have a go at writing. I was initially reticent but finally conceded.Until November, I had answered 5–6 questions.Since November, I began writing regularly.To my amazement, I started getting hooked on writing.Quora kept me engaged and, most importantly, happy. The kind and encouraging words of fellow Quorans really made a world of difference in my attitude towards life.I thank them all.Within days, I recovered beyond my imagination.I would not say Quora changed my life.It rather restored my ‛life’.I have become the person I was before- Happy.And I'm grateful to this platform for that.:-)",448 followers,Joey Carmello,20.9K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-awesome-upcoming-technologies-that-can-bring-a-big-change-in-our-day-to-day-lives

If they can’t figure out the answer to something just by Googling it, then many of them think that the answer isn’t worth figuring out.When I was a student, we had Cliff Notes… summarized versions of novels… for students who were too lazy to read the actual novel. Cliff Notes were pretty much banned in school. It was considered cheating. Now, students have a variety of websites with those same kinds of summaries, and many students use them. They may still read or skim the novel, but they use the online summaries to understand what they just half-assed read.Or, even better, they just find a youtube video of someone explaining the novel to them, so they don’t even have to read the summary, but just listen to someone else explain it to them.But the easiest way to see how tech has made students lazy is when I ask them to write a story or essay on notebook paper instead of typing it. They will groan and complain about it, begging to just type it instead. I call it being “hand lazy.”They’ve also gotten lazier about organization, planning, and other executive functioning skills. Instead of writing down their homework in a physical planner, most of them claim they will just “ask the group chat when they get home.” Of course, many of them forget to actually do that. They don’t worry about taking home the correct books for their homework. As long as just one of them has the book, that person can send pictures of the necessary pages to everyone else. (Or just send the answers… yes, students, we know when you do that.)Some might call those “problem solving skills.” Others might call it laziness.
