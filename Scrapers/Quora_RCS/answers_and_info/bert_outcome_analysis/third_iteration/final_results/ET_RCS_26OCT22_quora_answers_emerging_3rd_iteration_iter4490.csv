They appreciated science, and could have very well led the scientific revolution. This might have been possible, yet I would not expect them to create such cutting edge schools of thought at the same time as Europeans did. Their politics, culture, philosophies and trade was so entirely different from Europeans that it could not have happened within the same timing. Even if they did, it would be hard to spread such ideas worldwide without the same trade influence, colonies, and political ties as the Europeans.Asia, however, could have done it. Their society was highly developed. There were highly successful trade routes and large political alliances which bound areas together. They had no shortage of scholars and scientists. Asia, being so large, could have easily spread such ideas into Africa and up into Europe, or along trade routes like the Silk...",1 follower,Maciej Kania,1.3K,2.5K,6.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-Europe-hadn-t-engaged-in-the-scientific-revolution-and-enlightenment-at-all-would-another-continent-have-ever-brought-technology-science-and-human-development-to-their-current-levels

4,"I worked at MSFT from 87 to 98. I had multiple meetings with Bill, from the days when you had a meeting with him like you would with anybody else to the days when just getting on his schedule was like meeting with POTUS.Back in the day MSFT was full of really really smart people. For example, Nathan Myhrvold was an astrophysicist who had done some stuff with Stephen Hawking. And that kind of background wasn't that uncommon among the people there.

Lots of PhDs in lots of fields (not just CS). (I once remarked to a Really Smart Friend that I always felt like the dumb guy in the room; he looked surprised and said that was how he always felt.)And yet, with all these smart people, who remember specialized in some small aspect of Microsoft, when they would meet with Bill he would almost always pick out very quickly the things they had missed in their product plans and strategies. HE was invariably the smartest guy in a room of brilliance.Let me give a specific example from the last time I saw him. I was in the marketing department on a product team that was launching our first ever product for ecommerce (Microsoft Commerce Server). It was a very small team on a product that was not expected to make a great deal of money, but was necessary from a strategic standpoint. My point is, it wasn't exactly on Bill's radar. We had gotten the product via an acquisition, ported it to NT (remember NT?) and were ready to launch it.Somehow we managed to get Bill lined up for the launch event, which was super hard to do because every product team wanted Bill at their events--a Bill appearance would guarantee lots of turnout, both by press and customers, as well as press coverage. So it was a major score.  We had one very brief planning meeting with Bill several months in advance and, when the PM started telling him about the product, he cut him off saying, ""I don't want to fill up my head with a bunch of stuff that I'll just have to learn again later.""A couple of weeks before the launch at the San Jose Convention Center, we had a briefing with Bill on the product and launch, where we went over features, messaging, competition, etc. We had an hour I believe. Two weeks later and Bill gets hustled in back stage, surrounded by his (now ever present) ""bubble""--PR flacks, assistants, security people. Bill went out on stage and did a complete in-depth presentation on the product, space, future, etc, all from memory, no notes. Then dashed off to his next meeting.","1,301 followers",John Browne,7.9K,377,4.6M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Why-doesn-t-Bill-Gates-engage-his-children-with-Technology

9,"Bill himself put it this way:“I want my kids to have enough to do anything but not enough to do nothing.”What he meant was that if they were given hundreds of millions, or billions, which he could easily do, what would be the result?

Certainly, he could leave them many times that amount. But what would be the point? So that they could live like barons or princes of Lake Washington, sitting in their baronial estates, and their children and grandchildren doing the same, for many generations?Certainly other great entrepreneurs and creators of wealth have done just that. They wanted to create, or re-create, aristocratic dynasties here in the United States. This is a theme ofAnd what do Tom and Daisy plan to do with all that wealth? Absolutely nothing, except sit back and lord it over all the less fortunate people… and then leave their children enough to do the same.My humble opinion is that Bill is a different kind of person. Having amassed that wealth, he turned his mind to the question:As for his kids (whom I know nothing about), I don’t think they have anything to complain about. They’ll be able to get the very finest educations in the country, if not the world, and be guaranteed to have enough to live on, very well, for the rest of their lives. They’ll be able to live nicely in any place in the world… and, if Bill has their way, those kids will also find something useful to do to benefit the planet.And they’ll have something like $10 million (in today’s money) to do just that.","2,262 followers",Geetendra Abhinav,37.8K,63,2.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-doesn-t-Bill-Gates-engage-his-children-with-Technology

Bill Gates democratized computing like no other person did - neither the UNIX folks nor the Mac folks opened computing to grandmas and poor kids alike. Thus, he is a target for the snobs.For all the Bill Gates bashing on monopolistic attitudes of Microsoft (part of that is deserved due to the Netscape episode and its long term lock on the OS market) on the whole Microsoft did more to break up monopolies in computing & bring a very diversified market. This it did by breaking the Hardware-Software tight coupling that restricted production to only those companies with expertise in both. Breaking this coupling allowed a variety of companies ranging from Dell and Compaq to build the hardware and thousands of independent vendors to make the software. Whole national economies were impacted as east asian countries readily jumped to hardware superiority while India and other countries took up software. It is not without reason that Windows ecosystem is so rich in diversity.Bill Gates also found the right balance between the monarchy of Apple & IBM and the anarchy of UNIX/Linux world. In the former, getting your software built for their systems required obeisance. In the latter world, there was a long time little monetary incentive with no clear business structure.Also, the Silicon Valley elite doesn't use any of Microsoft products and thus it is far easy for them to ignore his contributions on building the market to which they serve.Make no mistake - Steve Jobs is a fascinating character and he has built an extraordinary company. He deserves to be an icon for the revolutionary quality he brought to computing. In fact, even I don't use any Microsoft product now.But if I use Mac and Linux exclusively now, it is because I was able to start on Windows that my parents could afford and I could quickly understand. In my student days, Macs were way out of my reach and Linux distros were way too buggy to be useful for consumers [I would have to keep reinstalling those Mandrake and Debian distros every month].Bill Gates changed lives and is changing lives at a scale that neither Silicon Valley nor the tech media writers can comprehend.",39 followers,Eric DeFazio,879,0,0,2016,https://www.quora.com/Why-doesn-t-Bill-Gates-engage-his-children-with-Technology

It is not clear how privacy is protected especially with hackers who may gain access to personal information.These online services are for profit and like other privately owned companies a quota is expected to be met and sometimes people working with this pressure may short change their client as they have only so much time in a day to meet that demand.If a corporation is going to offer something such as online therapy they should be regulated and the client should be the top priority and receive nothing less than exemplary care.More Technology Use Linked to Mental Health Issues in At-Risk AdolescentsCan technology be helpfull in treating mental health problems?",1 follower,Jordan Yates,517,2.8K,47.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-Europe-hadn-t-engaged-in-the-scientific-revolution-and-enlightenment-at-all-would-another-continent-have-ever-brought-technology-science-and-human-development-to-their-current-levels

Yes, that helped us feel like we were still in control.From this point forward, there may be some protest. There may be proposals that get some consideration. We’ll look at those proposals most likely on the very devices those proposals are referring to. We’ll all feel good to ‘like’ some things that acknowledge where we’re heading. We’ll all want to think we’ve still got a handle on it. Yes, we’ll all want to hold on to that. If only we had a free hand to use to grab such a handle, we just might try and reach for it.It’s just not very likely that this problem goes away.
