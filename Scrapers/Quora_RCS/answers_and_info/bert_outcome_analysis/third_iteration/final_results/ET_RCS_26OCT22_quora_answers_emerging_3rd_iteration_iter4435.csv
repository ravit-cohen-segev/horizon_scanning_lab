If ancient peoples had been making CAT scan machines or nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, we would know about it.It's possible that there have been societies that took care of their people better than we do, ensuring that everyone had a vote and access to justice and health care (such as it was).

No matter how much technology we rely on, relationships are still foundational to sales (which involves personal interactions with customers) and sales management (which involves personal interactions with the sales team).The other pitfall is to become intimidated by technology and not harness its power properly. Technology in sales can be overwhelming, so it is essential to remember that, as a manager, you don’t need to embrace every new technology.
