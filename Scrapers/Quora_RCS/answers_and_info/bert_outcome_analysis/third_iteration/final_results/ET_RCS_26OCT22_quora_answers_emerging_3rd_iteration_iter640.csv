2,"Do you think missiles or missile countermeasures will come out on top once technology has reached it's peak for those technologies?Neither. That’s not how this works.It’s a constant battle between offense and defense, same as we see with armor vs weapons. There is no endpoint to this game. It simply ebbs and flows as one side gains a temporary advantage over the other.Another thing to consider is that there are always trade offs to be made. A missile might be developed that fuses half a dozen different sensors together to overcome countermeasures but that missile might too large for a MANPADSDo you think missiles or missile countermeasures will come out on top once technology has reached it's peak for those technologies?Neither.

A missile might be developed that fuses half a dozen different sensors together to overcome countermeasures but that missile might too large for a MANPADS system or maybe even for a fighter craft. Likewise, there might be more complex countermeasures but they might be too large and too expensive to outfit onto most platforms.","29,923 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,1.4K,7.7K,249.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-university-for-technology-to-study-in-Turkey
3,"People have often said missiles will make other weapons obsolete. But technology keeps showing that missiles are far from perfect and there are ways of overcoming themCurrently we are at the start of a new generation of defensive technologies for tanks and armored vehicles from missiles. Actie missile defence is using technology to detect incoming missiles then prevent that missile from being effective. These may mostly be using explosive weapons to destroy missile warheads. But many other ideas are being developed to stop missiles.Many types of weapons go through a similar process, a fight foPeople have often said missiles will make other weapons obsolete.

But many other ideas are being developed to stop missiles.Many types of weapons go through a similar process, a fight for survival. Now ships, aircraft and tanks have defenses. Some use guns or laser or other means for protection.No one can say where this struggle will end. Future missiles may be hypersonic weapons and torpedos may be supercavitating that will be much faster than current torpedos. New technologies are constantly being developed and being applied to many weapons.Missiles will remain relevant weapons but they will continue to face opposition from counter technologies. There is no sign of technology stopping..",19 followers,Noor Alam,587,77,1.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-university-for-technology-to-study-in-Turkey
4,"Personally, I predict that countermeasures are eventually going to win out. This is mostly due to lasers, though, not counter missiles. In fact, I think that the rail gun is going to really be the game-changer when this happens simply due to the fact that it is a kinetic weapon and not an explosive so it will be more difficult (but probably not impossible) to stop with a laser.",201 followers,Rohit B,678,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-missiles-or-missile-countermeasures-will-come-out-on-top-once-technology-has-reached-its-peak-for-those-technologies
5,"Currently I am a PhD student in Propulsion, Aeronautics and Astronautics Engineering, Purdue University. I did summer internship last year (2014) in King Abdullah University of Science & Technology (KAUST). Combining my Master and PhD I am in US grad school for over 4-1/2 years. I did my undergraduate from India. Visiting Saudi Arabia and KAUST was a real opportunity for me to understand research environment and trends other than India and United States.Currently I am a PhD student in Propulsion, Aeronautics and Astronautics Engineering, Purdue University.

6,"The minimum GPA is 3.5 for admission to KAUST. To be admitted as a PhD student you typically have to graduate from one of the notable universities in your country and also secure the support of a PhD advisor. Most of my graduate students came from the top schools in either India (ITTs) or China (Beijing University, USTC, etc). Sometimes I would admit a student from a lesser rank Chinese university if they proved exceptional in their Skype interview with me, had a technically astute publication record and performed well as an intern.

One of my students was Saudi, and proved to be be one of the best PhD students in my 32 years of teaching+research. He had a BS from a school in Texas, an MS from Stanford, and worked for Aramco for several years. I taught at U of Utah from 1985 to 2009 and, on average, my grad students at KAUST were more productive than the ones at University of Utah. And so was I because of the tremendous supercomputing, geophysical equipment, and research dollars support at KAUST. I had some outstanding students at U of Utah, but I did not have the critical computing and research support like I have at KAUST.","21,936 followers",Vidhi Khandel,20K,182,11.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-university-for-technology-to-study-in-Turkey
