3,"Automation has been a concern for workers and policy makers for centuries. It is still a legitimate concern.What if 50% of the jobs are done by robots?Case 1: I assume that theAutomation has been a concern for workers and policy makers for centuries. It is still a legitimate concern.What if 50% of the jobs are done by robots?Case 1: I assume that theAnd in the developed world too there are plenty of challenges, especially in geriatrics. They don’t have enough nurses or caretakers. I believe robots will take up a lot of these. Robots could also handle customer service and concierge in those places as big chain stores have taken these markets providing a very impersonal touch.And robots will also do a lot of new jobs - such as cleaning up solar panels in the middle of a desert, cleaning up trash in high voltage power lines & windmills, prospecting for metals at the bottom of oceans, clearing up plastic from water bodies, compacting land fills etc.Assuming there are a 2 billion jobs in 2017, the number of jobs could go to 5 billion in 2025, of which if half are done by robots, we still win. The key is to push for creating a number of jobs.Case 2: Assuming thatThis would require a lot of restructuring of the economic policy. It would not be a bad thing for humans to reduce the number of work hours. We are already having less time for our children, parents and spouses. We spend most of our daylight working and this would appear as a crazy-barbaric thing in the future. It increases our stress levels and makes for an unhappy, unhealthy society.What if we all could have our work times cut into half, but still being paid the same? That would require the governments to tax the firms appropriately - they don’t need to increase corporate taxes, but make sure all firms pay 35% of profits in taxes and don’t do what companies like GE and Apple do - skipping most of their tax payments with wicked accounting.In parallel, they have to create a minimum welfare program where all citizens get basic necessities - food, clothing, shelter, books, healthcare through a universal basic income. The cost of these will be a lot cheaper by then as the robots are creating these services and thus making it more affordable for the government.All said, overall our business and political leaders cannot imagine well about the robotics industry. They keep thinking about the 1960s era robots - of big metallic machines doing automation in factories. There are a whole new fields and applications to be created that they cannot even imagine now.Think of some applications of intelligent humanoids:Robots could do to our life, what the PCs did 30 years ago. Sure, they automated some stuff and removed some jobs [typists, stenographers, secretaries] but they created whole new wonderful fields. PCs do a lot of our jobs, but they also created an equal amount of new jobs. That is what could happen to robotics - but the common public and leaders are uncompletely unaware of what is happening new in robotics.",218 followers,Alan Ham,2.7K,270,757.7K,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-good-to-have-a-technology-that-will-replace-millions-of-jobs-Will-it-not-impact-an-economy-since-it-takes-away-money-from-these-millions-of-people-and-their-spending-Is-it-not-against-the-fundamentals

Robots face vastly fewer limits on growth of their intelligence. Robots will eventually become much smarter than humans, even if that means they are only remote sensors and effectors for a server-farm sized brain. Humans were evolutionarily successful because they could evolve knowledge and social structure faster than they could evolve the DNA that encoded our structure. Robots can evolve both knowledge and structure very rapidly.We are looking at our robot descendants, and there’s little we can do about it, because robots will always be handy, helpful things, right up until the last human dies out.I wonder if the last Neantertal, looking out at all the smart, tall-walking, gracile","135,539 followers",Hector Quintanilla,3.1K,1.2K,88.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-good-to-have-a-technology-that-will-replace-millions-of-jobs-Will-it-not-impact-an-economy-since-it-takes-away-money-from-these-millions-of-people-and-their-spending-Is-it-not-against-the-fundamentals

I think that people are somewhat complacent in regard to the economic impact of AI, and will likely be ill-prepared for the changes we have to adapt to in the not-so-distant future.First, let's start with the comparisons to machinery and automation. They did indeed put factory workers out of work. In that respect, I agree AI today is similar in many applications, replacing workers who have less specialized skills, perhaps call center operators, office assistants (in a limited extent), and maybe soon, taxi drivers and truck drivers. But I would argue that AI is fundamentally different from machinery or most of the other analogies commonly made when answering this question, because AI is growing and is unlikely to stop growing. It's growing in breadth (of applications and industries), in geographic and economic scope, and in power (it's capacity to address increasingly complex tasks). A more fitting analogy would be machinery in an automobile plant that not only made the parts one day, but then learned how to assemble them the week after, and then how to design cars a year later.I think that there is little that is out of reach for advanced AI of the future. Let's leave the question of the AI singularity alone for now. Instead, I think that deep learning efforts at Google and elsewhere are making AI systems learn faster and faster, with a growing rate of acceleration. Advanced AI can now address increasingly complex tasks including medical diagnosis, stock market trading, weather prediction and human behavioral modeling. Very soon, it will be able to take the place of certain types of teachers, and find a role in education. It can already deal with complex systems in software and mathematics, and seems to be only limited in applications that require interactions with the physical world (sensors are still imperfect), and with people.So without projecting too far into the future, we can ask the question, what jobs will NOT be killed by AI? Jobs that involve labor are already (or soon to be) replaced. Jobs that require logical reasoning are being replaced, albeit at a slower rate. What are the qualities that humans have that cannot be captured by AI? Perhaps creativity, emotional responses? So perhaps researchers in academia will survive longer than most, and artists (though AI stylistic mimicry is already quite impressive and their results enjoyable), and counselors/psychologists/case workers, and decision makers like CEOs who cannot be predictable or error prone. And hopefully software engineers and algorithm designers who develop AI systems.This leaves a very, very small portion of today's jobs intact. Many say: we just need to train people to fill higher level jobs created by AI, e.g. Programmers, ML researchers. But this is no easy feat. The US educational system is struggling to meet the demands created by advanced technology today. This failure is in part responsible for the economic divide plaguing the country today. The challenge of educating the public for a job market that is both decreasing in scope and increasing in complexity, is nothing we've ever faced before.I am far from original in this opinion. But if I had to guess, I would say that AI will put far more people out of work than we can (re)train in time. That will have significant economic repercussions as corporations seeking to minimize cost will do so at the cost of rising unemployment. There will need to be dramatic changes in social policies in order to avert large scale economic disaster, first dramatic rises in minimum wage, then eventually some type of universal income/welfare.

8,"Executive summary: such a plan would result in economic disaster. It might in the short run make those who’s income is brought up happy. At the same time, it would remove most incentives to get advanced training, work harder or move up the ladder if that means increased responsibilities and/or risk.My analysis starts with which way the wage leveling would go:Executive summary: such a plan would result in economic disaster. It might in the short run make those who’s income is brought up happy. At the same time, it would remove most incentives to get advanced training, work harder or move up the ladder if that means increased responsibilities and/or risk.My analysis starts with which way the wage leveling would go:Another way to look at this: I’m required to have more qualifications than the CEO of my company. I’ve also worked twice as many years so, what makes the CEO worth roughly 10X what I make? If anyone should be angry, it should be those of us in the middle, not those at the bottom. I make just 5.5X what a bagger in their first job on a 40 hour a week job at California minimum makes.A compromise of somewhere in the middle isn't likely to work either. The closer you get to the low end, the less incentive for anyone to be another other than an entry level employee or executive level. If you go toward the high end, the economy collapses because no one, not even CEOs, can afford anything.Then we have the owners — are owners also profit capped? What happens if you make a great product, there’s a line out the door but you have to stop selling because you’ve reached the national wage cap. Who’d want to be an owner if you take all the risk of ending up with $0 but the most you can make is the same as you lowest level, least experienced employee?Okay I hear one answer loud and clear. The owner can keep selling and perhaps even should, but all net over the national cap goes to public works and charities. Does the owner at least get to decide which ones? And again, why would I want to be an owner if I can end up with 0 and yet have to give away most of what I’d make if I provide superior goods or services?Wage compression has been shown to sap incentives to work hard. That occurs when minimum wage increases but an employer doesn’t give those in the bands above minimum a comparable raise. Consider this:Minimum is $10/hour and at XYZ Corp, a new Widget stuffer makes $10/hour to start. After 6 months, a high merit stuffer get a bump to $10.50/hour. After a year, most competent stuffers make $11/hour. A senior stuffer gets a bump to $12.50/hour and a Master stuffer caps at $14.00/hour.The incentive to learn and improve — obvious to me — the company in return rewards you for it. Now let’s say minimum goes up to $11/hour and XYZ Finance concludes that they can’t bump everyone up. So here’s what happens.Stuffer: $10.00 -> $11.006 month incentive: gone because the new minimum exceeds $10.50.After 1 year: stuffer goes from $11.00/hour to $11.00/hour. The new minimum wage has compressed three job grades into one pay level.Senior stuffer: $12.50/hour -> $12.50/hour No increase needed due to the increase in minimum wage. A senior stuffer makes $1.50/hour more than a staff stuffer, so there’s incentive there still, just not quite as much as before.Ditto a Master stuffer, who stays at $14.00/hour.Now, minimum wage goes up to $12.00/hour.Entry level stuffer: starts at $12.00/hour.Experienced stuffer: gets a mandatory raise from $11/Hr to $12/HrSenior stuffer: Still at $12.50 hour so the incentive is nearly gone. Why meet all the extra requirements of a Senior for not much more.Master stuffer: heck of a lot of added work, training and responsibilities for what’s now not all that much more than an entry level stuffer makes on Day 1.Ah, you’re saying … but they’d have to bump everyone up wouldn’t they? No, there’s no law requiring that and this is what wage compression is all about. Maybe Marketing tells us that we can’t sell Widgets for any more than we were before. Maybe Budget & Finance tells me our reserves are now very thin because I had to give all base level employees a raise to the new minimum.Executives take a pay freeze or cut to bring up employees’ wages and retain incentive differentials? There may be a few altruist execs out there who’d do that and I might even call that smart thinking in the long run. But of the probably 200 or more executives I’ve met in life so far, none have thought that way.That leaves the shareholders and owners. Do you want to be the CEO or Chairman who stands before the shareholders’ meeting and announces a significant reduction in net return because you can’t raise prices materially but have decided to give all those layers of the onion above the new minimum a comparable raise?So go get another job, right? Except 123 Widgets and Widgets by Design are following the same policy. And East Coast Widgets doesn’t hire anyone who lives more than 50 miles from the plant and it’s more than 50 miles from Los Angeles to Portland, Me.Or maybe you get lucky: Smith Widgets does give a comparable increase in a very bold play to steal top widget stuffers from XYZ, 123 and Widgets by Design. But they can only hire so many, so most of the rest of our widget stuffers are still stuck with the compressed wage scale. Those who jumped to Smith are living the good life while it’s become pure hell at the other companies now that those who couldn't get out (and that will be obvious) have to work longer hours and assume higher level tasks just to keep their jobs.And if Smith miscalculated: happy stuffers results in more sales … then Smith ends up filing for reorganization. They dump their high priced stuffers on unemployment. Now, by virtue of what they were getting at Smith, they’re constructively unemployable because no one else will touch them at their old wages.","135,539 followers",Hector Quintanilla,1.5K,1.2K,88.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-good-to-have-a-technology-that-will-replace-millions-of-jobs-Will-it-not-impact-an-economy-since-it-takes-away-money-from-these-millions-of-people-and-their-spending-Is-it-not-against-the-fundamentals
