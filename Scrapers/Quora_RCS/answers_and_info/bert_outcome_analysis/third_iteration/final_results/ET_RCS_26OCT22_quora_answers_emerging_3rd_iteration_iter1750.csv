It is because of the importance of data in the life of every individual and consistent improvement in social networks and ecommerce traffic.4.Full Stack Development using MERN/MEANWith the advent of javascript evolution in the web world,things have been vibrantly changed as it is coming up with number of frameworks every day.M-MONGODB5.ANDROID DEVELOPMENTAs the internet users are more comfortable with using android apps than websites,the demand of android development becomes very high.The two popular ways of building android apps are through:6.Business Intelligence and Data VisualizationFor every business,there is a lot to deal with data.Data visualization becomes essential on every business and there is large demand in this area.The popular tools of BI and Data Visualization are:7.AutomationAs the role of manual monitoring and surveilance is no more interested by the enterprises, everyone is now looking for the automation processes which automates the task of handling various operations in the enterprise.Robotic Process Automation is one such popular technology to look out for.8.DevopsDevops is the combination of Development and operations team in a software organization,which is advanced version to agile development.9.MicroServicesIt is the way of modularizing the services of a software product into independent modules.10.BlockchainBlockchain technology is the decentralized computing environment ,where distributed computing plays an important role here.",4 followers,Carl Elliott,14K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-are-the-upcoming-technologies-in-IT-field-that-are-not-used-in-India

2,"Nanotechnology, but in a really cool way.You remember the microbots in Big Hero 6, right? Well, unfortunately, those microbots are impossible, but there is a similar technology that’s being developed in real life.The idea is to build tiny replicators that can create more of themselves, like a sort of super bacteria that never stops replicating. Such a technology would be“…the first replicator assembles a copy in one thousand seconds, the two replicators then build two more in the next thousand seconds, the four build another four . . in less than two days, theyNanotechnology, but in a really cool way.You remember the microbots in Big Hero 6, right?

Such a technology would be“…the first replicator assembles a copy in one thousand seconds, the two replicators then build two more in the next thousand seconds, the four build another four . . in less than two days, they would outweigh the Earth; in another four hours, they would exceed the mass of the Sun and all the planets combined …”Of course, self-replicators require materials, so they aren’t going to spread through space or anything. But they would have an abundance of material on Earth, especially of carbon, which would likely be the building blocks of such an assemblers. If you were carrying a jar of them and tripped and they spilled out, and they had no limit, they would quickly devour the entire earth with no way of stopping them.But here is where things get interesting: These tiny robots would have the ability to construct molecules from atoms, giving them the ability to produce amazing materials like graphene, cubes of apple, and even brain material.With advanced nanotechnology in the form of self-replicators, the entire world would experience a revolution. Think for a second about what wouldn’t change in the face of machines that can produceProduction jobs would cease. The price of every item ever created would be lowered massively. Supercomputers and experiments regarding brain material would become almost commonplace. Terraforming other planets would take years if not months.
