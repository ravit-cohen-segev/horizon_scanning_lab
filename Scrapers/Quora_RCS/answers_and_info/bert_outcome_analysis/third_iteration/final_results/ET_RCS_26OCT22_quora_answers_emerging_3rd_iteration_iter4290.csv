1,It could help!!!If Carefully Implemented - It could bring more and more people into the Tax Bracket.It could slowly organize - the unorganized sectorThat could put a low burden on the Average Taxpayer and could lead to Tax Concessions that could lead to more disposable income and more spending.However Gamechanger - NO!!!!!HOw can any currency be a Gamechanger????Our Economy can only have Four Gamechangers:-It could help!!!If Carefully Implemented - It could bring more and more people into the Tax Bracket.It could slowly organize - the unorganized sectorThat could put a low burden on the Average Taxpayer and could lead to Tax Concessions that could lead to more disposable income and more spending.However Gamechanger - NO!!!!!HOw can any currency be a Gamechanger????Our Economy can only have Four Gamechangers:-Right now only RCEP with China is easily possible.

2,"According to us, Digital Rupee or e-Rupee will expand to a limit in India because here is a cash-based economy rapidly converting to digital-based. However, we are still not cognizant of or interested in a CBDC, or digital assets. This is when people are becoming aware of cashless transactions, the next level is the e-Rupee which is still at least 5–7 years ahead of us.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,12.4K,5.6K,427.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Will-RBIs-digital-rupee-be-a-game-changer-for-the-Indian-economy
3,"Well. NO.other than reduced printing cost, there is no visible benefit of digital currency. I guess people are having some false notion about digital currency. It's not a magic wand and all the rules of monetary prudence remain as they are post digital currency.",64 followers,Wasim Ansari,5.7K,0,0,2022,https://www.quora.com/Will-RBIs-digital-rupee-be-a-game-changer-for-the-Indian-economy
4,"Strong rupeeWhen we compare currencies , we need a baseline. Without that just comparing the absolute value of currencies of two countries is meaningless. You need to take in the macro-economic parameters of the country and posit that against the nation you compare with to get an idea.Lets look at few examplesStrong rupeeWhen we compare currencies , we need a baseline. Without that just comparing the absolute value of currencies of two countries is meaningless. You need to take in the macro-economic parameters of the country and posit that against the nation you compare with to get an idea.Lets look at few examplesCurrency rates can be artificially manipulated by the governments, especially authoritarian governments. Similar to stock prices can be manipulated during a bubble. When the bubble bursts- both the currency and stock would crash as reality hits..:)So the question is not whether a strong rupee is good/ bad for Indian economy, but what factors make the value of a currency strong or weak in a free market.These are the key long term factors to decide how good/ bad Indian economy is.Can the Indian Government artificially make 1 USD= 1 INR?.Yes, it can. Thats is revaluation of the Indian Rupee. This would work well if we are a self-sufficient economy or ruled by a dictator.But unfortunately [or fortunately]- we are now connected to the global market and also we are a (cesspit)democracy …:).If we forcefully make 1 USD= 1 INR, then we would be facing what Japan faced in 1986.We cannot change our productivity overnight, nor can we improve our trade deficit or reduce our debts. If we forcefully revalue INR then India would see a massive capital outflow, loss of jobs and government would be forced to print more money —-> higher inflation.",113 followers,Abhimanyu Sood,5.8K,200,25.5M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Will-RBIs-digital-rupee-be-a-game-changer-for-the-Indian-economy
5,"How often have we had a change in the automotive industry that is significant enough that anything else seems like driving the past?In the early days of private cars, there were plenty of these moments, but in recent years, what has been ground breaking? Yes, the design of cars has changed, features have been added, computers have proliferated in them, but it’s still a car based on technologies which have underpinned the car industry since the end of the century before last!Now, Tesla has brought us a car with a completely new drive train, one which most of us have never driven before.

Yes, the design of cars has changed, features have been added, computers have proliferated in them, but it’s still a car based on technologies which have underpinned the car industry since the end of the century before last!Now, Tesla has brought us a car with a completely new drive train, one which most of us have never driven before. Added to that, the car can drive itself to some extent, with the promise of being able to do so completely in the relatively near future. The interior is significantly different, with the huge display and the paucity of physical buttons coupled with the level of customisation that this provides. The car I picked up in 2017 has also been updated so many times with automatic OTA updates that in many ways it feels like a different car.When I bought the car, I would have put a 6 on the 1–10 scale. After they enabled Autopilot on my AP2 car in March 2017, I’d have updated that to a solid 7 and as the Autopilot gained more and more features, I’d have taken it to an 8.When full self driving comes, if I’m still in this car, I’ll have to pay for them to upgrade my car to the AP3 board, but that will take this car to a solid 10.That said, this car has been revolutionary enough that I don’t see anything on the horizon from a competitor that would tempt me to buy anything but a new Model S as my next car when my lease is up in February next year. I will look carefully, however, since I’d love a car with this level of tech, this commitment to upgradability and this level of driving pleasure, but with a bit more refinement in the cabin. I don’t expect to find it, though!","129,190 followers",Jessica Su,21K,1.5K,49.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-electric-cars-called-revolutionary-even-though-they-use-Lithium-Ion-technology-from-1970s
6,"An impossible question to answer. There is no 1 scenario that the Autopilot handles, so there is no one score to scale.Sometimes I know the car is dialed in and operating on a 10. Sometimes I know the car will not handle a situation at all and I take over before I get there.So…depending on the situation, I trust the AP system between 1 and 10.

7,"I am a Tesla owner. I guess the question back to you is, Why do ANY car owner dislike any other car owner because of the car they chose? Okay, if an owner puts a booming stereo and loud pipes in, and blasts them at all hours, I can see that. But that is against the person, because they are being jerks, not because they own a certain make and model of car.So, why do so other car owners dislike Tesla owners?

8,"I see a lot of fantastic answers here, so there isn’t a lot to add. But in my mind, the revolutionary facts about Tesla.They came out of nowhere. One day there was no Tesla, then there was Tesla. They struggled a lot to build their first Roadster and proved beyond a shadow of doubt that electric cars were not toys.Then they made Model S. High end luxury car with around 400 km range. They built supercharging network in many countries. You can drive from Oslo to London without taking a ferry, on a Tesla, and pay nothing in “fuel”. You can drive coast to coast in the USA. Sure you can get betterI see a lot of fantastic answers here, so there isn’t a lot to add. But in my mind, the revolutionary facts about Tesla.They came out of nowhere.

High end luxury car with around 400 km range. They built supercharging network in many countries. You can drive from Oslo to London without taking a ferry, on a Tesla, and pay nothing in “fuel”. You can drive coast to coast in the USA. Sure you can get better travel in a petrol car, but you can do this in a Tesla, easily. For me, that is the revolution.One day cities will have to close access of petrol/diesel cars into them, at least during some weathers. This will happen. These same cities will put up chargers in parking spaces. The smog and fuel smell will go away from the cities. Peoples health will improve.Tesla is a poster child of electric cars. I fear greatly that if they fail, electric cars will fail. The only reason VW, Hyundai and Jaguar just to name a few are making them is because they feel the pressure from Tesla. They know not everyone can afford one, so they make cheaper and smaller versions, and because they get tax breaks. Toyota does not make the Prius because they are trying to make a good hybrid car, just look at the Prius, it is so ugly, it isn’t even a good hybrid. You can not drive on interstate using the battery, the battery is just for 40 km. You end up using the petrol engine for most things. No. They make these cars because this allows them to pay less taxes when making gas spewing cars like Land cruiser and other huge cars.What makes Tesla absolutely stunning, they are still here. They are getting better every day. They make more cars today than yesterday. They are making more cars in a plant previously owned by Toyota and GM and they are making more cars in that plant than the previous owners ever could.It does not matter where you look at Tesla. The superchargers, their support, their charging, their batteries, the gigafactory, their roof tiles and just about everything they do is spectacular. Sure you can point to gaps between doors and such that do not match perfectly, but neither do many brand new cars today. There are huge recalls by Toyota and other huge companies because cars tend to just explode, or some other ridiculous things.Tesla is still here, doing better and better all the time.","4,196 followers",Simon Crump,537,2.4K,9.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Will-RBIs-digital-rupee-be-a-game-changer-for-the-Indian-economy
