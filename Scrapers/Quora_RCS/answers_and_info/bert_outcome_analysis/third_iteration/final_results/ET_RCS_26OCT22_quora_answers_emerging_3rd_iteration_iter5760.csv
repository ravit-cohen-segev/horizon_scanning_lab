However today many tires are low or super low aspect ratio tires so a tube isn’t really an option. #2 Here I will fit a gaiter (patch) on the inside of the tire. You going to find it hard to find a tire shop in the USA which will be prepared to do the repair for you. I guess they are too scared of getting sued if the repair fails. Also, being somewhat cynical there isn’t much money in it for them…. I’ve done it and it worked just fine.Now don’t confuse the above opinions with a case where your tire has been vandalized by piercing with a knife or similar. In this case its just hard luck, you have to replace the tire. Sorry, but that’s the painful truth because the reinforcing material in the sidewall has been compromised.","358,963 followers",Sean Kernan,7.5K,5.6K,726.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-exceptions-to-the-rule-that-you-cannot-repair-a-punctured-tire-sidewall-Has-any-new-technology-or-ingenious-ideas-emerged-to-help-victims-of-vandalism-save-money-by-saving-the-damaged-tire
1,"I can only tell you that such a repair is NOT an accepted practice in the industry. Therefor, any shop that would attempt to do so is taking on a huge legal liability (from which there is NO so-called “release” of same), and that alone will deter any business with even half a conscience from doing so. I can also tell you that I as a professional would not.

3,"We don’t know. That’s the whole point.A singularity in physics is a place or time where our equations say that a value is infinite, when it really isn’t.

So, at least with the information we have now, we can’t say for sure what either of those values are, or if they are even possible to know.Now, the technological singularity is a little different. The technological singularity is what could happen if a computer is taught to program and build computers. That computer will build a better computer, which will build a better computer, which will build a better computer, over and over, faster than a human can think. Soon, a computer will be created that is so ridiculously intelligent, we’ll seem no smarter than ants to it. So, humans trying to guess what that computer will do, or if it will do anything, is like a cat trying to guess which nations will go to war in the next decade.Now, that doesn’t mean we haven’t t...","99,915 followers",Alcatraz Dey,9K,1.4K,68.3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-exceptions-to-the-rule-that-you-cannot-repair-a-punctured-tire-sidewall-Has-any-new-technology-or-ingenious-ideas-emerged-to-help-victims-of-vandalism-save-money-by-saving-the-damaged-tire

People are working on all those technologies now, but they do not exist yet.But it's also possible to think of a singularity as any technological change that radically changes the way humans live, rather than as a specific thing. By that definition, we have already had several singularities. The Agrarian Revolution, the Iron Age, and industrialization were all singularities. A Neolithic hunter-gatherer could never have imagined what life in the first cities was like. A Roman citizen could never imagine what life in modern New York City is like. The Information Age may represent another such singularity.",0 followers,Leon Schmidt,1.3K,0,0,2016,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-exceptions-to-the-rule-that-you-cannot-repair-a-punctured-tire-sidewall-Has-any-new-technology-or-ingenious-ideas-emerged-to-help-victims-of-vandalism-save-money-by-saving-the-damaged-tire
5,"We don't know. More precisely, weOne of the key points about the Singularity is that one of the drivers is machine intelligence. (Or possibly hybrid machine/biological intelligence.)If you predicate the entire event on the emergence of ""things"" (which may, to be fair, be us) that are able to think in ways we can think, then they'll think of things that, well, we can't predict.A second key point is that the timescales for step change development are shrinking exponentially.

6,"They didn’t, they evolvedWe don’t know exactly when we and our fellow apes diverged from other primates (including the various monkeys) to begin our own branch of the evolutionary tree but it may have been as long as 25–30 million years ago. That was when the common ancestor (of humans and monkeys, in your terms) lived.

But language is so much more than lexicon and syntax; it’s context.What do I mean by that? Well, let me give a few examples:I could go on, but I think you get the idea. Even if you fix the concepts words are mapped to (get rid of all homonyms), connotations and understandings of words will vary from group to group. It’s one of the reasons misunderstandings can even happen within a company where everyone speaks the same language (data scientist has a different understanding of statistical significance from the business guy). It’s why minorities will switch-hit. Language is actually deeply mercurial.Now, back to your original question:A lot of people will say it’s a bad idea because languages preserve a culture. But I’d like to ask you a different question: So long as different cultures exist, is it actually possible to have a single language?","2,286 followers",Emmanuel Fabella,2.8K,434,3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Could-bitcoin-ASIC-hardware-help-the-technological-singularity-to-emerge

Also, on the other side, new technologies in solar bring a promise of better generation, more flexibility and innovation coupled with seamless adaptability across various topographies and landscapes.Let us discuss some major solar technologies which have been introduced or are already in the pipeline.Floating solar:Floating solar power plants, or floatovoltaics are solar power plants which are installed on water bodies like reservoirs, dams or lakes. Such installations are more economical by way of capital cost saving as the need for costly land and real estate is substituted when the plant is installed on water.Ground and roof-top installations require more fabrication for mounting the panels compared to installation of a floating plant. This results in savings in cost, manpower and resources.Solar panels lose generation efficiency in high temperatures. Floatovoltaics, due to their proximity to water, have cooler surroundings, hence giving better generation and faster payback time.As a floatovoltaics plant covers the water surface, blocking sunlight, it stops the photosynthesis process, stopping the growth of algae resulting in the water staying clean. This coverage also helps in reducing the evaporation of water which helps in saving this valuable resource.BIPV & BAPV:Building Integrated Photovoltaics serve in a dual-purpose manner, as an outer layer of the façade of buildings and as a source of electricity generation. As they can be integrated during the initial construction of a building, they save on construction costs by replacing certain standard materials. Besides helping in generating electricity, BIPVs do not disturb the aesthetics of a building but merge seamlessly into the design elements.Building-Added Photovoltaics are added during a retrofit. Both BIPV and BAPV do not require the racks and mounting equipment of traditional solar PV systems, ultimately saving on costs.Solar Skin:A very dynamic innovative design by MIT engineers, Solar Skin uses selective light filtering to simultaneously display a vibrant image and transmit sunlight to the underlying solar panel with minimal loss of efficiency. Due to this revolutionary feature, it can blend across variety of surfaces and preserve the aesthetics of the surroundings along with efficient functioning.Solar Fabric:Imagine every fabric of the clothing you wear being able to harness the power of the sun. Such fabric has the potential to keep your winter jacket warm, power your phone while in the pocket, even light up lamps from the awnings and generate electricity from window curtains eliminating the cost of setting up solar structures and mountings. Once this technology is developed and feasible the possibilities of its applications are endless.Solar Powered Roads:Solar powered roads are a reality now. They are being designed and built not only for their ability to generate clean energy but they would also power LED street lights during the night and in cold countries they can be designed to have thermal heating capacity to melt snow.Beginning from ground mounted and roof mounted systems, today solar has come a long way. Solar is now more efficient, more flexible and more customization with better applicability across various surfaces. Solar is here to stay and the future is nothing but bright.",4 followers,Siddharth Meshram,783,198,407.6K,2020,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-exceptions-to-the-rule-that-you-cannot-repair-a-punctured-tire-sidewall-Has-any-new-technology-or-ingenious-ideas-emerged-to-help-victims-of-vandalism-save-money-by-saving-the-damaged-tire
