2,"Books.While it's not completely obsolete yet, that's the direction we're headed— pretty much every bookstore is closing now, and traditional book libraries are dying.A lot of people are migrating towards ebooks and audiobooks nowadays. It's not a bad thing, but there's just something so satisfying about holding an actual book in your hands and smelling the pages.","68,772 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,1K,17.3K,413.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-product-that-we-currently-use-will-soon-become-obsolete-due-to-advanced-technology

A Gini coefficient of 1 expresses maximal inequality among values (one single individual has all the wealth, or all the income).Of course, Gini 0 and Gini 1 can’t really be reached (these are theoretical values).The medieval income Gini coefficient for Paris was 0.7 (based on data from 1292 to 1313).

14,"I know this sounds cold. But that is not how humans work. We don’t do well when we are given everything. The human psyche is like any muscle in the body. It if is not exorcised, and challenged it will atrophy and die. Look at sheep in the field, they are docile, meek and easy to lead to the slaughter. Then look at the sheep in the wild. They have to forage, fight and struggle to stay alive but they are twice as intelligent as a domesticated sheep.
