0,"At this point, it's mostly science fiction, but I believe that in the long-term, truly significant progress in brain scanning is going to require huge leaps in application of nanotechnology.One of the major limitations of virtually all current scanning techniques is not just a simple issue of temporal and spatial resolution, it's that we're still reading a very coarse level of brain activity. Even if we could read electrical activity at a resolution of a single neuron, it doesn't tell us the kind of detail we need to know about which neurotransmitters are involved.

Even if we could read electrical activity at a resolution of a single neuron, it doesn't tell us the kind of detail we need to know about which neurotransmitters are involved. It's helpful to know which neurons are activating. It's helpful to know where blood flow is concentrated. But it tells us virtually nothing about the nature of such activity and how it relates to the complex networks in a whole brain involving hundreds of neurotransmitter types.One day, in the distant future, I hope that we'll have sophisticated enough nanotechnology that we can actually inject thousands of nanobots into a patient and get our firstOkay, it isn't completely sci-fi... we're taking the first few baby steps.http://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/v9/n2/full/nnano.2014.23.html",543 followers,Arvindh Mani,9.1K,0,0,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-promising-technology-that-will-replace-both-MRI-and-EEG-for-reading-the-brain

3,"No, smartwatches are can never outdated smartphones. The reason behind it is that smartwatches have many features that make them different from smartphones. But the features smartphones have, that are not available in smartwatches.","11,837 followers",Franz Rivoira,775,1.6K,29.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-blockchain-replacing-technology
4,"Google, Amazon Apple and Microsoft have each been throwing a research budget bigger than the national debt of a medium sized country at Voice-type technology for decades. Products like Siri, Alexa and Cortana are finally nearing maturity. I’m now of retirement age, but remember the era of “Copy typists”. Copy typists produced “boilerplate” letters - effectively copies of previous standard forms. Then came OCR software- a spinoff of military aviation software, used for identifying targets in downward-looking RADAR/avionic sofware. OCR can analyse a graphic - a photograph or scan of a document.Google, Amazon Apple and Microsoft have each been throwing a research budget bigger than the national debt of a medium sized country at Voice-type technology for decades.

Then came OCR software- a spinoff of military aviation software, used for identifying targets in downward-looking RADAR/avionic sofware. OCR can analyse a graphic - a photograph or scan of a document. The software is capable of “reading” the document- identifying individual characters, feeding them into a spell checker, and saving the result as a file. A PC cost a few hundred pounds, a scanner maybe fifty more - with the OCR software thrown in… and it totally destroyed the need for copy typists (or, more to the point, destroyed the need to PAY copy typists) Back before tablets, smartphones and the “virtual keyboards” built into them, I discussed the issue with Guy Kewney - a brilliant journalist, and a good friend - of a new conceppt gizmo from IBM - a Personal COmputer the size of a cigarette packet. featuring spectacles (Not unlike Googles later “Google Glass”) the hard drive was the size of a matchbook. It was a blind alley of computer development, but an interesting one. The BIG problem that IBM seemed to have been unable to address was the keyboard, voicetype was still a LONG way from maturity.

Saying this Apple newest macOS does have a way of using numbers to move around the screen like using a mouses with key words. It looked real good. and with some time be easy to mastered. And would shock me if Microsoft did something like that and version for Linux. What Next the keyboard will be around for longer time. But maybe AI and the camera could be used with ur eyes to move around a digital screen and type letters. And apple working on glass kind like Google did.

And that the key. functions. The keyboard will most likely be around longer. it cheap easy and been proven. so eve if had camera or glass or use your voice, keyboard will still be around.
