Traders also tend to have a short memory, and winning strategies often have a finite lifetime.The key area to look into is a comprehensive list of human behavioral and psychological biases to be a successful speculator - which incidentally, is just as important in traditional value/fundamentals investing to defend yourself from well, yourself. “Value investors” often have a strong bias themselves against discounting “exponential thinking” in what is an increasingly nonlinear, uncertain world, because they’ll probably do fine without it. But what if - on the off-chance, it doesn’t do well? You have to consider the implications. Not necessarily speculation on assets, but learning what the technology really does. If you break down what money is, it’s simply a shared belief and universal language.I haven't invested more than 10% of my net worth directly in the cryptocurrency asset class. I invested my time, creative energy, intellectual capacity, passion, and work in the cryptocurrency industry and blockchain technology.Edit:If you decide to use this answer, I would really appreciate the favor to reference me as the author.

Technical analysis is based on a set of trading rules for buying and selling currencies when prices reach certain stipulated levels according to the trader's system or premise.* Trading bots operate 24/7, 365 days per year automatically executing pre-programmed instructions over an exchange's public interface (order book).

5,"The best applications of the blockchain are in industries that are controlled by very large and corrupt institutions that make the industry very inefficient.Most of them are also already used by companies and individuals in the real world.This list is sorted by potential from greatest to lesser.The best applications of the blockchain are in industries that are controlled by very large and corrupt institutions that make the industry very inefficient.Most of them are also already used by companies and individuals in the real world.This list is sorted by potential from greatest to lesser.So, this is my list of the most powerful blockchain applications ranked by powerfulness and usefulness.Interestingly, the top 3 industries aren’t really served yet, only by smaller cryptocurrencies (Mediblocs, Medishares, District, Counterpart, Civic, THEKEY) that have not seen that much popularity yet. I think the reason for that is, because the industry are so huge and deeply controlled by the rich and powerful and very political that it will take a long time for cryptocurrencies to have an impact here, while it will probably go much faster in the ones ranked lower (Gaming, Adult, Gambling, Ticketing).it looks like the Top 7 has the biggest potential, but will take the most time while the bottom 7 has a smaller market, but will make an impact much faster.Some of these blockchain have already found usage and we can expect for some of them to become the standard worldwide in several industries.Here, you have a few more use cases in a nice infographic.If you found this post helpful, please give an upvote. :)",27 followers,Benjamin Price,1.2K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-major-types-of-strategies-being-used-in-crypto-investing-right-now
