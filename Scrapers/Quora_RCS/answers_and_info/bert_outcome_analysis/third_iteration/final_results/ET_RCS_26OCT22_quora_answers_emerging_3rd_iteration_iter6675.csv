Just spongy wrought iron. Without steel, there is no advanced manufacturing. Including no real power systems. We would be stuck at about a year 1700 level of technology.So, even if other planets evolve intelligence levels equal to or greater than us humans, they will never broadcast or leave their planet unless they too had the equivalent of the Carboniferous age.","220,628 followers",Franklin Veaux,722,47.3K,783M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-Great-Filters-could-potentially-shoot-down-a-planets-ability-to-support-even-microbial-life-the-odds-of-animals-evolving-intelligent-life-evolving-Civilization-arising-developing-technology-or-surviving-past-a

2,"A planet being table to support microbial life is probably an easy great filter to explain, ifnitnis one. Life forming may require very specific conditions, which may be very complex and precise.

Multiculluarism evolved multiple times on earth, which I would take as a sign that its pretty likely to occur. And if you can be mobile and consume other creatures, that is a huge niche that will be filled. But maybe that really requires an oxygen metabolism to be viable, and an oxygenation event is rare, or maybe surviving it is rare. I don't think either is likely, at least in a chemical environment similar to earth, but maybe.Intelligent life could be a filter, as in all of earth history only humans habe achieved human level intelligence. Sure, there are other animals which are pretty bright, but they are building civilizations. We could be some perfect storm of factors that pushed us into civilization building, and. Its far more likely to not occur at all. Where we draw the line here between intelligence and civilization is a bit fuzzy, but civilization could very well require intelligence to form in a suitably social animal.Similarly the jump from civilization to technology is one only humans have done on earth (primitive tool use isn't quite technology yet).As for surviving a few million years, yeah, that is anyone's guess. Human history is short in that timescale, so we don't even have our own example to ponder. Millions of years os long enough for major evolutionary change, much less predicting how civilization will change. We normally talk in terms of centuries, much less thousands of millenia, when it comes to hoe civilizations change. Dying out after a fee millenia could br completely normal, or maybe its endless boom bust cycles, or maybe you csn br stagnant for a million years. Or maybe once you posses thr ability to destroy yourselves, its only a matter of time before it gets used, even if its really unlikely at any given moment, enough time could make that a near certainty.But without any other instances to build from, its really just speculation.","17,170 followers",Pascal Morimacil,5.2K,4.3K,34.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-Great-Filters-could-potentially-shoot-down-a-planets-ability-to-support-even-microbial-life-the-odds-of-animals-evolving-intelligent-life-evolving-Civilization-arising-developing-technology-or-surviving-past-a
3,"Brown/Norway rats, because of their very short generation time (two months), evolve very quickly. 30 or 40 years ago in the UK there was a case reported of a group of rats who took to living in a cold meat store, and in about eight years they had long-haired fluffy rats.But for really fast evolution you don't want animals - you want bacteria. The ever-increasing resistance of many species of bacteria to antibiotics is evolution in action.","46,127 followers",Steven Haddock,693,25.6K,343.5M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-Great-Filters-could-potentially-shoot-down-a-planets-ability-to-support-even-microbial-life-the-odds-of-animals-evolving-intelligent-life-evolving-Civilization-arising-developing-technology-or-surviving-past-a
4,"A2A: It’s not that proposed solutions to the Fermi paradox are anthropocentric; it’s that they’re intended to be a list of answers to the question “why don’t we see intelligent, tool-using alien species?”There are a lot of proposed answers.

This posits the Great Filter isNone of these answers are anthropocentric.“We’re rare” suggests that the rise of sapient, tool-and-metatool-using civilizations is extremely uncommon, either spatially (perhaps it’s so rare that only one or two will arise on average in any given galaxy) or temporally (perhaps only one exists at a time in any given galaxy). It may require an extremely unlikely confluence of events. For example, without our moon, we might not ever have been here. Planets are common; perhaps planets that can give rise to complex sapient multicellular life are rare. Yes, there are a lot of stars in a galaxy, but it may be, for instance, that stars too close to a galactic center are subject to too many unpredictable and dangerous events for technological societies to have time to arise. (Gamma ray bursts, anyone?)I think you’re talking about “we’re fucked” answers, which include the idea that the normal course of a highly technological society might be self-destruction. This can sound anthropocentric (why would aliens be aggressive and warlike?), but it doesn’t necessarily make the inference thatMe personally, I think “we’re first” and “we’re rare” explanations are more plausible than “we’re fucked.” But then, I’m an optimist.My stalker is once again creating fake profiles that look just like mine to send rape threats to other people.

5,"A car was once a luxury enjoyed by few, the way things are going I feel it will soon return to being just that.

6,"Probably not. The cost of the systems in NOT CHEAP. A fully functional Level 5 AV in 2018 was anticipated to retail at $150,000- if they existed. I don’t know if this included an add-on for the insurance, as for the first time the car manf’s are going to have to be covered… and this is a huge issue.What I see is that we’re going to have a re-peat of lessening of the car companies. New companies will form who will build electric powered cars that are more generic and can be refurbished as a fleet (lower cost to operate) and offered to consumers as an alternative to owning a car.Most luxury carProbably not.

If the brand can cater to the industrial sector (Think Ford and the F150 and F350) they’ll survive… I contend that your plumber will not arrive at your house in an autonomous plumbing repair truck…The volume brands… Kia, Hyundai, Mitsubishi… even Honda and Toyota may struggle with decreased car sales, as the lower end of the market (which is most of the market) is going to make a 50% to 60% shift from ownership to subscription and likely go from being a multi-car family to a single car family. The averages are going to DROP LIKE A ROCK….So, who’s going to win the AV war?
