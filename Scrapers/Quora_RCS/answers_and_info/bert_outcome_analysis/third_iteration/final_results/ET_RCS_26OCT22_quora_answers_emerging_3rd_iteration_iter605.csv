How does Alexa understand the words you just said?In 1989 I was visiting Carnegie Mellon to decide if I would go to graduate school there.One of the graduate students, Kai-Fu-Lee (now one of the most famous investors in the world and I would check out his excellent recent TED talk on AI) showed me what he was working on:It was speech recognition for the 60 or so commands that might happen on a Navy battleship (ten guesses as to who was funding his project).When you say the word ""Fire!"" a sound wave is created. When you say the word ""hello"" a sound wave that looks different is created.If 100 people say ""Fire"" and 100 people say ""hello"", all of those sounds waves are stored in a database.Now, if a brand new person says ""Hello"" the computer program needs to determine if that person said ""Hello"" or ""fire"".There might be 10 different attributes of every sound wave. It breaks the new person's sound wave into those 10 attributes.Then it compares that ""vector"" of 10 attributes with all of the vectors in its database for ""Hello"" and ""Fire!""It uses a statistical technique called ""Hidden Markov Analysis"" to determine if the sound wave is more like the ""hello""s in the database or more like the ""Fire!"" in the database.Then it says to itself, ""This guy said ""Hello"". ""It then has a line of code that says, ""If someone says ""Hello"" Then say ""Hello"" back"".Additionally, it adds your ""Hello"" to its database.Your ""Hello"" might be slightly different than the other 100 ""Hello""s so it just learned a new way to say ""Hello"". That gives it greater ability in the future to recognize the word ""hello"".In other words, it ""learned"".So it used Statistics to hear you, code to respond to you, and database technology to learn. There's no real intelligence there but it feels like it's intelligence.Multiply that by 30 years and millions of patterns and computers a million times faster and you have Alexa and Siri in today's kitchens.Ask ""Siri"" what gender it is.-----B) EVALUATION FUNCTIONI just mentioned about language recognition. But how does a self-driving car work?Every second it has to make a decision. Does it move forward? Does it brake? Does it swerve to avoid an accident? Does it turn left?How does it get from point A to point B?1) Google Maps. - Using GPS it knows where it is. And it puts itself on Google Maps.2) List all of the possible routes. This is a ""hard"" problem in the mathematical sense (there's no way for it to guess the fastest route. It has to list each route and then sort by the shortest. )But now computers are so fast what would normally be a slow decision (drive me from this corner in Piscataway, New Jersey to the capital building of Sacramento, California) now just takes seconds.3) Waze. Use Waze to eliminate the routes with too much traffic.4) Start driving.5) Statistics: Every microsecond it uses statistics to see if there is blank space or an object that must be avoided or a traffic sign that must be followed.6) Decide what to do according to the code. For each traffic sign, it has code that tells it what to do (if a sign says ""Stop"" it Stops for a second, uses Statistics to see if any traffic is happening on its sides (with radar and cameras to provide the images). )If there is a person standing in front of it, it might just stop.If there's traffic it didn't expect, it might trigger the program to re-route.If it's blank space it will just keep going.If there's a baby crossing the street and it has to swerve to avoid hitting it, but if swerving will cause the car to hit a truck, killing the passenger in the car, then the ""AI"" of the car is dependent on the ethical decisions of the programmer of the car.In other words, in every situation, it determines it's options, then uses an ""evaluation function"" programmed by a coder, to determine which option has the most successful outcome (move the trip forward, don't kill anyone).Eventually the evaluation function will NOT be programmed by a human coder.Instead, through thousands of experiences of other self-driving cars, the experiences plus the outcomes will all be put into a central database.When a new experience is encountered, the code will look up that experience in the database and the database will spit back the best possible outcome.The code will learn statistically what the best outcomes are of each possibly decision and change the code accordingly and send updates to all self-driving cars.-----C) TREESThe hardest game in the world is a board game called GO. With chess, if a computer can evaluate a billion possibilities a second, it can be a world champion level player.But a Go game can involve trillions of possibilities. How did Google make a program, Deep Go, to beat the world's best Go player. This was thought to be impossible.And yet Google did it.For any game, a computer program first builds a tree of possibilities. Much like a human would.A human thinks: ""If I make this move in checkers, my opponent might respond with A, B, or C and then I can do D, E, or F and then my opponent can do G, H, I if I do D or it can do J, K, L if I do E and I'm never going to do F.A computer doesn't select as well as a human so it builds the FULL tree. Meaning, what are ALL of the possible moves it can do, what are ALL of the possible responses of my opponent, etc.And then it uses a programmed evaluation function to look at the leaves of the tree it built.Whichever move results in the best leaf of the tree (as determined by the evaluation function) that is the move it makes.That's how computer chess worked for decades. I'll get to the secret sauce in a second for how computers conquered chess.And then after that I'll describe how computers miraculously conquered Go.It's only a miracle until science can explain it. It's only ""intelligence"" until it can be coded by a programmer.D) HARDWAREEverybody thought for decades (including many Nobel Prize winners) that the best computer chess programs would be developed when scientists encoded the knowledge of the best chess players in the world into the evaluation function.How does the world champion value a position instead of a weak player?This turned out to be wrong.The MORE code in the evaluation function (i.e. the ""smarter"" the evaluation function was from a human perspective) the SLOWER the program.Which meant a smaller tree would be built, which meant less possibilities would be analyzed.What really allowed the programmers at IBM to build ""Deep Blue"" which beat Garry Kasparov in 1997 were two things.Both related to hardware.a. Computers got faster.And finally, they made the evaluation function STUPID in order to use less code so the hardware could value more positions.Then, before anyone caught on to their ""artificial intelligence"" they retired Deep Blue right after it beat the World Champion of chess.As hardware gets faster, artificial intelligence gets ""smarter"".[as an aside, I once gave a date a chip that was the initial chip for “Chip Test” - the “ancestor” of what became the best chess computer, Deep Blue. She was weirded out.]----INTERLUDEWhat I just described is all the basics. You can stop now.The rest of artificial intelligence is simply combining the basics to make more advanced techniques.-----E) STATISTICS + TREERemember the TREE from computer gaming. And STATISTICS from speech recognition.Now let's go to the impossible game of Go. Google developed the program ""AlphaGo"" to win at Go when everyone else thought it would take another 20 to 50 years.First, remember Kai-Fu Lee who worked on speech recognition. And later developed Apple's first attempts at speech recognition in the 90s?At one point in his grad student days, he was getting tired of navy battleship commands (as one does) and decided to focus on building a program to play Othello.He ended up building the world champion of Othello.He took a lot of games, let's say a million, and put them in a database. And each position from each game, he would label, ""winning"" (if it was a position on the winning side) or ""losing"" in a massive database.He would identify several attributes of each position (how many white pieces, versus black pieces, how many corners were controlled, how many pieces were on the sides, etc).Now, if the computer was playing a brand new game, it would determine all the attributes of that position, then use Hidden Markov Analysis (remember: speech recognition) to match that position to the database.If the position pattern-matched a ""winning position"" then it would make the move that would lead to that winning position. If it matched a ""losing position"" it would not make that move.That program became the world champion of Othello.AlphaGo took it one step further.It put in the positions of millions of Go positions and did the same sort of breakdown.It used faster hardware to speed up the process.Then, once it became pretty good at GO, it played BILLIONS of games against ITSELF to put many BILLIONS of new positions into the database. In other words, it ""learned"".Now it was ready to play Go. It crushed the world champion------That's basically it. That's all of artificial intelligence.Let's say a bank wanted to fire all of the employees in charge of lending. And replace them by artificial intelligence.How would the bank lend money?Well, there's 100s of millions of loans already out there. And for each person who has ever borrowed money I know:- their ageI can put all these vectors in a database and divide them into people ""most likely to pay back the loan"" and people ""most likely to default"".Then, just like speech recognition or the Othello program above, I can use statistics to determine who I should loan money to.And if I say ""no"", I don't have to explain. On to the next one!---Let's say I want to fight terrorists.I already have examples of many terrorists who trained in the US and then went on to perform or attempt acts of terror.I know everything about their bank accounts. How often they transferred money. How often they traveled. How often they took out cash versus using a debit card.And so on.I can build a vector of attributes of what a terrorist bank account looks like. Then I can match new people against that database of vectors of terrorists.Believe me, every time you do a bank transfer, some AI program is out there trying to determine if you are a terrorist.----This is all that AI is.It is nothing more. It's not ""intelligent"" from a human sense. It's not conscious, nor will it ever be.Here's how AI has improved in the past forty years (and how it will improve the next 40):- statistics has gotten betterWhat is changing the fastest is data. The land grab of modern society is not land, or gold, or oil.It's data.I have been invested in many companies that collect and sell data. I was an early investor (and on the board of)Believe me when I say, data-driven companies know how many strawberries you ate last summer.And right now that data is used mostly to target you for ads about sneakers. Or politics.But this is AI 1.0. Soon that data will be used to target your every movement, your every want, your every need.Amazon Prime won't be about delivering you what you want tomorrow. Amazon Prime Plus will be about delivering you what you want yesterday.Police 2.0 will be like the movie ""Minority Report"".Even art and music will be driven by AI that studies the neurochemical responses to music you like to music you don't like. And then compose accordingly.Where will humans still be unique?I don't know. Ask the humans with AI implants that enhance their brains so when they look at you they know exactly what answers will make you happy.BUT… will AI replace jobs?The answer (at least in the next decade or so…) is NO.Look at recent examples:A) Many people were worried ATM machines would replace bank tellers.Instead, the banks made so much in profits they opened up more branches than ever, creating new jobs.B) Will autonomous delivery services cost jobs.Right now there are millions of truck drivers involved in delivering goods. With autonomous delivery, less people will go shopping, more people will be required to shop in the aisles, finding products for people.Obviously this is not a high-end job. But this replaces the fact that less cashiers and drivers will be needed.Meanwhile, there will be more high-end jobs. More maintenance engineers for the cars, customer service, marketing, etc.C) Ecommerce. Branding will become less important (branding is VERY important when everyone is shopping at the big box store but advertising will have to become more clever and digital) so the millions in profits that are generated from AI will filter down to more people starting e-commerce ventures and the ancillary businesses associated with that.)Final conclusion:This is probably a net NEGATIVE for society as the higher classes will be able to afford “super AI” capabilities, making them demi-gods to lower-classes.Instead, massive profits will be generated, which will be soaked into the economy through a rising stock market, increase in opportunities, etc.","20,169 followers",Sriraman Madhavan,4.1K,186,7.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-age-of-computers-forever-What-technology-can-possibly-top-the-concept-of-computers

I’d like to get him on stage and beat him over the head with a mop for the terrible hype he generates regarding the ‘Singularity’. His time frame is wrong, his view is only an opinion, not fact nor provable fact. He angers me for conning the public into thinking humans are going to be threatened by AI overlords any time soon. Not going to happen. Making AIs as smart as people is exceedingly hard and it’s not soon in the cards. I say this as an AI researcher who works on these problems and I see how truly difficult they are. We can, and will solve some of the problems but we are a long way from AIs that can match human minds. An AI that plays Go better than humans is buildable because the game is a closed small universe. What humans have to work with is an enormous complicated world, and much harder to deal with.So, yes, AI is way hyped, and the promoters may be leading us to the next AI winter if they keep up the crap and eventually burn out expectations.",581 followers,Bart Trojanowski,1.4K,895,2.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-age-of-computers-forever-What-technology-can-possibly-top-the-concept-of-computers

I think an elephant would prefer our bite over a king cobra's any day of the week.We aren't the most durable species. Cockroaches can survive through extreme amounts of radiation.We don't have any interesting built-in biological defenses either. Skunks have their farts, porcupines have their spikes, and peacocks have their feathers.Humans are fragile. The vast majority of animals in this world could kill us effortlessly given the opportunity to do so, yet we still stand as the most dominant species. What do we have that others don't?TheThrough our intellect, we are able to domesticate other species for our own selfish needs such as entertainment and food. We manipulate animals to do as we please by enticing them with their most primal biological need, food. That Shamu at SeaWorld is content with doing flips because it is rewarded with constant treats. The chicken in the slaughterhouse copes with the trauma by being fed until it can't eat anymore.What happens when a new species that outperforms us physically AND intellectually is introduced into the ecosystem? They will domesticate us, exactly how we domesticate other animals.I present to you ladies and gentlemen, AI.Let me explain why AI is superior physically and intellectually.Machines do all of the strenuous physical labor for us, from cranes that carry metal beams to build skyscrapers to car crushers that squash old cars like printer paper. There is no doubt they possess more strength than us, and their limits are endless. Machines are very durable. If a robot's arm is blown off, the robot does not die. We can simply replace the arm with a new arm as if nothing happened. If a human's arm is blown off, he/she will die from blood loss. Who would win in a fight with Connor McGreggor and the villain from Terminator 3? I think the answer is obvious.Machines are starting to get smarter too. A computer can do millions of computations in a matter of seconds, and machine learning allows robots to learn with experience like a baby. Put those two things together and it is possible for a 30 minute old robot to have as much experience as a 100 year old man given the abundance of data on the web. Now put this intellect into an iron, replaceable body and you have the next ruler of the universe.Imagine a scientist who is planning on shutting down a robot because its getting too smart. In a matter of seconds, the robot downloads every single possible human portrayal of body language and facial expression, learns what they mean, analyzes the scientist's behavior, and decides the scientist's intentions are malicious. Then, analyzes every single possible outcome that ensures the its survival and chooses the most optimal one. The scientist is toast because he can't analyze every single outcome. The human brain does not have the capacity to do that, and instead reacts to events in real time. The robot then reverse manipulates the scientist by touching on his biggest insecurities, which defuses the situation. If the robot already had a strong body, the robot would utilize its physical advantage.Of course we aren't at this stage yet. We are still struggling with Alexa commands as it does not play the right song half of the time, but as history has shown, technological innovation always moves forward and never backward. We could warn everyone to stop working on advancing AI, but if someone doesn't do it, someone else will for power and profit. It is ironic how a species so obsessed with maintaining power is working relentlessly on creating another species that will steal that power. We are too blinded by our own ego and selfish desires to see the big picture from an objective point of view.The question is notHopefully not in my lifetime...",256 followers,Priyal Gupta,9.7K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-age-of-computers-forever-What-technology-can-possibly-top-the-concept-of-computers

What reason do you have to continue existing except to feel pleasure? Nobody needs you.Artificial intelligence can be such a boon to mankind that it could eliminate all suffering, forever. No more waking up on a Tuesday morning and sitting in traffic in the rain; you’ll just be waking up comfortably to a cleared sky with no work to do and an entire day to relax!But after spending hundreds of days relaxing, it won’t be quite so great, not having anything to do. Boredom will probably set in and you’ll find yourself wandering about gorgeous landscapes searching for something meaningful to do.But we’re resilient. Humans already (mostly) live in a world without individual biological purpose (most of us here take food and safety for granted).We still have the advancement of our species, however, and this is something important. We also have the individual struggles that come with trying to think of the right thing to say.Imagine a world where, when you wondered about something to make someone feel happy, Google would drop the answer right inside your brain? No effort involved. The words aren’t yours… they’re an AI’s.I don’t believe that AI will destroy the world or become self-aware like many predict. I believe that AI will slowly conquer every struggle that humans deal with, and so, slowly conquer every visage (aspect) of purpose.That isn’t to say that there isn’t hopeIronically, that hope fades a bit right alongside this answer, as the AI named “The Quora Distribution Algorithm” slowly stops spreading this answer to your feeds…","3,905 followers",Monica Anderson,806,148,1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-age-of-computers-forever-What-technology-can-possibly-top-the-concept-of-computers
