Minimum legal wage is just above 50K USD annually.When IT had started in early 2000, that time 5LPA (12.5K USD) was above average, and US companies had 90% savings compared to local hiring.

Earlier a software project development would require team of 25 on an average. In the past there were special role to just manage the task list and calculate the progress. Today it is done automatically. Today same complexity project requires only 5 member team.Go over Fiverr website and check how many non Indians offer same software services at cheaper rates. I am being Indian had outsourced our work to people from Serbia, Philippines and Nepal. And many of my friend in US are doing same.Indians are heavily investing in advance degrees but there aren’t enough jobs.

Where else I believe, if we don’t have recession now, we will have even worst recession in future.Ocean waves collapse sooner if they stopped rising, they cannot keep on rising, they do come down and they will have to come down.

Rather, it’s a clever placement of 2D figures on the screen, and following perspective lines, plus some limited 3D geometry (the road lines). This was applied to vehicles too, the typical availalble hardware had graphic cards supporting “sprites”, small rectangles where you could draw something and move it very quickly, thanks to the graphic card wired functionality. So, the driven car was animated by swapping 3/4 different sprites and the the effect of an incoming vehicle was rendered by showing sprites of the same vehicle drawn in different sizes and positions.At the time, it was absolutely impressive, especially considering that it was running on hardware that was thousand times less powerful than any nowadays smartphone. In fact, I still run it with my smartphone from time to time, and obviously it has no performance problem with it, as it is also able to do do much better with frameworks like Unity.Oh, and we had game rooms where these wonders could be played in a setup like this:Which is also common nowadays, but imagine you are 16 and you’ve never seen an almost-real Ferrari that you can drive before legal age…Another example I love of 3D that is actually 2D is this:It was named Fire Trap, you had to climb your fireman avatar by coordinating two joysticks.

And then, accidentally transmitted my hack to a rival high-school, where I hear it created much consternation among faculty for an entire week!1974, Southside HS. Elmira, NY, somehow our math teacher got hold of a PDP-8/e, and started a class to teach programming in DEC Basic. At first we had to enter the bootloader via the front panel switches, then run in the half-hour of 4K papertape through the teletype reader, into the computer’s six entire k-words of memory, doing this each time the system had been turned off. Finally someone figured out that USUALLY the Basic code could be re-started (from a secret start-addr,) rather than relying on the startup stuff at the end of the papertape (an important part of this story.)The PDP-8/e had core memory. Several boads, 2K words each, iirc. If you knew how to gracefully crash the basic code, it usually could be re-started, even after power had been removed. (Plus, if you took the full bin of paper tape punch-holes off the side of the teletype, you could empty it out the window, and make it snow! )Good times.I discovered that our copy of Basic had some unknown string-array commands. LINPUT A$, inputting an entire line of text. These weren’t supposed to exist! The commands were found in the back of a manual for a more expensive Basic version. Mostly they didn’t work, but “LINPUT” was there. So was string-compare.So, I wrote a tiny program to generate wise-ass responses to system commands, and which, when running, just printed READY(crlf), as the PDP normally did when halted. Heh, by fortunate chance, the LINPUT command didn’t print any question-mark while waiting for input like it was supposed to! So, nobody would realize that my program was running. A second lucky break.Now, if you sat down at the teletype console, and typed in an entire Basic program, all your typing would be wasted (my program couldn’t store strings,) and then if you typed “LIST,” my program would say “Don’t bother me I’m busy.” Type “RUN” and it said “I can’t, I ain’t got no legs.” Plus a few others, one for each valid command.Easily defeated by anybody, just type CTRL-C. And then swear a lot, depending on how many lines of code you’d just carefully typed into nowhere.My program was only effective/hilarious for about a week, until everyone got into the habit of always hitting CTRL-C, to make sure that no joker who’d been using the system had left that f****g thing waiting for you.Months later, by fortunate chance I happened to be using the computer on the day before summer vacation. I was told to perform the last halt-system procedure before summer vacation, when I suddenly had an idea. I said “Just a sec.” I input the short papertape for my program, ran it, THEN halted the PDP-8 and turned off the power …while a Basic program was still running. (I never tried this before. Didn’t know if it would work.)[Summer vacation happens]Months later, on the first day of school, the math teacher tracked me down, and said “What was that thing you did just before we turned off the PDP-8?”Uh oh.Actually he started laughing, and told the entire story.Ours was the “football school,” while our rivals on the other side of the river were the “smart school” with all the science courses. Somehow they’d wangled the PDP-8 away from us during the summer. One of their teachers was going to present a teacher-only programming course, so they could all learn Basic language. Our own math teacher was NOT invited. By fortunate chance, the guy taking our computer had been carefully instructed in how to restart the PDP-8, so no bootloader and no thirty minutes of tapereader would be needed. He did this successfully.The PDP-8 said READY.Then he typed in his first “hello” program, and hit RUN.It said …I CANT I AINT GOT NO LEGS.Our math teacher swears that it took the other school an entire week to figure it out, and their summer course had to be delayed. The person using the computer had learned everything from manuals alone, and (by sheer bad luck) had somehow skipped the paragraph about breaking out of a running program. He didn’t know CTRL-C. Nobody else could solve the problem either, because apparently everyone else assumed he of course knew CTRL-C, and had already tried that, first thing …which he hadn’t.So yes, if you have a PDP-8/e running DEC Basic, and a Basic prgram is currently running, then if you halt the system, remove power for weeks, then restart, not only is Basic still in memory, but any Basic programs are still in there, and still running!Oldschool hacking. OLD-oldschool hacking, the master of the syncronicites. This “hack” required about eight unlikely amazing bits of luck and coincidences to first line up exactly. And, my “virus” was “transmitted” to our rival HS, by them coming in and physically taking our corememory-based PDP-8 computer away from us, so it couldn’t be used by Southside HS during the summer. Hacks via social engineering, performed by accident.Alchemist synchronicities? A Toltec accomplishment? Me and Richard Feynman, we both have the Red Dwarf Luck Virus. (So why aren’t we millionaires?)Other cool tricks, now somewhat lame…WRITING IN ASSEMBLER. In 1979 I had Conway’s Life going fast, on Altair-era Polymorphics 88 graphics. Well not that fast, on 8080 at 1MHz cycle speed, where I think a glider-gun was updating about six times per second. Also a voice-recorder, a Morse typer, even a Morse code listener (microphone to text, our 8080 home computer could understand human speech in 1979, as long as the human sounded like DAH DI DAH DI. DAH DAH DI DAH)Speaking of which, years later in 1982 I had another wonderful idea, but talked myself out of it: today called “computer viruses.”Or more specifically, why shouldn’t I write the very first personal-computer virus, then keep it secret, …so I can sell it as computer-game security software, self-installing?Infectious “Sony rootkits” of 1982.I bought a used Apple from a guy at work. On the APPLE-][-plus, I realized that if you have a custom-modified master-disk, which when loaded, can sit waiting, and then modify any other master-disk placed in the drive, then soon all Apple disks now have your code. It spreads worldwide, kinda-sorta like a “disease,” but this disease …is for home computers! Perhaps give away free Apple games to various high schools, to “infect” entire distant cities!And if your silent, unsuspected code is always watching for illegal copies of a certain video game, it can take action. It could even beI was just at the stage of doing 8080 dis-assembler on the Apple-][ OS when, I realized I didn’t want to become the famous person who invented the “home computer influenza.” Every computer-owner would be spitting on my grave (after they’d killed me slowly, hunted down by a crowd of Apple users equipped with tiny needlenose pilers. And soldering irons! They’ll kill me with cold, dirty soldering irons. With dull tips.)Eventually that title went to a high-school kid in ?1986?, who did exactly the same thing with the OS on his Apple-II+. But he let the thing get loose and start spreading through his school, rather than keeping it quiet like I’d been planning to do, nor selling the whole “virus-spread rootkit” concept to all the major game-companies of 1983.The “IBM PC” soon appeared, everyone started writing viruses for it, and the rest is history.So, I got lucky and took subconscious warnings seriously, and really dodged a bullet there! More like, dodged thousands of bullets …and also the tips of those cold, unsharpened soldering irons.[1] Are there any other “hacker” stories involving the PDP-8? I’ve yet to encounter one. I did hear that the Rochester NY planetarium back in the 1970s was run by a PDP-8. I wonder if they got up to any shenannigans with it?

LCGs are of historical and pedagogical note only.Note that had they declared the seed to be an unsigned integer, it would have 16 bits of output and 32 bits of internal state.

The only thing you have to do is to deliver a somewhat working game.And yet, they failed.The game came out as a buggy mess with supremely aggressive micro-transaction features and a flawed multiplayer feature (it is marketed as a live service game, which you should be playing with people around the world, but the matchmaking does not work).Moreover, setting all technical difficulties aside (let us assume that these can be solved by the developers in the future), the game is just “uninspired”. It sits on a franchise which almost became a myth during the course of the past eighty years with countless characters, famous events (such as Civil War, Avengers v. X-Men, etc.), and immensely strong story arcs, and yet, they have made a game in which you run the same three or four maps, fighting the same five or six AIM robots over and over again. For bosses (which is the bread and butter of any beat’em up game), you have: MODOK (only appears at the end of the story mode, is not included in multiplayer endgame section), a plane (yes), a giant spider robot, Taskmaster, and Abomination. Eighty years of Marvel and yes, these are the enemies you fight in the game.In conclusion, the game came out and made good sales figures. Then, in a couple of weeks the player count stabilized and reached around 700–1100 on Steam (I do not know about console numbers). I will not do comparisons between player numbers of live service games, but you can check for yourself: these numbers do not indicate health.I tried to explain my answer to you folks, and I am not grieving actually. Wish they could just wiggle a magic wand and make the game better, but this would be just what the question says: an extremely popular game, ruined by the developers and died.UPDATE 1 (26th of November 2020): Thank you everyone for your views, upvotes and comments. I just wanted to share some updates about the game. Last week the developer Crystal Dynamics shared a “deep dive” video about their upcoming hero, Kate Bishop and showcased new content for the months to follow. They said that Kate Bishop and her story campaign will be released on the 8th of December and new content will follow shortly after. In my own opinion, these will not help raise popularity for the game (since Assassin’s Creed Valhalla launched recently and Cyberpunk 2077 is about to drop like a bomb), and they recently stated that the game has not been successful financially. This means that they would have less budget to keep improving the game. The likely scenario is that if they can somehow hold out until an Avengers movie releases, that would get the game up to some degree (the popularity of the new movie would likely rub onto the game, as well). Otherwise, they might go F2P or some other financial model. I will keep updating this post as the situation progresses.","3,454 followers",Matti Porkka,3.6K,1.8K,16.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-the-Indian-IT-industry-will-remain-a-choice-for-cheap-labour-as-people-are-frequently-switching-and-reaching-30-40-LPA-with-5-7-years-of-experience

Due to this game being 3D using polygons back during a time when consoles weren’t as powerful, it doesn’t look that great.The frame-rate also isn’t that high which can be a problem for people (i.e.Games get more impressive over time, so it only makes sense that this game isn’t as technically impressive as it once was. The AI isn’t as good compared to more recent games, the content isn’t as vast, the split-screen isn’t as good as you can just play CoD or Halo etc. The biggest reasons to come back to this game would be for nostalgia and retro gaming.The second major problem is the control scheme. You also have to use the N64 controller to play this game, and look at this:That controller is most definitely not good for FPS games. Look at where the stick is.The controls for this game are also god awful by today’s standards and we can thank Halo and other modern FPS games for improving them. It’s somewhat insane to think that FPS games used to operate like this.This is the second control scheme, but don’t worry, they’re pretty much all not that good.Now, instead of using two sides of the controller to look (or in the above image, to move) we have the left-stick to move, and the right-stick to look around. We also have the left trigger to ADS—though this can be replaced with an aim feature like in GoldenEye, there was no reason for it to be removed from games—or throw a grenade if the game has no ADS and the right trigger to shoot.It’s a lot more comfortable to play FPS games now, thanks to a better controller and control scheme.If you do wish to play this game, emulate it on a PC so that you can play it with a mouse.This game, though it was great when it first released, most definitely didn’t age well.

(e.g. karate games with 2 big figures used character graphics, space shooting games used sprites, some a combination of both). I’ve never seen ANY game that actually used the graphics modes of the C64, all were character graphics plus sprites.So you had to store the character screen (40x25 = 1000 bytes) and the character generator (2048 bytes max, depending on how many characters are used) only. This is not very large for a C64 either. The level graphics always contained many repeating motifs, that’s ideal for handling as character graphics. It can be considered a sort of image compression. When the level was bigger than the physical screen, only the less than 1k character display had to be multiplied, while the character generator remained static.Usual data compression was also used.

Always.Computation takes heat. More efficient computation takes less heat, but it still takes a lot of heat.This graphic is pretty handy for explaining why that’s a problem:As a processor gets more powerful but maintains the same size, you have to use more and more powerful cooling to keep it from just outright melting.Making a processor physically larger is a good way to cheat yourself around that, but it makes chips exponentially more expensive to manufacture. You can get around that problem some by connecting multiple chips in one package, like AMD is doing with their current high-end lineup:But even that has physical limits, though. At some point, you’re pumping too much power into too little space, and you can’t cool it off fast enough.So the solution is to spread that computation out among different chips that are physically separate, which we often do by having multi-CPU machines. You can also do load-sharing between specialized chips that are better at certain tasks, which is what we do with GPU co-processing.And then, at the highest level of performance, you can chain multiple physical machines together through a hyper-fast network.Supercomputers take advantage of all of these options at the same t...",260 followers,Andrew Lane,739,1.2K,7.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-the-Indian-IT-industry-will-remain-a-choice-for-cheap-labour-as-people-are-frequently-switching-and-reaching-30-40-LPA-with-5-7-years-of-experience
53,"I think previous answers are missing the point.We don’t know how to build more powerful processorsThe best we can do is hook a bunch of what we can build together.I’m talking about what are called “cores” now. The thing that executes a single threaded serial program.We know how to pack multiple cores into a single package (socket, processor, whatever you call it) up to a hundred or so. We know how to hook up to a million or so such packages into a cluster and use to run a single very large application.We have no idea how to build a single core that is 100 million times faster, or even 100 timeI think previous answers are missing the point.We don’t know how to build more powerful processorsThe best we can do is hook a bunch of what we can build together.I’m talking about what are called “cores” now.

A “supercomputer” isn’t a particular thing, it is the word we use to describe the largest most powerful machines that we can afford,",5 followers,Wasim Momin,1.1K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-the-Indian-IT-industry-will-remain-a-choice-for-cheap-labour-as-people-are-frequently-switching-and-reaching-30-40-LPA-with-5-7-years-of-experience
