5,Of course there is a possibility. The Big Bang is estimated to have occurred 13.8 billion years ago. Our sun has approximately 4.6 billion years of age. So a star similar to our sun formed just one billion of years before our sun could have today a planet orbiting around it with an alien civilization with a history of 500 million years!

No other atom seems to be able to do this in a similar way. Even silicon [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon ], which has the same number of valence electrons [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_electron ] as carbon, cannot form the variety of molecules that carbon can. However, this does not mean that all life would necessarily be based on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA ]) and cells [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology) ], as it is on Earth.An essential requirement for life as we know it is water. Any life which is based on molecules almost certainly requires some kind of liquid solvent to be able to move them around. Whilst chemical reactions can take place in gases and solids these are much less ideal than liquid. Gas phase reactions happen only with molecules that are volatile enough to be present in large quantities in a gas whereas reactions in solids can take place only (comparatively) very slowly. Both of these limitations make it much more likely for life to develop in liquid, as indeed it has done on Earth. Even science naturally takes the easiest path wherever possible!It therefore follows, for there to be water (chemical symbol, H2O), two elements that would be required in abundance are oxygen and hydrogen.Many of the unique physical and chemical properties that make water particularly well suited to support the complex chemistry required for life include expansion when it freezes [ http://youtu.be/T4GCShGvw-M ]—preventing oceans and lakes from freezing solid—and easy dissolution of many substances. It also has a high heat capacity [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properties_of_water#Heat_capacity_and_heats_of_vaporization_and_fusion ], meaning that it requires a lot of energy to cause water to change temperature. It is this property of water that gives Earth its relatively moderate climate and the proportion of water to land (71% surface area – although only 0.2% of its mass) is a relevant factor in that.Water is also the commonest liquid and the second most common chemical in the universe (after pure hydrogen). Other liquids exist naturally in the universe, but not in the abundance that water does. Furthermore, most of those liquids don’t have many of the other key properties of water that make it as eminently suitable as the basis for life.The planet (or satellite of a planet) where life could exist would need to be orbiting its star at a distance—relative to the star’s size—where the prevailing temperatures will not cause water to permanently freeze or rapidly evaporate into space. As previously mentioned, this is referred to by astronomers as ‘The Circumstellar Habitable Zone [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumstellar_habitable_zone ]’ (CHZ)’ and Earth is the only planet in the solar system that is in that zone - which is why Earth is the only planet in the Solar System WITH life.But what about other solar systems? That is a question that, after thousands of years, mankind is only just beginning to have the ability to answer. Only in the last 50 or so years have we had the technology that has given us that ability and only in the last 8 years have we had the benefit of the Kepler space telescope (commissioned in 2011)—specifically dedicated to finding exoplanets—to provide reliable statistics.And, now that we have it, the complete answer will not be available to us for several generations. Whilst Kepler has indicated that all the stars in the Milky Way have at least one planet and that 1 in 5 of those are in its CHZ, scientists are now faced with the reality that searches they initiate now to establish whether those planets actually have any life at all most probably won’t produce answers in their own lifetimes—or even those of their grandchildren—due to the unalterable fact that any such planet is so far away from Earth. (It takes 4½ years for us to just be able to see the closest one—let alone go there and investigate!)Nevertheless, with one in five stars having planets with the conditions to support life as we know it, this means that there are in the order of 80 billion of them in the Milky Way galaxy alone - and, whilst the question doesn’t actually specify so, it is only really relevant to consider “other star systems” in our own Milky Way galaxy as anything else is too far away to have any significance in this context.What is it though, that animates lipids, sugars, proteins and nucleic acid molecules into organic life forms? The missing ingredient is, of course, energy.That essential energy could possibly have been provided by lightning which struck the essential components—already bound into compound chemicals—and thereby activated them into a primitive independence by the production of DNA which self-sophisticated (by way of evolution) over millions of years to the point we are at today.If that is, indeed what happened in the primordial Earth, there is no reason why it couldn’t have happened—and still be happening—in millions of other similar environments throughout the cosmos. In fact it would be audacious to assume that it isn’t!So, let’s examine some more statistics that should give more credibility to the argument.When the planets (including Earth) were first formed after the big bang, they were much hotter than they are now with most of their surfaces being molten rock and, furthermore, in the early cosmos, they were constantly bombarded by asteroids and meteors (most of which have now already been burned up or coalesced) and so self-sustaining life would have been exceedingly difficult or virtually impossible.However, with the passage of time (lots of time - millions of Earth-years) they cooled to the point where liquid water was able to form and basic life-forms were able to establish a foothold and become increasingly sophisticated to the point of having what we call intelligence.Evidence of organic life has already been found on Jupiter’s moons, Europa, Calisto and Ganymede and frost forming on the dwarf planet Ceres (the largest asteroid in the main belt) suggests the presence of water and thus the possibility of (at least) primitive stromatolite life.Looking further afield, to support life, a planet in its star’s CHZ would also need to have a stable atmosphere. This would, firstly, have sufficient free oxygen to sustain aerobic (oxygen-breathing) life without containing lethal levels of poisonous gases and, secondly, to provide a protective filter for screening radiation and burning up incoming space debris. It would also need to be able to support water vapour in the form of clouds to enable the natural distribution of water by way of rain and dew to nourish plant growth which, in turn would require a significant proportion of carbon (in the form of carbon dioxide) to provide the molecule that plant life requires for conversion to fibre. (And it must be remembered that animals NEED plant life to eat.)Another requirement would be that the planet revolves on its axis at a speed that doesn’t produce extremely long equatorial days and nights so that photosynthesis of plant life isn’t suspended to the point where it would die and thus fail to use up the carbon that, without them doing that, would be present as too high a proportion of an earth-like atmosphere to sustain animal life. In other words, a certain equilibrium would be essential.Then the planet would not have to spin on its axis at such a speed that the centrifugal force at its equator didn’t overpower its gravity and fling anything not firmly rooted into the ground—including small stones and topsoil AND animals—into space.An interesting fact that not many people know about that illustrates the truth of this is right here on Earth where, even due to our relatively gentle spin, the summit of Mt. Chimborazo at 6268 metres above sea level, just a few kilometres south of the equator in the Ecuadorian Andes, is actually further from the centre of the Earth than the summit of Mt. Everest at 8848 metres because the centrifugal force caused by the Earth’s spin means that it is not a perfect sphere but an oblate spheroid where its diameter at the equator is 12756 km whilst the polar diameter is 12714!Also, if the planet’s axis is, like Earth’s, inclined (tilted) in relation to its orbit, the period of its orbit would need to be within a range whereby seasons are not too long since that would contribute to quicker desertification—both arid and icy—and, over extensive periods, ultimately result in an inhospitable environment.And, having so said, the planet would also need to have a porous surface capable of holding water and thus sustaining abundant plant life to provide food and photosynthesis.If the planet’s axis happened to be at right angles to its orbit, there would, of course, be no seasons as we on Earth know them so that life forms would be noticeably more diverse at different latitudes. That would not, however, pose a survival problem although it could make life on that planet a lot more stratified to the point where animals (including hominids) living in Polar Regions would not comfortably survive for any length of time in the tropics and vice-versa.As with life here on Earth, it would seem inevitable that a survival-of-the-fittest paradigm whereby those life forms that are best able to adapt (evolve) to suit the environment would be predominant if not exclusive. Depending on prevailing temperatures, it is possible that life might only be viable at extreme latitudes or altitudes just as natural life on Antarctica is limited to just a few species on the extreme outer rim.And, of course, all of the foregoing would require the planet to be of such a size and mass [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass ] that its gravity is within a range whereby living creatures would not be crushed by their own weight or float off into space. The gravitational attraction at the surface of a body is proportional to its mass and inversely proportional to the square of its radius so that a very dense planet could be smaller than Earth and still have the same gravity whilst a much larger planet would need to be much less dense than Earth to exert a similar gravitational force.The normal awareness we have of the concept of mass is when we talk about weight, which is the effect of an energy field (in this case, gravitation) upon mass. Hence, for example, we can talk of ‘weighing’ one sixth as much on the Moon as on the earth because not only is the Moon’s radius a quarter of Earth’s but it is also much less dense. In actual fact, weight is just a relative term referring to effect and, in the case of living creatures, feeling. For the same reason that the earth is an ellipsoid an object at the poles actually weighs 0.5% more than it does at the equator—although its mass doesn’t change.That is not to say that the gravity on another inhabited planet would need to be identical with that on Earth since, if, for example, it was stronger, the muscular development of life forms—although still basically as we know them—would adapt to cope with it because, in such an environment, they would be heavier. However, if humans were ever to visit such a planet, they could be crushed by their own weight. Interestingly, this is not an aspect often considered in science-fiction stories and movies of space travel.Yet another requirement would be the geological age of the planet tectonically speaking. If it is still in the (cosmologically) early stages of cooling, there would be numerous volcanic eruptions and earthquakes making stability of life hazardous at least, and probably impossible.There are also certain requirements of the star itself. Our sun is a yellow dwarf [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Dwarf ]—itself, another myth (better referred to as a misnomer) since it is only the passage of the Sun’s light through Earth’s atmosphere that makes it appear yellow when it is, in fact, pure white—a fact only observed when space flight became possible and man first saw the sun without impedance.This means it is not rapidly expanding and thus liable to envelop the Earth in such a short time (again, cosmologically speaking) that life wouldn’t have time to develop sufficiently to become intelligent—let alone technologically capable of intragalactic travel (we’re only just beginning to understand it after two hundred thousand years!). By the same token a very small bright star would be more likely to explode as a super nova and destroy any life that had developed.In 1961, a founder of SETI, American astrophysicist, Frank Drake [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Drake ] formulated an equation that was supposed to accurately estimate the number of communicative civilizations in the Milky Way. Some scientists reckoned it was reasonably accurate whilst others were sceptical.Basically, the equation stated that the number of planets that might have intelligent life could be determined by the sum of seven hypothetical statistics observed. However, since several of those statistics still aren’t precisely known, the formula is difficult to calculate. Therefore, I don’t personally rate the formula very highly although, as I say, some scientists do.Another aspect of life as we know it—yet potentially very different on another planet—is its morphology—that is, its physical structure.If, for example, the production of peptides [ https://www.britannica.com/science/peptide ] (growth hormones) was only slightly different in otherwise identical species to those known on Earth, their relative sizes could be vastly different so that what we know here on Earth as small creatures, which, whilst unchanged in any other way, might be dramatically larger in size so that a very fast huntsman spider [ https://theconversation.com/hidden-housemates-australias-huge-and-hairy-huntsman-spiders-55017 ] the same size as a human would be able to run 8 times faster than him!The same could apply to any number of other small creatures such as ants or bees (both already pretty intelligent) or katydids, scorpions, geckos or mantids etc.When it is considered that there are somewhere around 2½ MILLION spiders for every human on Earth and that they collectively eat over 400 million tons of meat every year, they could eat the entire human population of Earth (less than 300 million tons) in less than a year! (Now there’s a cheerful thought for all you arachnophobes out there!) Aren’t you glad that their meat diet is mainly small insects and bugs?Whilst that may, at first, sound like a great script for a horror movie, some 3 billion years ago, when Earth was much younger, that was exactly how it was here.If it were normal on another planet, hunting arachnids, with their lethal fangs and venom, would probably be a dominant life-form and the only change (other than their size) that would be needed for them to achieve total dominance would be intelligence and, as the physically dominant life-form, that may only require time for development.If rational thinking is borne in mind, the only reason that humans are the dominant creatures on Earth is their superior intelligence.

9,"Yes that is certainly possible and this most likely occurred many times over !

All this is very plausible even if you just use the common sense approach, but is a lot more than that ! The number of planets that could, and can sustain life is likely to be an enormous number, and life could have originated on many, many of these planets, and many of these could have given rise to intelligent, and highly intelligent life forms, very likely far more advanced than us at any given time. What is also possible, but not talked about much because of fear of controversy is if other life forms originated here on earth millions of years before us, and moved out of here to other distant places, visiting here at times to see how we as a newer race on earth is doing in their own secretive ways with minimal or no interference ?? It is likely to be a hallmark of any highly advanced civilization with capacity for possibly limitless space travel to branch out to different parts of the galaxy or go to other galaxies as their technology could permit that, and they could return where they originated from to see it from time to time, and check on any other civilization that might have originated in their place of origin ! This is a new idea that struck me as being plausible on rationalistic grounds and I have just shared it with you. This would be somewhat different than the purely extraterrestrial or extra-dimensional hypothesis. Or even more remarkable is if there are other far more advanced civilizations that actually originated here, and are still here, but are not visible to us as they occupy the sub-hydrosphere regions of the earth (under the oceans)… This latter conjecture was hinted at by biologist Ivan Sanders in the 70s in his book, “ Is there intelligent life under the oceans ?” The numerous UAP (Unidentified aerial phenomena) incidents, and USO (Unidentified submarine object) incidents with strong connections to our waters, and aero-space territories are quite uncanny indeed leading to the suggestion of such a possibility. Many of the serious researchers whether with privately funded research organizations, or with classified organizations within the system may know a lot more than I can possibly write here. Most of this information if correct is not likely to be disclosed to the unsuspecting public anytime soon. It certainly can be construed as one of the most highly classified areas of research and endeavor that can exist ! There may develop a tendency to call it more “extraterrestrial”, as people become a lot more informed, open-minded, and relatively accepting of the “straightforward extraterrestrial hypothesis” than “sub-terrestrial”, or apparently “co-existent-with-us-hypothesis” which is far more unsettling, can conceivably trigger far more unrest, and excite vulnerable corners of population psyche far in excess of what we would like to imagine !

I am not a “shouter”, I know how to bring constructive arguments to the table. Pointing out the elephant in the room. It is really easy actually.I have zero respect for hierarchy. I draw the line at performance.The only ones who would like to throw me in front of a train are the folks who achieved that level of comfort zone, and want it to stay.. as comfort is nice.",UNKNOWN,Ali O.
