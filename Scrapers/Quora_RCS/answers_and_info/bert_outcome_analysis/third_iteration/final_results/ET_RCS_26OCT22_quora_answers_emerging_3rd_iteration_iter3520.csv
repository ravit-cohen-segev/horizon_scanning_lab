1,"Does religion create society or society create religion?For a question no one can ever really know the answer to I am happy to share my personal opinion.First, for a long time it was believed that religion was a product of civilization. It was thought that agriculture started civilization which then started religion. That would pretty much answer your question if that was all the info out there. It isn‚Äôt.

It is now being theorized we got that backwards.The assumption was that in settling down to lives of farming, people built cities, created art and made up organized religions to suit the new needs they faced in the transition from hunter-gathers to farmers.Or not.New evidence suggests that it was not agriculture which created civilization, but religion.G√∂bekli Tepe is the site of the world‚Äôs oldest example of monumental architecture‚Äî a temple. This particular Temple existed without a city.At the time ofThe picture created here is that differing groups of people worshipped ‚ÄúGod‚Äù and got together to build a Temple. There would have been enough of them together in one place for long enough that foraged food would become scarce, so they started growing their own. Hence, religion led to agriculture which then produced civilization.The evidence from Turkey suggests that the pilgrimage impulse, the collective worship impulse, the sacred space impulse, are all supra-natural, if not super-natural. There is something within us, not necessarily from outside us, which compels the building of Gobekli Tepe and places like it. That ‚Äúsomething‚Äù is not simply accounted for by the usual explanations which seek to explain, or, too often, explain away, people‚Äôs attachment to religious expression.This is supported by a recent Oxford study as well.Humans are naturally predisposed to believe in gods and life after death, according to a major three-year international study. Led by two academics at Oxford University, the ¬£1.9 million study found that human thought processes were ‚Äúrooted‚Äù to religious concepts. The project involved 57 academics in 20 countries around the world, and spanned disciplines including anthropology, psychology, and philosophy.It set out to establish whether belief in divine beings and an afterlife were ideas simply learned from society or integral to human nature and ‚Äúnot just something for a peculiar few to do on Sundays instead of playing golf‚Äù.‚ÄúWe have gathered a body of evidence that suggests that religion is a common fact of human nature across different societies,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúThis suggests that attempts to suppress religion are likely to be short-lived as human thought seems to be rooted to religious concepts, such as the existence of supernatural agents or gods, and the possibility of an afterlife or pre-life.‚ÄùBelief in God is part of human nature - Oxford studyJenny Hawkins's answer to Why has religion not disappeared yet?","220,605 followers",Franklin Veaux,3K,47.3K,782.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-personal-development-system-which-could-create-people-who-can-live-in-an-advanced-technological-society-without-becoming-destructive-as-individuals-or-societies
