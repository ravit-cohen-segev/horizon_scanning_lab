The dolphins and whales are mammals that moved back into the water millions of years ago and they still breath air. But they can stay under water much longer than humans thanks to adaptations, and that’s something we might see.I do remember there’s some small Asian (?) group of people who show certain changes in their physiology for just the reason that they swim and dive for food.

Quick google-fu. Ah yes, the Bajau, boat nomads that move around the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. They have on average 50% bigger spleens than related land-living peoples which somehow helps them dive longer and deeper (in addition to training, of course). The mutation for this didn’t appear over night but it was so good for their lifestyle that they all have it now. The article just said they’ve lived like this for “thousands” of years so what, maybe 2000 minimum for the mutation to spread through the whole community?","26,184 followers",Ken Saladin,775,22.2K,104.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-all-humans-were-thrown-into-the-oceans-are-there-some-whom-their-bodies-will-evolve-and-start-breathing-in-water
1,"Evolution only works on species not individuals. Any situation that changes the environment so severely as to lead to immediate death does not give an option for having sex and raising a family with a tiny mutation that is a little bit more beneficial in the environmentThis is why we have caused so many species extinction events. We caused the environment to change so rapidly that there can be no adaptation. Like draining the great Ohio swamp that used to exist.

Any situation that changes the environment so severely as to lead to immediate death does not give an option for having sex and raising a family with a tiny mutation that is a little bit more beneficial in the environmentThis is why we have caused so many species extinction events. We caused the environment to change so rapidly that there can be no adaptation. Like draining the great Ohio swamp that used to exist. Bingo all the swamp critters gone at once.Climate change was responsible for the adaptation of global migration routes. Birds would fly say 10° North to 10° South during the season in the narrow band between the ice sheets. Then year by year as the glaciers receded they would be flying 20° North to 20° South. Then eventually 60° North to 60° South as they moved to the freshly exposed ground.This process took tens of thousands of years of adaptation, and certainly evolution to sustain these long journeys. But now we are altering the climate in just a few centuries more than what happened in the past several million years. This is simply too fast for a species to adapt to.Now there is a theory called punctuated equilibrium. That species will evolve faster when a stressor is placed on them. Throughout the body there are watchdog cells, asleep in my case since I now have cancer. Their job is to patrol cell development and destroy anything that gets off the master plan. In our gonads the immune system has a type of cell called a chaperonin, and it does exactly what the name suggests, it keeps an eye on how sex cells are doing. And if sperm or egg are being manufactured wrong it destroys them.So the theory posits that under stress the immune system is weakened and the chaperones fail to do their job and mutated sperm and eggs occur at a higher rate and thus increase the mutation rate due to replication error. So the variation shows up just as it's needed. It's a theory, it has critics but it seems reasonable to expect.It also would seem reasonable that highly evolved specialist animals would have the hardest time dealing with environmental change requiring an evolutionary response. Bees and ants are prime examples. And with bees we've already see them as a bellwether species with the colony collapse disorder. Bananas are another one, strictly due to our behavior in creating monocultures. The bananas you currently eat are going extinct. And you will tell your children and grandchildren of these creamy bananas that had no seeds in them. Bananas will still be on the table, but just not the ones you eat todayHummingbirds are so evolved that some of them can only survive on a single type of flower. If that flower were to go extinct those species of hummingbird are done for.The generalist animals have a better time with change, often due to behavioral adaptation which is far faster than biological evolution. To which we get to keep company with raccoons, seagulls, feral cats, rats, pigeons, mice, gophers and a whole host of other obnoxious creatures have no problem commingling with us and surviving in our cities.Science fiction is anything but science in most cases. Since the movie 2001 A space Odyssey had the cryptic evolution of consciousness most science fiction grabs derivative pieces of it, most notably Star Trek and Star wars. Star Trek routinely has people individually evolving to a light form energy source. It permeates science fiction as an ersatz Christianity spiritualism merged with kubricks special effects.Individuals cannot evolve, they can adapt. Species evolve by lots of f****** and dumping their children into the cold world and letting Darwin's hammer take care of the ones that aren't good enough.The time you need for evolution to work is longer when the species delays breeding. Hence viruses and bacteria can evolve faster than anything and the slowest to evolve would be the animals that have the longest time before they start breeding.No matter what though if you change the environment fast enough not even a virus or bacteria can keep up and evolve.",3 followers,Samuel Bateman,1.1K,102,56.4K,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-all-humans-were-thrown-into-the-oceans-are-there-some-whom-their-bodies-will-evolve-and-start-breathing-in-water
2,"No. Evolution progresses through tiny incremental changes in the average genetic makeup of each successive generation of offspring. Only octopodes can change themselves on the fly, in one lifetime, because they have special ways of editing their own RNA after it leaves the gene: the rest of us can’t do that.So, throw all the humans in the ocean and humanity will be extinct in half an hour. Put all humans near the coast in a situation where the best food is to be found underwater and there are no aqualungs, and from generation to generation they will gradually get better at holding their breathNo. Evolution progresses through tiny incremental changes in the average genetic makeup of each successive generation of offspring.

Put all humans near the coast in a situation where the best food is to be found underwater and there are no aqualungs, and from generation to generation they will gradually get better at holding their breath under water - as has already happened with some coastal communities. Keep that up for, say, 200 million years, and prevent them from developing technology, and yes, they might evolve gill-equivalents.",15 followers,Toon Larsson,691,0,0,2022,https://www.quora.com/If-all-humans-were-thrown-into-the-oceans-are-there-some-whom-their-bodies-will-evolve-and-start-breathing-in-water
3,"No. For two different reasons.Firstly, evolution works mainly by fairly small steps, where each step has to make the individual better adapted (or at least not worse adapted) to the prevailing environment. It’s hard to see what intermediate steps you could usefully take in that situation. And anyway, this is basically a poster child for how huge, rapid changes in the environment can make a species go extinct: they can’t adapt quickly enough.Secondly, humans are warm-blooded mammals. We need lots of oxygen to keep a constant body temperature—the oxygen is needed to “burn” mainly carbohydrates aNo. For two different reasons.Firstly, evolution works mainly by fairly small steps, where each step has to make the individual better adapted (or at least not worse adapted) to the prevailing environment.

We need lots of oxygen to keep a constant body temperature—the oxygen is needed to “burn” mainly carbohydrates and fat. A lot of the food we eat go towards keeping us warm. Water simply can’t hold enough oxygen for warm-blooded creatures. Aquatic mammals breathe air, without exception. This is chemistry and physics; those are constraints we can’t evolve our way out of.If you want humans to evolve into something more like whales, that’s certainly possible. Constrain us to a desert coastline without tools for a million years, so that we have to get all our food by diving into the water, and you’ll see considerable change.","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,742,6.8K,91.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-all-humans-were-thrown-into-the-oceans-are-there-some-whom-their-bodies-will-evolve-and-start-breathing-in-water
4,"Without the help of technology, humans wouldn’t survive on another planet at all. If you alter the air mixture even by a few percent, anyone breathing it would go into a coma. We would be unable to digest any of the local food material. If we’re very unlucky, the viruses and bacteria in the environment would be similar enough to infect us, which would kill us faster than the Martians in War of the Worlds.","220,632 followers",Franklin Veaux,702,47.3K,783M,2018,https://www.quora.com/If-all-humans-were-thrown-into-the-oceans-are-there-some-whom-their-bodies-will-evolve-and-start-breathing-in-water
5,how long would it take for humans to adapt/evolve on other planetsCurious question.Assuming humans could live and survive on this other planet in the first place (or they are dead before they get a chance to “evolve”) then the process would begin immediately and within a few hundred generations I would expect to see some obvious adaptions.A lot would depend on the selection pressure and the size of the initial population of colonists.,201 followers,Max Williams,3.5K,1.4K,3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/If-all-humans-were-thrown-into-the-oceans-are-there-some-whom-their-bodies-will-evolve-and-start-breathing-in-water

8,"Maybe a few millennia. Maybe never.Evolution is not goal directed. We are not the “highest form” of evolution. Evolution does not move in the direction of greater and greater intelligence.After the non-avian dinosaurs went extinct, evolution never again produced something with a neck as a long as the giant sauropods.
