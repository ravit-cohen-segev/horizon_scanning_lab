0,"Are the survival aspects from the movie ""The Martian"" possible with our current and near upcoming technology?Well, if Neil DeGrasse Tyson doesn’t see major flaws in the movie, except for some plot holes to make it more dramatic - well, I don’t think that there are any mayor ones either.There is a challenge to get all this stuff to Mars and properly place it there, but other than that - yes, the survival seems plausible.The answer is therefore - yes.",10 followers,Andrew Forrest,2.3K,6.2K,16.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Are-the-survival-aspects-from-the-movie-The-Martian-possible-with-our-current-and-near-upcoming-technology
1,"Like can you grow potatoes in your own shit and survive? Yes.Most everything except the severity of the storm, and the gravity was accurate in that movie.

2,"There is the plausible science (using rocket fuel as a source for water) and the downright impossible fiction (Mars sandstorms are not strong enough to cause damage).

As far as we know, the soil on Mars doesn’t have any organisms or micronutrients to support growth of potatoes.Plants need five things in order to grow: sunlight, proper temperature, moisture, air, and nutrients.

3,"If a person was left on Mars, would NASA really expend that many resources to bring them home, like in the movie The Martian?Sorry to say, but it all boils down to money. If NASA have the funding, they will do what ever it takes to rescue a stranded astronaut home. The question is, do they get the money?I actually think that such a rescue attempt would be undertaken because Congress would vote in the funds like a shot. Consider this, normally politics works on the emotional response of the public, which politicians are very well aware of.

Politicians normally leverage fear as the great manipulator to get what they want, but how many would sacrifice the opportunity to be seen as a great humanitarian and rescuer of stranded heroes?The funding required for a rescue would be approved overnight and NASA would be gleefully working on how they could solve this fascinating new problem, and expand their capabilities. Saving the actual person would be a fantastic benefit, but the real perceived benefit would be the expanded resources and new equipment and knowledge.This is assuming of course that the rescue was technically possible in the first place.

4,"We are nowhere near it.Nowhere. Not even slightly.An exoskeleton that allows the user to have greater strength for lifting in specific circumstances? Yes. But not a suit. A suit that allows you to breathe? Sure, with GIANT tanks attached to it, for a couple hours.Let’s break down what the suit is and why we can’t have nice things… yet.

You need the actuators to give it the stretch but the suit would fall apart from stress so you need the exotic materials but then you need to power it so you need a power source that generates enough power in a tiny space that doesn’t kill the wearer with radiation and heat, but you can’t fly unless you have repulsors and then you can’t control it because you don’t have the mind interface, but then you are limited in what you can do unless you have the most advanced and complete and benign AI installed but you can’t do that unless you have the computing power that is insanely powerful in a tiny space and none of that matters because a couple hits from physical attacks would turn your body and brain to jelly from the outside shocks so you need electronic inertial dampeners that would put the Enterprise to shame.And that’s why we can’t have nice things.PS - I’m sure I missed something. :)","15,677 followers",Sarthak Raj Baral,742,550,66M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Are-the-survival-aspects-from-the-movie-The-Martian-possible-with-our-current-and-near-upcoming-technology
5,"Not in detail. As Andy Weir, the author, has freely admitted, the storm which sets up original situation where Mark Watney is unknowingly marooned on Mars, was not realistic. The Martian atmosphere is far too thin for a storm to force an unwanted launch in the manner shown. The rest is as realistic as a good engineer could make it. But only one, and there have been numerous criticisms of aspects of what is portrayed. Which is only to be expected when hundreds of highly skilled engineers criticise one, however good that one may be.",0 followers,Nicole Kane,2.8K,889,8.4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Are-the-survival-aspects-from-the-movie-The-Martian-possible-with-our-current-and-near-upcoming-technology

Well, unfortunately, those microbots are impossible, but there is a similar technology that’s being developed in real life.The idea is to build tiny replicators that can create more of themselves, like a sort of super bacteria that never stops replicating. Such a technology would be“…the first replicator assembles a copy in one thousand seconds, the two replicators then build two more in the next thousand seconds, the four build another four . . in less than two days, theyNanotechnology, but in a really cool way.You remember the microbots in Big Hero 6, right?

But they would have an abundance of material on Earth, especially of carbon, which would likely be the building blocks of such an assemblers. If you were carrying a jar of them and tripped and they spilled out, and they had no limit, they would quickly devour the entire earth with no way of stopping them.But here is where things get interesting: These tiny robots would have the ability to construct molecules from atoms, giving them the ability to produce amazing materials like graphene, cubes of apple, and even brain material.With advanced nanotechnology in the form of self-replicators, the entire world would experience a revolution. Think for a second about what wouldn’t change in the face of machines that can produceProduction jobs would cease. The price of every item ever created would be lowered massively. Supercomputers and experiments regarding brain material would become almost commonplace. Terraforming other planets would take years if not months.
