I worked for my friends computer cafe for about 3 years, not because it was the only job I can get, but because it was so easy and I get to play games as much as I want.The following year I had a girlfriend, I had to get more money, as I was spending more. By that time, I already knew programming, I did code a little on my free time in the cafe. I also got paid by several computer science students who can‚Äôt finish their projects in time to do the coding for them.So here‚Äôs what I did, I created a resume. At that time,I probably know at least 5 programming languages, c++, java, php, visual basic, javascript. I also know SQL, HTML, and CSS. I knew I‚Äôm at a disadvantage for not having a degree, so I created a resume with my educational background nearly at the end of the document. After finishing the document, I went online and looked for opportunities, sent my resume to every company possible.Two weeks later I got a bunch of calls inviting me for an interview, I passed most of the application exam. Some companies even asked me when I wanted to start the day of the interview. Despite my lack of a degree, I was able to have the luxury of choosing which company to work for.Seriously, don‚Äôt let a piece of paper stop you from getting the job you want, as long as you can prove to people you are capable of doing something.

Can you help me?‚ÄùI receive several of these requests every month, on Quora or LinkedIn. I try to be a nice guy and help when I can but a request like that tells me why you are struggling to find a job.The Importance Of SpecificityRichard Nesbitt and Lee Ross conducted an experiment with Stanford students, who were asked to list the most generous students they knew as well as the most selfish.Lists were created and the researchers contacted these groups, asking them to contribute to a food drive. They split them into two groups, with the difference being instructions given.The first group was given a vague ‚ÄúDear Student‚Äù request asking them to donate food and telling them where they could drop it off and when.The second group was given much more specific direction. They were addressed by name in the letter, given direction on specific foods to bring (i.e. Creamed Corn), a map directing them to the drop box, a specific time to visit and then a follow-up call reminding them of what they learned in the letter.Even one in four jerks showed up with some creamed cornMake It Easy To Help YouWhen I suggest to a job seeker that they need to approach as many decision makers as possible, I often hear ‚ÄúI‚Äôve tried that, it doesn‚Äôt work.‚ÄùPerhaps, you have tried. How many did you reach out to? Five? Ten? How about 500? How bad to do you want a better job?Your alternative is starting your own business and I assure you that you will reach out to far more strangers than 500 to accomplish that.How easy are you making it on those you reach out to? Are you leaving them with open-ended requests to help you?How many decisions do they have to make when they open your email?They now have one decision to make. They can forward the email to someone in their network, who is most likely junior to their position if you did the homework. Or, they can delete your email.It is still likely they will not help you, just like 75% of the jerks in the study still didn‚Äôt donate to the food drive. That said, you give yourself a much better chance of sparking an action on your behalf if you are clear, direct and ask for something that requires a quick decision or action.Do the work for the person you need help from.
