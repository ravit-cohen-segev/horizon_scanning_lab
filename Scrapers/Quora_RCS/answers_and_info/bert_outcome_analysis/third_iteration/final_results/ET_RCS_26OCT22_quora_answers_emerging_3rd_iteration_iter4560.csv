2,"No. First of all, there is no reason to engage China militarily. China is not an enemy of USA.Second, a war with China would be devastating for the whole world, possibly leading to global nuclear destruction.Third, USA cannot win a war with China. The Pentagon has conducted numerous war game exercises involving China in East and South China Seas, and in each and every one of them, China won. The lesson here is:China has operational hypersonic missiles and so-called “carrier killers.” Does USA want to see all their supercarriers sink to the bottom ofNo. First of all, there is no reason to engage China militarily.

3,"From the perspective of terrorists they are just an army — and a little guy taking on the big guy. They believe they can attack just as an army does. And many governments even implicitly and explicitly support these “small guys”.US and Europe fund “terrorists” in Syria fighting the Assad regime, because they consider the terrorists to be the good ones. Same in Libya. India at one point armed militia in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.

4,"No. Supporting the resistance in Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban, and searching for Bin Laden was the right thing to do, but the kidnapping, the black prisons, the torture, and the indefinite detention without trial were gross violations of human rights. The torture is wrong on its face, but in addition to that, it doesn’t work. Bush tortured people for seven years trying to find Bin Laden and got nowhere. Obama used better methods and found him.I was never so disgusted with American politicians as when I heard them openly condoning torture… and many of my fellow-citizens as well.

Subscribers receive online high-resolution photographs of a single element of a grid taken from satellite photo mosaics of an area under study.Following instructions sent with your particular photo, you (as the subscriber) scan the picture looking for traces of ancient buildings, roadways, waterworks, temples or the like. If you find something, you report it to the site moderator and he (or she) forwards your description and your cell identifier to a ground team to investigate.Aside from the increasing use of LIDAR, this crowd-sourcing approach has found more legitimate sites in the last 5 years than in the previous century using conventional methods.Or how about searching night-sky astronomical photos, looking for subtle streaks that belie asteroids?Or how about the continuing work of logging the world’s weather at thousands of amateur stations around the world?

6,"Community art projects on a massive scale. When everyone is housed, feed, health taken care of, educated, and cared for is when social gatherings in collaborartory fashion become meaningful. Art is play and like changing shapes of things as manufacturing does changes function. Art allows one to see different meanings and functions in things that exist and how to alter them to add different function.Society is afraid of art because of its power of perception as a change agency.",UNKNOWN,Prachi,13.5K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-foreign-governments-today-readily-possess-the-requisite-technologies-to-be-actively-engaging-in-global-directed-energy-radiation-like-attacks-against-foreign-diplomatic-intelligence-officials-Non-state-actors
