4,"No, the U.S. move isn’t a devastating blow to China's supercomputing sector because the more than 60 Chinese scientists and engineers of the Tianhe high-performance computing team (hereinafter referred to as the Tianhe team) of the School of Computer Science and Technology of China National University of Defense Technology have contributed a great deal of their efforts in the research and developmNo, the U.S. move isn’t a devastating blow to China's supercomputing sector because the more than 60 Chinese scientists and engineers of the Tianhe high-performance computing team (hereinafter referred to as the Tianhe team) of the School of Computer Science and Technology of China National University of Defense Technology have contributed a great deal of their efforts in the research and development of the core supercomputing technology.With its super computing power, Tianhe-2 facilitated the virtual screening of drugs, and quickly located more than 30 potentially effective drugs in only 3 days. The new coronary pneumonia CT imaging intelligent diagnosis platform built on the Tianhe-2 can complete a CT image diagnosis in 15 seconds, making a major contribution to the fight against the epidemic.A high performance supercomputer is one of the important indexes to measure the comprehensive national strength and technological development level of a country and plays an important role in war simulation, weapon development, simulated nuclear test explosion, space satellites and other military applications, meteorology, physics, detection, material science and computing nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, in-depth learning, biomedicine, genetic engineering, and financial analysis, …, etc.The high-performance computing science and industry were started late in China. Thus, it takes the Chinese scientists and engineers time to catch up with those leading countries. In order for the high-performance computing to catch up as soon as possible, Xiao Liquan, the Deputy Chief Designer of Tianhe No. 2, who is in charge of the communication direction of the Tianhe team, has worked hard for 30 years on the research and development projects.At the end of the 20th century, electrical interconnection technology was usually used in large-scale high-performance computer systems, and the information transmission rate was slow and susceptible to interference, which affected the stability of the system. The best solution is to replace electrical interconnection with optical interconnection.After many failures, finally, the optical interconnection technology has been effectively verified in large-scale high-performance computer systems, which has laid a solid foundation for the subsequent application of this technology in supercomputer systems. In June, 2013, the Tianhe II was successfully developed and took the top place in supercomputer rankings of the world.In November, 2013, in order to upgrade the Tianhe No. 2 system, Xiao Liquan and his team members launched a 10 month intensive research and strived to complete the localized replacement of the core components. After this round of research, Xiao Liquan led the Tianhe team to greatly improve the performance of the Tianhe-2 high-speed interconnection communication system, making it run twice as fast as the international commercial interconnection system at the time, laying the foundation for the development of the next generation of Chinese supercomputers.For a long time, the leading countries have implemented strict technological blockades on China in the high technology field. It has been difficult to solve the software and hardware problems of China because the information system were controlled by the foreign high tech leaders. The chip is not but the IP and kernel are the core technology.Computing speed (commonly known as computing power) and power consumption are the core indicators of supercomputer chips. It is generally for the Chinese scientists and engineers in research and development to simply integrate more transistors in the chip if they want to achieve higher computing power, but that will increase the chip area and power consumption. The real difficulty in developing a supercomputer chip is to reduce the power consumption of the chip as much as possible while ensuring high computing power.Guo Yang, head of microelectronics of the Tianhe team and researcher at the School of Computer Science, China National University of Defense Technology, has persisted for more than 20 years and finally determined to take the technical route of heterogeneous fusion architecture based on autonomous instruction set. The development of a processor chip with an independent instruction set means that the R&D team must not only develop the chip, but also develop a complete set of software systems such as a supporting compiler and algorithm library to achieve technology leadership. He led the team to overcome a large number of the technical problems in chip design and development of the well-known FeiTeng (飞腾处理器) brand in China. The performance of the FeiTeng processor is more than 10 times higher than the previous generation CPU chips.In 2017, the system upgrade of Tianhe-2 was completed. At that time, more than 4000 FeiTeng chips with the best performance in China were installed in Tianhe-2. At present, the ""Tianhe"" series of supercomputers have fully mastered the five major independent core technologies: the four major chips with independent intellectual property rights and independent operating systems. At present, general-purpose CPU and accelerator CPU, interconnection communication routing chip and interconnection interface chip have been assembled in the ""Tianhe II"" Phase 2 system.The new domestically developed FeiTeng-1000 CPUs were mentioned on 28/10/2010.A variety of fighter jets and missiles embedded with Fei Teng chips were unveiled in celebrating the 70th anniversary of the founding of China at the military parade in 2019.In 2020, Beidou 3 satellite communications network in orbit, Chang'e 5, flying to the moon, and Tianwen No. 1, flying to Mars are all embedded with the Fei Teng CPUs.Tan Yusong, the head of domestic basic software direction of Tianhe team, researcher of School of Computer, China National University of Defense Technology, has led his team members since 2011 in the development of the Kylin operating system.The Kylin operating system has become the domestically produced operating system with the highest level of security and the most widely used in China, and has been successfully applied to various national defense equipment and key information systems. Recently, servers, desktops, all-in-ones, notebooks, and other products based on the ""Fei Teng"" chip and the Kylin operating system [ https://www.kylinos.cn/ ] have been applied on a large scale in many fields.The Tianhe No. 3 E-Class Prototype System has realized four major independent innovations: three chips: ""Matrix"" many-core processors (Matrix-2000+), interconnect interface chips, router chips; Computing, storage and service nodes, more than ten kinds of PCB circuit boards; new computing processing, high-speed interconnection, parallel storage, service processing, monitoring and diagnosis, infrastructure and other hardware subsystems; system operation, parallel development, application support and synthesis management and other software subsystems.In addition, Chengdu Shenwei develops its own instruction set, specially developed for high-performance computing. Shenwei SW26010 is the first computer chip in China that adopts domestically-developed architecture and has world-class performance.SW26010 adopts 260-core many-core architecture, out-of-order execution architecture, frequency 1.45GHz, the entire processor includes 4 MPE (Management Processing Element) management units, 4 CPE (Computing Processing Element) computing units and 4 MC memory controller units The CPE unit is composed of 64 cores in an 8x8 array, so the total is 260 cores (4x64 4=260). The theoretical floating point performance of SW26010 is as high as 3TFLOPS, SW26010 can directly access main memory. On June 20, 2016, the Sunway Taihu Light only costs 1.8 billion to build because of the use of independent Shenwei 260 many-core processors.The realization of domestically produced independent and controllable CPU is essential to support the development of the national information industry and ensure information security in China. On April 15, 2021, Loongson Zhongke Technology Co., Ltd., which has persisted in independent research and development for 20 years, officially launched LoongArch, an autonomous command system architecture of Loongson and achieved a historic breakthrough.It is not difficult to launch a command system, but the difficult part is the ecological construction. The experience accumulation of the past 20 years has allowed the Chinese scientists and engineers to master 9 abilities. The three basic compilers, are GCC, LLVM, and GOLANG. To master the dominant power of the ecology, the key lies in the capabilities of the virtual machines: Java, JavaScript and .NET. As long as the Loongson autonomous command system supports the above three virtual machines, more than half of the existing application software can be run directly without migration. LoongArch has more than 300 basic instructions and nearly 200 instructions are added to complete the binary translation compatible with x86, ARM and MIPS.LoongArch has also abandoned a lot of the historical burden of MIPS, and added some new functions in combination with new application features to bring 10%-20% performance improvement. At present, the first LoongArch CPU 3A5000 processor chip that supports LoongArch has been successfully taped out. The 14nm LoongArch CPU has stronger performance than the ARM 7nm CPU and is close to the ...","1,859 followers",Donald Canton,649,1.4K,7.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-Windows-and-Linux

We know that one day you will stare at us. For this we are prepared to use the world as a battlefield.China is the largest trading country in most countries in the world. But we still think that we can only rely on ourselves at the critical moment.China is the world's largest industrial manufacturing country. But we still think that the military industry may suffer a huge blow in the crazy first round of attacks from the United States. For this, we have established a large number of spare factories in the mountainous areas.We clearly understand that the sudden outbreak of modern warfare does not have enough time for us to mobilize for war. For this we prepare our own underground Great Wall and all-weather combat readiness system.We know that our navy is so fragile, so we are actively developing land-based anti-ship missiles in order to block your entry in the Western Pacific.We firmly believe that we will no longer be as lucky as the Korean War, and the Soviet Union has disappeared. You will definitely use tactical nuclear weapons to destroy the PLA without hesitation. So we have prepared nuclear weapons that are also miniaturized.We firmly believe that no war is not terrifying, and all foreigners may be agents. Similarly, all Asian Americans may be terrorists with nuclear bombs. As the weaker side in the brutal war, we rely on 1.4 billion people for war, people's war!We firmly believe that you will use full-scale nuclear warfare as an option. Similarly, we must ensure Dongfeng 41 missiles can break through your local anti-missile system and strike all your cities with more than 100,000 people.We are still developing submarine-launched ballistic missiles. JL-2 cannot hit the United States from the South China Sea. We need JL-3. H-6 performance is insufficient, we need H-20. We are still living under your shadow.In the Second World War, the Chinese persevered under the Japanese invasion for 14 years, and finally won the victory. We sacrificed 11.4 million soldiers. 24 million civilians were killed. In high-intensity modern wars, we believe that full-scale wars will continue for at least one year, with casualties likely to reach 500 million people within a year. Therefore, we must establish a corps structure that can fight independently, and all combat units are their own commanders.The form of war is rapidly changing, economic warfare, psychological warfare, and cyber warfare. We are still the weak side, and we have enough reasons to fear. This fear dominates us all the time.A dictatorship that can kill 100,000 Americans but feel nothing happens will never care about the lives of the people of the two countries. The low human rights advantage of the United States makes us tremble. The corruption and madness of the US military let us know that we are facing an irrational opponent. The risk of war far exceeds the fool’s imagination.I can't help but ask:When that day really comes, are we ready?………………………………………………………………This is the reason for fear, and people can't tell right from wrong. Democracy is not about letting people die in pursuit of profit. The understanding of democracy by Westerners has already been distorted. I don’t know when the concept of democracy became the private property of Westerners.“Most American people when they travel abroad seem to make no attempt to get to know the locals, instead they travel in their own isolated groups. Is this an indication of the American preference for isolation from the rest of the world? Being scared of the China makes no sense to me, but indicates paranoia due to a lack of consciousness of how the world and democracy works.”This gave rise to another kind of thinking. All the accusations were not because we did something wrong, but because of deep hatred towards us. The Chinese should work hard as your slaves, not travel and shop around the world. Even if the accusations of democracy are stopped, there will be accusations of human rights. You just need a reason to point your fingers.……………………………………………………………….As you can see, it is human rights accusation. It may be late, but it will never be absent.Believing in fake news or pretending to believe is your right, but I really believe that white immigrants in the United States carried out a genocide plan against Indians.In the name of equality for all, trade in slaves.In the name of anti-terrorism, bomb Afghan weddings.In the name of democracy and freedom, seize the wealth of Iraqis.In the name of the free market, let children die from hunger.America has only one name in God's eyes: Judas.……………………………………………………What scares us most is that you actually want to hate us in the name of democracy and human rights.If we fail, their rule will be even more brutal. The definition of democracy and human rights will be further narrowed. Just as the Soviet Union failed, the Western system became the only meaning of democracy. The United States became the liberator of Auschwitz. The world's largest racist country has become a model of human rights.Are we qualified to be treated as normal and equal human beings, not as demons?We can’t breathe.Like many people, I once thought it was a misunderstanding. It's time to abandon the fantasy. In fact, there is more hatred than misunderstanding.Do so many economic and trade links deepen misunderstandings? Why do the western world misunderstand us more and more?Conflicts of interest and racial superiority cannot be resolved by peaceful protests.Abandon fantasy and prepare for struggle.………………………………………………………………………….I think before blaming China you should shoot the intelligence officials who let China steal classified information again and again. Lest they treason again. If the FBI and the CIA are all shot to death, someone will be innocent, but if only half of them are shot, there must be an omission.Remember, before credibly accusing China, please kill an intelligence officer first.If we fail, the story you tell will become history.Let me tell you something you don't know.In October 1931, US President Hoover gave a public speech in support of Japan's invasion of the three northeastern provinces of China.In 1936, the Japanese Army proposed a hugely costly ""six-year combat preparation plan"" (1937-1942) to deal with future wars against the Soviet Union and China. The United States believed that the plan was aimed at the Soviet Union, so it used various methods such as granting Japanese loans, exporting technology, and supplying strategic materials to provide support for the Japanese Army's expansion and preparation for war. Among them, the American Ford Company provides Japan's modern metallurgical technology, the Rockefeller Consortium helps Japan establish a new electrical industry, and the Mellon Consortium helps Japan's aircraft manufacturing industry to further modernize. In fact, because the large-scale Soviet-Japanese war imagined by the Americans did not break out, the material and financial assistance provided by the United States to Japan eventually turned into guns and ammunition that killed Chinese soldiers and civilians.According to US government statistics, 54.4% of the strategic materials imported by Japan in 1937 came from the US. 92.9% of copper, 91.2% of automobiles and 60.5% of oil, 59.7% of scrap steel, 48.5% of various machinery and engines, and 41.6% of cast iron are imported from the United States.The famous writer and educator Tao Xingzhi delivered a speech when he was leaving the United States: ""I will return to China to participate in the war of resistance. If one day I was killed by a Japanese bomb, please don't forget that 54.4% of my body was bombed by your Americans!”Stimson, who has stepped down as the US Secretary of State, wrote in the ""New York Times"" that the US government only needs to prohibit the United States from supplying materials to Japan, and the Chinese can easily defeat Japanese aggression. 31 U.S. congressmen jointly pointed out: ""We say that Japan has two allies, Germany and Italy. In fact, we are Japan's best allies. Anyone will undoubtedly believe that we are actively participating in Japan's war in China. ""On May 4, 1938, at a rally of five thousand people in Los Angeles, US Congressman Scott said: ""Please note that when Japan is currently killing 1 million people in China, 544,000 was killed by American capital, as an accomplice.""Facing the pressure of public opinion, the US government had to make some official articles. On July 1, 1938, when China was about to enter the second year of the full-scale war of resistance, the US State Department notified the American Aircraft Corporation that the US government did not agree to sell aircraft and aircraft parts to countries that were carrying out indiscriminate bombing. This is the famous ""moral embargo"".What is surprising is that in 1938, when the ""moral embargo"" was implemented, the aircraft sold by the United States to Japan was worth 17.454 million U.S. dollars, which was 702.7% of the 1937 figure. The strangeness is self-evident. After collecting U.S. official data, U.S. economist Hu Dunyuan found that Japan’s acquisition of various strategic materials from the U.S. accounted for the proportion of its total imports from 54.4% in 1937 to 56% in 1938. This is the true attitude of the US government towards China's war of resistance.Chinese will never forget your friendship between The Americans and the Japanese. As you said, we give you the Korean War and the Vietnam War. Let us forget the lies about friendship. Let us remember the truth of history.The war entered into 1938. The huge consumption on the Chinese battlefield forced Japan to implement the ""first munitions mobilization in the China Incident,"" but the production and supplies of munitions still could not meet the needs of the Sino-Japanese war. The satisfaction rate of weapons is 70%, ammunition 60%, aircraft 66%, tanks 27%, light armored vehicles 43%, gas masks 97%, sanitary equipment 90%, veterinary equipment 87%, and marine equipment 80%. From April 1, 1938 to March 31, 1939, Japan was forced to implement the second military mobilization plan, which comprehensively reduced the supply of materials for all industries unrelated to military supplies, and required the citizens to implement “conservation, rationing, recycling” war. Ten major measures such as a simple life, stipulate that 32 kinds of materials such as steel, milled iron, gold, silver, copper, lead, etc., shall be subject to strengthened use restrictions. Even the coach rifles used in Japanese middle schools were taken back and used by the Japanese army. Under such circumstances, if the United States cuts off the supply of strategic materials to Japan, by the end of 1938, the full-scale war of aggression against China launched by Japan will not be able to continue due to exhaustion of resources.Japan suffered a huge defeat on the Chinese battlefield. Forcing Japan to turn to resource-rich Southeast Asia to support its material needs. Let me be straight, the US-Japan ""alliance"" relationship has been challenged. But the United States chose to earn the last coin.According to statistics, in 1939, military supplies exported from the United States to Japan amounted to US$186.9 million, accounting for approximately 86% of the total US exports to Japan that year. Among them, the U.S. exports of scrap iron and steel to Japan that year were 9 times more than in 1938. In 1940, US military supplies exported to Japan amounted to 190 million U.S. dollars, accounting for approximately 84% of all US exports to Japan. From 1937 to 1940, the total value of materials exported from the United States to Japan was US$986.7 million, of which military materials accounted for US$703.9 million.What irony, as potential allies, China and the United States import and export commodities mainly for civilian use. As potential hostile countries, the imports and exports of the United States and Japan are mainly military materials.On September 23, 1940, the Japanese troops stationed in northern French Indochina, their strategic intention to abandon the northward attack on the Soviet Union and turn to resource-rich Southeast Asia was already very obvious. When its own interests were seriously threatened, President Roosevelt ordered on September 26 that year to control the delivery of scrap steel to Japan, but did not mention the issue of oil supply. At this time, the United States still had the illusion that Japan changed its course and went north to attack the Soviet Union. Therefore, it has always ""opened the net"" on the oil issue that is vital to Japan.Japanese aircraft rely heavily on petroleum products supplied by the United States.In order to conceal the fact of supplying oil to Japan from the public so that the U.S. government is less criticized by public opinion, the U.S. Department of Commerce, in accordance with the requirements of the State Department, replaced ""aircraft fuel"" with the term ""high-quality fuel for engines"" in trade documents. In the first quarter of 1941, the US aviation gasoline sold to Japan was 131% higher than in the same period in 1940.Until July 22, 1941, when Japanese troops began to occupy the southern part of French Indochina, the United States announced on July 25 that it would freeze all Japanese assets in the United States and imposed a comprehensive embargo on oil and scrap steel. But it was too late. Because in the first seven months of 1941, the pig iron, steel plate, and scrap metal exports from the United States to Japan increased by more than three times in currency terms compared to 1940.Therefore, when the Japanese combined fleet attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, most of the aviation fuel that supported Japanese aircraft flying over Pearl Harbor was provided by the United States. Most of the materials needed to build airplanes and bombs also come from the United States. The United States called this day ""the darkest day"", and President Roosevelt called it ""National Humiliation Day."" But looking at what the United States has done since 1931, it can be said that this is the disgrace of the American policy of appeasement and the result of the greedy American capitalism. Blame it on its own, not worthy of sympathy.China bankrupted the Japan-U.S. strategic alliance through persistent resistance, making the United States compelled to join the anti-Japanese militarism camp in order to defend its strategic interests.The Second World War is not a funny story about American heroes saving the world. You didn't have this ability in the past. By now, you have lost even the ability to solve your own domestic problems. Of course, the United States will never lack super-powered office officials who claim to be able to sink the Chinese fleet in a short time, trade officials who promote the US's quick victory theory, and a president who cannot fulfill his campaign promises.By the way, the great achievements of the U.S. military. Never in human history has an army achieved so many achievements:Harassing pedestrians in South Korea.Caused a major accident in Italy.Gang rape of women in Japan.Bombing children in Iraq.Burning grain fields in Syria.Agent Orange is used in Vietnam.Contest to kill civilians in Afghanistan.Armed police shot civilians wantonly in America.…Be proud.When the U.S. military is constrained by China, guess who is their next target for robbery?Maybe it's Iran, maybe it's Venezuela, maybe it's Belarus.But I think it is you Americans who are most likely to be robbed by the higher US military expenditures.Wish you guys good luck.",101 followers,Anthony Galli,813,300,5.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-U-S-move-a-devastating-blow-to-Chinas-supercomputing-sector

Having more engines does indeed increase the chance that one engine will fail, and if the failure of one engine has the result of damaging critical hardware nearby, that would be bad.That was the case, in fact, with the Soviet N1 rocket which had the unfortunate distinctions of having caused one of the largest non-nuclear explosion on Earth up to that time. But the N1 suffered from a number of handicaps that must be considered.First, the engines for the N1 were radically innovative, but designed and built in a hurry and on a relative shoe-string by a design bureau whose previous experience was limited to airplane engines. The American F1 on the other hand was modestly cutting edge maturation of the basic engine design used by the V2 rocket during the war and by Goddard before it. It was much bigger and better, but was not nearly as radical a leap, and it was started more than five years earlier and well funded.Second, the technology to adequately monitor and control the coordinated firing of so many engines simply did not yet exist. The Saturn had no more than five engines on any given stage, a much more manageable control problem in which even limited manual intervention was possible.Third, Soviet industry and engineering talent had been decimated by World War II and Stalin’s purges before it, and the repercussions from all that were far from mere history at the time the N1 was designed and constructed. At the same time, American industry and engineering talent had benefited immensely from the war, and multiple ways we Americans are far too eager to interpret as inherent superiority.So yeah…between the Saturn V and the N1, more engines definitely increased the odds of big rocket go BOOM! Which the N1 did time and time again.But at the very same time NASA was extolling the virtues of larger, fewer engines, combustion instability in the giant F1 was never fully understood or solved, and every Apollo launch prior to Apollo 14 experienced POGO oscillations potentially dangerous to the mission, and addressed by simply shutting the first and second center engines down early (and then earlier). Subsequent analysis suggests that at least as late as Apollo 13, the first stage center engine may have failed, and its only good fortune that prevented catastrophe.Also at the very same time, the FAA was requiring four engines on long distance trans-oceanic airliners, specifically for redundancy.A 707 or 747 can fly on two engines. Not well, but well enough to reach an airport. Of course, having four engines increases the odds that one of them will fail, and airliners have crashed in the past because of damage caused by the disintegration of or fire caused by a failed engine.That’s why since the late 1950s, most airplane have hung their engines in pods below the wings. This is inefficient, but it eases maintenance and increases isolation in the event of a failure. Over the years, manufacturers have also found ever more effective ways to shield engines with lightweight armor and enable them to fail gracefully instead of catastrophically in the even of damage in object ingestion.So now, half a century later, Space-X is building a Saturn class launch vehicle around a platform loaded with comparatively small, comparatively radical rocket engines, and you are more than justified to wonder, “is that safe?”Well, lets consider a few differences between then and now.Put all this together and yes, not only do I think its safe to put engines on a Super Heavy booster, I think it provides redundancy and a number of efficiency and other advantages.","35,159 followers",C Stuart Hardwick,1.1K,12.3K,143M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-Windows-and-Linux
