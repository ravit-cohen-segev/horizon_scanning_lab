0,"Absolutely. Having the latest in technology, training gear and facilities is one of the biggest advantages to not only getting your current players in the best position to win, but also in recruiting the top high school players to your team. Winning and facilities are the two biggest advantages to recruiting. Teams without either of those have a tough time getting great players and, likewise have a tough time winning.","68,794 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Do-college-football-programs-equipped-with-advanced-technology-training-facilities-have-an-advantage-over-their-rivals-who-cannot-afford-similar-features

Certainly, the more successful teams have better equipment, and the better equipment is far more common with more successful teams.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Do-college-football-programs-equipped-with-advanced-technology-training-facilities-have-an-advantage-over-their-rivals-who-cannot-afford-similar-features
2,"No, it is not. Throughout the 1800s and into the early 1900s, this was the goal of Western modernist philosophy and science. It all fell apart in the 1920s.The mindset that gave rise to this view was well illustrated by the goal of the Encyclopedia Brittanica corporation to publish a 1911 edition that would be a complete compendium of all human knowledge - with nothing more to be learned. We see it also in the assertion in 1899 by the head of the US Patent Office that everything useful to humanity has already been discovered and patented. That was four years before the Wright Brothers flew theNo, it is not. Throughout the 1800s and into the early 1900s, this was the goal of Western modernist philosophy and science.

We see it also in the assertion in 1899 by the head of the US Patent Office that everything useful to humanity has already been discovered and patented. That was four years before the Wright Brothers flew the first aeroplane.The idea that physics could predict the future was somewhat challenged by the replacement of the long-standing “laws” Newton developed for motion and gravity with Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity in 1906. Things really came crashing down in the 1920s with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and Goedel’s Incompleteness Theorem.The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle showed that even if physical laws were absolute and precise, we could never get the data to input into the equations. We would need to know the precise location and velocity of every particle in the universe at the same time. Einstein showed that “the same time” was a meaningless concept. Heisenberg showed that the act of measuring location changed velocity, and the act of measuring velocity left location vague. Thus the data could never be gathered to generate the prediction.Goedel’s incompleteness theorem showed that if a logical model of the universe (or even basic mathematics) could ever be made complete, it would be possible, in that system, to prove every statement both true and false. Logic itself would collapse. Turing demonstrated that this would be true of any computational method using logic parallel to Goedel’s.So, before 1950, we knew that the modernist goal of predicting the future through physics was impossible. And things only got worse from there.Information science applied to biology has shown us that life generates divergent, unpredictable sequences. They show up particularly in chaos theory. Intelligence and consciousness do what life does, only moreso.Much of 20th century history is consumed with the effort to master nature in such a way as to solve all human problems. Many diverse minds have shown the disastrous futility of these attempts. In 1905, Thomas Alva Edison warned that our ability to master the material world was taking us out of control without equal governance of our moral nature. Jules Verne’s later novels turned dark with the same warning. World War I was based on the idea that seeing how evil war was would make World War I “the war to end all wars.” All hope of predicting the future was gone, and all hope that such a “conquest of nature” to use the Modernist rallying cry would be a good thing died with World War II. InMeanwhile, psychologist and holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl and Albert Einstien proposed that it is exactly our freedom and the indefinable qualities of the human heart that guide us to the humane life and future we so desperately need.",402 followers,Thomas Pilgaard,8.1K,116,1.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Do-college-football-programs-equipped-with-advanced-technology-training-facilities-have-an-advantage-over-their-rivals-who-cannot-afford-similar-features

You can see the people next to you move away from you, but they aren't walking or moving at all. They are standing still. It is the road itself that is expanding.Let's call you person 0. Next to you is person 1, and on your other side is person -1. Behind them, persons 2 and -2. Like a number scale:Now, ask yourself: As person 1 seemed to move away from you (person 0) because of the space between you expanding, did person 1 approach person 2?Now, ask yourself: As person 1 seemed to move away from you (person 0) because of the space between you expanding, did person 1 approach person 2?No. Persons 1 and 2 experienced the same expansion of the space between them, as you (person 0) and person 1. - The same goes on your other side. In fact, everyone on the entire road experienced the same thing. Everyone is now 2 meters (~6 feet) apart without ever having moved an inch.So, person 1 is 2 meters from you. The distance between you has increased by 1 meter. - But look at person 10! Person 10 used to be 10 meters from you, but is now 20 meters from you. That's an increase of 10 meters! The farther away a person is, the more they move away from you within the same time period. Put another way: The farther away a person is, the faster that personNow imagine a car travelling on this road (don't worry, it's not going to hit anyone). - As the car sets out on its journey, we know how far away the destination is. As the car arrives, we notice that the journey has been much longer! - Why?Because the road has been expanding while the car has been in transit.More importantly, some cars are so far away from us, that even at max speed, they won't be able to ever reach us. The space between them and us is becoming greater, faster than the car can travel at max speed.More importantly, some cars are so far away from us, that even at max speed, they won't be able to ever reach us. The space between them and us is becoming greater, faster than the car can travel at max speed.IF we could observe the car (we cannot), it would in fact appear to be moving away from us, despite clearly moving toward us. More road appears between us, than it can travel, thus increasing the distance between us.Back to your question:Thus, the 46 billion light years figure is theNothing can travel faster than the speed of light.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Can-we-change-the-physics-laws-in-the-future-in-billions-of-billions-years-from-now-with-the-advanced-technology

It is the limit of our vision/detection.Secondly - we know that space itself is expanding.Thirdly - the speed of light is the cosmic speed limit.Putting this together - the further away something is - the faster it’s moving away from us…and we have an equation (“Hubble’s Law”) that describes this behavior.If you ask:That means that no matter which way you look - any object that’s more than 46.5 billion lightyears away is moving away so rapidly that any light that it emits will never reach us because space is stretching faster than light itself can move…it will be completely impossible to see - or even detect.HENCE: The radius of the part of the universe that’s going slow enough for us to see is 46.5 billion lightyears…and the diameter is 93 billion lightyears.And THAT is where this number of yours came from.,"246,852 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Can-we-change-the-physics-laws-in-the-future-in-billions-of-billions-years-from-now-with-the-advanced-technology
