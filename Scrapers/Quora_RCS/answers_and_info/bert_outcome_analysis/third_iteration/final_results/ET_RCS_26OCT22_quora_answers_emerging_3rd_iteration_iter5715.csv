The repercussions for democracy are such that individual participation in governance will skyrocket. There will be an increasing demand for transparency and accountability as more and more people have direct access to the political process which will increase demand for input into the decision-making infrastructure and will increasingly be utilized as a tool for mobilizing citizen action into changes within governance.Beyond that, many technologies such as those involving alternative energy production, storage, and management will increasingly empower people by reducing dependence upon large, stale, and outmoded ""traditional energy suppliers"", which will reduce their power to manipulate political events, thereby granting a citizenry a greater proportion of influence into determining government priorities.Many existing technologies used in capturing / recording information are also not ""new"" or ""emerging"", but they are evolving in such ways that pressures on government transparency and accountability will increase. We are seeing now with respect to individuals capturing video of authorities behaving in egregious ways and making those videos available for widespread consumption to increase awareness and mobilize action. This trend will continue to grow and its effects will increasingly pressure governments to institute changes that will result in greater improvements in policies and practices which reflect a broader representation of the citizenry.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,2.6K,5.6K,427.2M,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-emerging-technologies-have-the-greatest-potential-to-strengthen-democracy-and-improve-governance
1,"One I like is OpenGov,Internet voting, if we can figure out the details, could be terrific, because it could raise the % of people who vote.  Lots of dangers, though, including fraud and bias against people who have less access to tech or are less tech savvy.TOR, for all the semi- or non- democratic countries where people are trying to get access to information.","23,887 followers",Robin Daverman,540,2.3K,40.1M,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-emerging-technologies-have-the-greatest-potential-to-strengthen-democracy-and-improve-governance
2,"Remove elections.Are you freaking insane?No, I’m not. We desperately need to abolish elections before they kill democracy.But a democracy without elections is a dictatorship!No. A dictator is an unelected ruler for life with no oversight or whatsoever.I don’t understand. What are you exactly proposing here?I propose to come back to the oldest form of democracy:Who… what the hell…? That’s bonkers!And do you think that our current universal suffrage system is not bonkers?

What are you exactly proposing here?I propose to come back to the oldest form of democracy:Who… what the hell…? That’s bonkers!And do you think that our current universal suffrage system is not bonkers? This only seems normal to us because we have been born inside this system, but this is anything but “normal”.Listen here: Some of the longest-lived, most successful democracies such as the Venetian Republic or the Ancient Greek republics were not elective systems, but they were chosen by a draw system.And lo and behold, it worked great, unsurprisingly.A lottery system removes the need for politicians, political parties, and a freaking specialized ruling caste altogether, not to mention the abolition of a stupid popularity contest that gives us not the best people qualified for the job, but rather the most un-representative people that better manipulates the masses.What we currently have is a mediacracy. Those who control the masses' fickle attention spans are those who control the result. We could call our current system “rule by Facebook” or “rule by donors” if you wish. If you think that your opinion is “yours”, think again. If you think that your vote matters anything to your rulers and acts as a meaningful check and balance against their abuse, think again. And if you think that this “democracy” turning into an oligarchy is a bug instead of a feature of a system, think again. It is just doing what it was always meant to do.But… but how could such a lottery system work?First of all, the other components of democracy would still be in place. That is, the most important parts of democracy, not our beloved elections: The constitution, the rule of law, separation of powers, checks and balances, public servants, civil rights… all of that will still be in place. You know, the actually vital parts of democracy, which are not politicians and elections.The only change would be the lottery system.There are several lottery systems impossible to hack. Members of the parliament would be randomly picked up among the entire census. As long as you’re a legal citizen of age with no violent criminal record, you have a chance of being picked for parliament. A lifetime state-funded pension would ensure the loyalty of those citizens chosen to occupy their temporal parliament posts, provided they attend their duties (think of them as some kind of popular jurors).How would laws get made and approved?By members of this randomly chosen parliament, of course. Propose a law to deal with a problem, get enough support to pass it, and there you go.What about technical posts? What about people who don’t know about laws?That’s what state servants are for. They currently advise our politicians, which are every bit as ignorant regarding laws and technicities as any other citizen.And who gets to become a minister? Who decides this?The randomly chosen parliament will pick those amongst themselves who volunteer to administer any particular government area.Rest assured, any of these could be removed by either the lottery appointed parliament or the justice courts, should they overstep their boundaries or do a bad job.But who’s the boss? Who is in charge?Where we going we are not gonna need any of that.",UNKNOWN,Ernest W.

All of the developed nations are democracies. On the other hand dictatorships show a lot of promise for a while before collapsing big.The thing that is holding India’s growth is not democracy, but socialism and protectionism. China’s Deng and his successors boldly embraced capitalism, but Indian leaders have to hide it tight in their closet. When we had more socialism we grew very little. And we had less socialism we grew a lot. That is the lesson we learn from the history of India, China and other countries around the world.Another key factor that is holding back India is that government doesn’t reach deep. We don’t have enough good governments schools, hospitals and roads in India’s interiors. Not because we are a democracy. But, because we had governments [especially at the state levels] that were horrible.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-emerging-technologies-have-the-greatest-potential-to-strengthen-democracy-and-improve-governance

Their usual complaints are “immigrants” or perhaps “national soverignty”, but their real concern is the rule of law and European anti-corruption and money laundering laws a member state is supposed to have. If these people were actual sceptics they would present their concerns, demonstrate their concerns are valid (they usually fail at this point so they don’t bother) and work with the EU to improve the union in this regard.What they usually do instead is claim their claims are obviously valid, provide no evidence they’re correct and agitate for a looser union as a solution to the problem, especially when a certain problem has no relation to the EU at all.As such Euroseptics can do lots of things, but strengthening democracy in the EU is not one of them.","246,856 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-emerging-technologies-have-the-greatest-potential-to-strengthen-democracy-and-improve-governance

It's still a car and does car things.I don't see self-driving cars being important enough in 10 years to have changed our lives much.I think there are two potential areas that relatively new technology will change our lives.One we may be having more and more remote working situations. This very well could change how we live. Right now if you want an engineering job, publishing job or big law job you have to live in an expensive urban area. If you could cut that down to having to go to your office once a week I see two different things happening at once. People can start living farther away which might reduce the cost of living in the heart of a city but it will increase the cost of living farther away and cause smaller areas to have to provide more services to people staying home.The other change I see is automation of low-level low experience jobs. For example right now self-checkouts and online ordering is cutting into the number of cashiers that are being employed. Other than answering questions, much of what happens in a store for example can be automated. The first thing is this eliminates one path for teens to start into the workforce. This automation likely makes it harder for the small business to complete in some ways.","2,115 followers",Pavithran Subbiah,698,110,3.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-emerging-technologies-have-the-greatest-potential-to-strengthen-democracy-and-improve-governance
