You might still feel a bit crappy while they’re working, but they’ll prevent you from getting seriously ill.In other words, we’re probably heading towards a world where “Jim can’t come into work today, because he has coronavirus” is the kind of thing you’ll hear, just as you might hear “Sue can’t come into work today, because she has the flu” right now.

6,"A cure per se, might never happen. In general viruses are almost impossible to cure. What we can have is a vaccine that is made from dead virus, parts of the virus, a look-alike for the virus, or a seriously weakened virus. What these do is to “teach” the body’s immune system what the virus looks like so the body’s own defenses can attack it immediately.

But, despite the popular perception, a vaccine is not intended to confer individual immunity. When enough people have contracted the virus and recovered plus the number that have received the vaccine, “herd immunity” is conferred. With herd immunity enough people are close enough to immune that the transmission of the virus from person to person is interfered with and the disease dies out.Yes, it takes about 18 months to get a vaccine that can be available to the general public. It is possible that a few priority individuals —- health care workers, high-risk individuals, etc —- can have access after a year.A candidate vaccine must be tested against cell cultures in a petri dish (in vitro testing.) This is to make sure that it actually teaches the cells to react to the virus. If that is successful, the vaccine is tested on anomals —- mice to primates especially —- to see if it works to prevent the virus and does not harm the recipient. 80% of candidate vaccines fail by this point. If animal testing looks good, it is then tried on a small group (<100) of volunteers to see if it works in humans and is safe, but also to determine the best dosages. If that is successful, then it is tried on a larger group (>400) to see if the small test holds true. This test is double-blind (meaning that neither the patient nor the physician knows if the person is receiving the vaccine or a harmless placebo), placebo-controlled, very detailed (and expensive) study to insure effectiveness and safety and to try a limited number of different dosages to see which is the best. Sometimes another trial follows when the vaccine, again double-blind, placebo controlled, to try combinations of drugs, such as the vaccine plus an anti-viral. Only then is the vaccine ready to be “cooked” in large vats to grow enough vaccine for the general population. Small batches may be cooked to produce small amounts of the vaccines for health care workers and high-risk groups, but not always. The cooking takes several months and requires careful attention and is extremely susceptible to contamination. If contamination occurs the whole batch is dumped and started again. Once cooked the vaccine is ready to be packaged and distributed into public health organizations throughout the world. This sounds like the easy part, but getting the vaccine to 29 % - 79% of the world’s population to achieve herd immunity is a major logistic task that is both expensive and time consuming. Remember that much of the world spends less than $1 per citizen per year on public health, including all vaccines.Yep, it will take 18 months and even then the virus will hang around and cause trouble for the next 36 months.",716 followers,Molly Dooker,699,188,1.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Even-after-having-such-advanced-technologies-why-is-the-cure-of-corona-virus-still-not-found
7,"Portugal and Singapore, with vaccination rates at 83% and 85% both still haven’t reached herd immunity. Singapore just had their highest single day rise in cases, and now authorities are saying herd immunity is a mirage so we have to lower our expectations. Norwegian officials recently dropped all restrictions on the public because they say covid is going to be endemic like the flu and people will just have to learn to live with it. Also there was news today that the antibodies from the vaccine only last for about six months.

It’s not a new quest. Nearly everyone in the medical field is working to prolong life and allow us all to be closer and available for our loved ones.Cancer, to put it plainly, is a label for “failure to keep consistent DNA”.Our DNA and protein structures replicate at an alarming rate. Faster than most of us would imagine. It’s mentioned that some parts of the human body replace themselves every few years. New skin cells, new hairs, muscles, and livers healing from alcohol (hehe). Billions of cells are replicated to heal damaged tissue. Billions of cells replicate to grow us into adulthood and beyond.When replication occurs, there is aACGTACGT becomes ACGTIn most cases, this is fine. A skin cell with an error in it will be created, it will live, it will duplicate, and then the skin cell will die. A human cell has 3.4 billion nucleotides, where only 2% are critical for protein expression. This allows small benign errors to not have an impact.However, some specific genes in that 2% are critical for cell growth and cell death. When the instructions for “grow every 5 days; die after 5 days” becomes “grow every 5 days; die after 15 days”, we call that “With more cells growing than they are dying, there is a greater and greater need for resources; cancer ends up stealing vital nutrients from other critical organs.So…It is not that science is holding back, but moreover science is still trying to understand it. It’s important to know how it works, how to control it, and how to make sure we don’t cause additional imbalance.When technology is created without rigorous testing, it’s working on assumptions. And assumptions can possibly hurt a loved one rather than help them. Worse, it may actually kill them.Today, at the cutting edge of cancer research, research is dealing with the billions of permutations that might occur. Some cancers are “grow every 2 seconds; die never”. Some are “grow every 5 days; die never”. Some are “grow 16 times every 1 second; die after 5 days”. Each one requires a different approach, therapy, or method of management.Today, science has already given us a few methods:Science is working on more methods:This poor mouse is helping humanity! Cow cartilage cells were implanted into the mouse and grown so we can better understand how we might grow and regenerate organs for humans. (It looks sad, but science is not blind. There are monuments that pay homage to these heroes. Like this one: (Altering the “force of nature” is what scientists all around the world are working to control. Unfortunately, Mother Nature is very mean when we don’t play by her rules. This is a great meme that’s been floating around:“Nature wants 5 of your 7 children dead. It wants you dead by 50. Everything better than that is brought to you by science and technology”At my lab, we are developing greater detection tools to identify mutations that cause cancer. We’re working on new methods to detect cancer in tissue, in blood, inFulgent Genetics - Leader in Next Generation SequencingIt’s a massive undertaking to combat the forces of nature. It takes time. It takes sacrifice. It takes generations of scientists to take the universe we are given and push it to allow just a few more years with our loved ones.I understand the anger, the worry, the wish to point fingers at science, at companies, at faceless entities for not preventing our losses.In June 2018 cancer has taken yet another one of my friends. Kind hearted. Friendly. Always willing to help. He went out of his way to get to know you, to understand your needs, to be impactful with the people he knew.I wish science already had the answers. That technology already existed. That nature wouldn’t take wonderful people away. This is my friendIt’s moments like these that reinforce why I work in science. Why We make technology.
