After all, crypto's value goes up when demand outpaces supply.Therefore, investing in cryptocurrencies is greatly affected by things other investors do. And so far in 2022, we're learning that reckless speculation has driven an outsized portion of gains.Technology company MicroStrategy is the biggest culprit, having borrowed $2.4 billion to buy Bitcoin. But MicroStrategy's actions were out in the open and a known factor. Moreover, MicroStrategy seems well enough capitalized to satisfy its loan terms for now. By contrast, leverage among retail and institutional investors was less known and apparently more dangerous. Lenders such as Celsius Network have recently been forced to freeze assets as liquidity evaporates. And crypto hedge funds like Three Arrows Capital have failed due to making highly leveraged bets that went wrong. These developments prove there was too much irresponsible leverage in use.This is a problem for responsible, long-term cryptocurrency investors. The reckless actions of other investors have started a chain reaction of liquidation it turns out the entire sector is greatly interconnected. And the market capitalization of Bitcoin and others is steadily declining as money consequently flows out. Therefore, it appears that for many, there wasn't real demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the first place. Many investors weren't adopting these solutions but rather speculating on the price. This clearly is not a safe place to invest.To summarize, investing in cryptocurrency isn't necessarily safe. Plenty of things could go wrong to decrease the value of the token you buy. Investors of all experience levels need to recognize this. However, this doesn't mean that investors should avoid cryptocurrency entirely.",0 followers,Brittany Crawford,969,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-cryptocurrency-to-invest-in-from-now-to-the-end-of-2020
4,"Cryptocurrencies may be more secure than other types of currency, and riskier in others. Before buying or selling crypto, you’ll want to be aware of potential scams and other pitfalls to look out for.Is cryptocurrency safe? It’s a legitimate question, given the recent spike in cryptocurrency trading and governments’ struggles to keep up with consistent regulation. Cryptocurrency’s security—or lack thereof—will likely continue to be a more pressing issue in the years ahead, as a recent report from Allied Market Research projects the global crypto market to more than triple by 2030.The answer toCryptocurrencies may be more secure than other types of currency, and riskier in others. Before buying or selling crypto, you’ll want to be aware of potential scams and other pitfalls to look out for.Is cryptocurrency safe? It’s a legitimate question, given the recent spike in cryptocurrency trading and governments’ struggles to keep up with consistent regulation. Cryptocurrency’s security—or lack thereof—will likely continue to be a more pressing issue in the years ahead, as a recent report from Allied Market Research projects the global crypto market to more than triple by 2030.The answer to how safe crypto actually is, at least for now, is complicated. Yes, cryptocurrency does come with some security risks that you should know about before making your first trade. Firstly, crypto is still an extremely volatile asset class, prone to roller-coaster fluctuations in price. Secondly, this relatively new—and relatively unregulated—financial ecosystem comes with its share of scammers looking to prey on unsuspecting newcomers.But crypto has some securityIs cryptocurrency safe—and how can you safely invest?When someone asks if buying and selling cryptocurrency is safe, they may be asking one of two questions:Since these are fundamentally different questions, we’ll address each of them individually.Is cryptocurrency a safe investment?Compared to other asset classes such as stocks and government bonds, investing in cryptocurrency can be considered very risky.While cryptocurrencies are generally seen as legal across Europe, many aspects of cryptocurrency remain unregulated—or may be subject to shifting regulations. Fluctuating regulations are part of what can make crypto markets more vulnerable to instability—as we saw in the summer of 2021, when China’s crackdown on crypto related activities coincided with a drop in Bitcoin’s price. With so many world governments weighing how to react to crypto’s rise, there are a lot of factors that may contribute to crypto’s volatility moving forward.Another part of crypto’s general volatility comes from the fact that it’s still relatively new, and investors may not know exactly what to make of it yet. Because crypto doesn’t have the same historical proof points of other asset classes, like stocks, it may be more prone to huge price swings that come with shifting investor sentiment. Some cryptocurrencies are more prone to this than others, but even Bitcoin, the oldest and biggest crypto by market cap, is known for alarming price swings.If you invest in cryptocurrency, you can mitigate the risk by not buying more than you can afford to lose. There is still a non-zero chance of any crypto asset plummeting in value on a given day, so exercise caution and consider a diversified portfolio of investments with crypto playing a smaller and more speculative part.Are there security risks associated with cryptocurrency?Yes, there are some security risks you should be aware of. We’ll break them down here.These are just a few of the security risks associated with cryptocurrency, but there are others that continue to crop up as the crypto ecosystem evolves. The U.S federal trade commission updates its information on crypto scams and security as they develop, so it may be worth checking every so often.What’s the most secure way to buy cryptocurrency?With the rise of crypto has come a similar rise in the number of online exchanges and marketplaces where users can buy and sell crypto. As a general rule, the safer online platforms tend to ask you to prove your identity, as they follow Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti Money Laundering (AML) guidelines.Many popular crypto exchanges, such as Coinbase, require customers to verify information about themselves before they gain access to certain trading features. If you’re just starting out in the crypto world, it’s generally a good idea to go with an exchange or marketplace that takes security seriously and implements these types of steps to verify your identity.Generally speaking, the most secure way to store cryptocurrency is to keep it offline and away from those who might be able to use an internet connection to get their hands on it. You can keep your crypto offline if you use a hardware wallet—also referred to as a “cold wallet” or “cold storage.” Digital wallets (i.e. “hot wallets”), which can be online or on your desktop, may be more vulnerable to theft from hackers.There are various types of crypto wallets to choose from, including hardware wallets offered by well-known names such as Ledger and Trezor. The downside of hardware wallets is that they can be pretty expensive, and you’ll need a recovery seed to regain access to your crypto if you lose or misplace your wallet. Still, they probably represent the safest option at this point.What is the most secure cryptocurrency?To put it simply—there isn’t a “most secure” cryptocurrency. This doesn’t mean some cryptocurrencies aren’t likely more secure than others. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are said to have some inherent security features thanks to their use of decentralized blockchain technology, and the wider adoption of these cryptocurrencies (relative to other so-called “altcoins”) may make them less prone to massive price swings.It’s worth noting here that security is part of the appeal of decentralized blockchain technology. Bitcoin itself was created in order to give buyers and sellers more security in their transactions and avoid the need for a trusted third party.It’s best to get a good understanding of cryptocurrency before you buy, Cryptos are a relatively new phenomenon, so there’s plenty still to learn—including the ins and outs of crypto wallets, NFTs, and blockchain technology itself.",0 followers,Jessica Fowler,568,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-cryptocurrency-to-invest-in-from-now-to-the-end-of-2020

Opposing theories exist on how cryptocurrencies would behave in the event of a crash – after all, they emerged after the 2008 crash (and as a reaction to it). Some experts believe they will thrive.•Your money is yours aloneCryptocurrencies offer you a level of independence impossible with other means. When you keep your money in a bank, you are at the mercy of other people and organizations. At any moment, your access to the money that is rightfully yours can be limited or closed by the bank outside of governmental structures. The bank can be robbed or go bankrupt. In the long run, it can become the basis of a truly open and decentralized economy. By investing now, you can be at the forefront of it all.•High liquidityOne of the primary characteristics of any asset is its liquidity – that is, how easy it is to purchase or sell it at a price close to the market rate. By their very nature, cryptocurrencies have very high liquidity – you can quickly and easily buy and sell them, and the technological organization of trading platforms allows the use of a wide variety of tools and tactics, such as limit-orders (automated buying and selling at a specified price) and algorithm-based trading.•Getting into any kind of investment, be it stocks, bonds, or something else entirely, is traditionally complicated, bothersome, and time-consuming.

The data in this ledger cannot be changed retrospectively or be falsified, ensuring the network’s security. It also provides a characteristic feature of cryptocurrencies — the irreversibility of transactions.Entering only valid information into the database is achieved by consensus of all network participants. Consensus algorithms differ between cryptocurrency projects. Bitcoin (BTC) uses the most common variant — Proof-of-Work. The validation of transactions and adding information to the database is done using cryptography, which is why cryptocurrency got its name; the prefix “crypto” means the term “cryptography.” In this way, the most crucial property of cryptocurrencies is achieved — the protection of data and partial anonymity of users. It is partial because circumstantial data can most often establish the identity.Cryptocurrency issuance can be done in several ways and depends on the consensus mechanism. The most common option, characteristic of the Proof-of-Work algorithm, is automatic issuance as a reward to network members for adding new blocks. This process is known as mining. The amount of issuance in most crypto projects is programmatically limited and decreases over time, which maintains the value of the cryptocurrency.

12,"Cryptourrencies are currency (a medium traded for value) that is held ONLY digitally. Unlike a physical dollar bill, they live in networks that take account of transfers made to and from your account (your account is generally a “wallet” of some sort - something that is tied to your digital identifier and just scans the network’s code for transactions related to you, then adds or removes coins from your account accordingly).Transfers are made through bank network transactions, individual transactions, or transfer to physical asset (eg, goods or services). Most US dollars are actually held digiCryptourrencies are currency (a medium traded for value) that is held ONLY digitally. Unlike a physical dollar bill, they live in networks that take account of transfers made to and from your account (your account is generally a “wallet” of some sort - something that is tied to your digital identifier and just scans the network’s code for transactions related to you, then adds or removes coins from your account accordingly).Transfers are made through bank network transactions, individual transactions, or transfer to physical asset (eg, goods or services). Most US dollars are actually held digitally, but because they can be transferred to physical asset (dollars, which you get at an ATM, etc), they aren’t technically cryptocurrency - no fiat currency is.Cryptocurrency has a unique problem because it isn’t physical - the problem of the double spend. The same dollar can’t be in two places at once - once you spend it, it is gone. You can’t respend it, because you don’t possess it. But digital assets are different - it’s possible to spend the same money from the same account twice. So, if there is $50 in Joe’s account, Joe electronically transfers it to both his mom (because dude lives in her basement and she needs SOME rent), and his local cannabiceutical for some…uh…snacks (which is why he lives in mom’s basement). The money was promised to his mom first, so she should get it, but because the transaction didn’t update electronically or took time to clear or he acted nefariously, he ended up spending his money twice, and now the local dispensary is out $50 worth of brownies. It’s tantamount to theft, and is a serious hole in the utility of the product.This is why Satoshi Nakamoto (a person? Group? No one knows.) wrote a white paper in 2008 describing a system in which digital currency could only be transferred once. This is blockchain, the road system in which the cars (digital currency, or cryptocurrency) travel in transactions from one party to another. Blockchain as described in the paper, and later executed, is specifically designed to transfer currency or value-based tokens. It’s partly designed on the way banks transfer funds - a token-based system - but designed to be a bit faster and much cheaper. Because the current blockchain is designed specifically for financial transfer, it has some particular quirks. This is NOT the only type of blockchain that could be designed, nor the only type of distributed ledger (blockchain is a type of distributed ledger). It is just the type described because the problem Satoshi was concerned with solving involved money transfer.So cryptocurrency is really just money transferred on these blockchain roads to various parties. Bitcoin was the first crypto, and the blockchain was originally referred to as the bitcoin blockchain.Now, however, we have DApps (distributed applications). Ethereum is probably the biggest and best known, and has its own DApps, like Brave and Augur, etc. Each DApp is a platform, and the currency it uses is like “gas” that activates the platform and makes a transaction execute. Sometimes it does this well, and sometimes there are problems.So no crypto has any innate value - they are just triggers for transactions. Thy are all meant to be traded (originally, anyway) for a fiat currency offline. And they still are - they trade on marketplaces for their market-determined fiat value. However, they shouldn’t intrinsically gain value unless and until the underlying platform they work on gains value. If people are consisting lots of transactions on NXT or Lisk, then suddenly the value of NXT or LISK tokens goes up, because people need them to do what they need to do.Holding them as a value storage vehicle, however - which people seem to be doing - is purely speculative and a bit like creating a penny market because people believe the price of copper will increase. Even though the penny’s purchase power may vary, it is not based on the value of its construction - it is based on the value of its utility.There is much, much more to this topic - it could literally be a semester-long course.

Bitcoin which was the first coin in the market, setting up a system in which two people, the sender and the receiver of coins must sign off on payments to create a digital signature. Everyone has a public and a private encryption key, which makes this possible, every transaction is verified for accuracy, and the system is anonymous and totally transparent.Transactions are sent between peers using a software which is called cryptocurrency wallets. When a person creates a transaction he/she uses the wallet software to transfer balances from one account known as a public address to another address.Transactions made between peers are encrypted and then broadcasted to the cryptocurrency’s network and queued up to be added to the public ledger.",0 followers,Melissa Aldridge,501,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-consider-investing-in-cryptocurrencies-safe

A great opportunity to buy crypto does not nullify the usual risks of investing in the market. Cryptocurrency is highly volatile because it is affected by anything from the news to the hype of the general public.The native D2T token is used to power the entire Dash 2 Trade ecosystem. These tokens feature 0% tax and will be utilized by people for a multitude of purposes including running backtests on strategies and paying for access to the Dash 2 Trade platform. As such, demand for the token is likely to spike once the platform officially launches, meaning D2T could go parabolic well.The industry is also projected to become more stable with the development of infrastructure for the entry of institutional investors. For example, Black Rock seeks to establish a perpetual infrastructure strategy that will help drive the global energy transition. It hopes to do this by creating resilient, inflation-linked returns through lasting investments in core assets. This will create stability for crypto.","84,995 followers",Adam Fayed,5.7K,0,0,UNKNOWN,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-cryptocurrency-to-invest-in-from-now-to-the-end-of-2020

16,"There is no such thing as best or worse especially when you deal with crypto. However I would suggest some methods/ formula whenever you are entering this field and keep some points of caution in mind .This is going to be long, but if you are serious about it , be patient and read it all. I am trying to be exhaustive here because I want people to know each and every aspect and invest accordingly :)First let me get to the points of caution :-There is no such thing as best or worse especially when you deal with crypto. However I would suggest some methods/ formula whenever you are entering this field and keep some points of caution in mind .This is going to be long, but if you are serious about it , be patient and read it all. I am trying to be exhaustive here because I want people to know each and every aspect and invest accordingly :)First let me get to the points of caution :-Let’s get to the formula/methods part :-Bitdroplet offers SIP in bitcoins. Here is the return potential2. Now when you start with the crypto world, naturally bitcoin , etherium and ripple comes into your mind at first glance. My suggestion - yes you can go for it , but these might not be the best of the crypto’a right now.Some example-look at last 15 days performance of matic/polygon(anyone with basic maths will understand the profit%)What do you see here :-Start of may , matic started with ~60rs. As I attach this screenshot( May 18)- it’s price is ~200.profit % = (final amount-initial amount)/initial amount= 140/60 = 233% in 18 days (now never extrapolate it to 12 months - bad way of calculating)What is the moral/learnings here -a) Look out for crypto’s which have a higher profit % (eg a 2rs to 4rs value is 100% increase) , and not where everyone is investing (for eg in bitcoin 40L to 40.4L is 10% increase). People just look at difference in amount (eg 4L increase of bitcoin viz a viz 2rs increase of the example I just shared) which is wrong way of analysing/investingb) Usually the lower ticket crypto’s(I.e which have low base price Per coin ) have higher profit % (take note of 7th point of caution also). Some low ticket crypto’s right now which have a huge potential are :- MATIC, TRON , BTT(present in WazirX ) apart from the usual etherium.3. Now let’s say you have decided on your crytpo. Don’t put all your money into it. First test it on a very small amount let’s say 2–5k , do all the processes (putting money in wallet , buying and selling crypto) , and putting then profit back into your bank4. After 3rd point is done, start with an amount with which even if you loose you can afford it. Then only you can take your risks.5. Very Very Imp -Every crypto at any moment of time has a plateau. After that plateau is reached , it starts decreasing and then every-time it increases , a new plateau is created. The trick to earning Very well in crypto is to know that plateau. With that, you can apply the concept of buy low- sell high.Use the alert feature and the immediate past tends to know that plateau.Image of alert feature in Zebpay:- I.e once the crypto reaches that amount , it’s notifies you (to buy in case it’s low and to sell in case it’s high)Now I will again take the example of matic. yesterday it was at 150,today it reached 200 and plateaued there for 2,3 hrsnow I put 2 alerts :-let’s say it reached 188, and I took it out and it’s hovering at 188–194now my alert would be -the above is just an illustration of how I work when I want to know the plateau. You may have a different/better strategy to this but the concept of identifying plateau is this only. You cannot predict actually anytime with crypto. Be prepared to loose while identifying the plateau6. There is also an option of buy max/ sell max. Its Like whenever it reaches that amount, it buys /sells automatically (very useful feature).FYI - for any crypto trading app you will have to first do a KYC (which is very boring -sigh!!)In case you reached this far , congratulations!!Hope these strategies/pointers for crypto trading is helpful for you all and please comment /ping me if you have any doubts/ queries and I will try to clarify them :) Also please comment if this was helpful for you.In case we are meeting for the first time, I am Archit and hope you all are safe and happy :)Cheers!!Edit 1You would have seen how the market crashed last 3–4 days (starting 21st may). Now if you knew your plateau of let’s say MATIC, when it reached much below that plateau (for me that final no. was 160) , you should have sold it off(peak of matic was at 220) and then wait for getting it to stabilise and raise again ( I started again at 75- lowest it reached was 55) and right now it’s at 133(but effectively I have earned in both dip and rise again and have more no of coins now).",0 followers,Gerhard Walter,1.1K,54,915.8K,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-cryptocurrency-to-invest-in-from-now-to-the-end-of-2020

It looks too good to be true until i gave it a try and trust me it has been a smooth ride all the way. Don’t give up on cryptocurrency and join the platform. Trust me, you won’t care about the price fluctuation anymore. Thank me Later.PS: This is not in any case of me trying to lure you into anything for my own personal financial gain, i am just innocently sharing so that you could gain one or two things as this has been working for me. You can also make a research on what works for you too.1It Will Be the Main Currency in the FutureOne thing that the economic crisis of 2008 showed us is that traditional banking systems are flawed. And it’s been confirmed in 2020. More and more people are seeing the need for viable alternatives. And that’s exactly what crypto offers — a secure, decentralized form of banking, that takes governments and banks out of the equation.And the crazy thing is, that even banks realize it. Just listen to what Germany’s Deutsche Bank have to say. In their ‘Imagine 2030’ report, they talk about how fragile the traditional money system is — that by 2030, over 200 million people will be using digital money — and by then, traditional money will already be on the way out.And it’s not just Deutsche Bank. Twitter’s Jack Dorsey has said he believes Bitcoin will eventually become the world’s single currency. Elon Musk has stated that ‘crypto is a far better way to transfer value than a piece of paper.’ China State TV has called Blockchain — the technology that makes crypto possible — 10 times more valuable than the internet.2You Need to Get Familiarized With the TechnologyIt’s the biggest technological invention since the internet. So, if you ‘re still not up to speed with it, you’re behind. But the good news is, you’re still in time to start playing catch-up.Just like in the 90s, when the internet was taking off, there were those who resisted adapting to it. There will be those people with the blockchain and crypto revolution — but do you really want to be one of them?And just like we now rely on the internet for information and communications — soon it’s going to be the same for financial transactions using blockchain. So if you’re not familiar with using it yet now’s the time — what are you waiting for?3You will position yourself better for opportunities in this spaceSure, you can make and receive payments with a crypto account. You can use it to save. But the really big opportunities come with investing in crypto.Just take a look at Bitcoin. If you’d invested $100 in it just 5 years ago, by now that $100 would be worth $2 500. Or if you’d got in really early with that $100 ten years ago, be worth $1.9 million.The price of Bitcoin is still set to keep on going up. Sure, with blips here and there. And to be fair, probably not as dramatically as it did before. Other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash, Ripple and Lisk also have huge potential to grow, and bring great returns to savvy investors.But to know which coins to invest in, and when you do need to get educated — and get some experience under your belt. So why waste any time? Now’s the time to get crypto-savvy and learn to spot the opportunities — because you can be sure, there are huge opportunities waiting.4It’s a Solid Alternative for Saving Your MoneyWe’ve already talked about crypto’s long-term upwards trend. Let’s compare that with regular money. If you took $100 in cash, buried it, and waited 10 years, the amount you could buy with it a decade later could be a lot less than when you put it in the ground. Because of inflation. And leaving it in a bank account isn’t going to be much better — if at all. Because of the interest rates in bank accounts, which vary from zero to extremely low.Disclaimer — yes, crypto is more volatile than most currencies, largely because it’s still new, and gaining traction. Like at the start of 2018 when the price of Bitcoin tanked. Remember, it’s more or less recovered since then. And it’s upward trend is likely to continue, and win out on any volatility. And that’s what makes it such a great option for long-term saving — something that will beat any interest rated banks can give you.5You Are Safe From InflationSo, we were just talking about inflation. Let’s spell that out in full. The problem with traditional money is that it’s always going down in value. And this isn’t by accident. Governments and central banks do it on purpose. Especially when there’s a financial crisis. Like the one in 2008, or the one this year, in 2020.At times like these, there’s a shortage of money. And governments try to get around it by just printing more. In fact, 22% of all dollars that exist today were created in 2020, when the Federal Reserve injected $2 trillion into the economy.Making money appear out of thin air, might sound pretty neat. Until you figure out the catch. There may be more money — but the amount of goods and services it’s chasing stays the same. And the value of money goes down compared with the value of those goods and services. And that’s what we call inflation.That’s why smart people trust gold more than money. Because when there’s an economic crisis, new gold doesn’t just magically appear out of nowhere. And it holds its value. And Bitcoin and other crypto — just like gold — don’t get created as a short-term fix to financial problems. That means it crypto also holds its value. And it’s inflation-proof.6It’s Way Easier to Get Into Crypto Than You ThoughtJust in case you thought you need a PhD in programming, or maybe in finance to get into crypto — we’ll tell you now. You don’t. A smartphone with internet access will do nicely. In fact, crypto is way easier to get into than more traditional investments.First, because it’s got high liquidity — that you can buy and sell it easily and quickly. Second, there isn’t a high threshold to getting into it. For stocks and bonds, usually you need to put a large sum of money, and you can’t just put down 100 bucks. With crypto, you can.Better still, there are no institutions, no paperwork — just get an account, get a wallet, track your assets. And it’s pseudonymous — you don’t have to give any documents, or even your name.But we realize, there’s still a lot of confusion, and not many people understand how this space works, and how to take advantage of it. That’s why we decided to create the best course out there, to guide you step by step through everything we’ve learned about Bitcoin and Blockchain — from scratch.It’s called Bitcoin Essentials. You’ll learn how the technology works, how to use it, how to buy bitcoin safely, and how to store it. Just to go7No One Controls Your MoneySo if regular money is controlled by governments and banks — who does control crypto? Well, the beauty of crypto is that it’s controlled by nobody — and everybody — at the same time.Let’s take Bitcoin. The code is stored in thousands of nodes — that means the computers of tens of thousands people who voluntarily run Bitcoin software on their computers. There’s no central authority or mastermind behind it. All users effectively retain control. And it’s in everyone’s interests to keep the network active and healthy.And running it this way has all kinds of advantages over banks. Like, banks are only open business hours of the country they’re based in. Blockchain functions non-stop. And banks payments can take up to 48 hours to clear — Bitcoin transactions take between 15 minutes and an hour.8The Best Security on the MarketSo, if there’s no big powerful institution monitoring it, is it safe? The answer is a definite yes. It’s got the best security out there. And that’s down to the way information is stored.Any time a transaction takes place, and digital money gets handed over to a new user, that gets recorded permanently. And it can’t be erased. Even after it’s changed hands again. And remember we said that the data is stored by tens of thousands users? Unlike a bank, which has one central database.If one user has an error — or if anyone tries to tamper with information — the other tens of thousands will cross-reference each other and correct it. And the bigger the network — the more secure. And in the case of Bitcoin — that’s big. And you can count on it being secure.9The Lowest Fees by FarFor any kind of investment you make, there are going to be fees. Fees for making buying, selling and even storing the investment. And this is also true of crypto. But the difference is that with crypto, fees that are determined by users. And that means it’s in their interest to keep them low. Much lower than the ones you’ll be charged by stockbrokers to invest in stocks or bonds.And the same goes for making transfers — especially international ones. Make a transfer through a bank, and you’re going to get slapped by a high fee. But with crypto, there are no institutions making a profit from these money transfers, which is a huge advantage for people doing business. And another reason why the adoption rate of crypto is going to keep going up.10Blockchain Is Here to StayWhat you have to understand about blockchain, is that Bitcoin and other crypto, are built on Blockchain in the same way Facebook or Google are built on top of the internet. It’s what makes crypto possible — but there’s more to blockchain than crypto.We think that crypto is proof enough that blockchain is going to become more important. But just in case you needed more — let’s just look at all the other things blockchain is being used for.Big business is using it to record data. Companies like Pfizer, Walmart, Siemens, Unilever use it to keep data which is too complex for a spreadsheet to record. Healthcare providers use it to store their patients’ medical records safely. And there’s potential for it to grow in records of property ownership. And in elections, to keep track of votes and take away the need for recounts. Yep, that one would have come in handy in 2020.11High Returns if Done RightWe’ve already told you how much Bitcoin’s gone up — and how the long-term trend is bound to continue upwards. So we won’t repeat ourselves. But we will take the chance to tell you about a few other cryptocurrencies.In 2020, even with the pandemic in full swing, lots of crypto have seen big gains. The world’s second largest crypto, Ethereum started the year at $145, and is now at $600. And some are tipping it to become as popular as Bitcoin.And Ripple started the year at just over 20 cents and is now around 65 cents. And may others are headed in the same direction. Further proof, that now’s the time to get in the door, if you haven’t already.12It’s in Limited Supply — and Can’t Suffer From InflationRemember we talked about the way conventional currencies lose their value because of inflation? There’s a simple reason why crypto doesn’t.The supply is capped. This is written into the source code, which states that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin produced.Currently, 18.5 million Bitcoins have been mined. Quick explanation — mining means when advanced computers crack complex math problems and unlock the Bitcoins stored in the code.And even if new Bitcoins are still getting mined, there’s a limit on this. Unlike with traditional money, when banks decide print it by the truckload. With Bitcoin, the number of new coins released slows down every four years, meaning the supply is limited. And that’s the reason Bitcoin won’t suffer from inflation.13The Price Is Dictated by the Free Market, No Government Can Touch ItWith traditional money, governments have lots of options for manipulating its value. We already mentioned printing new money. As well as that, they set interest rates — the price of borrowing government money, which has ripple effect on the rest of the economy.But with crypto, none of this is set by a government. Instead everything’s controlled by the free market — or how much people are willing to buy or sell it for. And besides that, governments can’t freeze crypto accounts, or look at records of who has how much in crypto accounts. That’s because, unlike regular bank accounts, crypto accounts are pseudonymous. That means the holder doesn’t disclose their true name or identity.14It’s at an Early Stage and Already Disrupting MarketsSince Bitcoin was created in 2009, meaning that crypto’s already over 10 years old. But now’s the time it’s’ really taking off — and the growth it’s’ going to see over the next decades is likely to be a whole load more exciting than what we’ve seen up until now. You could say, the stage we’re at now is like the internet in the 90s.In fact, if you look at the numbers of people who’ve adopted cryptocurrencies over the last decade, it looks a lot like the adoption of the internet back in the 90s. Deutsche Bank have pointed out this similarity — and they predict that adoption rates are going to keep on at the same rate as the internet after the 90s. In other words, it’s going to keep on going up — in a spectacular way.And just like the internet’s disrupted literally everything over the last twenty years — we’re probably looking at blockchain doing the same over the coming decades.15Big Business Is Taking It SeriouslyLook at the list of companies that already accept payment in Bitcoin. Microsoft. AT&T. McDonalds, KFC and Subway. Virgin Galactic. CheapAir. Gyft. 4Chan. Norwegian Air. Twitch. Sports clubs like the Dallas Mavericks, Miami Dolphins or Portuguese soccer club Benfica. And Wikipedia accepts donations in Bitcoin.True, other companies are still reluctant to allow payments in it — because, it’s still volatile. But that’s bound to even out over time, and more and more big business will accept Bitcoin — and other crypto — as payment.And remember how we mentioned that Twitter’s Jack Dorsey’s talked about it being the future of money? Well, he’s put his money where his mouth is, and his payments company Square has invested $50 million in Bitcoin.",2 followers,Kelly Pearson,1K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-consider-investing-in-cryptocurrencies-safe

20,"The 10 Best Cryptocurrencies to Buy in 20221. Bitcoin (BTC)Created in 2009 by someone under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin (BTC) is the original cryptocurrency. As with most cryptocurrencies, BTC runs on a blockchain, or a ledger logging transactions distributed across a network of thousands of computers. Because additions to the distributed ledgers must be verified by solving a cryptographic puzzle, a process called proof of work, Bitcoin is kept secure and safe from fraudsters.2. Ethereum (ETH)Both a cryptocurrency and a blocThe 10 Best Cryptocurrencies to Buy in 20221. Bitcoin (BTC)Created in 2009 by someone under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin (BTC) is the original cryptocurrency. As with most cryptocurrencies, BTC runs on a blockchain, or a ledger logging transactions distributed across a network of thousands of computers. Because additions to the distributed ledgers must be verified by solving a cryptographic puzzle, a process called proof of work, Bitcoin is kept secure and safe from fraudsters.2. Ethereum (ETH)Both a cryptocurrency and a blockchain platform, Ethereum is a favorite of program developers because of its potential applications, like so-called smart contracts that automatically execute when conditions are met and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).Ethereum has also experienced tremendous growth. From April 2016 to the beginning of March 2022, its price went from about $11 to over $3,000, increasing more than 27,000%.3. Tether (USDT)Unlike some other forms of cryptocurrency, Tether is a stablecoin, meaning it’s backed by fiat currencies like U.S. dollars and the Euro and hypothetically keeps a value equal to one of those denominations. In theory, this means Tether’s value is supposed to be more consistent than other cryptocurrencies, and it’s favored by investors who are wary of the extreme volatility of other coins.4. Binance Coin (BNB)The Binance Coin is a form of cryptocurrency that you can use to trade and pay fees on Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world.Since its launch in 2017, Binance Coin has expanded past merely facilitating trades on Binance’s exchange platform. Now, it can be used for trading, payment processing or even booking travel arrangements. It can also be traded or exchanged for other forms of cryptocurrency, such as Ethereum or Bitcoin.BNB’s price in 2017 was just $0.10. By the beginning of March 2022, its price had risen to around $413, a gain of approximately 410,000%.5. XRP (XRP)Created by some of the same founders as Ripple, a digital technology and payment processing company, XRP can be used on that network to facilitate exchanges of different currency types, including fiat currencies and other major cryptocurrencies.At the beginning of 2017, the price of XRP was $0.006. As of March, 2022, its price reached $0.80, equal to a rise of more than 12,600%.6. Terra (LUNA)Terra is a blockchain payment platform for stablecoins that relies on keeping a balance between two types of cryptocurrencies. Terra-backed stablecoins, such as TerraUSD, are tied to the value of physical currencies. Their counterweight, Luna, powers the Terra platform and is used to mint more Terra stablecoins.Terra stablecoins and Luna work in concert according to supply and demand: When a stablecoin’s price rises above its tied currency’s value, users are incentivized to burn their Luna to create more of that Terra stablecoin. Likewise, when its value falls compared to its base currency, this encourages users to burn their Terra stablecoins to mint more Luna. As adoption of the Terra platforms grows, so too does the value of Luna.From Jan. 3, 2021, when its price was $0.64, to the beginning of March 2022, Luna has risen over 14,200% to $92.7. Cardano (ADA)Somewhat later to the crypto scene, Cardano is notable for its early embrace of proof-of-stake validation. This method expedites transaction time and decreases energy usage and environmental impact by removing the competitive, problem-solving aspect of transaction verification present in platforms like Bitcoin. Cardano also works like Ethereum to enable smart contracts and decentralized applications, which are powered by ADA, its native coin.Cardano’s ADA token has had relatively modest growth compared to other major crypto coins. In 2017, ADA’s price was $0.02. As of March 1, 2022, its price was at $0.99. This is an increase of 4,850%.8. Solana (SOL)Developed to help power decentralized finance (DeFi) uses, decentralized apps (DApps) and smart contracts, Solana runs on a unique hybrid proof-of-stake and proof-of-history mechanisms that help it process transactions quickly and securely. SOL, Solana’s native token, powers the platform.When it launched in 2020, SOL’s price started at $0.77. By March 1, 2022, its price was around $101, a gain of nearly 13,000%.9. Polkadot (DOT)Polkadot (DOT), founded in the year 2016, is a unique blockchain interoperability protocol designed to connect different chains together. It also allows exchanging data and processing transactions for parachains, or parallel blockchains without compromising their security. Developers can create their own blockchains while using the Polkadot security.The core founder of Ethereum, Gavin Wood created Polkadot. The exciting feature of DOT is that it has no hard limit on its total supply. Rather, a new token is constantly in circulation.Polkadot’s price reached its heights in May 2020 at $6.30 and later in May 2021, the price hit its all-time high of $55.11.10. Litecoin (LTC)Litecoin (LTC), an open-source blockchain project launched in 2011, was created by former crypto exchange Coinbase software engineer Charlie Lee. It was one of the initial cryptocurrencies whose code is imitated from Bitcoin’s. Despite the fact that it has similarities with Bitcoin, it is developed to have a faster transaction confirmation time. It can be used as an avenue for paying people around the world without a mediator. LTC is frequently considered as “silver to Bitcoin’s gold.”Litecoin has a total round-off supply of 84 million tokens. In May 2021, it recorded its lifetime high of $413.47 but it dropped by over 50%. There are a growing number of merchants that undertake Litecoin. It has a per token value of around $106, the 21st-largest cryptocurrency in the world.Thank you :)","84,995 followers",Adam Fayed,18.5K,3.6K,476.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-consider-investing-in-cryptocurrencies-safe

I think you can hardly find a person who hasn't heard anything about blockchain. Still, not many people understand what it's about. Basically, it's a chain of blocks with a long row of letters and digits(hash) in it. Hash encodes any transaction within the network. Blockchain is the cornerstone of all decentralized systems, including decentralized finance(DeFi). As you can understand from the name, it's a financial transaction system without any regulator above it. All your everyday financial operations are supervised by some financial entity. Usually, it's your local bank with the central bank at the top of the pyramid.DeFi+ It is very hack resistant. As blocks in blockchain have their unique hash number, all the computers in the network know the hashes of the blocks in the sequence. In order to hack one block, you have to change the hashes in the blocks of the sequence on all the computers. Which is almost impossible to execute because these networks include thousands or hundreds of thousands of computers.- All the blockchain systems are critical to the agreement mechanism between the participants. In a blockchain, it is called a consensus mechanism. Basically, it’s how members of the network decide how they approve blocks in the blockchain. Because these systems have no one primary regulator and, at the same time, a guarantor of all the transactions, the network participants take this role. For approving the blocks, they get rewards in coins.According to this, blockchain consensus is divided into two different approaches:a) Proof of work(b) Proof of stake(You should be aware of this information for us to move on further. We won't stop at these two concepts for too long. Maybe I'll talk about them in the following posts.Why do I think Ethereum is a good option for investment?Here are four major points:1. Ethereum was created in 2013. In 2015 they launched the network with:a) decentralized applications. Everyone can locate their application into it for people to interact with it.b) decentralized finance apps perform financial services bypassing financial institutions.c) Ethereum network allows NFT.As you can see Ethereum is expanding to something more than just a coin. It has a vast opportunities for scaling into a separate decentralized environment with Ethereum coin at its core.2. Initially, Ethereum worked as a3. Ethereum is burning coins worth millions of dollars. Why are they doing it? Crypto Coins are known for their instability and volatile behavior. Burning coins helps to make them deflationary and more reliable to work with.4. Invest in people, not ideas. Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin is passionate about public goods; he always speaks about something that will be useful for humanity in general. Partly the reason of Ethereum 2.0 transition is to lower the overall cryptocurrencies energy consumption.This is a strong foundation for great investments. Investments just for investments are pointless; they must serve not only your benefit but also the prosperity of society.",0 followers,Andrea Eisenhower,1.8K,0,0,1991,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-consider-investing-in-cryptocurrencies-safe

Thank me Later.Note:While the advent of decentralized cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin has dominated the headlines, a broader set of changes wrought by advances in technology are likely to eventually have a more profound and lasting impact on central banks. It is premature to speak of disruption of traditional concepts of central banking, but it is worth considering if the looming changes to money, financial markets, and payments systems will have significant repercussions for the operation of central banks and their ability to deliver on key objectives such as low inflation and financial stability.",2 followers,Kelly Pearson,1.2K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-cryptocurrency-to-invest-in-from-now-to-the-end-of-2020
