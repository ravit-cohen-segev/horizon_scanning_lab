And that is actually what makes this so exciting.This guy used readily-available components and technologies to create a personal helicopter, and it probably costs less than your average car.Ultralight aviation is about to go mainstream. You don't need an airfield to launch or land it. You don't need a hangar to store it. You don't need a fortune to buy it.Flight times are still measured in single-digit minutes, but that will improve over time. Batteries improve by a few percent per year, and motors are improving, and there is surely room for improvement in the efficiency of the rotors.And how much flight time would your commute really need if you were not confined to overcrowded roads? These don't need to be capable of long distances in order to change the world.We've all been dreaming about flying cars and jetpacks, but I'm pretty sure personal helicopters are going to meet most of those needs much sooner.Given the FAA's abysmally slow pace at drone regulation, I'm pretty sure these will be for sale on Amazon before the government figures out what to do about this.",2 followers,Richard Muller,3.2K,2.3K,202.3M,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-will-emerge-from-now-until-2035

Upon cashing out, most companies stagnate and cease to innovate.  Software is not what it once was.  We have come to value the user-base over real revenue.  Even the most powerful new company, Facebook, is only a fraction as profitable as the ""original"" giants (Microsoft, Apple, etc).  Microsoft and Apple both built companies that did not rely on an exit - they were profitable from day one, and could continue being profitable without too much innovation.  They had a reason to last, and their leaders never really had a reason to cash out (I would argue that Bill Gates ""retired"" from the business, rather than cashing out).  I hope that we might one day return to this methodology.The next generation of leaders will have to be wealthy, a magnitude beyond their competitors.  It sounds like backwards thinking, but wealth is the only true measure of success (let us avoid philosophy here), and measuring success is the only meaningful filter among leaders.  Gates, Jobs, and so forth only ""matter"" because of their success.  Remember when Apple was doing poorly, financially?  Relatively few really cared (or even knew about) Jobs, until he stepped back in started smashing quarterly revenues. So, the question is, who will bring money back into the equation?This might seem tangential, but bear with me... :)I think we need to start challenging the assumption that everything should be free. It sounds like blasphemy, but real businesses are built on real profits.  The most successful companies right now are, in one way or another, charging money (Zynga, Salesforce, Amazon, Ebay, etc).I think there is one key change that needs to occur to ameliorate the way we make businesses, and thus allow room for a new generation of leaders in tech.Monetization needs to be automatic. This could happen in several ways.WhatWhy is this important?  Right now, companies tend to rely on user bases and acquisition as a business model (not all, but most).  This means they are surviving off of investor money, primarily.  Investors want a return, and thus an exit.  As I stated, businesses stagnate after the exit, and leaders die early.  Many companies are in the red, even with ad revenue (I believe Google's YouTube division still is).To illustrate the difference between ad revenue and subscription fees, imagine if Facebook charged $1/month for access (or better yet, let's say your ISP paid $1/mo to Facebook).  Facebook has about 600 million users.  That would amount toIn summary, iconic leaders will be born from iconic wealth.  Wealth cannot be produced in a vacuum, so we will not see a new generation of leaders until we change the way we think about business in tech.","5,074 followers",Jeff Ronne,4.5K,3.8K,7M,2011,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-will-emerge-from-now-until-2035

It is blockchain technology.There was always a concern in human history that how one could verify the originality of information or anything.Information Technology is vulnerable to manipulation and modifications. This in itself creates a unique problem in using information technology and computers.Blockchain technology beautifully developed a complex algorithm which is open source. It creates blocks using host of events happening in digital world. Each block is unique in the world and can be identified without any efforts.By using this technology every bit of information can be identified and verified. It is a revolution as big as internet itself.Sooner it will change the way information is transmitted and handled.While this being commonly projected uses and advantages of blockchain technology. The biggest limitation to wider use of block chain is computing capacities. To constantly decode, code and verify wide blockchains, there need to be very strong processor in every digital device.As we are observing information technology space is being created and handled by ecosystems; Like Microsoft, Google or Amazon.But very soon with Blink of an eye, every personal computer, every cell phone would be server in itself. There would be network of servers than network of passive memory and processors.The the time has come to realize and move away from the dependency on Google servers or cloud storages.It is always been a dream to control wide business and economic activities. But it was never been the case.It began with Central Direct Current electricity generation of Thomas Edison, which broken down by Tesla. Making electricity more decentralize. Now we have solar power and nuclear power plants.IBM also tried to control ecosystem using Mainframes. It was challenged by Apple. What happened later is well documented history.The same is happening now, Google, Amazon or for that sake Microsoft is trying to control information flows on internet using their servers. It is not only creating privacy issues but also threatening very concept of open internet platform.Very soon, with help of blockchain technology we would be able to secure our information database. It is nobody's mandate to control our cell phones or our location services.As every cell phone and every computer has its own machine number. In same way each machine with adequate computing power would act as a server. We do not need anyone else's servers to secure our own information. We can do that on our own. This would be the next radical change in the world. Everyone would own their information, it would be totally free to regulate and controlled by every other individual.The two dimensional carbon based Graphene could replace silicon as a material in electronics triggering new Era in computing.","17,163 followers",Pascal Morimacil,4.4K,4.3K,34.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-will-emerge-from-now-until-2035

It has changed the way we work, the way we learn, and the way we interact with others. But what is the next big thing in technology? What will have the biggest impact on our lives?1: Artificial IntelligenceArtificial intelligence has been around for a while and has been used in a number of different ways. Some people think that artificial intelligence is the next best technology and that it will be the biggest thing to happen to technology in a long time. Others are not so sure and think that artificial intelligence is overrated.2: Virtual RealityVirtual reality technology has been around for some time now, but it has recently seen a resurgence in popularity. This is due to the fact that virtual reality allows users to experience a simulated environment that is different from the real world. This can be used for a number of purposes, such as gaming, education, and therapy. There are a number of different virtual reality technologies available, but the most popular is probably VR headsets.3: Augmented RealityAugmented reality is a technology that allows users to see computer-generated images, sounds, and sensations that overlay or interact with the real world. It has been used in video games, advertising, and medical applications, and is now being used in a wider range of settings. AR can be used to improve productivity by providing additional information while workers are working on tasks, or to provide entertainment by making virtual objects appear to be in the environment around them.4: Robotics technologyRobotics technology has been around for quite some time and is still growing. It has many applications, including manufacturing, medical, and defense. Robotics technology is advancing quickly and there are many new developments being made all the time. It is an exciting time to be involved in robotics technology!5: Quantum ComputingQuantum computing is a type of computing that exploits the principles of quantum mechanics. It has the potential to solve certain problems much faster than traditional computers and could be used in a variety of applications such as cryptography and data encryption.6: 5G Mobile Networks5G mobile networks are expected to become prevalent in the next few years. They will offer faster speeds and more capacity than current 4G networks. They will also be able to handle more devices and more data at once and more data at once. This would be beneficial for businesses because they would be able to handle more customers and more data at the same time.7: Blockchain TechnologyBlockchain technology is a distributed database that can be used to create a tamper-proof record of transactions. A blockchain is a digital ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. It is used to track the ownership of digital assets and to make it difficult for anyone to duplicate or tamper with records.Another option is to use a digital ledger system like Microsoft's Azure Cloud File System. Azure Cloud File System uses file shares to store data and protect it from unauthorized access. Files are encrypted with a unique key, and each file share has its own encryption key. This makes it difficult for anyone to access or tamper with the data.Conclusion:It is still too early to say which of these technologies will be the biggest game-changer. But all of them have the potential to change the world as we know it.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-will-emerge-from-now-until-2035
