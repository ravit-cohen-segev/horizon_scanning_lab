A lot could happen in 85 years, no one is certain for sure that China will fall or rise definitively.The Qing dynasty up until the 1799 was prosperous and possibly the wealthiest and most populous nation on earth at the time. No one at the time would expected its downfall. Yet, in no more than 50 years, with signing of first unequal treaty 'The Treaty of Nanking' came the starting of its end. 50 year is well within the 85 year time period.From here I would list possible downfalls of China.1.

A lot could happen in 85 years, no one is certain for sure that China will fall or rise definitively.The Qing dynasty up until the 1799 was prosperous and possibly the wealthiest and most populous nation on earth at the time. No one at the time would expected its downfall. Yet, in no more than 50 years, with signing of first unequal treaty 'The Treaty of Nanking' came the starting of its end. 50 year is well within the 85 year time period.From here I would list possible downfalls of China.1. China never truly broke through chain of lock down. The chain(s) of islands under foreign control that spreads from atlantic ocean to the western end of South China Sea. Also nations in the world that does not want China to rise.The international relationship and politics went down hill for China due to whatever reasons: possibly sea or land dispute, fear of China's growing power, etc. The island chain went into effect and successfully blocked or controlling all shipping routes to and from China, placing China under sanction. The trading routes that run through South China sea are life lines to China. This would end or contain China as its economy crumples and society went into disarray.2. China is caught in middle income trap. This is a trap that caught many countries as they grow from a impoverished nation (below 1000 Per GDP) into a middle income nation (around 10,000 Per GDP). Nations are caught in it for many different reasons. Some reasons are but not limited to failure to restructure economy, failure to undergo needed political reforms, and faliure to transform from export to import country, and foreign intervention.As wages grow and labor expense rises, the low cost manufacturing base brings less and less value to the economy. China's economy never successfully transacted into high value industries like IT and Aerospace. Foreign investment started a large scale pullout. China went into a vicious sprial of nonexistent growth and high unemployment.3. China's political tense and social discontent are never successfully dealt with. As much as China is a authoritarian nation, Chinese were far from being meeky. Year round of protest and clashes with the authority were never rare. Social and political discountent could be caused by many reasons like environmental degradation, corruption, slower rise of income compared to living cost, large gap between wealthy and poor, etc.The social tense in China has risen to a level were it is disruptive to economy and stability and the government's failure to address this problem will inevitably torn China into pieces like so many dynasty before CCP.Now to sum up the answer to your question, will China fall?Not sure, there is just too much variables and factors going on.The possibility of it falling?Possible but not high. There are professionals that work on things like this. They most likely outwit us (at least me). Some of them reading this are probably getting a good laugh. They have plans.",111 followers,Marcus Krug,1.1K,77,247.4K,2015,https://www.quora.com/Will-China-fall-before-the-turn-of-the-century

2,"Yes. China will fall if:…no country at that scale will fall, especially this country has largest population and economy and still growing. U shall pray for china not to fall, cos if u pay attention to any countries that start to decline, they will try to shift the civil’s attention to outside first. Look at how those wars in the past happened, then u will understand.What a silly question.","5,260 followers",Joe Willmore,630,8.2K,43.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Will-China-fall-before-the-turn-of-the-century

There is no vestige of communism in the ways this country is being run.China has been a totalitarian state for almost 3 thousand years. Mao once commented:"" 千Before I can give any serious answer to your unanswerable question, let me stress again that China has got nothing to do with Communism except the current government has the word 'communist' in its name.

Mao once commented:"" 千Western industrial countries invading China in the late 19 century and early 20 century was for quite a while thought to have shaken China out of its cycle and broken its inner rhythm so violently and completely that it had gone onto a different path wherein Emperors and Dynasties no longer exists, however China ended up having a Nationalist government headed by Kiang Kai-Shek that is more dictatorial and more corrupted than any previous dynasties. Chairman Mao did upend China entirely by his Cultural Revolution and his communism ideology, but only briefly and superficially, 50 years later China has grooved into its old rhythm again.If no previous Chinese government has ever broken the curse of no dynasty should last more than 300 years, on what ground would we expect that the CCP is capable of doing so?So to answer your question, yes CCP will fall in the next 200-250 years, and China will be chaotic again, but eventually it will be united by another totalitarian government.So China will never fall.",8 followers,David Barry,2.9K,3.8K,8.4M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Will-China-fall-before-the-turn-of-the-century

But then again, with a country as huge as China you'll have no two regions where the seasons start at the same time, some are still in winter (north) while spring is already in full swing (south).But at the moment (as of May 2020) China's fall is not imminent, not imminent at all!Hope that answers your question?!","84,365 followers",Paul Denlinger,664,11.5K,55.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Will-China-fall-before-the-turn-of-the-century
6,"I think China is incredibly strong today and I see no reason why this should change in the near future.  While Communism was a catastrophe in Russia it amounts to just another dynasty in China.  Indeed China has found a way to keep Communism as a political system but have capitalism emerge as the primary economic system.  It is not perfect capitalism but close enough that the current Chinese economy is doing very well.It is easy to measure China's political system using American standards, but this is not really appropriate.

It is not perfect capitalism but close enough that the current Chinese economy is doing very well.It is easy to measure China's political system using American standards, but this is not really appropriate.  I have discussed this issue with real Chinese residents and their universal response has been they just don't care about politics.  That is different from America where interest in politics seems to be the national passtime.  It may be that strong central control as found in most Communist countries just doesn't work but China seems to have found a good mix between this and the freedom of capitalism for many business ventures.Of course the wording of this question talks about a very long time and I am not able to predict what will happen nearly a hundred years from now.  That said, for now I think the political and economic situations in China look more stable than equivalent measures of the USA.","4,495 followers",Sanjit Sinhasan,900,249,4.2M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Will-China-fall-before-the-turn-of-the-century

Her oldest sister was born in 1903 the next sister in 1909, my mother in 1918. Then my grandmother died in the flu epidemic. My mother was sent to a foster home to be raised she was an infant and he was a busy farmer. He remarried in 1923 and he and his second wife had a daughter born in 1925 and another in 1927. There was never that many small children needing to be cared for. The foster home had 3 children of their own and when they took in my mother their kids were 19, 12, and 6. Basically somehow they managed to space their children often in those days so there were not 4 kids under 5 and one on the way as a rule. In large families, often for religious reasons, it was especially common to lose 2–3 of the children to diseases that no longer exist. My father had a sister who was born in 1906 and died of diphtheria when she was 3.

Therefore, they cannot “dispense” of humans, because they are not capable of the same kind of egomaniacal thinking which would lead human beings to discarding whatever is “inferior”.Androids and automatons and the like can only abide by rules and regulations which are programmed into them, and it does not matter if they look, sound, and behave in ways which mimic a human being very well; they still will not possess a creative consciousness that is capable of thinking outside of the bounds determined by whoever programmed them.Since androids and automatons and the like cannot develop free will, because they can only “think” within the bounds which are determined for them by their programming and “operating system”, then there will never come a time when androids and the like take over.Of course, it is possible that the military will use androids for war purposes, because by the time we have developed androids and implemented in our society, it is highly doubtful that our humankind will have created lasting peace here on Earth, and therefore the military will almost certainly program them for killing. From out of this, it is theoretically possible that the military eventually loses control of the situation and hence the androids then pose a serious threat existential to civilisation — this is probably even more likely if the military leaders at that time regard themselves to be gods, just as today’s military leaders do, because military leaders who regard themselves to be powerful and untouchable like gods make careless errors which unleash all hell on the undeserving and unsuspecting people of this planet.)However, even in the off chance that androids are not used for war purposes (which they almost certainly will), they will nevertheless make plenty of work obsolete because of the fact that they are going to be more efficient workers who do not need sleep or homes, and so it’s up to us to slow down our procreation habit accordingly before they are deployed in our workplaces, which could happen within the next couple of decades, or maybe it will take 100 more years — who knows.So long as the population count of the Earth starts to contract and shrink in relation to the advancement of technology, then it won’t really be much of an issue that androids and the like make jobs obsolete.It will only be a major problem if we keep on procrating in the same reckless, irresponsible wise as always, although actually, we already have a major issue with there being too many human beings in relation to how many fitting careers there are in the entire world.But when there are androids and AI and so on making various jobs obsolute, it will be extremely bad, of course, if we have not adjusted our procreation habits in preparation, because then there are apt to be incredibly many people in life who are unemployed and have nothing to do with themselves, so they get up to more mischief or lose themselves in boredom or drug addiction or whatever other pitfalls.","114,101 followers",Alon Amit,4.1K,7.5K,119.2M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Will-China-fall-before-the-turn-of-the-century
