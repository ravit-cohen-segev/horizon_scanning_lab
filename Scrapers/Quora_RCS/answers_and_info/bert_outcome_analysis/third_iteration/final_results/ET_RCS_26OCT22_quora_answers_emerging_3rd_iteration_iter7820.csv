0,"Nuclear fusion is safer than nuclear fission. Why?Because nuclear fusion has no chain reaction involved.In nuclear fission you basically shoot neutrons at heavy atoms, thus breaking them apart, which frees energy which can be used e.g. to heat water and produce electricity via a dynamo. But, and that is the point here, it also frees neutrons which again break others atoms, again freeing energy and neutrons and so on. Uncontrolled this chain reaction can produce enormous amounts of energy in a very short time. That’s basically what happens when a nuclear bomb is detonated or if a nuclear plantNuclear fusion is safer than nuclear fission.

For energy to be freed, you have to keep up the pressure. If there is a malfunction and the magnetic fields collapse, the reaction simply stops. No chain reaction, no enormous amounts of energy, no catastrophe.","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Nuclear-fusion-is-safer-than-nuclear-fission-Why

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","220,634 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.1K,47.3K,783M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Nuclear-fusion-is-safer-than-nuclear-fission-Why

4,"It doesn’t, not atom per atom. As other answers to this question point out, a typical fission reaction releases about 200 MeV of energy.

That’s less than 10% of the energy released by fission!However, if you have equal weights of fuel, then the energy released by fusion is greater.

The fusion core emits a large number of fast neutrons, and these neutrons are capable of causing fission in ordinary U-238. So the fusion core in such a bomb is surrounded by U-238, and the induced fission gives about half of the energy. It also gives almost all of the fallout. So in the neutron bomb, this layer is omitted, resulting in much less fallout. The emitted neutrons, which can kill anyone nearby, give the neutron bomb its name.If you are still concerned about what MeV means, it is a unit of energy that is very useful for nuclear reactions. It means “one million eV” where the eV (or “electron volt”) is an energy unit equal to 1.6 x10^-19 joules.","220,634 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,783M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Nuclear-fusion-is-safer-than-nuclear-fission-Why

These engines are really weak, but they're cheaper and safer to use than even the normal rocket engines that power our current spaceships.A plasma engine would work by simply superheating material and pushing it out of the back of the spacecraft (possibly assisted by ion drive-like technology). It's more dangerous than a normal rocket, as it has a higher operating temperature, but it has the advantage that it doesn't rely on any particular chemical reaction, so it can be fueled with any material that's readily available.Antimatter is usually proposed as a powerplant rather than as a true propulsive engine. It's really dangerous, because if the fuel comes into physical contact with any part of your ship, the ship will not merely explode, but also release deadly radiation. But, on the other hand, the main alternative to antimatter in SF is nuclear power (usually fusion, though fission is an option for writers who don't want to project technical advances too far into the future), which also poses significant radiation and explosion risks. In any event, your antimatter or fusion reactor produces heat energy, which can either be directly used to power a plasma drive, or can be converted to electricity to power whatever other systems your futuristic spaceship might have.So, in summary, if the mysterious time traveler gives you an ion drive, that's safe enough. If he gives you a plasma drive, you probably should turn it over to NASA rather than playing with it yourself, but it won't kill you by just sitting there. If he gives you antimatter, though, evacuate immediately.

I think you do but it is never too careful to check.So a fission nuclear reactor works like this…So as you can see the heat that is harnessed, which only represents a small fraction of the radiation actually produced, is captured and made to heat a liquid that in turn makes the plates of a conventional electromagnetic generator produce energy.If you tried to use this to use as a propulsion system, you wouldn't even get it off the ground, less alone into space.And remember that the same goes for nuclear fusion, even though we don't have nuclear fusion wNo.Do you know how nuclear reactors work?

You would need the fuel used to either convert into a form of plasma or that its radiation was emited in form we could easily harness and convert into energy. Like for example… Microwaves!Unfortunately nothing like that exists. Or so it seems although there have been news (more like rumors) that China and Russia, are both on the verge of creating a form of Fission based propulsion system, that could not only send a craft to the Moon, but also Mars and beyond.How?! Like I said they are mainly rumors. But apparently they have found a way to convert certain nuclear materials, into a gas. That gas is then mixed with other gases. Placed inside a chamber that is equipped with neutron emitters, that make the gas heat up until it becomes a form of plasma. That plasma is then unleashed as a means of propulsion.Which in theory does work but finding the right combination is nothing but extremely hard work and also a lot of luck.So if the rumors are true then we'll see in a few years China or Russia colonizing the Moon and maybe moving beyond it.",622 followers,Steven Jerkins,987,6.8K,7.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Nuclear-fusion-is-safer-than-nuclear-fission-Why
9,"To properly explain how temperature affects the operation of both power reactors and thermonuclear systems requires discussing a fair amount of physics.The principal effect that temperature has on the rate of fission (reactivity) is a phenomenon called “Doppler resonance broadening”.All commercial power reactors in the world right now are moderated thermal neutron systems. This means that the fast neutrons (~1 MeV) produced by fission are immediately slowed down by collisions with moderator atom nuclei until they have the same average kinetic energy as the temperature of the moderator (~300 C,To properly explain how temperature affects the operation of both power reactors and thermonuclear systems requires discussing a fair amount of physics.The principal effect that temperature has on the rate of fission (reactivity) is a phenomenon called “Doppler resonance broadening”.All commercial power reactors in the world right now are moderated thermal neutron systems. This means that the fast neutrons (~1 MeV) produced by fission are immediately slowed down by collisions with moderator atom nuclei until they have the same average kinetic energy as the temperature of the moderator (~300 C, ~570 K) which is about 0.05 eV (3000 m/sec).But, like the fuel and moderator atoms and molecules themselves, the thermal motion of the neutrons follows a Maxwellian energy distribution.The majority of the absorbing nuclei in the reactor core is U-238. The neutron capture cross section of U-228 at different energies looks like this:Those narrow spikes of absorption at specific energies are called resonances, and are due to quantum mechanical effects. Although the lowest energy spike starts rising around 5 eV, around 100 times higher in energy than the thermalized average, there is a small portion of the very long tail that is in this energy range, and there are also neutrons that encounter the thick forest of spikes in the fuel before they have been fully thermalized.Doppler resonance broadening is the effective increase in the width of those narrow spikes due to increasing temperature (and motion) of the uranium atoms in the fuel. This leads to increased parasitic absorption of neutrons with increasing fuel temperature, which reduces reactivity and makes the reactor stable — temperature increases from increased reactivity suppress that reactivity.There are other effects, expansion of moderator and fuel, reducing their effective density, and so forth, but the Doppler resonance absorption of U-238 is the dominant effect.For thermonuclear fusion the effective reaction rates are a combination of the fusion cross sections of the reactions at different energies, and the Maxwellian distribution of energies of the fuel nuclei. Together these factors produce these reaction rate curves:The fact that the curves actual start decreasing above a certain temperature (this can only be seen for D-T in this temperature range) is due to the two factors that affect the reaction cross sections: the quantum tunneling probability and the geometric cross section of the nuclei, it is the integrated product of these two that determine the rate.The quantum tunneling probability strictly increases with temperature. But the “size” of the nuclei is determined by the de Broglie wavelength of the nuclei (the “matter wavelength”) which decreases linearly with energy, so that the effective “area” of the nuclei decrease with the square of the energy. This effect eventually overwhelms the increasing tunneling probability.","220,634 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.1K,47.3K,783M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Nuclear-fusion-is-safer-than-nuclear-fission-Why
