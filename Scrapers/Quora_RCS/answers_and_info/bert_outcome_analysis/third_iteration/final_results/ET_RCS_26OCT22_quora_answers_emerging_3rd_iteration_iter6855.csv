However, what is usually meant is ""hot fusion,"" or the collision of certain atomic nuclei at high temperatures  to fuse into new elements, which weigh just a little bit less than the sum of the parts. That mass is converted to energy. Lots of energy.Ordinary water contains fusible hydrogen, of two kinds: light hydrogen and deuterium. Fusion with light hydrogen is more difficult than with deuterium. Deuterium is only a small percentage of ordinary water.

However, what is usually meant is ""hot fusion,"" or the collision of certain atomic nuclei at high temperatures  to fuse into new elements, which weigh just a little bit less than the sum of the parts. That mass is converted to energy. Lots of energy.Ordinary water contains fusible hydrogen, of two kinds: light hydrogen and deuterium. Fusion with light hydrogen is more difficult than with deuterium. Deuterium is only a small percentage of ordinary water. However, even so, there is enough potential energy in the deuterium in water to provide earth's energy needs for a long time, if a way can be found to harness this.The problem is that the temperatures required are very, very hot, on the order of a billion degrees K. No material can withstand those temperature, so reactors must somehow keep the hot material in them from vaporizing the walls. This is normally done, in theory, with magnetic confinement, though there is another approach, ""inertial confinement,"" where a small piece of fusible material is hit by super-powerful lasers from all directions at once, and is compressed and fuses.  None of this is easy. The magnetic confinement approach has historically and commonly run into unanticipated instabilities, and the devices have gotten larger and larger in size, with more and more technology, superconducting magnets, etc., attempting to create an environment where fusion can take place.Fusion has been achieved  this way, but it is very rare that one of these machines has produce as much extra power as was put into it.There is a huge hot fusion research establishment, but having spent a billion dollars a year for maybe fifty years, with payoff in terms of useful power remaining twenty years on the future, governments are getting tired of budgeting for it. That is what could kill it. Essentially, continued failure to meet declared goals.There are alternative hot fusion approaches that private concerns are working on. I consider all hot fusion approaches to be a long shot.There is also cold fusion. The known cold fusion reaction converts deuterium to helium, which is a very energetic reaction, and, unlike the hot fusion reactions, this appears to generate no radiation. The reaction takes place at the surface of highly loaded metal hydrides, and the necessary conditions are unknown; that is, when the materials are made in a certain way, and stressed in a certain way, for a substantial time, most samples will generate anomalous heat and helium. However, this is extremely difficult to control. For a long time, because of that difficulty, there was great skepticism that the effect even existed.There are also claims of reactions with light hydrogen. These are not clearly confirmed, and the ash is not known. However, if this is real, hydrogen is vastly plentiful.I""m familiar with cold fusion, and I have no idea that anyone is trying to ""kill"" it. However, the patent situation is not favorable, the patent office still rejects patents that claim cold fusion, as it is allegedly impossible.While there are several commercial enterprises working on cold fusion, usually with hydrogen, they must, because of the patent problem, work in secrecy. I see no sign that anyone has learned to reliably control the reaction, so cold fusion, as well, remains a long-term possibility, albeit one that could change if one of the active enterprises is successful.As to the last part of the question, without a developed technology, it is difficult to assess impact. The most optimistic scenario I come up with is that Nickel-Hydrogen cold fusion technology becomes available and is sufficiently reliable and controllable to be used for electric power generation. Most hot fusion concepts involve large power plants. It is likely that NiH, if it works, could be made into a small device, that would be relatively cheap, and portable. So a lot of people writing about the ""rosy future of cold fusion"" think of being off the grid, as well as being green. Maybe.I actually think we have bigger fish to fry: how can human beings communicate, cooperate, and coordinate activities for common welfare? If we can solve that problem, we can solve all the rest.","220,638 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,783.1M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Is-fusion-energy-really-going-to-be-developed-or-is-it-going-to-be-another-killed-technology-In-what-ways-will-development-change-the-world

And if we also act so, we all will be extinct in an exponential way.Civilization level is not measured and expressed by the energy it can control and use but by the information evolution level it can achieve in nature given conditions. And its survival and its future depend on that.Due to the energy of any local system is intrinsically limited, the more you use it (in economic activities), the faster you die out. This process is destructing its material value base Q for survival and evolution of its information level E which it depends on to connect processes by matching the E level to the nature defined evolution distance d.On the earth, the nature generated life, so its material value base Q can naturally enable the evolution distance d which if we obey natural laws, our (thinking and biological) information evolution level E can match to connect processes to reach future.What can connect the processes is the information evolution level, but not the energy control and consumption level, which actually is destructing the material value base for the information evolution level to evolve.Whether we can survive into future depends on the efficiency ɳ we can use the limited nature given energy Q in this local system so that we can evolve our information E (thinking and biological information, and the coordination between them). ɳ = E/Q.Due to natural order orders natural system, therefore the best evolution rate we can get is the natural process controlled thermodynamic process defined upper limit ɳ. Therefore, the nature given natural life span (the next 1.2 billion years) in natural conditions is the best we can get for our information evolution level, therefore what we can do to get into future is to fully use the natural given conditions --- the natural life span of the ecosystem and its optimal natural conditions to evolve the level that we can connect processes.But natural order runs our manmade social system will not allow that to happen --- it naturally locking all human in its process level natural selection mechanism to force us to compete each other in power competition (both economy and war) to destroy the systems in range that will extinct us as life. Only when we change it into rational order, we can create an rational open process to reach future.In natural order, there is no solution, whatever you do in it, it will wipe you out; the only solution is to get rid of this natural order in our social system.Due to we are biological beings, we are natural subsystems that only can be ordered by natural order in natural process, therefore, there is a nature defined evolution distance measured by billion years unit for us to connect the processes to reach future. And that evolution rate is thermodynamic process controlled we cannot control --- the manmade order (such as technology) cannot order that natural system information but only disorder it, therefore technology cannot send us into future but only bring about our extinction.It is not the case human can use all the energy of the earth can get from the sun and the internal energy of the earth, because we are part of the ecosystem and we depend on the ecosystem to survive and evolve, we cannot cut short of this system process and structure to monopolize this local system energy use.Quote from my answer for question in Quora: “When do you think humanity will become a Type 1 civilization?”“And due to we are natural order ordered natural structure, we depend on natural system to survive, which by natural order, level by level, form the energy utilization and collection system to give us the natural harmonized coexistence in this ecosystem to survive and evolve --- the fact is: we are already depending on the whole earth ecosystem collected energy to support us from day one life began 3.5 billion years ago. And we cannot cut short all the eco system level by level, pyramid structure of food chain and eco system formed environment conditions to directly collect the sun’s energy to survive and evolve, it sounds like more efficient but actually that only means our own destruction”.That kind of thinking and action has zero efficiency in the universal efficiency equation ɳ = E/Q, that means total extinction.Because the E depends on the nature defined limited Q in this local space and time, and the ɳ is the nature defined ordering rate by natural order led natural process that defined the evolution distance d, so the Q, d and ɳ are all nature defined constants. And due to only when the E can match the d, it can connect processes, therefore, only the E that can up to the nature demanded level of it, can exist in nature finally, if not, it will be recycled. So what is this E?It is also a constant.Life can free act, but nature decides the final result of it. That is the essence of natural selection.It is not the case you just have to win every fight and breed a lot you will be selected by nature, that is an over simplicity in the interpretation of natural selection:",0 followers,Cesar Alcaraz,7.2K,1.5K,24M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-fusion-energy-really-going-to-be-developed-or-is-it-going-to-be-another-killed-technology-In-what-ways-will-development-change-the-world
