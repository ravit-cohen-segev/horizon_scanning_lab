Internet for everyone :-We can’t seem to live without the internet but still only around half the world’s population is connected. There are many reasons for this, including economic and social reasons, but for some the internet just isn’t accessible because they have no connection.Google is slowly trying to solve the problem using helium balloonsTheir satellites orbit the Earth 16 times a day and are already being used by organizations like The British Antarctic Survey to provide internet access to very extreme of our planet.3. Heart monitoring T-shirt :-Wearable sports bands that measure your heart rate are nothing new, but as numerous studies have shown, the accuracy can vary wildly (especially if you rely on them toUsing a single lead ECG printed into the fabric, this new t-shirt from smart materials company KYMIRA will accurately measure heart beats and upload them to the cloud via Bluetooth. Once there, algorithms process the data to accurately detect irregular heartbeats such as arrhythmia heart beats, which could prove life saving.And it’s not just athletes who could benefit. “The possibilities this product offers both sportspeople and the general public is astonishing,” says Tim Brownstone, CEO and founder of KYMIRA. “We envisage developing this product to be used for clinical applications to allow those who may already suffer with heart conditions enough warning of a heart attack.”4. The AI scientist :-Cut off a flatworm’s head, and it’ll grow a new one. Cut it in half, and you’ll have two new worms. Fire some radiation at it, and it’ll repair itself. Scientists have wanted to work out the mechanisms involved for some time, but the secret has eluded them. Enter an AI coded at tufts university Massachusetts. By analyzing and simulating countless scenarios, the computer was able to solve the mystery of the flatworm’s regeneration in just 42 hours. In the end it produced a comprehensive model of how the flatworm’s genes allow it to regenerate.Although humans still need to feed the AI with information, the machine in this experiment was able to create a new, abstract theory independently –5. Cancer-detecting ‘smart needles’ :-A “smart needle” has been developed by scientists in the UK which could speed up cancer detection and diagnosis times.Researchers believe the technology could be particularly helpful in diagnosing lymphoma, reducing patient anxiety as they await their results. At present, people with suspected lymphoma often have to provide a sample of cells, followed by a biopsy of the node to be carried out for a full diagnosis, a process which can be time consuming.if you guys like my content. so , please share and upvote this…",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-trending-technology-in-2021
1,Software development technologies tie in well with the new world paradigm. Rebooting service structures and applying new approaches in the pivotal areas is going to satisfy both building and relaunching a product.

4,"For me, IoT (Internet of Things) most likely.I was shopping for an indicator light bulb for my Range Rover today and I went onto a local auto site. It only showed me the bulbs that would fit my car! That’s because I went onto that site a year ago and told them what car I have.In 2030 my car will be able to do that. Likely as soon as a bulb blows I’ll get spammed with ads for the specific replacement from everywhere in the world.Which might be good or it might be bad lol. Depends on your capacity for spam.The point is that tech in 2030 won’t be revolutionary, it’ll be evolutionary.

For some perspective, lets consider 2002 as compared to 2016. What technologies are new in 2016 as compared to 2002?My point is this: Don't expect dramatic changes in important technology in 2030 as compared to today. We will likely see the invention of improved communication and electronic storage systems. We will also likely see the implementation of at least some self-driving vehicles (aircraft and cars). Other than these, much will be the same, although it's hard to say for certain.",726 followers,Dhananjay Ravikumar,20.9K,0,0,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-trending-technology-in-2021
