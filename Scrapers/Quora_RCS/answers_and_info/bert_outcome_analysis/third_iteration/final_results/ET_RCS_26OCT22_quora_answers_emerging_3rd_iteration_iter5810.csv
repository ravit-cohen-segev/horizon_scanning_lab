He held several meetings with different people, went partying, went to the gym, met students at a university, and then started developing symptoms. He was the first recorded Covid-19 death. Since then, the country has had at least 17 confirmed cases, all linked to people who had flown into the country from Europe, Asia and the US.We just don’t have as many inbound flights to bring Covid-19, as Asian, European and American countries do. It’s one blessing in disguise I guess, but it does make air travel expensive.EDIT: Wow, thanks for the upvotes! Wasn’t expecting such a response.I have always lamented the huge cost of air travel in Africa, and the absence of strong domestic demand for flights, then when I flew for the first time from Johannesburg to Dubai, I came to appreciate just how large the continent is in relation to Europe. I also saw how Europeans travel so frequently among their countries, to the extent of even commuting by air (something unheard of in the part of the world I come from - flying is a luxury!), then I appreciated how European countries are strongly integrated economically, with all that free movement of people, and few travel restrictions, and how small the countries were in relation to African countries. So when the coronavirus hit, it spread very quickly because Europeans and Americans travel a lot by air, unlike Africans. We tend to fly only when it’s absolutely necessary.","8,509 followers",Kamal Poddar,25.4K,258,8.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-will-COVID-19-affect-emerging-technologies

No matter what you think of the President or his politics, no one wishes death on anyone, but in this case it would have long-lasting repercussions no one wants to face.The second worst thing that could happen for the country is for the President to end up with a very mild asymptomatic case.Donald Trump displays all the symptoms of an individual who suffers from Narcissistic Personality Disorder.Does Trump Suffer from Narcissistic Personality Disorder?He is unable to view the world through anyone’s perspective but his own. Empathy is not a part of his mental make-up. So if he ends up with nothing more than a harsh case of the sniffles, you can forget any possibility that he will ever be able to listen to what any of his medical experts are telling him about the danger the public health crisis poses to the country, because through his own experience, it’s no big deal. If, by chance he is reelected, and has just tested positive for COVID and does not have a rough time with it, that personal experience will dominate his instincts on all things related to the pandemic.I honestly don’t want to wish suffering on the guy, but for the good of the country, Trump needs to take a bit of a hit from this. He needs to be able to experience this in a way that will enable him to frame his personal experience in terms of exactly how serious an illness it can be, and he won’t be able to do that no matter how many spreadsheets you show him, how many graphics he looks at unless he personally experiences a serious case.The best case scenario for the country is for Donald Trump to become seriously ill with COVID and recover.",4 followers,Matthew Bates,1K,9.8K,293.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-will-COVID-19-affect-emerging-technologies
7,"There are many aspects to this question and here are some elements to consider in regards to Information Technology resources in larger businesses.First, while there are many people employed in IT, there are not that many ‘critical’ resources. These are the ones that basically keep the companies they work for running, while the rest do the ancillary work. They are typically the highest paid as well. If these resources go offline for an extended period most companies will struggle to address regular maintenance changes and high priority break-fix activities will become haphazard as those that aThere are many aspects to this question and here are some elements to consider in regards to Information Technology resources in larger businesses.First, while there are many people employed in IT, there are not that many ‘critical’ resources. These are the ones that basically keep the companies they work for running, while the rest do the ancillary work. They are typically the highest paid as well. If these resources go offline for an extended period most companies will struggle to address regular maintenance changes and high priority break-fix activities will become haphazard as those that are less skilled try to fill the gap.Second, during times of disruption, normal controls and safeguards may begin to be bypassed in order to get anything done. This will place the companies at higher risk for hacking activities, both external and internal, and astute actors who exploit vulnerable systems will be hyper active during this time looking for ways to exploit the situation. Security patches may not be tested and implemented in a timely fashion or a zero-day vulnerability may suddenly emerge and there is no ability to address the threat due to the workforce being unavailable.Third, some companies may fail. It used to be a rule of thumb that if a company lost their data and was unable to restore it within thirty days, they were going to be out of business. This was evidenced on the occasions where companies were caught off-guard by natural disasters such as hurricanes. If a company’s data repositories become compromised or there are issues with the company’s backup procedures, whether in the storage mechanics or data retrieval itself, they will be hard pressed to maintain daily operations.Fourth, management becomes a bit irrational at times during events that significantly impact the normal operations of the company. Especially the upper management, who will be extra vigilant in their attempts to protect their turf and possibly ‘pay back’ that other person for past wrongs. These activities will place companies at risk as internal politics begin to interfere with rational decision-making causing employees to become disillusioned, confused and disgruntled that they are not allowed to do their job and what is best for the company. Internal politics is a nasty creature that rears its head at times of organizational stress and if left unchecked can sideline even the largest companies. This results in lost market share, disgruntled investors, employees jumping ship and a lot of political fallout.Fifth, the job market in general is good for IT resources. As a result, ‘critical’ resources will be in even higher demand as those companies that have let their really good employees leave, will be hard pressed to deal with the emerging problems caused by a lack of qualified staff. If enough of the remaining ‘critical’ staff were to become sick with COVID-19 these companies will have no choice but to try and lure qualified resources from other companies with hefty salaries. In my experience, most corporations are very short sighted in this area. In almost every case, they do not do enough to retain their most valuable employees, thinking they don’t really need them and there are more available anytime they need them, only to find out at the worst time that this is not the case.Sixth, most companies are still reticent to allow employees to do a lot of the critical IT activities remotely. This stems from concerns over security of taking such actions over the internet, the uncertainty of how the employee will perform while away from the office and who may be present at the time the work is being completed. For example, VPN’s are not foolproof and one can never be certain there isn’t someone else looking at their screen through a window where the drapes have been left open.Seventh, even if a company is setup to allow resources to work remotely, will they have the capabilities in place to allow a high percentage of employees to work from home. Take for example the case where a quarantine suddenly goes into effect and the necessary preparations have not been completed to allow all the staff, critical to the ongoing operations of the company, to work remotely. Maybe there are not enough ports or routers available to allow remote access to a greater number of people than what the DR plan calls for. Or maybe there are not enough security devices or licenses to allow all those employees to connect all at once. The infrastructure for secure remote access is something that is not designed and installed overnight. In times of high risk, the necessary equipment may not even be available to expand the company’s remote capabilities since many of them will be trying to do the same thing at the same time, quickly depleting the pool of available technical equipment. A lot of computer equipment comes from China and if the supply chain is broken the equipment will simply not be available.Eighth, many HR departments can be slow to react to emergent risks. The SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads very rapidly leaving little time for corporate bureaucratic processes to catch up. Many HR departments will be watching how other companies HR departments deal with the Coronavirus risk and are taking a wait and see approach. They will be caught unprepared when the virus suddenly impacts their areas of operation leaving the workforce confused and unorganized as they struggle with the decision as to when they should go to work and when they should stay home. The result will be a situation where the business locations and offices will be devoid of employees due to the majority of the workforce deciding to stay home to safeguard themselves and their families. An even worse case scenario is one where a quarantine suddenly goes into effect and the necessary preparations have not been completed to allow the staff, critical to the ongoing operations of the company, to work remotely. Other factors to consider are, has the company installed enough remote connections to allow a higher percentage of employees to work from home than what the DR plan called for. Or are enough licenses in place to allow all those employees to connect all at once.These are a few of the areas where companies that are highly technology dependent may be impacted.",211 followers,Aman Goel,8.1K,523,37.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-will-COVID-19-affect-emerging-technologies
8,"To me, Neo-Socialism is merely a fruit of the subversive operations the foreign enemies of the West had been plotting at least since the 40s. “Progressivism” in its modern ugly form grew from the seeds called “McCarthyism victims” aka Stalin’s spies and/or admirers. I agree that being overfed, made it possible for a generation of whining capricious creatures to hatch.

I continued sleeping on my couch in front of my laptop with a constant stream of Netflix.For whatever reason, I decided enough was enough.On April 14th 2020, I started to diet and exercise every day.With the diet, I cut out sugar completely and consumed less than 20g of carbs per day. It was a little difficult to change my habits at first, but now it's second nature. I can't understand how everything needs to have so much sugar in it.Now, I HATE exercise. It's just never appealed to me. My health problems and connective tissue disorder make even eating a sandwich painful sometimes (because my jaw will randomly dislocate).That's why I didn't set the goal of ‘exercising.’ My one fitness goal was to make myself sweat every day.

I can sprint after a bus if I want to.My immune system seems better than ever and the same goes for my joints.

They are both morbidly obese, and I honestly thought they would never change.My dad even told me at one point (when I told him that he'll never walk me down the aisle if he continues eating like he did) “if I die, I die. I've enjoyed life and that's all there is to it.”Now he enjoys calling me to complain that all of his shorts are too big and won't stay up. If I hadn't have lost weight first, they would have never done it.I'm so proud of myself and them, for realising it’s never too late to change.Top tips?If you want to ask me ANYTHING at all or need advice, comment or send me a personal message.
