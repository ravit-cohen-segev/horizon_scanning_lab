This answer holds a lot of truth. However, it does not answer the question, which asks how the Roman legions could be defeated inRoman legionaries in battleEssentially, no funny stuff, just a straight-up pitched battle, two armies head to head, and the Romans have to be defeated somehow.First of all, the Roman legions were not invincible, even at their absolute peak of size, effectiveness, training, equipment, etc. If you pick a Roman legion from the earlier or later eras of Roman history, you will find that there were more weaknesses and that the Romans lost many, many times to contemporary enemies.With that said, I will focus this answer on the Roman legion from about 100 BCE to 200 CE. I and most modern historians consider this period the peak of the Roman legion, the time when it was most effective as a fighting force. During this time, Roman equipment was standardized, state-supplied, and always of good quality. Training was top-notch and most soldiers had years of veteran experience. Discipline was rigidly enforced, the doctrine and tactics of the army had been refined through various wars, and the legions were well-adapted to fighting in all different settings.But believe it or not, even this army was not invincible. It may have been the best army around, but it lost battles.The most famous defeat, of course, wasTeutoburg ForestHere, in the dank autumn woods of Germania, the Roman-allied German turncoat Arminius put on a master class of how to outmatch, outmaneuver, and annihilate the best of the Roman legions.A mythological depiction of Arminius, the German general who defeated RomeArminius knew that the Roman legions were nigh unbeatable on a flat plain with a good night‚Äôs rest and orderly battle dispositions. Thus, he did everything he could to change the conditions of the battle in order to have the best chance of victory.Firstly, he leveraged his position as the German adviser to the Roman army to give the Roman commander a shit ton of terrible advice. His first suggestion was to have small units of Roman soldiers live with Germans in German towns. The implication was that this would help build rapport with the German people and lessen the chance of revolt. The Romans were unaware that Arminius had already instructed all the German towns to slaughter their Roman guests after a brief period of time. This slightly weakened Roman manpower for the upcoming battle.Arminius‚Äôs second suggestion was for the Roman army to march through the Teutoburg Forest, which he claimed was a shortcut. The Romans knew no better; they trusted him, as a local, to know what he was talking about. It was also autumn and quickly becoming colder. Rains began to come in just as the Romans entered the forest, making the whole march a difficult slog.Arminius slipped away from the Roman army at some point during the march, linking up with a German army that had coordinated for an ambush in the forest. The Romans were prepared for the attacks, but only as prepared as they could be when unfamiliar with the terrain, exhausted from hard marching, and surrounded on all sides by attackers. For several days, the Romans were assailed relentlessly either on the roads or from behind the walls of their fortified camps. Their supplies were running low.When the final attack came, the Romans were unable to resist the attack and their orderly lines collapsed. They were slaughtered in their disorganized state almost to a man.The Roman last stand in the Teutoburg ForestArminius knew his soldiers were not as well-armored, not as well trained in formation fighting, not as disciplined, and bad at fighting in a unit. Thus, he changed the circumstances of the battle to ones that would be favorable to him: keeping the Romans exhausted, preventing them from sleeping at night with raids and noise, and attacking from all sides in terrible terrain to disrupt their formation. Once out of formation, the Romans stood little chance as the combat shifted from group fighting to a bunch of small-scale melee combat.Essentially, one could defeat the Romans by following this maxim:If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.‚ÄîSun Tzu,The Romans were so effective not because they were great individual fighters. I mean, they could fight, but they were also shorter and weaker on average than, say, the German warriors, and they didn‚Äôt train for single combat or disorganized melee. They fought as a unit, which generally prevailed in most circumstances and was better for organized, large-scale success in places across the Mediterranean.However, people like Arminius, who recognized Rome‚Äôs weaknesses and knew how to exploit them, could win rare victories.Another one of the legions‚Äô weaknesses wasThe PhalanxThe Romans actually fought with Greek-style phalanxes for several centuries during their early history before switching to a sword-based army that was more versatile and better served their purposes. However, the flexibility that lightly armored and loosely formed swordsmen had forced the Romans to sacrifice the punching power that the phalanx had in a frontal assault.A Macedonian phalanx in battle formation. Those spears are terrifying.Of course, the Romans found ways to counteract the phalanx, such as luring it onto uneven terrain to disrupt the formation or attacking it from the side and the rear with infantry or cavalry. The phalanx was a stiff formation, powerful but rigid and inflexible. If it fell apart, the long spears held by the hoplites became unwieldy liabilities.But in a frontal assault on level ground, the phalanx could demolish the Romans any day, so long as the powerful cavalry first assembled by the Macedonians was paired with it to exploit weaknesses in the Roman line.Although the phalanx never fought a Marian-style legion because Greece was conquered back in 146 BCE, the high Imperial legion would fare no better against the phalanx in a straight-up field battle. If a phalanx army attacked Rome during its high Imperial period and met a legionary army on a flat plain, the legionaries would get routed, plain and simple.Luckily for the Romans, their method of warmaking was far more systemic and comprehensive than mere field battles. It involved naval blockades to deny supplies, besieging of cities, co-opting of allies, and when worst came to worst, just throwing more men and armies at the enemy, simply because they could, until the enemy could not do the same. Even when the Romans were generally outmatched in field battles, as against the Macedonian phalanx, they were able to defeat Greece in war.Perhaps we should touch on the Roman legions‚Äô final great weakness, which wasCavalryCavalry-heavy armies always gave the Romans trouble. The biggest sacrifice they made with their sword-based army was a difficulty in dealing with cavalry attacks. Although they could repurpose theirParthian cavalry. The Parthians had both heavily armored cataphracts and lightly armored horse-archers, giving them the ability to quickly shift from fighting at a distance to launching piercing charges.The Roman legions at their height only faced one army primarily composed of cavalry: the Parthians. Not a coincidence: it was also these same Parthians that dealt the Romans one of their most infamous defeats at the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BCE.Upon seeing the Roman army, the Parthians retreated for half the day, never totally running away but never allowing the Romans, slower on foot, to meet them in battle. Finally, when the confrontation did come, the Parthians shot their bows at the Romans and continued to stay back, wearing the already tired Romans out.Eventually, the Romans were forced into a defensive square after attacks from all sides began to take their toll. But the Parthians took full advantage, loosing shots from all sides and forcing the Romans to stay tense behind their shields, taking abuse from both the arrows and the hot sun. By the end of the day, the stalemate had not been broken; the Romans had tried to charge several times, but of course they were too slow to catch the Parthians on horseback.The Romans ended the day exhausted and attempted to retreat. Here too, the Parthian speed and maneuverability got the better of the Romans. In their disorganized state, the Romans were caught in isolated groups by the Parthian horsemen, who moved like lightning and killed or captured thousands of them. Soon enough, nearly the whole army was made into prisoners and the Roman commander was dead.Parthian horsemen executing their famous ‚ÄúParthian shot,‚Äù an arrow fired over the shoulder during a retreatThe speed, versatility, and punching power of cavalry-heavy armies made them the kryptonite of the legions.In conclusion, my ideal army to defeat the Romans in a field battle would be the Macedonian phalanx and the Parthian cavalry all led by the crafty Arminius. The Roman legion would stand absolutely no chance.But the thing about the Romans was that they absolutely did not know when to quit. They would not stop after the loss and they would eventually win the war. Such was the hard lesson that almost all of Rome‚Äôs enemies learned.Right at the moment when their worlds were in flames.The Romans besieging a doomed city",123 followers,Ben Waggoner,1.3K,5.5K,42.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-extraterrestrial-life-is-real-wouldnt-alien-civilizations-likely-have-a-huge-head-start-on-humans-given-the-age-of-the-universe-is-many-billions-of-years-older-than-the-Earth

Since you probably ask for military, many armies had different advantages.Early Roman army fought as Hoplite with bronze armor. Meanwhile, Gauls had iron, horses and overall better organization. Result: Rome was sacked. In fact the only reason Rome survived was thanks to Geese who alarmed the Romans on time. Still, Romans had to pay heavy price to Gauls and they complained to Gauls that it was not just. Gaulic leader simply added his sword to the scale and said ‚Äúvae victis‚Äù meaning ‚Äúwoe to the vanquished‚Äù. Romans later adopted arms and armor of Gauls. In fact one specific sword Spatha, is so good it can be used as blueprint for future medieval swords.One of the greatest maritime powers of Mediterranean was Carthage. First Punic War was war over Sicily which means you need good fleet. Roman fleet at that time was non-existent. First half of the war can be summed up as Romans drowning while Carthaginians are laughing at them. Based on pure luck, Romans salvaged one Phoenician ship and used it as blueprint. They added Corvus which is a bridge with fangs so that Romans can fight land battles on sea. Still, what good is Corvus if your maritime skills are horrible? In one instance, chickens refused to eat grain which was terrible omen. Romans threw them out in the water and decided to fight anyway. However they got stuck in a storm, Carthaginians retreated and won the battle without firing an arrow. The amount of this Roman naval blunders almost looks like Looney Tunes cartoon. Romans ultimately won, because Carthaginian elite hated winning war. Hammlar Barca, who was close to victory, made his two sons take oath to forever be enemies of Rome. If that wasn‚Äôt enough, when Vandals took over Africa and made Carthage their capital, they have immediately defeated Roman fleet at Cape Bon proving Romans haven‚Äôt learned their lesson 600 years later.Dacians had interesting swords. One was Falx and the other was Sica. Those two swords gave Romans headache (literally) when they were at their peak. It took multiple invasions to defeat Dacians. This swords ripped right trough the armor. Many Romans had their head cracked open or had their arms skinned. I don‚Äôt think Romans ever had any similar weapon in their 2000 years of history. Why they never adopted these swords in their army for their shock troops is something I will never understand.However let‚Äôs look at real problem called cavalry. Actually let‚Äôs ask better question: What Roman cavalry? You see, Manipular Legion is army that made the Empire. Serving army was requirement and you had to pay for your equipment. That means your position in army depended on your wealth. With that in mind, how many citizens could buy a horse and how many of them were willing to risk losing it in battle? Result was that Manipular army was flexible, but not mobile. Equites were rich citizens, but they soon became synonym with cavalry because only they could afford horse. Marian army and Imperial army will make things even worse. Specifically, cavalry will be reserved for mercenaries. Why is that problem? The worst defeats Romans have suffered in their history were precisely because they lacked proper cavalry. I am referring to Teutoburg forest. It was Germanic cavalry that signaled the ambush. After first assault, Roman army was wondering in the dark. Since they were all heavy infantry walking in swamp, it was nightmare to travel. Archeological site of battle is very interesting since equipment and even coins were left behind meaning the battle was complete chaos for Romans. Keep in mind Imperial Legionnare is unstoppable force while in formation. Fast Germanic cavalry prevented this.To illustrate further, Caesar used Gallic cavalry during his campaign in Gallia. When Vercigentorix rebelled he recruited Germanic one. Gauls even used chariots. Not big bulky chariots with pikes on the side. This chariots were small, agile and had loud and unpleasant sound when turning around. This is the real reason why Caesar retreated from Britannia.Now I saved the best for the last. Romans finally found their match in Persia. Actually, if we don‚Äôt count Turks who dealt the final blow, Persians were the toughest enemy Romans ever faced. Persians understood understood how Romans think and how to manipulate them. The worst humiliations to Rome were caused by Persians. Many Eagles were lost to the Persians which they used to mock and insult them and they really knew how to do it. Battle of Carrhae was one such humiliating defeat. Roman army was destroyed without any significant fight. Persians showered them with arrows. Since they were on foot and in armor, they were too slow for Persian Cataprachts and mounted archers. According to Plutarch, Crassus mouth was filled with molten gold (poetic justice) and one unfortunate soldier was forced to present himself as Crassus and was on a ‚Äútriumph‚Äù around Persia in a company of concubines. If you think Crassus was incompetent, keep in mind Marcus Antonius tried to avenge that defeat and failed by losing even more eagles.Parthian Persians didn‚Äôt want to fight aggressive war, but Sassanid Persians had different idea. They were more organized and aggressive and knew how to fight Romans. By that time, Romans finally reformed their army and used actual cavalry with actual combined arms. They still lacked mounted archers, although Belisarius recruited Huns for Gothic Wars.Byzantine army to my knowledge didn‚Äôt lack anything specific. If anything, Arabs, Bulgars, Latins and other lacked Byzantine weapons, technology and tactics. Alas, it was politics that destroyed Byzantine Empire by inviting Latins to the Near East.","33,159 followers",Susanna Viljanen,560,10.7K,164.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-extraterrestrial-life-is-real-wouldnt-alien-civilizations-likely-have-a-huge-head-start-on-humans-given-the-age-of-the-universe-is-many-billions-of-years-older-than-the-Earth

23,"That is a strange way to phrase this question. To answer frankly he hasn't. God has created everything and every law of physics is by his design. However he created us for so many things with many talents. Some of those are exploration and discovery. Science help us to explore and discovery our world and universe in new and interesting ways. He created the physics we just have to find, understand, and use what he created. However the primary purpose of our creation was worship and we do that by using the scientific or other gifts he gave us.",96 followers,Shiv Sharma,43.7K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Who-is-Gen-Z-on-TikTok

Christian Science became the fastest growing religion in the United States, with nearly 270,000 members by 1936, a figure that had declined by 1990 to just over 100,000. The church is known for its newspaper, the Christian Science Monitor, which won seven Pulitzer Prizes between 1950 and 2002, and for its public Reading Rooms around the world.Eddy described Christian Science as a return to ""primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing"". There are key differences between Christian Science theology and that of other branches of Christianity. In particular, adherents subscribe to a radical form of philosophical idealism, believing that reality is purely spiritual and the material world an illusion. This includes the view that disease is a mental error rather than physical disorder, and thatThe church does not require that Christian Scientists avoid all medical care‚Äîadherents use dentists, optometrists, obstetricians, physicians for broken bones, and vaccination when required by law‚Äîbut maintains that Christian-Science prayer is most effective when not combined with medicine.So Christian Science seems neither very Christian nor very scientific.
