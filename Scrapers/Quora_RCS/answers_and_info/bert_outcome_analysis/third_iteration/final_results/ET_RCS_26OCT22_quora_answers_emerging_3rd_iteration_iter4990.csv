Human doctors were continuously failing to diagnose patients with multiple illnesses as they over-focused on only one of them. And most of the models were simple enough to be represented by a straightforward yes/no checklist so they could be directly used by the doctors at least as a sort of decision making support.Of course, the doctors did NOT use the models as they refused to believe the decision making could be that simple and that diagnosing can not be done without intuition. They were correct, the models were far from perfect, but still better than most general practitioners. I do not remember exactly how did the patients accept the models but as those were the days before Google, I doubt the massive self-diagnosing was popular yet.As with chess, AI will definitely outperform doctors soon and is outperforming them at the moment in many tasks. But general acceptance and use will be much higher hurdle to jump, and strong resistance from the professional community is probable. And seeing anti-vaccine movement today, I am sure the “anti-AI” movements will soon become popular with the patients, too.In the long term, I believe AI diagnosing will be as common in the hospitals as an ultrasound, but the doctors will still be running the show. Not only the examination is still manual to some extent but the patients will probably always prefer a human to work with them.

I don't know about other dept but on many diseases in Pediatric this is one of the very important criteria for getting alarmed. How can AI, identify it I don't know.3)Medicine is not maths or physics where you will have discrete answers. You will have to apply your brain and anticipate things. Many times especially in ICU doctors can anticipate things and work accordingly. E.g a child having gasping type respiration needs to be intubated whatever his ABG is. Since AI relies more on values, I think they will miss many such things.4)A doctor has to not only deal with patient but their attendants also. He has to make them understand in simple language and councel them. It's not a Google form where you have to tick I accept and everything will be fine.5)Even in OPD you will find many patients of gastritis, diffuse body ache etc in which there is no proper history.

He doesn't speak to me and is probably terrified of doctors.Even before anyone has spoken anything to me I see what the problem they've come to me for. His right eye is more prominent than the left. A few hundred calculations are going on in my head and I arrive at a set of differential diagnoses. I've got to narrow down the list of diagnoses by patient history and clinical examination.The mother seems distressed while she's narrating the history. I have to wean the information that I want from the random set of sentences in no particular order that she's putting out at me. She gets more upset as she progresses with the story of her child finally requiring the father to clarify a few of my doubts about the history.I examine the child armed with my list of possible diagnoses, his age and the history. I can quickly diagnose the problem as I palpate an orbital (eye socket) mass just behind the eyeball. The little boy is scared stiff at what I'm doing and tries to protest feebly with whimpering. I manage to wrestle with the kid and get done with the examination with minimal difficulties. I believe the diagnosis is a dermoid cyst - a congenital benign tumour which is easy to manage. The CT scan and the radiologist will later confirm my diagnosis.I tell the parents about the diagnosis and that it will have to be confirmed with a CT scan and also to know the extent. I tell them that this will require surgery and go through the salient features of the surgery, the pros and cons, risks and complications, etc. I sense that both are getting horrified by the minute, so I now choose to focus on the good parts- like the prognosis of this tumour is excellent!, etc. The mother finally blurts out, ""But he is just a child! How can he have surgery. He's so small!"" and she starts crying. I stop and give her a tissue while I try to reassure her. She grabs at my hand and holds it tight asking ""Is this serious, doctor?"" I say ""Not at all. This is one of the less difficult things I encounter in my job"". I really meant it!I now look at the father and wonder what's going on his mind since he's hardly said anything since he's come into the clinic. Maybe he's considering taking a second opinion or maybe I'm already the fourth doctor who is saying the same thing. Or he's thinking how much it will cost him and whether his company’s medical insurance will cover the surgery for this congenital tumour? Or he's just as stressed as his wife but doesn't know how to show it.I speak a little more going over the essentials, ordering the imaging and blood investigations while answering any questions the father has. This whole encounter has lasted 20 mins with lots of patients waiting for me after this. I need to switch off and turn my complete attention to my next patient.The surgery.This is a straightforward surgery. I've done this lots of times- remove a dermoid cyst from an Orbit. The child is under anaesthesia and I'm pondering the best approach with the minimal scars. I choose the eyelid crease incision where the resulting scar is hidden under the eyelid crease. It will be like no surgery ever happened once the incision wound heals. I dissect out the tissues-skin, muscle and bone to expose the tumour. I have to be careful and meticulous as a ruptured dermoid cyst is a messy affair. Just then a vessel bursts at the corner of the wound and is bleeding profusely. I try various methods but it just doesn't stop. I finally manage to stop the bleeding by ligating the artery supplying that part. Weird anatomy this kid has I think to myself-one more to my experience book. The tumour still needed to be removed. I work carefully around the capsule of the tumour being very careful not to let it tear. After what seemed like an eternity, I get the tumour out with it’s capsule still intact. A surge of satisfaction runs through my whole body- it is like I've been injected with opioids. This burst of endorphins would only be understood by a surgeon who has had many ruptured dermoid cysts. The surgery lasted a little over an hour.I close up the wound meticulously in layers and wait for the Anaesthesist to reverse the anaesthesia. I meet the parents on my way out. I reassure them that all went according to plan even though there was slightly more bleeding than I expected. They seemed relieved that it was all over. I get home but this boy is not far from my mind while I'm internally celebrating a surgery gone well. Though everything seems alright, I do worry till I have seen the child the next day.The follow upNext week, that 7 year old terrified boy comes running into the clinic with a ball in hand and his parents in tow. He doesn't seem to be intimidated by me now and we had a tough time to make him sit for the examination. The tumour was gone and the swelling in it's stead had almost completely disappeared. His mother fussed about every little thing that happened to her kid since the surgery. I cut her short and asked a few leading questions which was answered by the father when he saw that the mother wasn't interested in giving me the answers I wanted and would rather tell what she wanted to tell me. I then reassured both of them, answered as many questions as I could and called the boy for review after one month while I did a lap of victory in my mind- small battles, big victories. This whole consultation lasted about 15 mins.If any robot with artificial intelligence can automate the above process in the same amount of time, I would gladly give up my job without batting an eyelid. This example mind you was a very simple case with a very excellent prognosis. This get messy when it is not so.Fortunately for me and my other doctor friends- much to the chagrin of the naysayers, AI is nowhere close to replicating human empathy and at making those 50-50 judgement calls without depending on any data points. How to zone in on the correct information points from a random rambling of a parent? How to sense the sense of dread in a patient or among his near and dear ones? How to convince them to go ahead with surgery while also educating them about what the surgery entails-success, chances of failure, complications and risks. How to make them see the cost benefit ratio of a treatment while allowing for reasonable requests by them to depart from the regular protocol? How to make the ethical calls that doctors need to make everyday. How to know anatomy of the body but to make peace with the fact that each surgery is different and that surgery can never be made an assembly line job to be automated. How to do the hand-holding of the patient when something goes off-script and the patient is distressed. How do you empathize and console the patient when the prognosis is bad? The actual surgical procedures in contrast seems like the easiest part of my job.True, today’s AI tech is already doing incredible work. Some medical fields like dermatology, radiology, pathology may be threatened in the near future. Even complex fields like internal medicine and medical oncology is getting lot of inputs from AIs.Of course I need to emphasize that I'm not arguing that never in the future will AI robots replace the jobs doctors do. I'm just saying the AI robots will be complementary to human doctors and won't be a zero-sum game for a long time to come. AIs will help us reduce our mistakes, decrease our workload, make us work more sane hours and in turn manage our work-life balance- but at least in the foreseeable future they aren't going to replace us. Maybe it will lead to lot of us doing less mundane, repetitive jobs and with doctors doing much higher intellectual level work.Not just doctors. Any field which involves human interactions and personal trust cannot get by without the human touch. Before physicians and surgeons are taken over by AI , many professions like law, accountancy, engineering and teaching will take the boot first.The shift, if at all it happens is going to be a very slow one. If in the event of AI finally taking over the medical profession, there will be enough time for doctors to adapt to the new paradigm.Doctors will find other things to do or probably take on a less stressful job!","11,420 followers",Madan S Shekhawat,8.9K,3.4K,89.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-big-step-in-TV-technology-after-OLED

The standardInteresting question.I am a physician-scientist and work with physicians and scientists and we discuss this question a lot. First, I’m surprised that most doctors that I have spoken to still don’t understand AI. They think it just means really fast computers. They are already accustomed to electronic medical records and that the computer interface prompts them with lots of questions. They are frustrated enough that these questions often don’t advance the cause of diagnosis or patient management and they see computers as more of an obstacle to patient care (and a boon to billing). The standard answer by almost all physicians, is that computers can’t replace them either because AI can’t capture all the nuances of the diagnostic process or that computers can’t administer the kindness and compassion that the doctor provides. The latter issue is ironic insofar as we, as doctors, have been losing ground in providing tender loving care, to new technologies. Unfortunately, a lot of the human warmth and compassion has been off-shifted to nurses and techs. Labs, MRIs and electronic medical records, all too often, get between the physician and his patients. Some of my trainees have to be reminded to look up from the computer to make eye contact with our patients.But this Quora question asks about how well doctors understand AI. And frankly, most of my colleagues don’t. They say things like, “But we doctors will be writing the algorithms.” or “Doctors will always be needed to interpret what the computers find.” How naive. I have found it difficult to explain that, on the simplest levels, the algorithm that is inputted relates to programming the way machine learning works. AI takes over and teaches itself. AI, therefore, will not do things, think, or make decisions the way we, as doctors, would, and it’s much more than an issue of speed. Hence, diagnostics will be fundamentally different. In some ways worse, in other ways better. But very different.As an example, consider a project we’ve recently done in cooperation with Google. We asked leading experts, “Is there a difference in the appearance of the retina between men and women?” Ophthalmologists answered unanimously, “No.” Then hundreds of thousands of images of the back of the eye were provided to image-analyzing computers together with the notation as to which were from men and which from women. This was used as a “training set”. Using a neural network system of learning, the AI system was asked to consider new images from men and women and correctly assign gender. After several iterations, it got really good at that. So now, AI could do what humans could never do.How did AI do this? We don’t know. We can’t just ask the computer what it was thinking. We can’t dissect the program because there is no underlying logic. But we can “interrogate” it. This is done by masking portions of the image. And it turns out, the AI did well when the mask blocked any part of the retina except for in the very central retina, an area call the fovea. So from this we know that information about the appearance of the fovea is critical and necessary. But we still can’t ask the AI how it did it. And we, as ophthalmologists, even knowing it’s all about the fovea, still can’t see any differences between the retinas from men and women. This is both frustrating and amazing. It’s frustrating, since this AI research has not really revealed new scientific truths about gender and foveas. But it’s amazing, since for the first time, computers, so good at image recognition, can accurately identify gender from retinas alone. Imagine what else is hidden from our view, but available to AI to recognize.So it will be with medical diagnoses. With enough data, especially information-rich data sets like images, computers will correctly put people into bins based not only on diagnosis, but on those most likely to benefit from specific therapies. This will be image recognition, not human-like “thinking”. This is entirely different from what doctors presently do. There will be less understanding, less insight, less logic and less elegance. But AI is likely to be more effective and certainly faster and more efficient at diagnosing and managing most patients. The first medical fields to go will probably be those with data-rich images (like radiology, ophthalmology and pathology). My system of hypothesis-testing as a diagnostic approach in neuro-ophthalmology (I went to MIT and we were always being reminded, “garbage in, garbage out” so it’s become a mantra for fifty years. It’s different now. One man’s trash is another computer’s treasure.","6,606 followers",Laszlo B.

Sucking energy very quickly out of a battery causes heat and other effects which can cause parts of the battery to expand. Lead acid cells are pretty simple and rugged devices. In comparison, Lithium batteries are not. You don’t want batteries exploding because you are sucking too much energy out of them too quickly.These issues are pretty much unique for batteries designed for car starter motors.
