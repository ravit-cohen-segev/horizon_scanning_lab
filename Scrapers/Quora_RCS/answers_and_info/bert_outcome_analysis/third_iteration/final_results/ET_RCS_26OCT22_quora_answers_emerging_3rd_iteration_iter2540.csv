It was more than their average criminal activities of drugs, theft, stolen properties, car rings, money laundering, etc I knew there was something else that this gang stalking circle were hiding, something big. So trying to figure it out, I started analysing things.. 2014, during a holiday period I was on the phone talking and I just happen to see a young girl at the end of my complex pretty much half dressed. The main gang stalking group, lived in the same complex as me, which made it so easy for them to target me. So I’m watching this young girl from my kitchen window who looked like she was round 16/17 years of age, what struck me was she had no shoes on, her top looked like it had been ripped off, she was wearing her handbag, and she looked very disoriented. Like she didn’t know where she was, definitely not local, and she just didn’t know where to go. I had hoped she would have walked up to my end so I could be of some assistant to her but she walked the other direction. It was an image I’ve forgotten. About 6 months after that, I would see more young girls literally running up the complex in bare feet, crying some with their bags some not, like they waited until the coast was clear and ran for it. Again they seemed to be around the ages of 15,16,17. The cars from the gang stalking group would hunt the girls driving up slowly in the complex looking for them and circling the block. Roughly about 4 weeks later, I see this work type van that had no windows on the sides, looked like it had been painted over, one of those vans were you know that it wasn’t original. There were two males in the van, and they decided to stop and park smack middle of the complex blocking everyone’s access in or out. The male passenger gets out and opens the door of the van, and omg.. Here are all these females squashed inside this van, who were dressed up like they were going to a place of where you needed to be dressed up , the youngest I’d say probably 13 or 14 years of age the older one 18 to 20 approximately 15–16 girls inside this van on a Sunday afternoon at 2:19pm my first thought wasWhere are those girls going dressed like that makeupMy gut told me that whole situation?The way the men were acting was suspicious, not wanting anyone to see the girls, yet one of them opens up the sliding door so of course people will see. Then it dawned on me after that van left. OMG.. The gang stalking group are intoI believe that every gang stalking group world wide has something bigger to hide which is why, only selected people are chosen as targeted individuals. Because we are major threats to gang stalking groups, the harassment never stops unless we take our own lives or murdered. The key is to survive, and expose gang stalkers for who and what they do.God bless","68,793 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-long-has-gangstalking-been-around-Doesn-t-it-require-advanced-technology

Whatever is out there.Sadly it can be seen as a foot in the door of acceptance for social climbers who want to be part of the incrowd.The use or abuse of people power is what keeps the gangstalk empire afloat and lack of it is what will cause it to wither and die.Remember Hitler? Without others willing to follow his insane will he couldn’t have done anything on his own. Imagine if there had been no Hitler and no Nazies.Because gangstalking is mostly unidentifiable except to those they seek to destroy or those they tag team with, they perhaps feel untraceable. Big mistake.Nobody hides anything from God. People from the church are supposed to know this aren’t they? So how can it be thought it is ok to have a foot in both camps?Gangstalking is un-Christian, immoral, inhumane and illegal. Not pleasing at all really to a GOD of LOVE.Every person has the power to stop it. To drain off it’s effectiveness people need to stop letting themselves be used by it. They will be freeing themselves and the generations to come.Do something good today and don’t stalk anybody.

Smaller cities have buses available that will take you just about everywhere within the city and bigger cities have subways as well as buses. For going between cities and provinces, China has a high speed rail system in place that is more extensive than the American highway system! For example: I lived in a city called Nanjing in China - about 200 miles/300 km from Shanghai. I could take a high speed train from Nanjing to Shanghai in about 1.5 hours!In contrast, I took an Amtrak train from Detroit to Chicago (about 300 miles/480 km) and it took over 8 hours!Another area China wins at is public utilities. They provide electricity, water, and gas for billions of people for very affordable prices! I paid maybe a total of $20 (US) per month for all utility bills, whereas it cost me over $100 in America!

Don't always think naively that China can challenge and confront the US. That is to beat stone withCompared with hard power, the US leads China in almost every aspect. China will never surpass the United States in the next few decades or even a hundred years. Yes, this is what I said, a Chinese, who is regarded by many as an evil Communist Party.I say this not only to Americans but also to China. Don't always think naively that China can challenge and confront the US. That is to beat stone with eggs.I. How powerful is the US?From the political, economic, scientific and technological, military, cultural, diplomatic, and other aspects. China can't compete with the United States in any aspect.A. The US political powerThe US election is the most concerned political event in the world. Any American president who takes office will influence the direction of the world.For example, Trump, an “incredible“man who could not be found for hundreds of years, became the president of the United States. If he is in other fields, it may not have any influence. But he is now the president of the United States. His words can greatly affect people all over the world. For example, he said that COVID-19 pneumonia can disappear on its own, that children can avoid COVID-19 pneumonia, and that the United States controls it well. Even many important figures in the Republican Party did not support Trump's re-election. Because the disaster he brought to the world may be worse than COVID-19 pneumonia.But it is not that he is terrible, but that the global leadership of the United States is terrible!If he is the leader of a very underdeveloped country, I don't think most newspapers will even report it.B. The strength of the US economyThe strength of the US economy can be seen all over the world. The United States has not only influence but control over the global economy! The dollar, which is smaller than the mobile phone, is the most powerful weapon of the United States, not the US aircraft carrier or the US Marine Corps.C. The US science and technologyThe US stands at the forefront of science and technology in the world. Most of the high technology in the world is in the hands of Americans or American laboratories. For example, today's China is developing its aerospace industry, which is an achievement that attracts worldwide attention. However, we all know that compared with the United States, we are inferior to the United States and the former Soviet Union at the beginning of the Cold War.But I think Leonard's genius is that a nerd can have a girlfriend like Penny.D. The US militaryThe US military ranks first in the world, and I believe no one will refute me. The U.S. government has made deep research and practice on maintaining the combat effectiveness of the military, leading military science and technology, military theory, and military treatment.The largest conventional aircraft carrier in the world is the Kitty Hawk of the US Navy. This aircraft carrier has participated in many foreign operations of the US military. Regardless of her glorious history, technically speaking, which country can produce it now? This is an aircraft carrier produced by the United States in 1960.The United States Marine Corps, the firm executor of the national will of the United States, can basically defeat other countries with only one US Marine Corps. The US Marine Corps is not just a bunch of crayon-eating psychopaths. They have the most systematic, scientific, and arduous training, the most efficient and advanced military theory, and the most advanced weapons and equipment.I don't think any country in the world would be stupid enough to challenge the United States militarily.5 steps to reshape the US military: Glean, Engage, Focus, Incentivize, and Share.The Kitty Hawk of the US NavyE. The US cultureAmerican culture is an important manifestation of American soft power. Almost everyone on earth knows Hollywood, and even some people may not know where the capital of the United States is, but they must have heard of Titanic and Rambo, an American hero who can beat hundreds of people by himself. Most written works in the world are written and recorded in English. American music is basically the trend. The American brand is basically the guarantee of quality. It can be said that where there are people, there will be American cultural influence, except for newborns in hospitals.TitanicRamboII. What are the advantages of China?China's greatest advantage is the people. This may be something that Americans can't surpass for years.From the military point of view, the PLA under the leadership of the Communist Party of China has no advantage in weapons and equipment. But the People's Liberation Army has accomplished every military operation task brilliantly. Because Chairman Mao said: ""The decisive factor in war is people, not weapons and equipment."" Is it true that China respects the US military because the US military has the most powerful weapons and equipment? No, it is because the extraordinary courage displayed by the US military on the battlefield deserves China's respect.Let me show you a couple of the examples that the power of people:A. What has the Communist Party of China done in the history of being regarded as a communist devil by the West?The first National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held secretly in this boat, Shanghai on July 23, 1921. The meeting was attended by only 12 people, announcing the founding of the Communist Party of China. Today, China has 90 million Party members.Under the military attack of the Kuomintang, the army led by the Communist Party was forced to move. The journey is more than 20,000 miles, also known as the 25,000-mile Long March. During the journey, it has traveled 25,000 miles through 11 provinces, 18 mountains, 24 rivers, deserted grassland, and rolling snow-capped mountains.After the Long March, there were only 30,000 Communist troops.In 1932, he was commissioned by the CPC Central Committee to organize the Anti-Japanese Coalition Forces in Northeast China and served as the commander and political commissar of the Anti-Japanese Coalition Forces. He led the soldiers and civilians to fight bloody battles with the Japanese aggressors in the northeast. In the extremely cold environment, under the emergency of running out of ammunition, he finally fought alone with a large number of Japanese aggressors for a few days and nights and died heroically. When the Japanese army caught him, they cut open his stomach and found that there were only bark and cotton in his stomach. He kept fighting by eating these. At that time, the Japanese army stood up and saluted, because Yang Jingyu was a very respectable fighting hero of Communist Party members.The Liberation War was a war waged by the Chinese People's Liberation Army under the leadership of the Communist Party of China from June 1946 to September 1949 to overthrow the Kuomintang rule and liberate the whole of China. It is a decisive battle concerning China's future and destiny. On October 1, 1949, the People's Republic of China was proclaimed in Beijing on the way of PLA marching to the whole country. In 1951, the PLA completed the task of liberating the mainland and offshore islands and the Communist Party of China unified the Chinese mainland.The Communist Party of China has done a lot of things. She made China independent, and at the same time, she led the Chinese people to work hard to build the motherland. These examples are to say that a political party that is extremely poor can lead the people to today. It doesn't matter whether she is evil or not. We trust this party, even she is evil.Many overseas Chinese are constantly discrediting the Communist Party. It doesn't matter. More than one billion Chinese people now support the Communist Party of China. Is this party good or bad? If the Communist Party is really an extremely evil party, how can it monitor and control 1.4 billion Chinese people?Is it because China is really sinful that it keeps smearing China? Or something else?B. What are the strange characteristics of the Chinese people?Chinese people's character comes from Chinese culture. It is not deep to get in touch with the Chinese without understanding the Chinese character.1. Attach great importance to educationChina's college entrance examination is the exam with the largest number of participants in the world. The history of examinations in China has exceeded 1400 years. The examination is an important way for Chinese emperors to select officials from civilians. Today's Chinese college entrance examination is an exam that determines the fate of students. No matter you are rich or poor, you must pass the college entrance examination before you can enter the university. In China, every family and every Chinese regard education as a way to change their own destiny. Therefore, every Chinese family will spend a lot of money on their children's education.Every year in the college entrance examination in June, all cars in China will not whistle, so it is necessary to create a quiet environment for the candidatesParents waiting anxiously outside the examination roomExamination in ancient China. In the highest examinations in ancient China, the invigilator was the emperor. At the same time, any candidate who tries to cheat will be decapitated immediately once he is found.2. Chinese people especially like farmingChina's geographical environment determines that the people here will make a living by farming. Until today, as long as Chinese people see a good piece of land, they will not plant flowers, but grow vegetables.The picture above shows Chinese people growing vegetables in the Antarctic scientific research stations, deserts, university campuses, and space.3. Chinese people love saving money and grainWhen Americans were suffering from pneumonia in COVID-19, many people took to the streets. In fact, it is not necessarily opposed to wearing masks, but Americans do not have the habit of saving money. If the United States does not resume its economic activities, the American people will be unable to live because they have no jobs. But at the request of the Communist Party of China, 1.4 billion people stayed at home. Chinese people can stay at home for two months without going to the str...",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,12.7K,996,156M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-long-has-gangstalking-been-around-Doesn-t-it-require-advanced-technology

STEM fields.","23,887 followers",Robin Daverman,11.8K,2.3K,40.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-has-China-advanced-technologically-to-the-same-level-as-the-US-and-Europe-when-a-hundred-years-ago-China-was-so-much-less-advanced

Manufacturing is often dirty, lowly paid, requires long shifts, is thankless and mindless. Americas still wanted a living wage and a living wage in China is a lot lot less than in the USA. With money to be made in China over 4500 American companies set up in China and another 250,000+ from other nations did the same.Those corporations made a fortune and they continue to do so and China rose up the wealth ladder faster than any other nation.China also has another massive advantage and that is that they are ruled by a body that isn’t voted in but that rather are selected based on merit. This allows them to make very rapid decisions that will be implemented very quickly. In the Western democracies there can be numerous agencies, individuals, government oversight committees, etc., etc. that have a right to comment and delay implementation and as you can imagine nations that have to go through these torturous procedures will and do fall behind when you have a nation like China ready, competent, and driven to grow that is leaving the rest of us in their wake.Please watch these and weep for what we seem incapable of doing that China never stops doing.A short stretch of the Karakoram Highway.One of the three guys from Top Gear. His very last sentence says a lot!The fastest train in the world that can do 400 MPH (640 kph).This is from one of the older ‘slow’ trains from 2 years ago.The highest building in the US is the One World Trade Centre reaching 386.8 metres (8th highest in the world). The tallest in China is the Shanghai Tower which reaches 632 metres which comes in at 2nd tallest behind Burj Khalifa.Why can’t the rest of the world do what China can do? I believe our transport infrastructure in Elizabethan in nature and utterly humiliating.","68,793 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,514,17.3K,413.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-has-China-advanced-technologically-to-the-same-level-as-the-US-and-Europe-when-a-hundred-years-ago-China-was-so-much-less-advanced
16,"How advanced are Chinese speed trains?The Chinese high-speed rails have a quality all on its own, because it’s so massive. There are more than twice as many high-speed trains in China as the rest of the world combined. The picture below is an early morning photo at the train station of a second-tier city in China.Tier 1 cities like Beijing have a couple hundred high-speed trains stopping at the city every day.And the Chinese Spring Festival is just a mad house - an estimated 3 billion person/trips take place within a 2-week window.

17,"There is no plan. China is doing its best to increase the well being of its people. To do that it is educating and training its people to the best of their educational systems abilities. If they have better trained and better educated people, those people will contribute more to China’s economy. If, as a consequence of trying to to what is best for its population, they surge ahead of us in technology and other areas, then perhaps we should adopt some of China’s ideas and efforts to properly training and educating all of their people.Oh wait!!

18,"No, not same level now yet, far from that.China developed a lot in recent decades, but still long way to go.GDP is what China focused on in the last 40 years development, even so, the GDP per capita is only 1/6 as US and Europe. The government is not that stupid to think we are in the same level as US and EU, neither the elites, maybe only a small group of nationalist would think that way.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-has-China-advanced-technologically-to-the-same-level-as-the-US-and-Europe-when-a-hundred-years-ago-China-was-so-much-less-advanced

I can’t think of a single series (granted, I haven’t watched all of them!) where majority of the bots used melee weapons as their primary - or even only - weapons. Sure, some prefer to be up, close and personal, but more often than not, melee is saved for duels (like the ones between Optimus and Megatron) or for other special situations.

Even though at least G1 seemed to show characters taking cover behind some rocks every now and then, plus trying to maintain at least a little bit of distance between each other, there are many other shows where the bots and the cons shoot at each other from a pretty close range.Like others have said, people working on the shows want to make it look cool and interesting, and I can respect that. It’s entertainment, not a war documentary.
