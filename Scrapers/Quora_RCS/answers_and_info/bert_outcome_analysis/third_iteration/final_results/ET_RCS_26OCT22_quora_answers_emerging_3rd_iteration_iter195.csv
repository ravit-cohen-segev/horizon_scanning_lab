0,The math competition that is most prominent in these elite schools is typically the Math olympiad. MIT has one of the highest acceptance rates for students who compete in the olympiad.You can apply by taking the AMC 10 or 12 depending on what grade you are in. When after you take this test you must qualify for the AIME test by getting a high enough score. The AIME test determines if you're eligible to compete in the olympiad.Let me just tell you though that it is really difficult to qualify even if you are the smartest math student in your high school.,0 followers,Caleb Nastasi,579,87,290.4K,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-math-competition-that-an-international-high-school-student-in-the-US-can-take-I-want-to-attend-some-state-or-national-math-contest-as-they-will-help-me-to-increase-my-chance-to-enroll-to-MIT-or-other-top
1,"What is your source for this belief? While it may be somewhat true, the fact is that admission to one of America’s top-ranked universities is based on a diverse set of accomplishments, and performing well in a mathematics exam just helps you in only one fairly narrow area. As an interviewer for MIT (a volunteer activity performed by MIT alums), my advice would be to instead use your time to become more well-rounded, to find your passion in life, and to find some task that is both in line with your passion and is beneficial to society, and see how far you can go with it.

The world teems with challenges in the most basic areas of human existence; getting sufficient, clean water; dealing with waste water, providing sufficient food for everyone, providing affordable and reliable electricity and communication to remote areas, and offering these services in a way that is self-sustaining and locally scalable. Just keeping life-saving medications cold is a major challenge in some parts of the world. Inventing new, innovative, simple, affordable, and effective solutions to these types of problems is, I believe, well within the capabilities of well-educated and highly-motivated young people, and would be a lot more valuable on an application to any university.In other words, if you want to become an engineer, build something now. Even if you fail, you will learn valuable lessons that will serve you well later on. If you want to become a scientist, do some research and run experiments now. Do something real.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,21.5K,996,155.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-math-competition-that-an-international-high-school-student-in-the-US-can-take-I-want-to-attend-some-state-or-national-math-contest-as-they-will-help-me-to-increase-my-chance-to-enroll-to-MIT-or-other-top
2,"I don’t actually know about the competitions because I am an international student, but I am currently submitting my college applications and I think it’s worth it to give you the advice my Team has given me: don’t do anything just because it may look good on your resumé. Whatever you do, do it because you feel passionate about it, not because prep scholar told you you had to.When you do things passionately, it will show and shine in your application and an admissions rep may like that passion and that would augment your chances of admission. If you do things in an utilitarian way (like I feelI don’t actually know about the competitions because I am an international student, but I am currently submitting my college applications and I think it’s worth it to give you the advice my Team has given me: don’t do anything just because it may look good on your resumé.

3,"The Milkós Schweitzer Competition in Hungary is definitely more difficult than IMO and Putnam Exams.The problems are often recently proven theorems, and the proofs are so difficult that contestants are given 10 days to solve the problems, as well as resource books and other materials.

5,"I disagree with that statement. There are a lot of talented people that aren’t doing what they love because people are the ones who sabotage them.I have no idea if Google is doing that what you claim here.

6,"Its is not the role of an employer to screen for people who like to do what they are being hired for. It is the the candidate who has to apply to jobs the love to do. . Employers are looking for people who have the talent and skill to do what the job entails. That means they have to be productive.

7,"I’d say that most Googlers are happy with the current hiring criteria.I’ve worked at Google, and I’ve interviewed a lot of candidates while I was there.Some were hired, some were rejected, and it’s practically impossible for one interviewer to skew the results.Google doesTheyI’d say that most Googlers are happy with the current hiring criteria.I’ve worked at Google, and I’ve interviewed a lot of candidates while I was there.Some were hired, some were rejected, and it’s practically impossible for one interviewer to skew the results.Google doesTheyThey kind of do not care what school you graduated from, as long as you have those qualities, and the quality they call “Googleyness”, which has to do with culture fit.It’s not true to say “they only hire the best”.I know several people who I would consider at the top of the industry who would likely not pass a strictly technical interview at Google. They are the best, and they would not get hired … if they were being hired for purely technical positions.I also know several people who are working at Google who would not pass a technical interview — but are there because they founded a company, executed on it brilliantly, and created something of great value.Google bought their company; now they work at Google.You ask:But how is that diverse? How does that help people who dont arent born with high IQs or intelligence?It’s not diverse.It’s not intended to be.In the future, all work is going to be done by people capable of doing the work.Now ask yourself — even if you consider yourself below average IQ — if you hire someone to do a job, and they are not capable of doing the job, will the job get done?No, it will not.What, then, is the purpose of hiring these people? They add no value.If the intent is to provide a “social safety net”, isn’t that actually one of the reasons “governments are instituted among men”?Right now, society — at least, Western society — is on the cusp ofOn our way past that point in human history, we’ve arrived at a specific spot.The spot where we don’t need all the humans there are, in order to produce all they consume.In other words: there isn’t enough work for everyone, and if you aren’t capable of doing the work that’s available, better than someone standing next to you is capable of doing the same job… you don’t get a job.Rent prices are very high in Manhattan. What’s the answer for people who make minimum wage, but want to live in Manhattan, is it:A — Low income housing located in ManhattanOr is it:B — They don’t get to live in ManhattanI’m going to go with option “B”.You’ve applied at Google “several times and rejected” [sic].So you don’t get to work at Google; big deal. Apply to work someplace else.And realize, that there will come a day where only one person in the world will have a job.It will be someone named “Bob”, and they will live inBob’s job will be to roll out of bed at least once a week and press a big green button.And that big green button will tell the robots that the planet is still occupied by humans, and that they should not turn out the lights, and they should continue producing the things that humans consume.I look forward to that day.","3,266 followers",Borislav Agapiev,1.1K,1K,7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-math-competition-that-an-international-high-school-student-in-the-US-can-take-I-want-to-attend-some-state-or-national-math-contest-as-they-will-help-me-to-increase-my-chance-to-enroll-to-MIT-or-other-top
