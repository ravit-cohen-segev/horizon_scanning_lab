This might eventually be able to send you any information you think of on the internet. There are several startups advertising brain exercises that involve floating or rolling a ball across the screen with nothing more than your mind. These companies are going to send this data back to their own black box neural networks to learn exactly what signals from our brains are causing these things to happen or how to be more precise and accurate with those brain games.There are several other contenders but I guess that would be my guess if they figured it out and I could just think about something and Thinking Cap just told me the answer or gave me a multiple selection of possible answers.That's what I'd name a brain hat. Not sure if it's taken.","68,793 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-would-be-a-technology-that-would-be-so-revolutionary-that-itd-be-adopted-really-fast

3,"Few items that is not revolutionary technology,Non-invasive diabetes testingEven if you do not have diabetes, you have almost certainly thought about how unpleasant it must be to have to stick yourself in the finger every single day. There is a lot to dislike about being diabetic, but that particular aspect is right up there on the list of the top 10 worst.Today there is a company that has designed anon-invasive, wearable diabetes monitor , which can detect chemical changes in the user's skin and breath.

Now, this is something that dogs have been doing since 2003. Still, the difference is that your wearable diabetes monitor will not get distracted by a squirrel and accidentally bark twice to tell you that you are A-OK when he should have barked once to tell you that you need insulin NOW. And it is a learning device, too, which means it gets better at tracking its specific patient's unique breath signature. With the non-invasive, wearable diabetes monitor, testing will no longer be painful or annoying.Selpic Star 3D printerSelpic Star A is a super-compact and easy-to-use multifunctional 3D printer, supporting open-source customization and multiple functions.Adopting a low-noise motor, Star A keeps its operating noise down below 60db. This means you may have Star A running without disturbing your work or others. Moreover, Star A has the resume -printing function. In the cases of a power outage or filament exhaustion, it can stop working and continue from where it left off last time. This function can save filament and avoid wasting time and effort.Most importantly, Star A supports add-ons. The buttons can be replaced by a 2.4-inch full-color touch screen. You can install the laser engraving head to start your laser engraving. And you can also use an upgraded hotbed that can heat up to 100‚ÑÉ, achieving stronger layer adhesion and better printing effect.Synthetic skinSwiss researchers have developed an artificial skinThanks to researchers at the √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne's (EPFL) Reconfigurable Robotics Lab (RRL) and the Laboratory for Soft Bioelectronic Interfaces (LSBI), VR users could soon feel objects in virtual worlds.SleepbreatheGetting good sleep is an important component of daily health and one that often gets overlooked. In fact, millions of people suffer from common sleep disorders that affect their health and well-being. For anyone who wakes up feeling tired, the Sleepbreathe device can help. It uses advanced technology that works with a smartphone to track key metrics and analyzes sleep data to help users achieve relaxing, restful sleep after only one night.Sleepbreathe acts as a sleep quality coach that monitors breathing, snoring, sleep cycles and sleep positions, to comprehensively and accurately assess sleep conditions. The lightweight, comfortable smart mask links up to an intuitive smartphone app with advanced algorithms that measure critical sleep data without the need to visit a sleep clinic. Sleep data is compiled into an easy to understand score that provides insight into general physical condition and measures the most important sleep metrics to provide detailed suggestions to improve your sleep quality. It can be done conveniently at home, recording the data immediately to produce statistics graphs and an in-depth analysis report to better understand your health and prevent potential sleep disorders.A needle that can diagnose cancerLike all medical innovations, the trials for this one are going to take a long time, and your doctor probably is not going to get one of these things in 2020. However, this device has been designed and proven in initial testing, and it has the potential to change the way doctors screen for certain kinds of cancer. Today, cancers are typically diagnosed through a series of invasive and uncomfortable tests, which can include lab tests, CT scans, MRIs and biopsies. Worse, many of these tests take days or even weeks to process, so patients are left anxiously waiting for results.
