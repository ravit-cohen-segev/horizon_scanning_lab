But if you’re working out 5–7 days a week you’re either training because you’re a professional athlete, or you’ve lost life’s balance. A layman person in western society should have much broader priorities.However, with proper nutrition I can get away with moderate weekly exercise, say like 2–3 times a week at low impact cardio and light weightlifting, and walk away even healthier overall. I may not walk away cut and ripped, but that’s not exactly a normal resting state of the human body either.Diet is an extremely important aspect of good global health. Having a six pack is not a faithful measure of good global health, only aesthetic health. It’s possible to have a six pack but have a gut full of bad bacteria because you load up on foods that kill off the good bacteria. That’s not good global health.Sports drinks and sugar-laden smoothies? I couldn’t think of anything less healthy and yet gyms are often stocked full of them. Gyms should only be serving clean-filtered, non-sweetened water, herbal teas, perhaps coffee. Everything else is for the athletes, because they’re going to burn right through it in no time.Even the general western medical community underestimates the importance of diet, ready to prescribe patients with illness and disease chemical-laden medications instead of asking them what they eat and starting from that foundation. How diet gets removed in the chain of total health is beyond me.We are so focused on aesthetic health because it’s what we can see, but this is a huge mistake in my view.

The survey shines a spotlight on the public perception of the future and suggests that building further into the sky, and colonising oceans are believed to be the biggest future trends as space and resources become scarce.The top ten predictions for future living:1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10.Maggie Aderin-Pocock, who co-authored the report, said: “Our lives today are almost unrecognisable from those a century ago. The internet has revolutionised the way we communicate, learn and control our lives. Just 25 years ago, technology like SmartThings would have been inconceivable, yet today, developments like this let us monitor, control and secure our living spaces with the touch of a smartphone.""Over the next century we will witness further seismic shifts in the way we live and interact with our surroundings – working on The SmartThings Future Living Report with a panel of industry experts, has allowed me to explore what these could be.“We are likely to see the emergence of towering megastructures as well as sub-aquatic cities and transportation via advanced flying drones – some of which could be strong enough to transport entire houses on holiday.”Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock has seen the future - and it's technologicalJames Monighan, UK MD of Samsung SmartThings, which commissioned the report, added: “The smart home revolution will have massively positive implications on how we live. Our homes are becoming smarter and can now detect the presence of things like people, pets, smoke, humidity, lighting, and moisture. And this is just the beginning.""Just as the technology driving the Internet has spread to smartphones and smart homes, the smart home revolution is destined to spread to larger communities and countries. By simply turning lights and heating off when we don't use them, we can reduce emissions.""By being able to better monitor and secure our homes, we can reduce crime. By better monitoring the habits of aging relatives, we help them to achieve greater independence and a higher quality of life.”The report was commissioned on behalf of SmartThings, a system which allows people to make their home smarter, meaning that at any time and from anywhere it is possible to switch on lights, turn up the thermostat or unlock the back door, all via a simple app or automatically through our daily routines - something that might have seemed like science fiction as little as 10 years ago, but today is a reality.The report has been published to coincide with the announcement that from the start of 2016, SmartThings will work with hundreds of products from a wide range of brands, as well as working with all of Samsung’s TVs as well as refrigerators, washer machines, ovens, and robot vacuum cleaners.Hope it helps…………………………………………………………………………………",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,17K,996,156.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-will-banks-evolve-in-the-future-with-technology-change
