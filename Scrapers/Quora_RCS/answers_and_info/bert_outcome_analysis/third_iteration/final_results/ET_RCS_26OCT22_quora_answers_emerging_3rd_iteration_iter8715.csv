The nineteen sixties!Let me dig back into my memories.I was a boy stepping into my teens in the sixties.In 1960, as a 11 year old, I started wearing glasses.In 1961 I remember the famous Bay of Pigs invasion when United States’ CIA trained Cuban rebels and tried to overthrow Fidel Castro of Cuba. The same year I remember the euphoria in India particularly in Mumbai when 450 years of Portuguese rule ended in Goa and India annexed it.In 1962 I remember the tension ridden days when the war with China was going on. We lost a lot of territory in that war. I was too young to realise the implications. Nehru, who was a political giant till then, suddenly fell from stature.In 1963 I remember being shocked by the assassination of John Kennedy, President of the USA.I remember the cold war between the USSR and the USA and the great Cuban missile crisis. The grownups were all talking about it but I was too young to understand. I remember the Vietnam war and just could not understand the reasons for the war.In March 1964, I went through the sacred thread ceremony that is customary in my community.A month after this ceremony, I had experienced the first major shock of receiving news of the death of Jawaharlal Nehru. I had known no other prime minister till then. Jawaharlal Nehru died in 1964 and I was a confused little boy at that time wondering how it would affect all of us. I remember seeing him first when I was in Kindergarten in the mid fifties. Nehru was visiting Bombay (as Mumbai was then known) and our school teachers had lined us up along the route that passed closed to our school, when “Chacha Nehru” and his retinue travelled from the airport to South Bombay. Each of us had been given a flower (a red rose) to be tossed at him as he passed by in an open car. I was confused and tossed it at someone else in his retinue and shouted “Chacha Nehru ki jai!” as rehearsed. The teacher later scolded me for being in a hurry and wasting one good rose flower.I remember the Shiv Sena taking birth in Bombay and the fear it caused among South Indians living in Bombay. I was in the first year of college in 1966 when Bal Thackeray launched the Shiv Sena to protect the interests of the Marathi Manoos, and wanted jobs reserved for Maharashtrians and since South Indians were the main rivals a lot of attacks on South Indian establishments followed. During the agitations, we Tamilians and other South Indians were afraid of talking in Tamil or other South Indian languages in public for fear of being attacked or teased or harassed by lumpen elements.In 1965 I remember the Indo Pak war and the ceasefire and the Tashkent treaty the mysterious death of Lal Bahadur Shastri immediately after he signed the treaty.I also remember the great anti Hindi agitation in Tamil Nadu and riots and destruction that followed. At the height of that agitation, my uncle was celebrating the wedding ceremony of his daughter (my cousin). We went through nervous tensions because we feared disruption of the wedding ceremony by the agitators who were burning buses and railway stations and blackening all Hindi sign boards. My Uncle was a Hindi teacher in a college in Tamil Nadu and was likely to be targeted. After the wedding he had no job as the Hindi department was closed down. My Uncle was a double MA, in Hindi and Sanskrit and switched to teaching Sanskrit for a couple of years till that department too was closed down. He later became a building contractor and prospered. What he had not earned in a lifetime as a teacher, he earned in just a couple of years as a building contractor!In 1967, I remember entering engineering college at BITS Pilani for my five year undergraduate program in Civil engineering.It was the costliest engineering college in the country at that time. The semester fees were Rs 450 per semester while at IIT it was just Rs 200 per semester. My dad spent Rs 15000/- in total for my engineering education. My train ticket from Mumbai to the nearest railway station at Pilani was Rs 18/- after allowing for student’s concession. My monthly mess bill at Pilani was Rs 120/-.In 1967 I also remember the famous 6 day war between the Arab countries and Israel and how it had lasting effects on world politics and particularly oil prices. I remember the Great Cultural Revolution under Chairman Mao in China. I also remember that Naxalites made an entry at Naxalbari.In 1969 I remember the events in France and how president Charles De Gaulle had to temporarily flee the country.In 1969 I remember the famous split in the Indian national Congress. Indira Gandhi split the party at the AICC session in the glass house at Lalbag gardens in Bengaluru.I was a student at BITS Pilani those days and I remember the thrill of listening to the running radio commentary on Man’s first landing on the moon in 1969. (There was no TV in India at that time). That famous quote “That’s a small step for a man but giant leap for mankind” of Neil Armstrong captured our imagination.I will stop here as this account will be never ending if I continue to think more about it.I hope this was a readable account. Thanks for this opportunity to recall my boyhood years.Edited to add on May 1, 2021Srini’s comment made be think about the nineteen fifties.Here is my reply to his comment.I too enjoyed going through memory lane. A whole book can be written but that is not practical. I have only vague memories of the 1950s. I was just a kid then. I was born in 1949. But I still remember that my pocket money was one anna (6 paise) and that the we could buy a Masala dosa for 12 paise and a coconut for 20 paise. I remember the change of currency from Rupees, annas and pice to Rupees and paise. 16 annas made a rupee those days. Money was carried by us in coins rather than currency notes. I also remember the change from the British Imperial system of measures (Pounds and ounces for weight, miles, yards, feet and inch for distances) to the metric system. I remember how Gujarat and Maharashtra was one state called Bombay State. I also remember that Goa was a “foreign” country then.Edited again on May 1 to include my reply to Avni Sharma’s comment who wished she had been born in the sixties!RAlso no Google, no Wikipedia for information but instead asking around, or a visit to the local library. No downloading, no uploading of songs and videos but listening to music on the radio or using a gramophone and playing vinyl records? We had tape recorders but no cassettes.We read books and comics, played cards, out door games like street cricket with tennis balls, lagori, hide and seek, kabaddi, football, volleyball, badminton. Video games were unknown.There was only one airline then, Indian airlines for local travel. Air India operated Internationally. Air travel was a privilege beyond the reach of the middle class. We had only two choices for cars, either Fiat (later called Premier Padmini) or Ambassador. All other cars were imported. No middle class person owned a car. They had only scooters and the only choice was Vespa or Lambretta.We attended music concerts, kavi sammelans, visited animal circuses or attended dramas/plays in theatres and saw black and white movies. Color photography was not invented. Most of us did not have cameras. We had to go to the photo studio to take a picture and it took a few days to get the film developed and printed. Today you can click a picture in a second!There was no reservation. There was no problem getting admissions for an above average student. You did not have to score 99 percent! Even 60 percent was good enough to get admission. No OBC reservation. All merit students were easily accommodatedToday there is too much competition and tension.We were happier those days than the young people are today.Edited on May 2, 2021 to add this link to an old answer that may interest some of you.",50 followers,Laura Jenkins,1K,248,166.7K,2021,https://www.quora.com/Can-you-share-anything-exciting-that-happened-to-you-or-someone-else-in-the-1960s
1,"In 1961 my parents were divorced and sharing custody. My dad picked my brother and I up for a six-week summer visitation. As we were driving, he told us that he had gotten married to a woman we had met once, and she wasn't too thrilled with us then (or ever).After the six weeks we were driven home to mom. When we walked in the house, a strange man was there, and mom said “this is Jim, we're married.” We'd never met him before. Luckily, he turned out to be a good man and step-dad.

I was born in 1963, so I am writing from the perspective of a little girl and focusing on what was most different from today. I grew up in a lower middle class neighborhood in a small southern city. It was definitely not Mayberry and I most certainly did not have an idyllic childhood.While there are things I remember fondly from the 1960s, I certainly wouldn’t want to live there.

The early 1960s were still very much like that of the 1950s. To us it would be an alien world of social repression and lock-stock conformity. But even then the “all American family” of a dad ar work, mom cooking and cleaning in pearls and heels and 2.5 children is something of a myth. Only about 60% of children in that era spent their entire childhoods in that type of family and as for “traditional” the 1950s were an aboration bucking the trend of rising divorce rates and declining marriage rates and family size since the 1880s. In fact in the 1920s there were predictions that marriage would be extinct by the 2020s.By around 1965 the oldest “boomers” were 20 and society had grown weary of the “pretend it isn't happening” mindset of the ‘50s, what was often deemed “innocence” was often in fact forced naivete. The civil rights movement had gained serious traction by then, women's rights and by 1969 gay rights had emerged. The pill and sexual revolution made it so people, especially women had greater agency over their bodies and lives. The deaths of JFK, RFK and King rocked society, the sprees of Richard Speck and the Manson family stripped away “innocence” as did riots, protests and demonstrations. The counter culture and the “mod” allowed for greater personal freedoms and sexual expression.Of course not everyone liked these changes. I've never heard “hippie” used as a compliment. The “schedule 1” of drugs, marijuana, LSD and heroin reflect what was demonized at the time. A lot of people blame the sixties for “what's wrong with this country” (an old refrain, when three boys in Chicago disappeared in one day in 1955 the father of one of them said “when three boys can't walk to a bowling alley and be safe in the middle of the afternoon there is something wrong with this country.”)People lament the death of an old comforting world in the 1960s, the loss in Vietnam, Nixon, the cynicism of the 1970s, the greed of the 1980s, and even today the 60s are blamed for ushering in our current world. But that's not fair, the 1960s helped shape a more modern outlook but it also stripped away the rose -tinted sugar coated myth of the 1950s and made everything “real” again. Far to real for some people's taste.","227,252 followers",Gopalkrishna Vishwanath,750,11.9K,117.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Can-you-share-anything-exciting-that-happened-to-you-or-someone-else-in-the-1960s

Generally I mean, no math or science, let alone physical labor, car mechanics, finance, real estate, etc. Women were always told not to “worry your pretty little head about it.” Men were totally in charge of everything, and your only real commodity was your body and your looks. Of course, there was a very fine line between dressing “modestly” or “looking like a hooker.” I’m talking about a mere inch in your hemline. Oh yeah, about that - forget wearing pants, especially to school! No pantyhose. Stockings and garter belts. We were expected to wear girdles too. I refused. Yeah, I was a real rebel!There was little information about bodies. We never even knew what males looked like, unless we were the victims of flashers, and we were! Information about sex, periods, pregnancy - just don’t do it! You would get a “reputation.” Then women stayed away from you, and so did “nice” boys, i.e., “marriage material.” We had to safeguard our precious hymens so that our husband would have the pleasure of having painful sex with us on our honeymoon night.You will have never heard the word clitoris. You are not supposed to enjoy sex! Lay there like a dead fish and tolerate it. And keep in mind, the guy on top of you doesn’t know anything either, just stuff he heard in locker rooms, and only half of that was even true!In the workplace, a man was always the boss. Every man was a sexist, and you were fair play. If you don’t learn to have radar, you are going to get your ass and tits grabbed often. Sexual harrassment lawsuits? What? Rape? That was your fault because of the way you dressed, or wore makeup. Physical abuse? You need to learn how to behave!Of course, you are only working until you meet Mr. Right, who will be the bread winner. Forget about a career! You will be a housewife and a mother.

I don’t recall ‘Duck and Cover’ in the 60s, that may have been a 50s thing. Rock and Roll was in a tailspin, all we were getting was Frankie Avalon, Fabian and such.

Plastic was the thing, everything was covered in plastic. The new space age material. I asked my Mom once why she covered everything in vinyl. She laffed and said, it was the thing everyone was doing. There was no AC. The only place you could find AC was in a movie theatre.JFK was President and the press loved him in the way that they loved Barack Obama. For most of the press he could do no wrong, nor could Jackie or any of the Kennedys. The press had endless stories of touch football at the Kennedy compound, The Kennedy children and the Kennedy brothers. So everybody played touch football too. Viet Nam was still a distant police action; it did get press coverage but it was mostly of the Viet-Namese.American cars ruled. Automotive engineering was a different world from today. The things were fucking hugh and ran like Giant sloths. Bench seats front and rear that could fit a family of nine w/o a hitch. Gee, I loved those seats. Plus I was small enuff to ride in the shelf under the rear window. The National Highway system was copied from the Nazis and had just got under way under Eisenhower. So when you drove inter-city or inter-state it was on two lane blacktops for much or all of the way. Air travel was just beginning and people still traveled by train. Imagine telling your friends today that you’re taking a train to California or New York. Air travel was a different world from today. Every passenger was treated like a prince or princess. And the staff all had Hollywood good looks. BTW, no searching or security at all. I remember (latter 60s) buying a ticket at the airport and walking on to the flight. Often we got to walk onto the tarmac to board. All the staff smiling and greeting us like we were royalty. Smoking was allowed everywhere and the booze flowed on the flights. Folks dressed to fly. It was an occasion. The only foreign cars I recall from the early 60s was the occasional VW beetle or Mercede Benz. Japanese cars are still in the future- at least on the east coast.Back on the ground, there were supermarkets (remember I’m a city kid) but not as large as today. I remember we did much of our food shopping at neighborhood stores. A loaf of bread was 15 Cents, a hamburger at a local restaurant was 25 cents. A pack of cigarettes was 21 cents. And a newspaper was 4 cents. I remember some of these prices because as a kid I was often sent to a store to buy these items. My Mom would go to the A&P and buy a week or two of groceries for about $20. The groceries would be loaded into one or two big, paper bags which it was my job to carry. The big grocery chains in NY then were A&P and Bohacks. Latter there was a cute girl teenager cashier at the Bohacks who would let me buy any amount of stuff for the price of one item. How did I ever fuck that up. A pair of Clarks Desert Boots was about $5.In NYC, nobody wore blue jeans; That was farmers’ clothes; That’s gonna change soon. A 45 RPM record (top 10) was about 50 cents. Elvis was no longer on the charts as he had been drafted. Many young men went into the army or other military as there was still a draft of two years active duty. Fellows would volunteer for the draft to get it out of the way. But you could only volunteer for the draft in the army. There was no draft for other branches of the military.Racism was alive and very healthy. God save the poor black man that ventured into a white neighborhood. I have spoken to many black men, my age, that told me they would turn down jobs or other opportunities rather then venture into some white or ethnic areas. And the reverse was true. I remember being told not to go into certain black neighborhoods and recall being stopped once by a group of young blacks about something but nothing came of it, I was about 11 or 12.In NYC, at least, suburban flight was beginning, and every once in a while a friend or relative would move to the suburbs- never to be seen again. It was also the beginning of traffic jams.We played in the streets and parks all day and well into the night. Me? As long as I was home for dinner I was cool. It was not unusual to be out with your friends all day. Seeing your parents for the evening meal and then out again. Also, this was when extended families lived nearby so you had cousins and friends all around.Then JFK was shot and a month latter came The Beatles. LBJ was President and Viet Nam loomed ahead. Everything Changed.When JFK was shot it was a week of national mourning. Think 9/11. Everything closed, except churches. All schools, businesses, gov’t offices, etc. TV was Black and white and it was 15 hours or so of news coverage of the assassination, funeral, transfer of power. BTW there was no 24 hour TV back then. Everyone was solemn, no joking around and everyone in the country assumed that everyone in Dallas was guilty to some degree.Premarital sex was still a big no man’s land. As a teenager, we would dream about making-out or coping a feel. Holding a breast while while making out was heaven and you had to work for it. Weeks and months of being the BF. Finger-fucking was always beyond me. If your girl got pregnant, you got married that week. Dropped out of high school and got a job. Every year there was a couple that disappeared and folks would whisper that some girl was in ‘trouble’.Then came the Beatles and everything changed. Then Civil rights protest, and Viet Nam. Now begins the 60s people talk about.","2,325 followers",MA Sadik,15.9K,124,2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Can-you-share-anything-exciting-that-happened-to-you-or-someone-else-in-the-1960s

DJ and music was the other half. So in these villages there's this thing calledIt happened that I wanted to pee. So I got out of theWhile peeing , suddenly, I heard a noise 50 feet away of a scream and some movement in the bushes. I got conscious and skeptical. I stepped forward to see but my friend who were not more than 20ft away called me back. I told them that there was some movement in the field, my friends insisted that it would be some wild animal (since it's a common sight). But I insisted that what I heard was some child scream and we should go and check.My friends who were not in the mood of leaving their pegs tried to shoo me off but ultimately we decided that for once we should go and check.So me, along with my friend and his 2 friends started walking toward the fields with a thick bamboo stick which was in my hand and my friends.It was immensely dark, but as we kept moving, our retinas slowly started gaining vision and what we saw next shook us to the core of our souls.We saw a young girl ( aged 6–7 ) lying completely naked and unconscious on the field and we saw 2 dark figures running towards the other end of the field. We knew what had happened so we ran towards them and ultimately got hold of them after a short chase. One was a 25 yo something man and one was a 35 yo man dressed in a cop uniform.Both of them fell to our feet and started pleading for mercy. They started saying things like:For the first time in my life had I seen an cop getting on his knees and pleading for mercy. My friends were discussing what to do with these two rapists.I looked at the little girls face. I felt like crying. She was so tiny and innocent looking. She was not even big to understand to what had happened with her. I was in a rage. And at the highest I had ever been in my life. I looked at the cop's face and started thinking what would happen now. Being that particular part of the country where law doesn't almost exist, will the girl ever get justice? Or even if she would, after how many years? Not before 10 years. The cop would definitely get bailed out. As corruption is in the DNA of the indian Judiciary systems. What would the cop do after getting bail? Harass the poor girls family? Or maybe even get them killed? Rape more children?All these thoughts started bombarding in my mind. And I don't know what got into me , I slammed the cop's head with the stick in my hand. No I did not stop there. I kept on slamming till I could see blood flowing around his head. He died on the spot. My friends went crazy - they snatched the stick from my hand and started shouting at me that I had killed a cop. The other rapist literally shitted in his pants as we could smell it. My friend ( bride's brother) told them ( his friends) to take care of the event and took me to his car. He drove me to the bus stand and boarded me in a bus going to Dehradun ( that's where I'm from ) which was a 3 hour journey. He told me to keep my mobile phone switched off till the time I don't reach my destination and contact me only after reaching Dehardun.The very next day I called him morning 10 am to ask what was the situation and what happened after I left. He said that they had to kill the other rapist as he was a witness and that they erased the evidences. Next day the villagers called the cops who took the bodies and the little girl to the hospital. They took her statement about what she saw and what happened. She told them that she was raped by both of them and she fell unconscious and doesn't know how they died.Few days later I read in a local news article how a cop lost his life trying to save a minor girl from being raped in the mids of night in Muzaffarnagar. Hence he died a hero.Call me a murderer but to date, I do not regret what I did. I did what a father or brother would do in such a situation.EDIT 1:",UNKNOWN,Mary,3.7K,257,19.4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Can-you-share-anything-exciting-that-happened-to-you-or-someone-else-in-the-1960s

The decade of the 60s, the cultural influences and what went on spilled over into the early part of the 70s, sexual promiscuity, wide spread drug use such as marajuana, and some clothing styles for example.The cost of gasoline was cheap in many places, less than 30 cents a gallon for off brand gas in the early 70s. Disco was a dance movement and subculture that existed in some large cities across the country, and there were at least 100 million less people living in the United States. There was less traffic on freeways, at least out west. Automobiles were more solidly built, being heavier due to having more metal in their frames, but not as good quality wise, compared to cars of today. There were one too many junk cars driving around back then compared to the present, and some of them were gross polluters. Automotive technology has vastly improved for cars since that time, less pollution per car, last longer, better built and engineered better. Cars in the 70s also didn't have the streamlined designs like cars of today. There were no cell phones, so you didn't have to listen to people talk their heads off, and no internet, at least used by the masses in its present form like today. Everything was a lot less expensive, and free love seemed to be more common. Although this can be a matter of debate I suppose, depending on where you lived. Hairstyles too were different, for both men and women, and alot of men wore their hair longer. Bell bottom pants, tye dye shirts, and mini skirts were popular. Many other clothe styles were different. Hippies were still running around, but they mostly faded away by the late 70s, and there seemed to Volkswagen Beetle cars everywhere. There were hardly any sport utility vehicles in existence, but many station wagons instead, so at least you could actually see down the road when you drove your car. Margarine was considered more healthier than butter, and smoking was much more accepted so you could light up just about anywhere. Nobody really seemed to care about healthy eating, exercise routines, health foods, vitamins, and the like, though there were health enthusiasts, they were mostly in a small minority.There wasn't the political divisions like we have today, everyone these days seem to be in a lot less agreement when it comes to politics.Rock music and pop music sounded a lot better, (my personal opinion) and our nation had a lot less debt. You could actually watch heavy weight pro boxing matches on TV without paying, and there was ABCs Monday night football, which was really popular. TV had some really good variety shows, series, and movies before cable, and commercials lasted for around 1 minute, and just seemed laid back, so you weren't blasted with a lot of fast paced ads like today. There were the TV wrestlers and the wrestling matches I liked to watch as a kid, just not as flamboyant back then. I thought Roller Derby, especially the women's version, was fun to watch too. TV stations didn't broadcast 24 hrs a day, but signed off the air late at night. There weren't alot of channels to choose from before the advent of cable TV. I remember when my Grandmother was alive, she only had 7, and she lives near Los Angeles.Technology wasn't so common, at least not as advanced. There were no big screen TVs, the widespread use of personal computers, no public GPS, and other personal electronic devices.The Los Angeles area had some really bad smog problems, and so did many other major metropolitan cities. The air quality in many major cities has improved since then. Drive in theatres were common. They seem to be mostly non existent today than in the 70s, and movies, although still made well, didn't have use of the advanced special effects like today. Technology for movies has become alot better.The spoken English language had different variations in word usage, and phrases, although this was a minor matter. Equal pay for equal work, women rights, the feminist movement, and the homosexual rights movement were starting to grow. Other social causes always seemed to be in the news. Children could go out, or at least could go out more easily to places where their parents didn't have to be so concerned. The Cold War still existed, since the USSR was still our enemy. The NASA Apollo moon landing missions were still going on, but people were losing interest in them as more missions were conducted. They ended by the mid 70s. The Vietnam War, at least in the 1st half of the 70s, was still in the news. The death penalty was actually done away for awhile due to a ruling by the Supreme Court.There was a major gasoline shortage at one time due to an Arab oil embargo. I remember seeing some really long lines at many gasoline stations. The US has since then become alot more independent from foreign oil.There was something I really never did like in the 70s, and that was the introduction of the 55 mph national speed limt, which was enacted by Congress in 1974 in response to the oil crisis in 1973. I remember seeing some motorists getting pulled over for doing 65 mph on the freeways. It wasn't until 1995 that it was finally fully repealed after over 2 decades. I wonder if other nations were laughing at us for our ridiculous slow national speed limit laws.",50 followers,Laura Jenkins,1K,248,166.7K,2022,https://www.quora.com/Can-you-share-anything-exciting-that-happened-to-you-or-someone-else-in-the-1960s

This is what I remember.Everything was much slower than it is today. Electronics were extremely primitive, so things tended to take a long time. As a result, you spent a lot of time waiting around and being bored.For example, phones were attached by wires to your home or office, there were no answering machines and there was no texting or email. As a result, phone calls were very different. If the phone rang, you always answered it. Always. There was no way to know who was on the other line if you didn’t. A person other than the person that you were calling frequently answered the phone. It was polite to chit chat with them for a couple minutes before they handed you off to the person you actually wanted to talk to. If the person that you wanted to talk to wasn’t home, then the person who answered the call would write down a message on a piece of paper asking the other person to call you back, or you would call back whenever they were likely to be home. If the other phone was already in use, you’d get a tone indicated that the phone was busy, and you’d call back later. Sometimes it took days to get in touch with someone.There was no e-mail. You could send a letter through the post office. You’d usually get a reply in a week or two. If you needed something local right away, it was usually faster to simply drive to the professional office and sit and wait until the person was free. You could also usually make an appointment to see someone or have an appointment for a phone call a day or two later.There were no computers. All correspondence was either typed on a typewriter, or more likely written by hand. Spreadsheets could not even be conceived of. You would draw a grid with a ruler and write the numbers in by hand. You could do simply arithmetic with an electronic calculator. Everything else was calculated by hand.There was no internet. No one except the most advanced computer scientists could even conceive of what that might be. If you wanted to buy something, you went to the store. If they didn’t have what you wanted, you either asked the store to order it for you or you went to another store. If you needed information, you went to the library and looked in an encyclopedia. People generally had subscriptions to their local newspaper and a couple magazines, to keep up with the news and their interests. The papers were delivered daily by local children, the magazines arrived in the mail.There were four TV channels — NBC, CBS, ABC and PBS. Some larger cities had a few independent stations, as well. TV shows came on at on a specific day and time of the week. If you weren’t in front of the TV when the show aired, you missed it. As a result, most shows were designed to be watched one episode at a time, each episode telling a complete story. There were very few serial shows like is common today. There was no binge watching. There were no video players or streaming services, so you couldn’t watch big-screen movies on demand. Each network had one evening a week where they would show a movie of the week, edited for TV. There were virtually no sports on television other than on Saturday and Sunday afternoons.There were no video games until the late 70’s. People would play cards or board games at each other’s homes.It was much less common to eat at restaurants. When you did, it was kind of a big deal. There was no food delivery until the late 70’s when pizza started to be delivered. Everyone ate their own meals at home a lot more. People would also be invited to eat at their neighbors’ houses much more than they are today. I remember that my best friend’s mom would always set a place at the table for me, if I was still hanging out at his house around 6:00.For me as a child, the best thing was that if you went outside, parents didn’t really pay attention to what you were doing. All I had to do was tell them where I was going to be, so that they knew where to find me. At age 8, I could ride my bike a mile and a half along a busy street into town to buy comic books and soda. (We never had soda in the house — just milk and water). At age 11, I could spend the entire day at the swimming pool unattended. I remember that people were constantly calling their neighbors to figure out where their kids were. It was no big deal.Those are the biggest changes that I can think of off of the top of my head. I’ll be curious to see what other people remember, as well.",UNKNOWN,Joshua P.

We had 6 channels, and you had to wait for your favorite show to come on. if you missed it, you had to wait for repeats later in the year. There was no DVR.Cars were more primitive, but not unrecognizable. Same with TV. Same with Computers.If you wanted to call someone, you had to go to your land line. And you had to know where they were. And you had to know or lookup the phone number where they were. And it had to be close by, or it cost a fortune to call. If they didn't answer, you'd hope that someone else would answer so you could leave a message. Otherwise, the phone just rang.If you wanted to send someone a mail, you had to write it out on paper. By hand. Unless you had a typewriter, and that was really expensive. I got my first typewriter when I was in the twelfth grade. I was sure I would be a super-famous novelist millionaire by the time I was 25. Life didn't turn out that way.To send that mail, you didn't push a button. You put it in an envelope and put a stamp on it. Then you went down to your mailbox, and put it in, and pushed the flag up. This would signal the mailman to stop at your box tomorrow, and pick up your letter. 3 or 4 days later, the person would get it in their mailbox. Now? I tried to send a letter the other day. Apparently, my mailman will only stop if he is giving me bills. I don't think he knows what the red flag is for anymore. Oh well, I was just paying taxes anyway, not like I was in a hurry.If we wanted to go somewhere, we rode our bicycles. Our parents did not monitor us as much as parents do now. We were expected to be home by dinner. If not, we missed it, and got a griping. If we misbehaved, we had our butts hit with a belt, until we screamed and swore we would never do it again. And believe me, we thought twice about misbehaving. Sometimes we were spanked for things we didn't do. I wasn't keen on those.School was harder. Teachers didn't cheat so ""everyone won"". If you were stupid, you just failed. The smart kids got ahead, and the not-so-smart and the delinquents didn't. This was before the days of ""No child left behind"". These were the days where they wanted to help kids excel, and the ones who wanted to learn, and could learn, did better.If you went to a sporting event, not everyone got a trophy just for showing up. Only the winners got a trophy. The losers had to suck it up and work harder. It was a valuable lesson.People socialized more with each other, with their neighbors and work friends. When you sat at the table, people talked to each other. No one had cell phones that took up all their time.If it sounds like I'm waxing nostalgic for the good old days, that's not really true. Some of those changes have both good and bad. Cell phones, cheap calls, omnipresent internet, all those things that seem to eat up our time have a lot of good as well. It's much easier for lonely people to find like-minded folks on the net, so they're not so shut out. It's easy to find medical help on the net, where before you had to go to a doctor and sit in a room while he looked things up in a big book. You can contact anyone, anywhere at anytime. Tech is amazing.There were bad things in the 70s. If you got pregnant, you were having a baby. If your girlfriend got pregnant, you were getting married. Abortions, while legal in some places were still illegal in others. Sometimes girls would get them anyway. Sometimes they would die, or be rendered infertile. People were way more racist. My grandmother was scared to death of black people. And she hated catholics. I never understood this. I wondered what would happen if she ever met a black catholic.So in short, imagine your life without the internet and cell phone. When parents were not so afraid of kids being kidnapped and killed. When trying harder in school meant something. And people had long hair and colorful shirts.That's what the 70's were like, at least for me.Were your experiences similar?",0 followers,Alex Mara,771,5.4K,2.7M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Can-you-share-anything-exciting-that-happened-to-you-or-someone-else-in-the-1960s

Antiques were all the rage and every home decorating magazine showed rooms having clocks and especially grandfather’s clocks, so our business boomed.The huge honey pot that was created by the Vietnam War, when most every factory was booming, had dissolved by the late 1970s. The largest employer in town, being Bethlehem Steel was losing out to the Japanese. By the end of the 1970s the times where anyone who wanted to work could get a good paying job, were over.I continued to do well selling antiques and especially old clocks, until that market began to dissolve in the early 1990s.

Suddenly there were more college graduates than there had ever been, eventually greatly diluting the meaning of most humanities or liberal arts degrees. You could graduate in 1975 with a Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology and be legitimately surprised that there were no jobs available- hard to believe that still happens now.This was before DUI laws were on the books, and enforced. Yes, there were DUI laws, but as long as you could stand up, you were considered probably OK to drive.This was an era when many people were still smoking cigarettes, but it was starting to be less “cool” than it had been before. People were trying to quit. By the 70’s if you smoked, it was a possible detriment to your social and work life. But people smoked in all offices, workplaces, and restaurants.A trip to McDonald’s, or getting a pizza was a monthly thing, not 3 times a week. This was mostly due to economics, and not health.30 and 40 year old people were seldom greatly overweight in the 70’s. If a woman was 10 pounds over her ideal, she was very concerned. She was on a program. At the beginning of the decade, you couldn’t even get a diet soda in a restaurant, but by the late 70’s, they were everywhere. Jogging became a thing, and stores carried various food items made with saccharin, an artificial sweetener, which tasted like the chemical nightmare it was.At the beginning of the decade, women still made a lot of their own clothes if they were handy, and other crafts such as crochet and needlework were very popular. By the end of the decade, making clothes at home had declined, partly due to the cost of buying a pattern and fabric, and factoring in an hourly rate for the time involved. Women started realizing their time had an hourly rate.You already know there were no cell phones or Internet, but the average home didn’t even have an answering machine. Meaning you could call, and the phone would just ring. A large book of phone numbers would appear on your doorstep on a yearly basis. In the back were yellow pages for businesses and services. If you didn’t wanted your number published, you paid an extra fee.High school was really a bitch in the 70’s, but based on what I read here, it hasn’t changed much. Then, as now, being in the top 10–20% popularity echelon meant nothing at all in the context of your life.If you were being bullied in the 70’s though, you were definitely blamed for being the one who didn’t fit in. That aspect has had some improvement.Many homes had a set of encyclopedias, which helped you identify the state bird of Oklahoma, but didn’t otherwise contain much of any useful information. For that you had to go to the library, and even the library oftentimes couldn’t answer questions that are now so easily researchable on the Internet.Watch films of the era. Standards of living have risen a great deal. See upper middle class movie couples in the 70’s sleeping together in a double bed. In the morning, they don’t mind drinking instant coffee. Can you imagine that now?Speaking of films, I would say The Exorcist was the defining film of the decade. It was certainly the most talked about. People waited for hours in line to see it, then they actually came out of the theatre traumatized. By today’s standards, it seems tame.A book hit the market about 1978, creating big waves. It was called The Hite Report and it was the result of extensive research on women’s sexuality. It said essentially that the clitoris is the organ of female satisfaction, not the vagina. This was news to many people. It concluded that many women faked orgasm because their partner did not know how to stimulate them.A lot of things were changing rapidly in the 70’s, so rapidly that 1970 and 1979 almost seem like two different era’s. There was a loss of innocence that went with the resignation of Richard Nixon. The man who held the country’s highest position had fallen. With heinous crime, like that perpetrated by serial killer Ted Bundy, also came a loss of innocence.By the end of the 70’s the US was really a very, very different place than it had been 20 years earlier.If I could somehow magically transport back to those times, I am not sure I would be interested. I remember it being boring a great deal of the time. Only 6 or 8 channels and we had no VCR. They may have existed, but were not affordable to average people.

I was the youngest of three boys, so I have some the memories by older brothers to lean on, but let me tell you some of my dominant memories, in no particular order.  I am not fact checking any of these, I'm just streaming from memory.Oil Shock, Gas Guzzlers, Leaded Gas, Driving CultureIn elementary school, I did a current events report on the first gas station to charge over $1.00 a gallon for gas in Hawaii.  This was an unfathomable price at the time.  The concept of gas going up to a dollar a gallon was so alien that the mechanical gas pumps of the time could only be set to a maximum price of 99 cents per gallon.  The fix was to start selling gas by the half-gallon - the price was calibrated to half of the actual price and you would pay double of the total displayed on the pump.American car brands were dominant, but they were designed to guzzle gas like it was water while burping out tons of emissions.  These were all non-issues to the car companies, who were still resting on the laurels of the halcyon days of the 50s and 60s.  The US companies arrogantly denied the issues and instead of investing engineering effort to fix the problems, they lawyered and lobbied up to fight the forces arrayed against them.  However, the sharp growth of pollution and the rising prices of gas thwarted their best political efforts.  Honda and VW showed up with small, cheap cars that were laughed at... at first.  The smaller cars were gradually adopted for their lower price and efficiency, and the Honda CVCC engine provided an annoying existence proof that the emissions standards being imposed on American automakers were completely attainable, despite their insistence to the contrary.Gas used to have Lead in it.  Really!  It made engine design easier, apparently.  The appearance of Unleaded gas caused a great backlash since it cost more and performed worse than its leaded counterpart.  It took years for engines to work better with the fuel (see: ""arrogant auto companies,"" above).  Or maybe refining got better.  I don't know, but the transition to unleaded gas coupled with the spike in gas prices and the recalcitrance of automakers to change made for a very unhappy driving public and a ripe market to clueful competitors.Speaking of gas, back in the 1970s, every gas station had dedicated ""gas station attendants"" who would pump gas for you.  Toward the end of the 1970s, self service options became available and there were two prices for gas: A ""self service"" and ""full service"" price.  Eventually, self service dominated though a few straggler states didn't pick it up until much, much later.Although safety glass and lap-belts were everywhere by the 1970s, not very many people bothered to buckle up.  A ""car seat"" was your mom's lap.  Kids routinely roamed around a car while it was in motion, and maybe slept on the floor or on the shelf of the back window.UnionsIn the 1970s unions were continually flexing their power with strikes.  Teachers, manufacturers, transit workers, sanitation workers, etc. etc.  The combination of strikes, job actions, and general malaise drove down manufacturing quality and quality of life in general.  The pressures placed on society by these strikes were probably the driving force behind most non-union people quietly letting the government run roughshod over the unions in the 1980s.  Strikes and work stoppages sucked.  Setting aside the moral correctness issue or the fault issue, the prevalence of strikes made the 1970s painful.  I heard stories of how bullying of employees was exercised in a pretty naked way in a lot of shops, and members were expected to fall in line.Organized CrimeThe Mafia was alive and well, engaged in various protection rackets and intimidation of the populace.  They were intermeshed with the unions in a shameful way.  The police were powerless against these guys until some creative prosecution methods and heavier duty laws appeared towards the end of the decade.  I also remember that some police were complicit in the crime organizations at the time, too.  That helped to develop a greater cynicism for authority in my impressionable young self.InflationStuff just got inexplicably more expensive every day.  President Nixon declared a wage freeze.  The stage was set for an astronomical upwards march in interest rates for all loans.Credit Cards / Cash economyGeneral purpose credit cards like MasterCard (then ""mastercharge"") and visa did not have big traction.  You paid cash, or maybe used a store credit card or gas credit card.  Cash or Check were the main ways to pay.  Mostly Cash.ATMs were just starting to appear and direct deposit did not exist.  You got your paycheck and RAN to the bank, waiting in a long line to deposit or cash it.  And you'd better get a enough cash, too.  If you wanted to withdraw, you'd have to find a narrow window of time when the bank was open and you could afford the time to stand in line.  Out of cash over the weekend?  Hopefully you have a friend you can borrow from!Cold WarThere was always this sense that ICBMs could be raining down on you at any time, for no reason.  There was a lot of fearmongering and defeatism about it.  The only defense was the Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) doctrine, which provided us the cold comfort to know that our radioactive ashes would be well avenged after our death.Supermarket Price TagsIn the days before UPC codes and price scanners, all items in supermarkets were actually tagged with small price tags, and somebody's job was to affix an adhesive price tag to every item.  New stock arrives?  Tag every item.  Price change?  Re-tag every item.  On sale?  Re-tag every item (with a SALE tag!).  These tags were designed to fall apart if you tried to remove them and place them on another item, which was a common way to fraudulently lower one's grocery bill.  A cashier would manually enter every price and category (to make sure tax was applied or not).  I remember encountering my first bar code scanner, and being totally amazed at how much faster checkout went.NixonThe resignation of president Nixon taught me and all my peers that politicians were completely dirty and inherentlyuntrustworthy.Iran Hostage CrisisThe seizure of the American Embassy in Tehran put Islamic extermism on the American conciousness, and showed the all powerful USA that despite having an arsenal that could wipe out the planet, you couldn't free your own trapped citizens from a bunch of unruly students.  Despite the rhetoric that America was so powerful, the citizens felt frustrated about all the things that we couldn't do.Hijacked and Crashing AirlinersAirline crashes were routine news, it seemed.  Planes were hijacked by terrorist groups you never heard of and redirected to Cuba.  The ""Airport"" series of movies capitalized on these fears.Airline security was minimal to non existent, and some bad actors set in motion the path to the TSA, today.Transistor RadiosIn the days before the walkman, the value of your portable radio was determined by how many ""Transistors"" were in it.  Nobody knew what a transistor was, but dagummit, you needed as many transistors as I can afford!  Most radios were single-speaker affairs, and by the 1970s most were AM/FM switchable.  There was no digital tuning, you had to gently twiddle the tuning knob for the best reception, to get rid of all of the static.  Since it was all analog, dirt in the air-gapped capacitors or variable resistors could impede reception, driving a market in various formulas of contact cleaners.  The radios usually used C or D size batteries, sometimes a 9V.  The alkaline battery was just getting a foothold; in most cases you used crummy carbon-zinc batteries that died in a hurry.Television, Antennas and No Remote ControlsMost television programming was delivered through antennas.  Three major networks (NBC, ABC, and CBS) and a PBS station on VHF, and local independent stations on the UHF band.  There were no DVRs, VCRs were just coming in to play.  If you wanted to watch a TV program, you had to plan to be in front of a TV when it was scheduled to be on.  Monstrously large video tape recorders and players appeared by the end of the decade, but were very expensive.  An older couple in our neighborhood bought one and hosted movie nights for the kids in the neighborhood, showing the programs on their enormously-large-for-the-time 25 inch color TV .  TVs of that size were so expensive that they were typically build into an elaborate furniture cabinet.  They were called ""console TVs.""Color TVs were not ubiquitous.  At the time, about half of people had black-and-white TV.  Typically, the main TV of a home was color, but secondary TVs were the cheaper black and white models.  VHF tuning was typically done by knobs that made a satisfying CLUNK as you changed channels and there was a ""fine tuning"" to clear up the picture.  No phase-locked-loop tuning at that time  Cheaper UHF tuners were just continuously spinning knobs (as you would find on the AM of FM radios of the time) or sometimes on the higher end sets would ""tick"" from channel to channel and add a fine tuning knob.These mechanical tuners were nor remote controllable.  If you wanted to change the volume, you got up, walked over to the TV.  Same with the volume control and power.TVs were powered by vacuum tubes that would take minutes to ""warm up.""  The sound would come up first, and the picture would slowly start to appear.  Some sets touted ""instant on"" capability, which just meant that the tubes were left on all of the time.  This gobbled power, even when the TV sets were off.Tube testers.  Many shops stocked tubes and had a device called a tube tester.  If your TV was failing and you were handy, you'd open it up, pull out the tubes and carry them to the shop to test, replacing the bad ones.Boy, this got longer than I expected.

When you read about the social changes and advances of the 1970s, try to imagine what life was like before these things happened, and remember that change did not magically occur overnight.During the decade, women gained valuable new rights, protections, and options. In 1972, Title IX prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex in any federally funded education program or activity. It took a Supreme Court decision, also in 1972 (The effect of safe, effective, and widely available contraception caused major social changes. ""The pill"" meant that women could choose to engage in sexual activity and explore the recreational aspects of sex without the consequences of an unwanted pregnancy. Married women finally had a reliable method that allowed them to choose the number and spacing of their children. Women began to demand sexual and gender equality. These changes, often called the sexual revolution, have extended to the overall role of woman in society. As one example, access to reliable birth control meant that more women were able to enter, and stay longer, in the work force. By 1982, 60% of women of reproductive age were employed in America.TheTechnology was substantially different, but people managed to live full, varied, and satisfying lives without iPads, smart phones, texting, or the Internet. The skill set needed for a good job was very different. Skilled craftsmen were valued, factory jobs plentiful. Many people worked for only a very few companies during their entire working lives and loyalty was a two-way street. In some families, multiple generations worked for the same company. People feltThere were very few computers in offices, schools, or colleges and virtually none in homes. Slide rules were still in use. School homework was hand-written. College papers and business documents were composed on typewriters. Major edits and rewrites often necessitated re-typing the whole document. Research was done by consulting physical books in a library.Sales of color TVs did not surpass sales of black-and-white sets until 1972.

Some people here who were adults in 1986 have claimed that aside from the Internet/mobile phones, life isn’t really all that different. I think they’re discounting two major things:Now sure, on the face of it, you may not think all that much has changed, but the vast majority would not agree.Take a look at these pictures.ShanghaiMumbaiAddis AbabaHo Chi Minh CityHad you shown these images to the residents of these cities in 1986, it would have blown their minds. This is just one sign of the massive, unprecedented economic expansion and rise in living standards across the globe. While I haven’t found exact figures for 1986, in 1981 about 44% of the world’s population lived in extreme poverty, and that figure was 36% in 1990. Today, it’s about 8.6%. That’s still somewhere around 662 million.Right now, the world is continuing to undergo massive economic development. Economies around the world are booming. Asia and Africa were both massive seas of poverty in 1986. Today, Asia continues to surge and Africa has begun it’s rise. All around the world economies are growing, and a majority of countries are middle income. That means that the lifestyle around the world is changing. Sure, people have noted that their lives haven’t changed much since 1986, but this ignores the fact that billions of people have been lifted out of poverty and economies grow all across the world, from Asia to Africa, from Latin America to Eastern Europe. It may be that the lifestyle of the industrialized world hasn’t changed too drastically, but that ignores the fact that billions of people are undergoing drastic changes to their lifestyle. The lifestyle of people who say things haven’t changed much since 1986 are talking about was the lifestyle of the privileged minority of the world’s population back then. It doesn’t account for the massive change billions of people outside the developed world have seen.It’s still going on. Poverty continues to drop, and rates for education, nutrition, and Internet access rise. So that leads me to my first point. By 2050, extreme poverty will have been eradicated. Pretty much everyone is going to have access to an adequate diet, education, Internet connection, and sufficient shelter at the very least. We will adapt to climate change because while it will have nasty effects, it will open up new agricultural land in the northern regions of the world. Russia has already begun taking advantage of this to become an agricultural powerhouse as more and more of it’s land becomes cultivatable thanks to rising temperatures.However, there is one major economic force that is on the way, preparing to change everything, and that is automation.Right now, technology is emerging that will eventually render the majority of the human population unemployable. Robotics and artificial intelligence are advancing at a dizzying rate. The low-skilled professions will be the first to go, but large numbers of higher-skilled workers, including STEM professionals, will be put out of work. We are looking at majority global unemployment by 2050. We’re going to really feel the effects of this revolution in the coming decade, and it’s effect has already been felt to a certain extent. We’ll have to implement Universal Basic Income or some other economic system to accommodate this. The world will end up being divided into a non-working majority and a wealthy elite who continue to do whatever work is available. Everything will be affected. Manufacturing, farming, mining, medicine, law, education, software development, and construction, it’ll change entire industries. Productivity will massively increase as well. And assuming we handle it right, the end result will be far higher living standards for everyone.Technology is also going to advance more rapidly between 2018 and 2050 than it did between 1986 and 2018. That’s because technology begets even more advanced technology. The rate of technological progress between 1800 and 1900 was far greater than that between 1700 and 1800, and likewise the technological level of the world in 1900 allowed far greater progress up to 2000 than had been achieved between 1800 and 1900. The technological differences between 1986 and 2018 are greater than between 1986 and 1954.I’m not even going to attempt to predict close to half of what will be achieved, but some of the things I expect:Now, as to the typical day, given that extreme deprivation will be all but gone and automation will have taken away most jobs, this is what your average day is going to look like.Children will still go to school, and those who want whatever jobs are available will still attend higher education to get qualified, although schooldays will be shorter since most teaching will be done by automated computer programs which will adjust to people’s individual learning styles and grade their work, but for the average Joe around the world, they’ll basically get up whenever they want and do whatever they want and go to sleep whenever they want, all day every day. I do expect some changes in the way we do things. Delivery drones are going to seriously cut down on in-person shopping. Self-driving cars will result in much smoother traffic flows, with traffic jams and accidents almost eliminated due to cars able to communicate with each other at lightning speed. In fact, the only purpose of traffic lights will be to let pedestrians cross, as vehicles will just be zipping past each other throughout intersections while avoiding one another.For the wealthy, working elite, the average day will start in their more luxurious than average accommodations, a smooth commute in a self-driving vehicle, work reasonable hours, and then go home or to wherever else they want to go. I don’t think workdays or even workweeks will be as long as they are now. Companies will need to entice people who don’t have to work, so I suspect they’ll be very well compensated indeed.",992 followers,Omkar Nawlakhe,37.9K,53,3.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Can-you-share-anything-exciting-that-happened-to-you-or-someone-else-in-the-1960s
