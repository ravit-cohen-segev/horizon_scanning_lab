3,"I suggest that you pair up a crypto exchange with a hard wallet to manage the greater risks of the crypto you are investing in. Choose a hard wallet compatible to the exchange. I recommend using Ledger Nano X to store your coins. If you are in Canada, the best exchange that is compatible to Ledger is Netcoins.","1,772 followers",Thomas Y Graham,945,55,4.5M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-ways-of-managing-the-risk-of-investing-in-cryptocurrencies

8,"As with any investment, the best cryptocurrencies to invest in will fit your own financial needs and reflect what you consider likely to happen in the future. It’s important to note that because they are new, cryptocurrencies are still relatively volatile in pricing, and there is no assurance of their future viability. As a result, it’s important to carefully consider how much of your portfolio should be devoted to cryptocurrency and to determine that allocation in line with your risk profile.As with any investment, the best cryptocurrencies to invest in will fit your own financial needs and reflect what you consider likely to happen in the future.

10,I guess you aren't aware of it. Recently RBI has given green signal for usage of cryptocurrencies in India. But despite of this government is not recommending it because there should be one regulatory body to monitor it just like sebi who monitors mutual funds. If anything happens sebi will take care of it. No risk is minimal here. But in case of cryptocurrencies there is no regulatory body as such. So nobody knows where your money goes and who takes it. Hence its too risky. Upvote if you liked it.,6 followers,Ryan Burner,735,0,0,UNKNOWN,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-ways-of-managing-the-risk-of-investing-in-cryptocurrencies
11,"There are a lot of reasons for this. India is not the only country that is having this debate about cryptocurrency. In at least 80 countries, there is some kind of debate going on regarding the legalisation of cryptocurrency. Crypto being pseudo-anonymous in nature, has a risk of money laundering and other illegal activities. Normal banks are hesitant about its distributed nature, as India's financial system and most counties have been centralised till now. A distributed system like crypto is new and more research needs to be done regarding how it will affect the populace and the economy. ButThere are a lot of reasons for this.
