1,"No. Cryptocurrencies have a bad carbon footprint ONLY when coal is used as a fuel to generate the electricity needed to run the mining farms. Smarter crypto miners are using solar, which has nearly a ZERO carbon footprint when running crypto mining farms.

5,"After having watched Transcendence, I actually thought about this scenario. If there is a prolonged, large scale loss of power all across the globe, which means essentially that nobody has access to the internet after a couple of days because even the back-up generators which keep the net up have failed, then bitcoin will still exist, as will all other data, and one could theoretically trade it buAfter having watched Transcendence, I actually thought about this scenario.

But I would be the one doing the investing and you have no say.ORIf I showed you a way to invest $10,000 in yourself over the next little while and it could make you pretty comfortable in 10 years and beyond.Which one would you pick?If you are looking for an industry to invest in over the long haul, which is pretty safe and has proven to provide a decent ROI and where you have some control over, it is Real Estate.Look at the growth of RE over the last century. Yes, there are dips and drops and crashes, but over the long haul, it’s one of the safest investments you can make.

9,"Might I suggest, you will kick yourself for not in investing in them now in ten years from now. Let me focus on Crypto in this answer.You cannot ignore Crypto – the major players – Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple because Bitcoin alone is valued at $80billion according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Although there are a thousand coins out there, these are key and the bank says the reason these are important is because they have distinctive features and “Unless a coin has some distinctive feature, we think it may struggle to gain mass adoption.” Bitcoin’s objective = decentralised payments.

Let me focus on Crypto in this answer.You cannot ignore Crypto – the major players – Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple because Bitcoin alone is valued at $80billion according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Although there are a thousand coins out there, these are key and the bank says the reason these are important is because they have distinctive features and “Unless a coin has some distinctive feature, we think it may struggle to gain mass adoption.” Bitcoin’s objective = decentralised payments. Eth objective = “smart contracts” and Ripple = forex trading infrastructure.Crypto currencies are crossing into the mainstream according to BOA Merrill Lynch because two major trading exchanges, the Chicago Board Options Exchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange are both offering products you can trade based on these. These are two of the oldest exchanges in the world and so it is an important market that we cannot ignore crypto currencies – whether bitcoin, ripple, or Ethereum.Whilst what the currency is used for is more important for owners, I think traders, especially those with a long bias, like to know the use of the underlying currency – just as trading copper or gold, or USD, we know the underlying asset has a utility which is at the long term core of its value.Some traders will pick Crypto currencies on the basis they want to short all of them for a perceived bubble. But, it is important to know more than price momentum alone. The long term chart of Bitcoin and say Apple and Amazon look similar after all. So are you when trading these products a believer in their utility? If so, why?For instance in the case of Ripple it was built around blockchain for an institutional audience looking at borderless money transfer. Not a problem about to die a death soon then?Ethereum’s popularity was based on its uses for smart contracts. Just as you and I may not be experts on the utility of Gold in all its guises, so too with cryptocurrencies, you may not understand to a PhD level the uses, but smart contracts are a solution for a global set of problems and this is a technology, not a fad, at the forefront.And how’s this for utility: “As","1,717 followers",Wilfred Edmund,927,65,881.3K,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-hypocritical-that-generation-greta-screams-for-climate-change-initiatives-while-they-push-cryptocurrencies-and-gaming-which-have-the-worst-carbon-footprint-of-all
10,"The people who made money out of anything were either smart or lucky. If you want to be in the “smart” category then figure out why people invested in what they did, and do the same now.People invested in Amazon because they believed in their strategy.People invested in nVidia because they understand that deep learning is disruptive and that it needs technology to support it.People invested in Bitcoin because they believed that it makes sense to store value in the form of cryptocurrency.What is important to understand is that what seems obvious today was not obvious 5 years ago, but nothing haThe people who made money out of anything were either smart or lucky. If you want to be in the “smart” category then figure out why people invested in what they did, and do the same now.People invested in Amazon because they believed in their strategy.People invested in nVidia because they understand that deep learning is disruptive and that it needs technology to support it.People invested in Bitcoin because they believed that it makes sense to store value in the form of cryptocurrency.What is important to understand is that what seems obvious today was not obvious 5 years ago, but nothing has really changed in the actual strategy of the company or the idea.Let me give a concrete example (please don’t take this as investment advice): Microsoft has 0% market share in mobile. If you believe that they have what it takes to solve mobile and get to 20–30% market share then invest in them. If you read this again 10 years from now and they do have 20–30% market share then the belief in Microsoft was right and the stock will reflect that. But no one really knows if they will manage to succeed in mobile. As of now, there’s no actual signs of success which means they are potentially under-valued, but there are reasons to believe that they will manage to succeed. These reasons need to be analyzed and understood thoroughly. After you have made a projection on the future of the company based on hard facts thenKeep in mind that when signs of success are visible to the public, then the stock will automatically reflect that, which is why you shouldP.S - I invested in Amazon, Microsoft, nVidia and Bitcoin a long time ago based on this strategy.","89,629 followers",Aviral Bhatnagar,521,831,35M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-hypocritical-that-generation-greta-screams-for-climate-change-initiatives-while-they-push-cryptocurrencies-and-gaming-which-have-the-worst-carbon-footprint-of-all
