An attempt was made by groups of concerned citizens to pass a Thirty-Sixth amendment to the Constitution which would have nullified the ruling, but as the organizers of the amendment push were not aware of a little known provision for ratification, they were all immediately arrested and charged with suspicion of ignorance of the law.A number of large software firms were actually behind the effort to make ignorance illegal. The market for HUD mounted legal guidance systems was to be huge, and as their research and development teams had been working on the problem for some time, they didn’t want to lose that investment. So, on the very day of the Supreme Court’s monumental decision, three different firms went to market with different subscription based apps that promised to keep you in the “Legal Green Zone.” All three systems were marketed to anyone over the age of three. The basic concept of the systems was nearly identical: voice recognition, spatial location, GPS tracking, and on-board camera feeds were all combined to produce one of several different types of feedback, depending upon the individual setting that the user desired. The simplest of the three appeared as a color bar in the corner of the user’s HUD. If the user was obeying all observable laws, the bar would appear in the green. As questionable deeds were committed, the bar edged towards yellow. Clear violations pushed the needle higher and higher with greater movement resulting from the most obvious transgressions. In cases of capital offenses, the system actually reported the user immediately. Many balked at this level of data collection, but the software manufacturers marketed the feature as a potential alibi for those wrongly accused and most users relented. Now that the software was installed, it was not only difficult to remove, but there was a distinct possibility that removing it could be a violation of the law in some municipalities.As an added feature, the smallest of the three companies,Eventually, the software became required on every single person’s HUD. Anyone over the age of three was required to know their legal status at all times. Children were told that if they were being “bad” then the little picture would turn yellow or red. The parents would receive constant live feedback about their children’s performance. Most forms of punishment had been outlawed earlier (evenThe various paths we might take are hard to predict, but as it stands right now, none of them are good. :-\","5,084 followers",Bobby Tatro,1.2K,2.2K,45.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/In-the-future-will-advanced-technology-make-it-easier-for-the-legal-system-to-monitor-defendants-electronically
1,"I think it depends on the crime.Computer crimes are something of an arms race. That is, the criminals keep making more advanced techniques to attack, and the authorities are generally a step behind. However, most criminals leave data tracks. Not too many are good enough to cover them all. One of the greatest problems with computer crimes is simply the amount of them. The authorities cannot keep up with your every day sort of theft.

Also, better databases, more content in those databases, and greater ability to search through them quickly, helps to identify DNA and fingerprints if they are already within those databases. The increase in face recognition ability will also make it easier to catch people (though it is not yet near where they show us in television shows and movies.)So, my answer to your question is both yes and no.","35,662 followers",Colin Riegels,557,28.6K,287.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/In-the-future-will-advanced-technology-make-it-easier-for-the-legal-system-to-monitor-defendants-electronically

Or imagine having Siri prepare an official court transcript.Despite the warts that human judges leave on the system, I think that attempting to useAdvocacy isn’t an art that lends itself to AI. Advocacy is, at its heart, a form of story telling. (One of my “bios” is “studied linguistics long ago, now plays with words for a living.” There isn’t much overlap between the science of linguistics and the practice of law in a practical way, but the two do both share a preoccupation withWhile there might be certain cases where you could input facts into a computer and have a result spit out mechanically (perhaps a plurality of my child support matters might fall into this category), it’s the rare case where the “facts” to be decided upon are clear and free from doubt in the first instance. Even, to take the support matter as an example, if we have pay stubs showing the parties’ incomes, there might be a dispute of fact over where the child lives. This happens with some regularity. At least once, the court was called upon to decide if the parents were really separated or not. Other things people fight about in support court are whether additional income is regularly available, or (in spousal cases) whether “grounds for divorce” can be shown by the defendant. If you wouldn’t trust computers making Quora’s “BNBR” determinations, you surely wouldn’t want them makingWhile the potential for idiosyncratic decisions or a tribunal’s being incorrectly swayed by a witness’ testimony, or more sinisterly, by racial, cultural, or other blatant bias on the part of a judge, is not something that any of us deny about the current system, I see no technology out there that has any potential to evaluate credibilityIn criminal matters, guilt must be shown beyond a “reasonable doubt.” In our standard jury instructions, this is defined as doubt which would make someone pause before making a decision of import to their own affairs. In ordinary civil cases, the standard is “preponderance of the evidence.” I suppose, theoretically, you could define these with some sort of arbitrary statistical probabilities—“a reasonable doubt” is a 10 % chance the decision is wrong, and “preponderance” is a 50.01 % chance that the decision is correct. Even if the problem of accurately calculating the probability of something in the past having happened could be solved by some sort of evidence-evaluating routine, I suspect, though, that any arbitrary threshold will lead to a significant number of decisions being proven wrong after the fact, undermining confidence in the system and causing a great deal of wasted litigation.I actually also think that a sense of humanity to a system which, after all, is designed to order the affairs of humans, is important. I observed long ago, when I first started out, that one of the most important things courts and lawyers do for litigants isI speculate that there’s something about hearing something from aSo, all in all, I will say that in my opinion the answers to both parts this question are “no.” I’m not saying what we have is perfect, of course.",0 followers,Hatice Aslan,570,164,11.7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/In-the-future-will-advanced-technology-make-it-easier-for-the-legal-system-to-monitor-defendants-electronically

5,"I’d try a different metaphor.Imagine you’re in a small clearing in a forest. You look around and you’re surrounded by trees; maybe 8–9 big trees that hem in your little clearing.

So it’s hard to give a precise answer.There are so many factors that affect the development of technology. Cultural, sociological, environmental, physiological, and many other potential influences would affect the timeline of technological development. Necessity is the mother of invention, so the emerging “need” of new technology would heavily influence the speed of technological development. Since the brain of modern humans has been basically the same for a couple hundred thousand years, it’s possible that the advances we have seen in the last few hundred years could have come about if humans had been pressed by a continuous need for tech development in order to survive, and if the interest in such development were being instilled by existing societies of the times.
