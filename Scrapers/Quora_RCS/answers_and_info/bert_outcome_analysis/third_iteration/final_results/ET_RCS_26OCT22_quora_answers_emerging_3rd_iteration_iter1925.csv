6,"Yes, I think I qualify to answer this question. Prior to my current role at Kabbage, I had a (sucessful) 8 year long career in designing graphics, mobile and server processors. The entire process took nearly a year with my interview period lasting roughly 2–3 months. I ended up attending 5 interviews on site and had offers from 3. Here is my story.The Motivation Phase (1 month)As a computer engineYes, I think I qualify to answer this question. Prior to my current role at Kabbage, I had a (sucessful) 8 year long career in designing graphics, mobile and server processors. The entire process took nearly a year with my interview period lasting roughly 2–3 months. I ended up attending 5 interviews on site and had offers from 3. Here is my story.The Motivation Phase (1 month)As a computer engineering graduate, I had shockingly minimal exposure to statistics and no exposure to machine learning. Initially, the buzz around data science in the tech media got me interested in the area. I pored over blogs, news media and articles online trying to define to myself the idea of a ‘data scientist’ and what makes one successful in the role. This included exploring stories about data science making a difference in diverse fields from healthcare to recruiting to marketing to education to everything in between. Gradually, the hype turned to genuine potential in my mind. This phase of setting the motivation was hugely important and set up the intrinsic drive to succeed. Otherwise, it would have been highly likely that I would have given up the endeavor before seeing it through to the end.Next, I set out to figure out the skills required to become a data scientist. The most popular idea on the net is that a data scientist is a super-human who sits at the intersection of programming, statistical (and ML), math, business domain and communication skills. Additionally, I would also like to throw in familiarity with big data tools like Hadoop/Spark/AWS to the mix based on my experience. I could only check off the software engineering skills (hacking skills) in this Venn diagram! One of my primary complaints with my prior job as a computer architect was that I felt that my learning curve was saturating. With such a vast skills requirement, I knew that there would always something new for me to learn for a very long time!The Knowledge Phase (9 months)The knowledge phase involved signing up for and completing a number of courses online through Udacity [ https://www.udacity.com/ ] (U), Coursera [ https://www.coursera.org/ ] (C) and edX [ https://www.edx.org/ ] (E). While Coursera was somewhat dry and theoretical and focused on the traditional lecture format, both Udacity and EdX focussed on a more interactive learning experience with short videos and tons of built in quizzes and programming questions to help with learning by doing. While this phase lasted a long time, it was because there were huge knowledge gaps to fill. I was also mostly taking these classes in the evenings or weekends after my regular work hours aka spare time. My focus was on statistics, machine learning, exploratory data analysis and some advanced topics (since I already had the programming and software engineering skills from my prior job).List of classes I took but not necessarily in that order (not just skim, but actually complete all the lectures, assignments and mini-projects for the most part):1. Descriptive and Inferential Statistics (U) - CriticalThe Skill Building Phase (6 months)This was a super interesting phase.After arming myself with the necessary fundamentals and practical tools (Python, R, mathematical and statistical base), it was time to put them to work. Enter Kaggle [ https://www.kaggle.com/ ]. For those not in the know, Kaggle is an online competitive platform for budding and experienced data scientists. Its a chance to get your hands dirty with real datasets from real companies to solve real problems using insights gleaned from data. Most of all, it is a vibrant community of like minded people having fun and learning from each other. Kaggle was single handedly successful in teaching me the nuances of experiment design, data pre-processing, feature engineering, model validation, and ensemble building. The gamification of the task at hand (leaderboard, rankings, forums etc) made the experience hugely rewarding and fun at the same time. Not to mention that you can use your achievements on Kaggle to get recruiter eyeballs. For more details on this, see: Vijay Sathish's answer to Do recruiters really care about Kaggle achievements or successfully completed courses in Coursera? [ https://www.quora.com/Do-recruiters-really-care-about-Kaggle-achievements-or-successfully-completed-courses-in-Coursera/answer/Vijay-Sathish ]The second phase of the skills building involved trying to get my hands dirty with real world data science projects. One of the drawbacks with Kaggle is that the problem is already defined, the data is provided to you (and mostly in clean format), and success is defined. In the real world, translating a business problem into a data science task, identifying data sources, extracting the data from multiple sources, data cleaning, defining metrics for success, find ground truth or labels are equally critical tasks. The model building and validation part is probably the easiest task. I identified several problem areas in my field at Oracle related to processor workload analysis, performance coverage analysis, and workload sampling - defined the problem, identified the datasets and metrics and got to work using supervised. unsupervised learning techniques and visualizations to tackle the issues at hand. Most of my team being fellow computer architects had minimal or no experience in machine learning, so this was unchartered territory. The insights I brought to the table from a different perspective was hugely rewarding and my colleagues looked at me with new respect. I was essentially disrupting computer architecture within the team! This also further strengthened my resolve to pursue data science as a full time job.The Interview Phase (3 months)The interview phase is the signaling phase.

Extrinsic:Everything that influences your decision and opinion is stored here (ex: why do you like certain music, food or fashion)The interesting part is this motivation usually does not last more than 3–6 months.3. Obsessions:This stores your passions but also your addictions such as being a workaholic, drugs, shopaholic and chasing stuff.When it’s on, you are not free to choose what you want anymore and will go after the obsession.# Imagination:This is the marvel of evolution, it’s what makes us human.Your imagination driver gives you creativity and adaptation.It should take control when dealing with new and complex situations that require you to think out of the box.People usually don’t let imagination driver take control and stick to their motivation driver instead, which leads them to lose out on big innovations.Examples:These mistakes happened because the people in charge relied on their motivation driver which only thinks from what it already knows - if they had used their imagination driver, they can see a future that Steve Jobs saw.When your imagination driver is taking control, you feel calm and in full control.How to activate it on command? think for yourself these questions:Making yourself answer these questions in your head activates the imagination driver.In conclusion we can say that even though our brain is too complex to summarise in a Quora post, this framework gives us a better idea on how we go about our daily lives and how we can use this knowledge to live a better life.Hope this helps you as much as it helped me.I might be updating this post with more findings, follow it if you want to keep updated.All the best!","1,896 followers",Jalon Fonseca,21.7K,485,5.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-upcoming-high-paying-technologies-which-are-in-high-demand-in-the-IT-industry-of-Canada-and-they-dont-need-development-experience

I’m going full speculation-mode here, as this has not been done ever and might not be possible/probable in the future.What we are performing is a full body transplant, so instead of transplanting a heart or a kidney, we transplant the entire thing. We would run into some problems though. The whole immune system thing is a biggie, but let’s just assume that is no issue (as I assumed we could do it for the sake of the question).We now have a male brain in a female body, or a female brain in a male body. Do note that male/female denotes the sex of the original body and the sex that the person grew up with. Brains in general are not male or female, more like a mosaic of both.This would actually be pretty interesting to see. I’m not sure what exactly would happen since the body and the brain interact at a lot of levels. Hormones are produced in both the brain and the body, so you’d have a lot of conflicting signals at first. You’d have genitalia that would produce hormones in levels the brain is not familiar with, whereas the brain does the same for the body.I suspect that in time this would even out, since I don’t think one can overtake the other (but I might be wrong, this has literally never been done, ever). The result might be a homosexual person (or I guess by definition a transsexual person), if the sexual preferences remain in tact (this assumes a heterosexual original, if the person was homosexual to begin with then it would be reversed). Sexual preferences might also change, though plasticity is probably not enough for a total turn, leading to bi-sexuality. It would be very informative to see what occurs, as we are not sure what leads to our sexual preferences (and preferences are not as robust as you might think).Then personality-wise. Now this would most likely change, I don’t see how it could not. The brain is now in a completely different body, which produces a completely different environment and chemical concentrations. I don’t see how someone could not change due to the hormonal changes alone. Again, no certainty just speculation. I’d expect the male brain to show more feminine behavior and vice versa. We can already sorta see this in transsexuals who take hormone treatments. Experiences change, emotions are different, nothing new just different you know?In the end, overall, I would expect such a treatment to lead to an intermediate of the two. Some aspects are changed more though bodily influences than other, but the brain (once formed) doesn’t like to make major changes and will still exhibit plenty of behavior you would associate with the original gender.",0 followers,Rahul Shrivastava,2.1K,587,53.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-upcoming-softwares-technologies-should-be-learnt-by-data-scientists-today
