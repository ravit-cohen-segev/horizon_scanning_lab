2,"When I was growing up, we had mechanical voting machines where the voters pulled down levers to pick candidates, and then you pulled down one big lever to cast the vote. At the end of the day the election worker took the cover off a set of odometer-line wheels that showed the number of votes. Those would be written down and the telephoned to the county who totaled them and then reported them to the state, probably by phone.In other jurisdictions they used paper ballots counted by hand.

It was built on intangibles like the slogan “Love Trumps Hate,” which was a great way to convince focus groups that your campaign prioritized humanity, but perhaps she put too much faith in the American people’s sense of right and wrong.Her campaign was built on this assumption that people understood that the other guy was an idiot. He was. But, just pointing that out was enough to convince an insatiable nation that you were much better.Clinton wrote in her book,Her campaign was fragile. A lot more fragile than it should’ve been. She was a Senator, Secretary of State, former First Lady, and her campaign hinged on an email scandal?Yes, the media, the Russians, and and Comey were all partly to blame, but her campaign was never as flexible as it should’ve been.

You can have an IQ of 20 and still benefit from the few with the knowledge to make cures for new diseases. It may be that as a divide grows between those with knowledge and those just benefiting, that we have the beginnings of a species split.A number of scifi movies have covered the topic where two “apparently” different species on a planet have a common ancestor but evolved differently over 1000s years as differences between them pushed them apart.Ultimately any change to human physiology is still evolution, whether or not it has long term benefits is another question. If not a benefit, it may be the beginnings of extinction, but extinction is one part of the evolution process, just not the favoured part.",0 followers,Jeff Mwangi,17.4K,182,4.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-have-presidential-campaign-advertising-techniques-changed-over-the-years-technologically

It occurs when a baby suddenly loses support and feels like its falling. The baby involuntarily spreads its arms out, clenches, and brings the arms back in. Then finishes it off with the loudest cry possible. To stimulate this reflex (ear plugs on hand), find a human not older than four months old (I currently have a 3 month old), lay them on a bed, hold them up, then suddenlyOnce the baby is done crying, take their hand and run your finger across their palm. What happens?Am pretty sure its this,Abnormally tight, isn’t it. They don’t even have their muscles tuned in right, and yet, they can hang their entire body weight on that grasp. It is known asSo why am I telling you about my favorite dad pastimes? Because these reflexes are anMost primates live on the canopy most of their lives. Their young are instinctively able to hang to their mother’s fur and eventually on to the trees. The Moro reflex is an evolutionary response that enabled the baby to either regain hold or alert the mother that they have fallen off. The palmar grasp reflex works to enable primates to move around in the canopy e.g. jump from one tree to another and not fall off regularly, or even hold on while doing other activities like sleeping or eating. Its not the baby that does this, but the brain. In humans however, development of the frontal lobe (responsible for voluntary responses) suppresses these reflexes and is instinctively forgotten overtime.Now return the baby to its mother, then take an abnormally long shower…to wash away your guilt for making the baby cry, of course. What happens?Its not the temperature of the water, nor is it the nature of your skin. This reflex, is caused by the nervous system, not the brain, and occurs when your skin is exposed to water over a prolonged period of time. But why just your palms and not your entire face? Because when you’re a primate cruising around the canopy on a wet day, wet palms would not help your grip.That’s right.

13,"Yes, sort-of - as Ann Carlyle says, mutation and selection between mutations is always an ongoing process. But species which are not being subjected to a significant selection pressure, and which exist in large enough numbers not to suffer from genetic drift, may evolve very slowly. This could be because, like the tuatara, they live in a sheltered environment which changes very little, or it could be because, like the cockroach or the horsetail, they hit early on on a design so good that there isn’t much room for improvement.Parthenogenetic species, which reproduce by self-cloning, also evolveYes, sort-of - as Ann Carlyle says, mutation and selection between mutations is always an ongoing process.

Sexual reproduction, by mixing together the gene variants from different bloodlines, produces a wide spread of slightly different offspring some of whom will be better suited to a given environment than others, and will therefore tend to have more offspring and alter the average genetic makeup of the population in favour of their own gene variants, which is basically what evolution is.",3 followers,Samuel Bateman,1.1K,102,56.4K,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-have-presidential-campaign-advertising-techniques-changed-over-the-years-technologically

15,"Humans are very likely evolving faster today than at almost any time in the past. Sounds crazy, right? How could this be? Let me explain.Most people think of evolution as operating on members of a species with “inferior” traits, thereby reducing their survivability and ultimate contribution to the gene pool. With this understanding, you’d then point to our modern longevity and note that “humans have largely solved the problem of survivability” — which we have. We can remedy poor eyesight, compensate for chronic diseases, vaccinate against plagues, work around infertility, etc. But this understHumans are very likely evolving faster today than at almost any time in the past.

With this understanding, you’d then point to our modern longevity and note that “humans have largely solved the problem of survivability” — which we have.

And what is it looking for? You might say, “survival of the fittest” or “natural selection”. And that’s where a lot of the confusion comes from. With ever longer lifespans and no natural predators, evolution seems to be way back in the rear view mirror for Homo sapiens.
