A horse required higher quality food and its ability to pull heavy loads was slightly less than that of a oxen, but it could move about twice as fast.As you might imagine power output moves up considerably once we move into the inanimate realm. A properly built vertical windmill or an overshot waterwheel could have a useful output in excess of 5 horsepower. Of course they required skill and material to build, operate and could only function when there was a sufficiently strong flow of water or air.Something like a sawmill might have an output 30 to 50 times that of a human sawing by hand.Though I am not confident in the specifics I can suggest that the most powerful output in pre-industrial days was generated by sails. Sails with an area in excess of a field hockey pitch could propel huge ships with hundreds of crewmembers at speeds in excess of 12 knots if the wind were right. Again I can’t say exactly how one would translate that to horsepower but I think we should see them as engines in the hundreds of horsepower range.The industrial revolution introduced new powerplants that had considerably smaller footprints and a higher degree of reliability. In addition they could run on fuel that was burned. Steam engines in ships, locomotives and factories could generate thousands of horsepower.What made cars and aeroplanes feasible were engines that had higher outputs at smaller sizes and lighter weights.Early automobile and aircraft engines might only have 30 horsepower internal combustion engines but rather than being the size of a three story building like a windmill they were small enough to fit in a modern shopping cart. By the end of the Second World War some aircraft were fitted with V-12 engines that had outputs in excess of 1000 horsepower while remaining comparatively pocket sized.Even lighter and more powerful engines such as various forms of gas turbines pushed airplanes beyond the speed of sound while rockets got us into space.The ultimate limit of our species is the ability to generate power. We can certainly improve existing power plants, their fuel cost, output, size, weight and manner of power distribution. However I do think there are limits to these. We kind of figured out how they all work and as such we are really improving them by each iteration.What I suppose the humans of the future need more than anything is something radically new. Something which can generate power beyond what we can imagine is feasible, something which might as well be magic to us.",UNKNOWN,Prajwal,5.3K,582,3.9M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Has-technology-reached-its-near-peak-or-will-there-be-things-invented-in-the-future-that-will-be-unimaginable-and-what-types-of-things-will-likely-be-invented

I'm gonna go the other way and give maybe a simpler answer. TL;DR He probably couldn't because he didn't know how to, and even if he did, the Imperium in 30k probably lacked the industrial base or technical ability to produce it.I think he either legit did not know how most of it worked, or did not know how to obtain the resources or production chains required to build any of it.Firstly, the Emperor is indicated to be vastly better at basically anything he does than a normal human, but he is still more or less human — he has said himself he isn't a god, and its never indicated that he's omnipotent or omniscient or anything like that, and his overall portrayal is of a pretty imperfect super-human. There’s no reason to think his knowledge is perfect - he has been alive a really long time and probably has a good theoretical knowledge in regards to dark age technology, but unless he dedicated all of that time to learning the details of how to actually build that technology, there is no real reason to assume he would be able to.Look at it this way — let's say you have a great idea of how a computer works. You understand how the physical components interact with eachother, how to properly assemble them by connecting CPUs to motherboards and what have you. You know how to program it to do what you want. You probably can't, however, take a pile of metal and silicon and whatever and then form that into computer components — that knowledge is just outside of your area.Secondly, even if the Emperor knows how to build EVERYTHING, he doesnt nessicarily know where to get the base materials or make the required tools.An example for that — Let's say you have built guns all your life and know exactly how to produce an AK-47 from a block of metal. Somehow, you get sent back to the mid-1800s, and you figure you can make it big and alter history by producing AKs a hundred or so years early. You theoretically have the ability to do this, and certainly have enough of a technological basis to produce examples of the gun, but it doesnt mean you know how to build the lathes or stamping equipment required for mass production. Similarly, do you know how to mass produce things the gun will require, like smokeless powder and cased ammunition? Just knowing how an AK-47 works and how to build an AK-47 wouldn’t be enough — you'd have to know how to engineer machinery and draw brass, etc. etc.This is basically the case with the Emperor's situation in the 30k era. Mankind is undergoing a resurgence long after a cataclysmic, civilization-destroying event that was centered on many of the most developed human worlds. While Dark Age technology is still around, everyone directly responsible for it's creation or construction is probably long dead. The Emperor might as well be stuck in a time before much of it even existed, practically speaking.Hopefully that makes sense.I think that even if the Emperor has the capacity to rediscover or reinvent Dark Age technology, he is not particularly gifted at it and it requires a great amount of effort on his part.You can see a little evidence of this in the canon — not only does the Emperor not actually directly invent much, but most of it doesnt really work as planned. The Thunder warriors were flawed. The Primarchs were flawed. Space Marines are flawed. The webway, a potentially fantastic accomplishment, might have worked, but it literally required all of his efforts and attention to put together, and potentially might not have. There isn't really the constantly implied level of perfect genius there, especially considering he's lived through tens of thousands of years of human history — for much of which he is hinted at as being a series of religious and political leaders, not a scientist. Thousands of years after the fall of man is a little late to get a solid education or the skills required to create perfect devices.What you DO see is incremental improvements in his creations. The Thunder Warriors were unstable combat gods. His next attempts were the Primarchs, and perhaps the Custodians — the Primarchs being an improvement in every way, and the Custodians retaining the prowess of the Thunder Warriors but without retaining whatever issues plagued them.Both of these were improvements, but even ignoring the later issues, the Primarchs obviously weren't suited to mass production. It could be pretty easily extrapolated that the Custodians are also too expensive to mass produce, which led to the Emperor's third iteration: Space Marines. Representing the bare minimum of modifications required to make an individual human physically competitive against most of the enemies they will face, they compromise between mass production (and it's a pretty severe compromise) and functionality. The next iteration would be the primaris marines, an improved version created by people other than the Emperor.To me, there is simply not much evidence he could have recreated much of anything.Finally, while the Imperium is vast and has an unimaginable amount of resources at it's disposal, it seems unlikely that it could have produced Dark Age levels of technology on the scale required to be significantly useful during the 30,000s.The infamous saying is that you go to war with the army you have, and that applies here too. The minute the Imperium began to bring new planets and systems into the fold was the minute it began to require resources to control those systems. Even if all you need is an orbital outpost or a regiment of guardsmen, you need to provide the materials or equipment needed to assemble and supply them. You need to be apply to supply this stuff thousands and thousands of times over, at the bare minimum. This is not to mention the vast armies raised from them and required to subjugate them, or the ships to provision them, or any of a hundred other things.This is the type of footing the Imperial economy was on during the Emperor's direct reign. It was geared towards providing for these things, a real war economy, and not for the development of new things. While the investment this allowed in expansion would pay off eventually, and did to a degree, it's unlikely the Imperium experienced immediate benefits from most of it's new annexations. One of the biggest problems they currently face is that they’re still stuck on the war economy setting, and have never had the opportunity to make much for advancements in any other area.I think this is upheld in canon, too. Even if the Emperor were a giftes scientist, it could contribute to the relative stagnation of technological development after the Emperor was wounded — while he was able put the required effort into the development of much of the infrastructure and technology required for war, he had no chance to do much else in those regards. After his incapacitation, humanity was left with even less knowledge of truly advanced technology, and still could not afford to focus on independent rapid development of it or the means to produce it. Ten thousand years later, there is likely enough established control in many areas that an exceptional individual could co-ordinate the required resources, but few exist and none have the Emperors knowledge. The organization required to build this technology simply doesn’t exist. Even where relatively advanced things are produced, such as baneblades or plasma guns, they are unable to be truely mass produced.The value of STCs, even in 30k, seems to almost imply much of this too. Not only do they contain the designs for advanced technology, but they contain the required information on how to effectively mass produce it. Things like the Leman Russ (originally a tractor) and the Terminator armour (a mining suit) indicate that even when the Emperor was active, it was easier to adapt established designs intended for mass production and mundane purposes, than to use the technological insights learned from the STC to redevelop more specialized technology the Emperor may have been familiar with.Anyway, really long ramble.

Over the millennia this stagnating gene-pool has created more cosmetic mutations: obesity or anorexia, bulbous facial features, large ears and withered limbs are all common amongst the nobility of the Navigators. More sinister mutations are hidden from view, the worst sufferers hiding within the privacy of the palaces, never to see the light of day, their hideous deformities hidden from the Imperium behind a mask of wealth and luxury.

If you are perfect in your field then you will automatically make the way and suppose you are not able to get a job and you are a master in your subject you yourself will create or innovate something in one or the other way.,"90,346 followers",Alisha Talks,21.9K,910,103.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Has-technology-reached-its-near-peak-or-will-there-be-things-invented-in-the-future-that-will-be-unimaginable-and-what-types-of-things-will-likely-be-invented

In innovation? Yes The Global Competitiveness Report of 2016 to 2017 ranked Israel as having the world's second most innovative economy on the globe. In solar energy? Yes[1]. In cyber? Yes. In medecine? In medical research Israel is by far better than both and it is best in the world per capita[2]. In practical medcine Israel is about the same as Japan and better than Germany. For example in all major cancers survival ranking rates Israel is placed far higher than Germany and usually in top 3 or 5 in the world. In male life expectancy Israel is ranked higher than both, if you factor out war related deaths and terroist attacks Israel takes the first place in the world with ease [3]. In air force[4] and intelligence? Yes . I would argue that israel is even more advanced than the USA in Cyber and intelligence[5]. It's just that Israel does much more classified work which is desperately kept discreet. Israel is more advanced than both in agriculture and farming related science and inventions. Israel is more advanced than both in terms of patents and creative scientific publications per capita. Israel has more academic educated people than both of them per capita. In the modern era Israel has put out more world first-class mathematicians, computer scientists, musicians and chess players than both[6] . Israel has many top class computer scientists and is a superpower in computer science [7]. Israel has won more Turing awards for computer science than both of them combined not even per capita ( per capita Israel is no. 1 in the world). The list goes on and on. The problem is that mostly these things are not so prominent to the average people because they are just good on measures of ‘per capita ‘ and ‘average ‘. But the fact that these countries are at least ten times Israel’s size confuse us and make them in some sense more prominent . For example, there are more academic degree holders in Israel per capita than in Germany , but there are probably more degree holders in Germany in terms of absolute numbers than Israel so eventually it should make Germany stronger and more advanced but only due to the bulk got me??? Israel is almost the best in academic publications , inventions and stuff. And Israel has the highest number of scientists and technicians per capita in the whole world, but it is also very very very VERY small which lets other countries catch up with it in absolute numbers.Now imagine how would Israel have looked like if it was 10 times bigger (80000000 ppl) ? Scarry , isn't it? Too strong to compete with.[1] From Wikipedia “Israeli engineers have been at the cutting edge of solar energy technology” it doesn't specify what it means. But it does provide a hint that Israel was a pioneer in solar energy since 1950. And Wikipedia states that “Israel is now the world leader in the use of solar energy per capita”[2] From Wikipedia “Israel is a world leader in medical and paramedical research, and bioengineering capabilities. Biotechnology, medical, and clinical research account for over half of Israel's scientific publications, and the industrial sector uses this extensive knowledge to develop new pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, and treatment therapies.[67] Among other areas of medicine, Israel is a leader in stem cell research, with the largest number of articles, patents and research studies per capita,[68] as well as research into regenerative medicine and medical marijuana.”[3] Israel is ranked no. 2 in the world for male life expectancy.

Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party. Because radiation from nuclear accidents is apparently scarier than way more people dying of regular pollution constantly and the total annihilation of all life on Earth as the oceans boil away.","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,631,1.5K,2.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Warhammer-40k-Is-it-true-that-during-the-dark-age-of-technology-when-the-Aeldari-and-humanity-were-at-their-peak-they-had-non-aggression-packs-or-alliances
