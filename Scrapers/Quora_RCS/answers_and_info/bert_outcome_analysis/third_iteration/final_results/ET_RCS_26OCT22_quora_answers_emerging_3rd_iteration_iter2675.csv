Overseas trade was so important, in fact, that for the only time in Chinese history the Southern Song Dynasty of the 1100s AD and 1200s AD had its capital on the ocean, in the modern-day port city of Hangzhou. (All Chinese capitals before and since have been deep inland, far away from the coast, like Beijing. Most Chinese dynasties except for the Southern Song deeply distrusted trade and the powerful, rich merchants that trade tends to foster.)The below is a model replica of a Southern Song Dynasty ship of the 1100s AD. It was quite impressive, being bigger and more technologically sophisticated than any ship being built in the world at the time. These ships had huge rudders and divided sails that efficiently tacked to the wind, and compare favorably to the Spanish galleons that the Europeans used for their exploration and colonization in the 1500s and 1600s (an example which is below the Southern Song Dynasty ship picture).China’s seafaring technology reached its apogee during the Ming Dynasty, in the early 1400s, when the Yongle Emperor recruited one of his trusted eunuchs, Zheng He, to sail the “Treasure Fleets” to demonstrate to the world the power and riches of China. The Yongle Emperor was, as far as I can tell, the only Chinese emperor since the Tang Dynasty who seriously considered maritime exploration as a primary tool to expand Chinese influence, and who put huge amounts of resources into making it happen.These “Treasure Fleets” set out from Nanjing, the Ming Dynasty capital at the time, and went throughout the Indian Ocean, some making it all the way to the East African coast. There were 7 expeditions that took place between 1405 and 1433.The below is an example of how sophisticated China’s shipbuilding technology had become. The very big boat was one of the flagships of Zheng He’s “Treasure Fleets”, which sailed from China to Indonesia to India. The much smaller boat was the European flagship that Vasco Da Gama, the Portuguese explorer, used to sail around the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa on his way to “discover” India in 1498. That flagship was at the cutting edge of European sailing technology. Just look at how massive the differences were in technological know-how.Below you can see a whole “Treasure Fleet” decked out, sailing the seas. Each fleet contained hundreds of boats, each boat with hundreds of men. In total, around 20,000 people would be on board one of these fleets, which made a fleet as populous as a contemporary city and the largest armada of its kind in the world at that time. And these fleets sailed for thousands of miles per trip. It was quite impressive. By contrast, Vasco da Gama’s fleet in 1498 contained four tiny ships and at most 170 men.China, as a result, would’ve crushed Europe if it had been competing as a colonizer in the early 1400s.Alas, that was not to happen. China after the Yongle Emperor’s death in 1424 and the last “Treasure Fleet” in 1433 turned in on itself and began to close itself off from the outside world. Subsequent Ming emperors dismantled the great ships of the “Treasure Fleets” and used the huge amounts of money devoted to maritime exploration into building the extremely expensive Great Wall, and into building and maintaining huge armies to ward off the newly powerful Mongols on the northern borders.It was a bad time for China to cut itself off, as it was during the 1600s and 1700s that Europe began to grow technologically by leaps and bounds. And it was colonization, and the continual competition it fostered among small European kingdoms (small in comparison to China, that is), that caused these technological leaps and bounds.It was the centralized nature of the historical Chinese state that led China to not explore, colonize and expand outside its immediate sphere of influence in East Asia.In the 1,400 years after China attained in the Tang Dynasty the technological, logistical and resource capabilities of carrying out long-distance colonization, there was only one period of sustained political division of warring small kingdoms similar to what characterized Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire—the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (五代十国), which ended in 979 AD when the Northern Song Dynasty was founded. This period of disunity only lasted around 90 years or so. Otherwise, all emperors who founded dynasties after the Northern Song Dynasty just took control of the previous dynasty’s powers with a rebellion or rebellions. As a result, there were no “warring states” that preceded the Yuan Dynasty, the Ming Dynasty or the Qing Dynasty.Because of a highly centralized state, any decision that happened in the imperial court either advanced or stopped projects that could lead to colonization. It’s not a great leap of logic to think that if the Yongle Emperor’s “Treasure Fleets” had continued for another 100 years after 1433, that one or two high court officials or emperors would’ve thought it would’ve been a good idea to take some land—and thus colonies—in exchange for all the money and trouble they were spending on these huge maritime expeditions.Unfortunately the Ming court turned very conservative after 1433, concentrating its energies on land-based enemies, mostly the Mongols. The Qing court after 1644 continued with that same land-based foreign policy, very much ignoring what was happening in maritime technology. And both the Ming and the Qing courts remained deeply distrustful of overseas trade, regulating and controlling it with a weird anti-outsider paranoia that kept foreigners and Chinese traders heavily monitored and restrained. It was an almost 180 degree policy turn from the openness, trade-friendliness and cosmopolitanism of the Southern Song.The Europeans, because they were so politically divided, did not face the same problem of over-centralization of exploration and colonization decisions as happened in China.Christopher Columbus is a great example of this.Columbus had this rather crazy idea that if he sailed due west from Europe, that he would eventually hit Asia on the other side. Astronomers and other learned men in various European courts countered that this was impossible since, considering the circumference of the Earth known at that time, he would have to traverse an ocean 15,000 miles wide to get to Asia. Columbus thought not, that the ocean was just a mere 3,000 miles wide and that he would have enough supplies to make it across to Asia. Neither astronomers nor Columbus, of course, knew that a huge continent lay in the way.Columbus, with his new ideas, first went to the King of Portugal to see if he could get the money for his expedition. The King conferred with his experts and advisors and turned Columbus down on precisely the grounds I gave above. After a few years, Columbus went to the King of Portugal again, and again the King turned him down—this time because Portuguese explorers had just rounded Africa and the King needed to conserve his money for expeditions to India. He then went to the courts in Genoa and Venice in Italy—at that time very rich cities capable of giving him the ships and money to sail across the Atlantic. They also turned him down. He sent his brother to the King of England to see if he could sell that court on his expedition idea. The English King turned him down. Columbus was finally down to the Spanish court of Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand. Isabella remained skeptical, but Ferdinand became intrigued. Columbus finally convinced him, he convinced his wife, and off Columbus went in 1492 with the necessary ships and money to cross the Atlantic.So Columbus had to be rejected by 5 rich and powerful monarchs before finding one who had enough faith in him to give him the money and ships he needed.And even if he had failed with the Spanish monarchs, Columbus could still appeal to and convince the King of France, the King of Scotland, the various kingdoms and rich city-states in Italy that were not Genoa and Venice, the Pope, the King of Denmark, the Holy Roman Emperor, and the various kingdoms and city-states of Germany. Columbus, in other words, had a lot of choice in finding his “venture capitalist investor” so to speak. His goal was to clinch one sale with one single monarch to be successful.Imagine doing that in China—a Columbus-like explorer with a crazy exploration idea would only have one court to go to, the Ming court. And if the emperor turned him down, that was it. End of story. There was no other recourse, there was no choice at all.So it was this hyper-centralization of the historical Chinese state that strangled what little appetite there was for exploration and subsequent colonization among the Chinese.","33,159 followers",Susanna Viljanen,903,10.7K,164.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-china-not-conquer-the-world

9,"Thanks for the A2A,Thanks for the A2A,The same hard driving, laser focused goals applied to other industries too. More example, when China decided to build a high speed national rail network, Japanese and German companies were invited to bid on the projects. The needs quickly overwhelm the technology being offered and China has to go on its own. This mostly due to the fact that while others may have some forms of design, China is the only one that implements civil engineering projects on a massive scale. Those foreign companies were using China to prove out their design and learn anyway, so why not do it yourself. If you looked at scale, which other countries need to design road bridge robots, because it is building so much roadways.So, the answer is that China didn’t do all these in the last few years. They made a national priority to raise the standard of living, move up the manufacturing food chain, and in the near future self reliance on technology.

Earlier, Australian Department of Defence banned employees from using the Chinese app WeChat citing security issues and the app could be used to sabotage an election. Australia also banned Huawaei for 5G testing. In 2010, the then head of Australian mining company Rio Tinto’s iron ore business was jailed for 10 years on charges of corruption and stealing commercial secrets. Stern Hu, an Australian citizen of Chinese origin, was released earlier in 2018 after serving eight years. His incarceration came as Rio Tinto and China were engaged in a heated negotiation over the iron ore benchmark price.Detention of Wang Weijing, Huawei’s sales director in Poland, showed the US-China rivalry over technology pre-eminence has spilled over into Europe. Although Huawei sacked the arrested sales director, its position became worse after detention of its CFO Sabrina Meng Wanzhou (also daughter of founder of Huawei who had PLA links) in Candada’s Vancover on 1 December 2018. The founder Ren Zhengfei of Huawei Technologies says the tech giant would reject requests from the Chinese government to disclose confidential information about its customers but the reality is all Chinese companies, as per law must comply with Chinese government requests. Chinese smartphones are claimed to have been fitted with chips that collect personal data and buses in the US are alleged to have listening devices in seats.Hiding one's military background is believed to facilitate the overseas visa process. International suspicion about Chinese activities abroad has been growing this year, pushing Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and the U.S. — a group known as the Five Eyes alliance — to increase cooperation against potential Chinese interference in their respective markets. Recently a German media report quoted an anonymous official saying that there are 250 Chinese spies in Brussels. Some sensitive persons were even warned to avoid going to specific restaurants and cafes. The intelligence service of Lithuania, a country with a population of less than 3 million, released an annual report saying Chinese espionage has become a threat to the country's national security. Lithuania's report makes us Chinese feel the country is playing up to Washington and following the West's steps in preventing ""China's penetration."" The Lithuania report was issued after a similar one by Norway.Many Chinese military scientists working on strategic research at Western universities have deliberately concealed their ties to the army, according to new research.In a report, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) said it discovered two dozen new cases of scientists from the People's Liberation Army (PLA) — the umbrella term for China's ground, naval and air forces — traveling abroad ""using cover to obscure their military affiliations."" ""These scientists use various kinds of cover, ranging from the use of misleading historical names for their institutions to the use of names of non-existent institutions,"" the Canberra-based think tank found. Most were Australia-bound and studied topics such as hypersonic missiles and navigation technology. The majority came from top Chinese military academies such as the National University of Defense Technology, which is led by the state-run Central Military Commission. Other popular destinations included the European Union and the United States —countries that view Beijing as an intelligence adversary. These nations, however, may be oblivious to their inadvertent role in China's military advancement, according to the report's author. ASPI's findings come amid widespread fears of Beijing using education, spying, political donations and people-to-people diplomacy to gain a greater clout abroad. The issue threatens to further strain relations between China and Western economies at a time when Beijing is dominating the global trade conversation.The Chinese army encourages its academics, who are civilians, ""to work on areas of interest to the military while they're overseas"" in order to leverage foreign training to develop improved technology at home, Joske wrote.

The are feeling the heat as they felt anxious about what they perceived as an increasingly hostile climate towards Chinese students in the US. The Trump administration’s tough China policies have added to the difficulties some Chinese students were having in adapting to Western schooling. Amid employment and visa uncertainty, some had extended their graduate studies’ time limits to improve their chances of winning jobs or US citizenship. More than 360,000 Chinese nationals study at American higher education institutions. Trump’s policies, however, may well be reversing the influx of students from China – and that could be good news for Indian students.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo cautioned U.S. allies on 11 February 2019 against deploying equipment from Chinese telecoms giant Huawei on their soil, saying it would make it more difficult for Washington to ""partner alongside them"". The United States and its Western allies believe Huawei Technologies' apparatus could be used for espionage, and see its expansion into central Europe as a way to gain a foothold in the EU market. ""We have seen this all around the world, it also makes it more difficult for America to be present,"" Pompeo told reporters during a stop at the U.S. embassy,"" referring to Huawei equipment. ""If that equipment is co-located where we have important American systems, it makes it more difficult for us to partner alongside them."" US-China cold war on technology has just begun and China is to be blamed for this as they were secretly stealing or arm-twisting other developed countries to handover technology. PLA Air Force fighter jets are, for example, reverse engineering copy of Russian jets.The March 2018 report on Section 301 investigation running into nearly 50 pages says China fundamentally has not altered its acts, policies and practices relating to technology transfer, intellectual property and innovation, and ""indeed appears"" to have taken further unreasonable actions in recent months. The report reiterates that China uses foreign ownership restrictions, such as joint venture requirements and foreign equity limitations, and various administrative reviews and licensing processes to require or pressure technology transfer from US companies.Further, China's regime of technology regulations forces US companies seeking to license technologies to Chinese entities to do so on non-market based terms that favour Chinese recipients, it alleged. The report said that instead of accepting the USTR request for consultations on its 30-1 investigation, China expressed ""strong dissatisfaction"" with the US and decried the investigation as ""irresponsible"" and ""not objective"". The USTR said China shows no signs of ceasing its policy and practice of conducting and supporting cyber enabled theft and intrusions into the commercial networks of US companies. This illicit conduct provides the Chinese government with unauthorised access to intellectual property, trade secrets, confidential business information, technical data, negotiating positions and sensitive and proprietary internal business communications, it said. In recent months, the Department of Justice has indicted a dozen individuals and corporate entities directed by the Chinese government to obtain commercial secrets from 15 companies, predominantly in aerospace and high-technology sectors. The facts alleged in these indictments reflect China's ongoing determination to obtain trade secrets and other valuable commercial information in support of China's industrial policy.But going forward, Western governments must deepen discussions on PLA collaboration ""to determine how it relates to national interests"" in addition to enhancing scrutiny of visa applications by foreign military personnel, the report recommended.A well-known case is high-speed rail and Chinese government called the theft the paradigm example of indigenous innovation. In 2004, China’s Ministry of Railways tendered for bids to make high-speed trains reaching 200 kmper hour. To win the contracts, foreign companies had to form joint ventures and make significant transfers of technology to their Chinese partners. Alstom of France, a Japanese consortium led by Kawasaki, and Bombardier’s German subsidiary won parts of the contract. Bombardier-Sifang and Kawasaki-Sifang transferred technology to subsidiaries of China South Rail and Alstom-Changchun transferred technology to China North Rail. Both China South Rail and China North Rail were state-owned enterprises.In 2005, Siemens of Germany won a contract with China North Rail’s Tangshan Railway Vehicle Company to supply technology to build 60 passenger trains for the high-speed railway linking Beijing and Tianjin. The ﬁrst three trains were constructed in Siemens’ German plant, while the remaining 57 trains were made at China North Rail’s Tangshan plant in Hebei, China. Over a thousand of China North Rail’s technical staff were trained at Siemens facilities in Germany as part of the deal. With all the technologies acquired and learned, China has become a strong rival to the world’s high-speed train producers. By 2014, China’s premier Li Keqiang was considered salesman of China’s high speed rail (or bullet train). He went to many counties to sell Chinese bullet train including India (New Delhi-Chennai route). China now has 60% of global bullet train routes and expanding agressively.Chinese hackers have breached U.S. Navy contractors to steal a raft of information, including missile plans, through what some officials describe as some of the most debilitating cyber campaigns linked to Beijing. Victims have included contractors of all sizes, with some of the smaller ones struggling to invest in securing their networks, as hackers over the last 18 months have conducted numerous breaches to gather intelligence, sabotage American systems, and steal intellectual property, the Journal reported. Reuters could not immediately confirm the report. The Journal's report was based on information from experts and officials, who said that Navy Secretary Richard Spencer had ordered a review of cybersecurity weaknesses that led to an initial assessment validating concerns and laying groundwork for a response by the Navy. Officials in the Navy called the breaches troubling and unacceptable, the Journal reported.National Security Agency official Rob Joyce said on Tuesday that in general Chinese cyber activity in the United States had risen in recent months. The digital attacks have targeted the U.S. energy, financial, transportation and healthcare sectors, and gone beyond efforts to spy and steal intellectual property into disrupting critical infrastructure. Chinese officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment but have denied they engage in cyberattacks.Hackers behind a massive breach at hotel group Marriott International Inc left clues suggesting they were working for a Chinese government intelligence gathering operation, according to sources familiar with the matter. Marriott said in December 2018 that a hack that began four years ago had exposed the records of up to 500 million customers in its Starwood hotels reservation system. Private investigators looking into the breach have found hacking tools, techniques and procedures previously used in attacks attributed to Chinese hackers, said three sources who were not authorised to discuss the company's private probe into the attack. That suggests that Chinese hackers may have been behind a campaign designed to collect information for use in Beijing's espionage efforts and not for financial gain. While China has emerged as the lead suspect in the case, the sources cautioned it was possible somebody else was behind the hack because other parties had access to the same hacking tools, some of which have previously been posted online.Identifying the culprit is further complicated by the fact that investigators suspect multiple hacking groups may have simultaneously been inside Marriott computer networks since 2014, said one of the sources.The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not return requests for comment. If investigators confirm that China was behind the attack, that could complicate already tense relations between Washington and Beijing, amid an ongoing tariff dispute and U.S. accusations of Chinese espionage and the theft of trade secrets.Hackers working on behalf of Chinese intelligence breached the network of Norwegian software firm Visma to steal secrets from its clients, cyber security researchers said, in what a company executive described as a potentially catastrophic attack. The attack was part of what Western countries said in December is a global hacking campaign by China's Ministry of State Security to steal intellectual property and corporate secrets, according to investigators at cyber security firm Recorded Future. China's Ministry of State Security has no publicly available contacts. The foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment, but Beijing has repeatedly denied any involvement in cyber-enabled spying. Visma took the decision to talk publicly about the breach to raise industry awareness about the hacking campaign, which is known as Cloudhopper and targets technology service and software providers in order reach their clients. Cyber security firms and Western governments have warned about Cloudhopper several times since 2017 but have not disclosed the identities of the companies affected.British analysts briefed EU counterparts at a meeting on January 28 2019, offering evidence of both software and hardware attacks by the group known as Advanced Persistent Threat 10, or APT 10. They would not give details of the alleged hardware attack, claiming the information was classified. Officials at the meeting discussed potential responses, such as sanctions or a joint warning. The issue might be discussed at a scheduled EU-China Summit in April 2019. The focus on APT 10 is part of a broader clampdown by Europe and the United States on alleged espionage and intellectual property theft by China. The hacker group was at the centre of charges in December 2018 by the US Department of Justice, which accused Chinese officials of orchestrating a decade-long, since 2006, espionage campaign that involved infiltrating companies in the US and more than a dozen other countries.US prosecutors also unsealed indictments against two Chinese men, Zhu Hua (aka ‘Godkiller’) and Zhang Shilongin, for their alleged involvement in the group since 2006. They have been charged with “conspiracy to commit computer intrusions on corporate servers of IBM, HPE (now merged with Perot Systems to for DXC), NASA etc. with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft”, the indictment from the US Justice Department states. Both men worked at Huaying Haitai Science and Technology Development Company and “acted in association with the Chinese Ministry of State Security’s Tianjian State Security Bureau”. So the suspect over Huawai was emerging over a decade. China, however continue its one word denials as ‘baseless’.“For any response against China linked to cyberattacks, the EU’s members would need to agree unanimously that the country was responsible and not all EU members agreed, a source said. Britain is expected to leave the bloc at the end of March. The EU is developing protocols to respond to malicious cyber activities, for instance by imposing sanctions, but it can be difficult to clearly attribute actions to individuals or a nation state.The British foreign office in December 2018 joined the US in pressing the accusations against APT 10, claiming that the group acted on behalf of the Chinese government “to carry out a malicious cyber campaign targeting intellectual property and sensitive commercial data in Europe, Asia and the US”.The US justice department claimed that the group used a technique known as spear phishing, in which emails that pretend to be from legitimate addresses are sent with attached documents and files that secretly install malware if opened. That can give hackers access to a subject’s computer and allow them to steal usernames and passwords, files and other information.US cybersecurity firm FireEye, which has been tracking APT 10 since 2009, said the Chinese cyber espionage group had targeted construction and engineering, aerospace and telecom firms, as well as governments in the US, Europe and Japan in an effort to support Chinese national security goals of acquiring military and intelligence information.Taiwan is investigating six current and former employees of BASF's local operations suspected of leaking corporate secrets to a rival Chinese company. Five employees were detained and one had been granted bail by a court, Lu Sung Hao, Taipei-based director of Taiwan's Crime Investigation Bureau, told Reuters. The prosecution has not filed any charges against them. The case comes amid fears among officials and executives around the globe about industrial espionage by China. The Bureau said in a statement that a senior manager was suspected of stealing electronic manufacturing processes, technology, and other trade secrets, and leaking and selling them to a competitor in China for a high price. The company that paid for the information was identified as China's Jiangyin Jianghua Microelectronics Materials Co., which had offered 40 million yuan ($5.8 million) to the current and former employees in return for the technology transfer to build a factory in China, Lu said. The employees had received a series of payments totalling T$40 million ($1.30 million) late last year in two bank accounts, Lu said. The company, which also said that it owns 58 patents, says on its website that it manufactures and supplies wet electronic chemicals that are used in products like semiconductors and flat panel displays.German chemical company BASF said that only one of the people under investigation is a current employee and that the individual's contract had now been suspended. ""We have taken immediate steps to support the investigation led by local law enforcement officials and protect the relevant information,"" BASF said.The company and the Bureau both declined to provide any estimate on financial losses. Officials in Taiwan and the United States have been accusing Chinese companies of intellectual property theft amid China's multi-billion drive to cut reliance on foreign chips and build up its own semiconductor industry. Taiwan has vowed to defend its chip industry, the island's economic backbone, by tightening its regulations and penalties on corporate espionage.Arrest of Ms Meng of Huawei can be a turning point of China’s global espionage game",167 followers,Tim Brown,806,1.4K,1.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-china-not-conquer-the-world

15,"In a few areas, actually. First is infrastructure. The Chinese planned waaaaaaaaaay ahead while building. That’s why there were ghost cities. The developers built huge communities before they were needed, knowing that large factories were coming soon. Above that is public transportation.

Smaller cities have buses available that will take you just about everywhere within the city and bigger cities have subways as well as buses. For going between cities and provinces, China has a high speed rail system in place that is more extensive than the American highway system! For example: I lived in a city called Nanjing in China - about 200 miles/300 km from Shanghai. I could take a high speed train from Nanjing to Shanghai in about 1.5 hours!In contrast, I took an Amtrak train from Detroit to Chicago (about 300 miles/480 km) and it took over 8 hours!Another area China wins at is public utilities. They provide electricity, water, and gas for billions of people for very affordable prices! I paid maybe a total of $20 (US) per month for all utility bills, whereas it cost me over $100 in America! Atop of that is wireless technology (which is considered a public utility in China). I paid 100 rmb ($15) monthly for 16 GB of 4G data, with 1000 texts and 500 minutes of talk (which pretty much meant unlimited everything for me). In America I pay $50 a month for my unlimited plan. Yes, the 4G is a little faster, but that may just be because I’m not trying to access the foreign web here…A third area (kinda related to the second) is how the CCP controls markets and prices so everyone can live a comfortable life. I ate a big plate of food at a small restaurant for between 10 and 20 rmb… ($1.25-2.50). The government controls the means of production, so there is plenty of food for everyone!I hope you enjoyed my answer!","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-china-not-conquer-the-world

It can do the job, much faster and perfectly.In manufacturing, research and development, and technology India doesn't even stand a chance against China. Comparing the two is preposterous. The pathetic state of Indian manufacturing can be gauged from the fact that 69 years after independence, India can't even manufacture products as simple as earphones. Yes, even your earphones are probably manufactured in China, though they might contain a Made in India tag, to fool the Indians.Comparing the two countries would be a great injustice to China. Most of Chinese people don't want their country to be compared with India, they think of it below their dignity, the same way we think of Pakistan.

For example like Alibaba (Amazon), Baidu (Google), Xiaomi (Apple), Tucent(Facebook), Did Chuxing (Uber),Youku(youtube and Netflix), QQ(Spotify) etc. The list goes on. These companies are financially as strong or sometimes stronger than their American counterparts. Having access to such a large population helps. That the government helps by restricting competition from outside definitely helps a lot.This domination does not end just in technological sector. Siemens and Alsthom had to merge in September this year (2017) to counter CRRC in the high speed rail building industry. This merger will bring a 18billion$ competitor to CRRC which is having an annual revenue of 35billion$. They are very active in infrastructure projects in Africa where the western world is not so involved.The government is stable and enforcing technological advancement with authority (of course it is difficult to enforce such things so hard in democratic countries). Intelligent Steel making , Indistry 4.0 , Driverless Electric buses (running in Taiyuan), Electric Taxis all are examples of Government backed advances. Sometimes experiments fail like the straddling bus in Qinhuangdao. But then such steps help technological advancement.So I would not say that Chinese are the most technologically advanced country yet.
