Others, like IBM, or General Electric are old-guard giants betting on technology renewal. And the list is full of ambitious startups like SpaceX, which is changing the economics of space travel with reusable rockets.1.Nvidia:-These are the 15 Companies that best combine innovative technology with an effective business model and hence they are the most technologically advanced complained of this 21st century human world:Some are large companies that seem to be growing ever larger, like Amazon and Apple. Others, like IBM, or General Electric are old-guard giants betting on technology renewal. And the list is full of ambitious startups like SpaceX, which is changing the economics of space travel with reusable rockets.1.Nvidia:-Though Nvidia still makes most of its money from selling graphics chips for video games, it has established itself as the leading provider of processing power for AI software, and its newer, AI-related businesses are growing quickly. During its most recent financial quarter, revenues from its data-center and automotive businesses increased by 186 percent and 24 percent, respectively, over the previous year. The company says all the major Internet and cloud-service providers use its chips to accelerate their processes, and a number of large carmakers, including Toyota, are using its autonomous-driving technology.$3 billion: spending on R&D to create its new data-center chip.Nvidia CEO: Software Is Eating the World, but AI Is Going to Eat SoftwareThe Race to Power AI’s Silicon BrainsDrones and Robots Are Taking Over Industrial InspectionBattle to Provide Chips for the AI Boom Heats Up2.SpaceX:- ◆In 2017, SpaceX proved it’s possible to fly a rocket into space carrying a payload, bring it back, refurbish it, and launch it again with a new payload. Reusable rockets make space travel far cheaper and faster: they are critical to SpaceX’s long-term goal of establishing an interplanetary transport system. The startup also compressed the time needed to refit its recycled rockets (from one year to a few months) and began preliminary tests of its Falcon Heavy booster, which is expected to be the world’s most powerful rocket when it is completed later this year.10 percent: price discount being considered for customers who agree to fly their payloads on reused rockets3.Amazon:-Industry Connectivity ◆ Status Public ◆ Valuation $479.3 billionAmazon is using a range of AI technologies, including computer vision, machine learning, and natural-language processing, to reinvent mobile computing and shopping. The company’s voice-activated assistant Alexa now controls everything from TVs to cars and is poised to be the next important computing platform. Amazon is also streamlining the brick-and-mortar shopping experience through its Seattle-based Amazon Go convenience store. Customers simply enter the store, scan an app on their smartphones, and walk out with the items they wish to purchase. Amazon uses AI, cameras, and sensors to identify the products they have selected and bills them automatically—no lines or checkouts necessary.12,000: number of programs that software developers have published for Alexa with Empathy4.23andMeA pioneer of direct-to-consumer genetic testing since its founding in 2006, 23andMe ran into trouble in 2013 when the FDA barred it from distributing health information. But this year the regulator changed course and reopened a major business line for the company, permitting it to market genetic reports on risks for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and eight other conditions. After extracting DNA from the cells in saliva samples sent in by customers, the company uses a DNA-genotyping chip made by Illumina (No. 22) to capture features related to health and ancestry—information customers are then able to access online. 23andMe now has more than two million customers worldwide, and its products have been used in a number of research projects, including studies of female fertility, depression, Parkinson’s disease, and even nail biting.1 million plus: number of customers who have consented to have their genetic information used for scientific research5.AlphabetAlphabet’s subsidiaries are technology leaders in AI, autonomous vehicles, and AR and VR, among other areas. Its DeepMind division keeps devising new ways for AI systems to mimic human intelligence and learn more quickly. Its self-driving-car project, Waymo, continues to improve performance and has aggressively defended its intellectual property by suing rival Uber after a top engineer switched teams. Google, Alphabet’s best-known and largest subsidiary, is collaborating with hardware makers to create standalone VR headsets for its Daydream VR platform. The new models will have built-in displays and processors rather than relying on users’ smartphones, and will use sensors to better track peoples’ movements in virtual worlds.40 percent: amount of energy the company says it saves applying machine-learning algorithms from its DeepMind subsidiary to cooling its data center.6.iFlytek:-iFlytek already dominates China’s voice recognition market and is now expanding into voice-activated command systems for cars, homes, robots, and schools. In the past year, it launched systems that enable people to control their cars, TVs, and home appliances via voice; invested in a startup that makes home robots; and established a joint venture to develop educational products that incorporate its instant translation features. It also established a multimillion-dollar fund to invest in AI-related startups around the world. It says that more than 160,000 developers use its software and more than 400 million people use its products.70 percent: iFlytek’s share of China’s market in voice-based technologies.7.Kite PharmaThis immunotherapy company is taking the body’s T cells, which naturally fight infections, and engineering them to fight cancer. It is farthest along with its therapy for aggressive non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, with more than a third of one study’s participants showing no sign of disease six months after treatment. There were two deaths associated with the therapy based on its known side effects—approximately 2 percent of study participants—but it seems to be nearing FDA approval.39 percent: proportion of study participants very sick with lymphoma who showed no sign of the disease six months after a single treatment with Kite’s therapy.8. Tencent:-It’s been a blowout year for Tencent, which owns China’s biggest social network, WeChat, and is also the world’s largest video-gaming company. Though WeChat already boasts more than 900 million monthly active users, Tencent keeps expanding the mobile app so that it now offers messaging, online gaming, shopping, music, videos, and peer-to-peer payments. The breadth of features attracts new users and keeps existing ones active inside WeChat, which enables Tencent to sell more ads and services. In April, the Internet giant passed Wells Fargo to become one of the world’s 10 most valuable companies by market capitalization, thanks to growth in its gaming, online advertising, and payments businesses.50 percent: proportion of WeChat’s 770 million daily users who are on the service at least 90 minutes a day.8.Regeneron:-A well-established biotech with a track record in treating eye and other diseases, Regeneron emphasizes the use of genetic information to focus its drug development efforts. In March it announced that, along with the U.K. Biobank and pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline, it would be sequencing genetic data from 500,000 volunteers to help support research into drug development and the connections between DNA and disease. It’s also put a focus on creating “off-the-shelf” engineered T cells to target tumors without requiring a patient’s own immune cells to be used, an approach that could make this field of treatment much easier to scale. Company revenue for calendar year 2016 was $4.9 billion, net income nearly $900 million.500,000: number of U.K. volunteers whose genetic data it is helping sequence10.Spark Therapeutics:-In addition to its treatment for a progressive form of blindness, the company has also been testing a way to combat hemophilia B, a blood clotting disorder, by intravenous treatment with viruses carrying a corrected version of the gene that codes for a blood-clotting protein called factor IX. This is one to watch because the disease, which affects one in 5,000 men, is expensive to treat conventionally.1 in 30,000: estimated number of individuals affected by the disease, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy11.Face ++ :-Facial recognition services are prevalent in China, and Face++’s software powers many of the country’s most popular applications. Alipay, the popular online payment platform, uses the technology to let users log in and make payments using their face as ID; ride-sharing provider Didi Chuxing uses it to verify the identity of its freelance drivers; and smartphone app maker Meitu uses it to offer highly detailed photo-retouching features. The five-year-old startup is believed to be the first facial recognition “unicorn,” having raised at least $145 million in recent years, including at least $100 million in December 2016.106: maximum number of points on a person’s face that its technology tracks12.First Solar:-Landed some of the biggest solar-plant deals in the world last year, including a 140-megawatt solar farm in North Queensland, Australia, the largest in that country. The company, which develops, constructs, and operates photovoltaic power plants connected to the electric grid, also continues to invest heavily in its cadmium telluride cells, a promising alternative to silicon solar cells that are making big advances. This year is off to a good start too, with the company reporting better-than-expected results in the first quarter of 2017 and raising expectations for its current quarter as well.$2.9 billion: estimated 2017 revenue13.Intel:-Intel is benefiting from a series of AI-centric investments and acquisitions it made to offset the decline of its main market, chips for personal computers. In the past year, it bought the deep-learning startup Nervana, the computer-vision chipmaker Movidius, and Mobileye, a supplier of assisted-driving systems. The Movidius purchase enabled Intel to sell chips to drone giant DJI, while the Mobileye acquisition brought it autonomous-driving partnerships with BMW and Delphi Automotive. In March, Intel launched an AI products group to further accelerate its AI efforts.46 percent: portion of revenues derived from areas beyond PC chips14.Quanergy Systems:-There are many startups trying to create compact, low-cost, high-quality lidar systems for autonomous vehicles, but Quanergy was the first to develop one using solid-state technology, which increases the reliability of the laser-scanning radar. The startup’s lidar is also relatively cheap to make because it uses some of the same materials and manufacturing processes as computer chips. The sensors, which are small enough to be embedded in car headlights, can be used in advanced driver-assistance systems and will be integrated into autonomous vehicles by 2021.$250: price of its S3 Lidar sensors for autonomous vehicles15.Apple:-Derided of late for a lack of innovative new products and tepid customer response to Apple Pay and the Apple Watch, Apple has launched a Siri-enabled speaker called HomePod to compete with Amazon’s Alexa-equipped Echo speaker. It’s also begun to tout its AI chops, including acknowledging its work on autonomous-driving systems. For some time Apple has been quietly hiring some impressive robotics and AI talent for its project, and its history of smart design and smooth integration of hardware and software may prove valuable assets.$257 billion: cash on its balance sheet, more than the entire market value of General Electric.Hope you enjoy.",UNKNOWN,DurgaPrasad (దుర్గా ప్రసాద్),546,183,3.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-most-technologically-advanced-company-Why

No, it’s not the company I’m employed at, my company still has a lot to learn, although is its field (information security), it’s also very advanced.I’m speaking about IBM. And although I have never worked for them, I do study documents and research papers they produce on regular basis. And since the question was about technology advances, I believe this qualifies.Think about it, the company was officially founded in 1911 while some of the core technologies were developed by its founders and contributors in late 19th century. Since then, the computation industry went through a number of paradigm shifts: from mechanical to vacuum tubes, from tubes to transistors and ICs and to today’s cloud computation and virtual IT infrastructure. Many businesses emerged and went broke, but IBM is still there, now getting ready to embrace the quantum computation filed and offering shared access to its quantum computer.Certainly, IBM had its brighter days in the adolescent years of PCs, and its darker days as well. But, up to this day, through support of basic research in the universities to investing into emerging technologies, IBM is maintaining its top place among world technology companies.I cannot name a field where IBM is not present. Cloud computing - IBM was among pioneers. Blockchain - IBM made the source code available one of the first. ML & AI - Watson was one of the first platforms available for businesses.Oh, did I say that they also",469 followers,Daniel Cohort,11.9K,377,1.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-most-technologically-advanced-company-Why

When I was a kid, we could travel between Paris and New York in three hours and a half (if you had enough money to buy a ticket). You could take a Concorde at 9am in Paris and you could land in New York at 6:30 am local time, with a flight time duration of 3.30 hours. Today, if you want to fly to New York from Paris, the average duration of your flight would be 7.30 hours. Then I told him that the Concorde was designed in the 50s and 60s and her first flight was in March 1969. Here you can see a photo of this first flight:So in the XX century, there was a plane which needed less time to fly from Europe to America than another one in the XXI (at least until now).Then I showed him another airplanes that were designed in the ‘50s and ‘60s and began to fly in ‘60s-’70s:1.- A Boeing 747 the biggest airplane in history (passengers of course) until the arrival of Airbus A380:2.- An outstanding Blackbird; one of the fastest airplanes in history:3.- The Grumman F14:And Finally the superb Saturn V rocket -- the most powerful in history until the SLS begins to fly in the following years.So in the 1960s aeronautics and space engineering lived their golden era.

Taiwan is a part of mainland China, even though the US says so but behaves like it is not. Instead of allowing a peaceful integration, the US has done everything in its power, short of war, to oppose that integration.These pressures are political, not economic.
