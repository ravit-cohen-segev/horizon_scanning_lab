0,"Scientists in Australia have developed a bifacial silicon solar cell with an efficiency of 24.3% on the front and 23.4% on the rear, for an effective output of around 29%. In December 2020, UK-based Oxford PV set a new efficiency record for its perovskite solar cells at 29.52%. In 1839, scientist Edmond Becquerel discovered the photovoltaic effect by experimenting with electrolytic cells: during the process, he realised that more electricity was produced if the cells were exposed to sunlight.",78 followers,Mike Hillsgrove,1.5K,4.2K,1.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-modern-innovations-in-solar-power

The sunlight striking the Earth is more than 10,000 times the world’s total energy use, and technologies to harvest as much solar energy as possible are surging rapidly.Since the first commercial silicon solar panels created by Bell Laboratories in 1954, the most common technologies today use different forms of Si-based solar cells and convert up to 20% of the sunlight to electricity. A typical solar cell consists of semiconducting materials such as p- and n-type silicon with a layered p-n junction connected to an external circuit.Sunlight illumination on the panels causes electron ejection from silicon. The ejected electrons under an internal electric field create a flow through the p-n junction and the external circuit, resulting in a current. With a swiftly growing market and the development of creative applications, R&D on innovative solar energy materials is at its peak to achieve maximum solar-to-electricity efficiency at low cost.Three types of highly investigated semiconducting materials of today are crystalline Si, thin films, and the next-generation perovskite solar cells. Apart from innovative materials, creative methods of harvesting maximum solar energy are also emerging.For example, Swiss start-up Insolight is using integrated lenses as optical boosters in the panels’ protective glass to concentrate light beams by 200 times while reaching an efficiency of 30%. Another recent development is the designing of prototypes of thermoradiative PV devices, or reverse",0 followers,Mark Adler,2.5K,755,2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-modern-innovations-in-solar-power

3,"There are a lot of important technologies that we need in order to become a true spacefaring race. If you read through some of the answers you will find that the most common answer is propulsion technology that is capable of getting us to the other planets inside a solar system in a reasonable amount of time and a means to travel faster than light in order to get to other star systems.Well technically that is very important - in the long term.

If you read through some of the answers you will find that the most common answer is propulsion technology that is capable of getting us to the other planets inside a solar system in a reasonable amount of time and a means to travel faster than light in order to get to other star systems.Well technically that is very important - in the long term. So are other technologies like artificial gravity or selfsustaining life support systems. However one of the most critical components is very typically being ignored by most Space-enthusiast and Sci-Fi-fans and is also nowhere to be found in the answers so far:EFFICIENT LAUNCH VEHICLESImagine you want to build a huge ocean faring ship. You’d need lots and lots and LOTS of truck loads of building materials hauled to your dry dock. Those trucks do cost a couple of ten thousand dollars a piece but once you have them the cost of using them is relatively low in comparison to buying materials, components and constructing your ship, as you only need maintenance, manpower and fuel.Now imagine you want to build a huge space faring ship of the same dimensions (let’s call it Enterprise ;-) ). You would still need the same lots and lots and LOTS of truck loads to build it. The problem is that you cannot use trucks as there are obviously no roads into space. Right now you would need to use regular old rockets. One of the most cost effective vehicles to do that today is SpaceX’s “Falcon 9″ rocket. It carries close to 23 tons to Low Earth Orbit (which is where we would construct our ship). That is roughly the equivalent of what a large truck can transport. The difference is that a single launch still costs you 60 million USD and more for each and every one of those lots and lots and LOTS of truck loads you need. And that is one of the cheapest launch vehicles available - if you used a Delta IV Heavy you’d get slightly more to space (28 tons) but at a even bigger price tag of ~350 million USD per launch.The point is: We have a fair amount of technology right now that is readily available or can be ready within a couple of years of decades in order to make a ship to go explore the solar system ourselves, including artificial gravity (by using rotating rings) and engines that can take us there in weeks or months instead of months, years and decades.A part of why it is so expensive is the fact that we dispose of most of our rockets after a single use. The “Falcon 9” is a partial exception as the first stage boosters have the ability to land and be reused, which is part of the reason why it is cheaper than other rockets.So in order to truly get started on being a spacefaring civilization the most important technology is one that can get huge loads to space and back for a fraction of today’s launch costs, so we can start testing and building large and capable spaceships and space stations that will allow us to live in space, work in space, as well as explore and colonize other planets and moons and later build ships that will do the same in other solar systems.THE ROAD AHEADScience-Fiction tends to show us this part as being no problem at all. Shuttles and oher small ships that take of and fly directly to larger ships or bases in orbit are common place in sci-fi, yet they represent the most important step in becoming a truly space faring civilization.But once again SpaceX has us covered in the not-so-distant future - if their plans work out. The goal of SpaceX has always been to go to Mars and a lot of the technology developed by the company has been geared to do exactly what I have been talking about in this answer - bring down the cost of doing so.So in essence the SpaceX BFR launch system is the best bet we have coming up for starting large scale space construction and thus becoming a true space faring civilization.",1 follower,Gordon Strathdee,4K,783,12.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-modern-innovations-in-solar-power

Today, you can get to anywhere in the world within 24 hours. What was it that made us into the globe-transversing race that we are now? The answer is not a single invention, but a series of inventions that applied the technology from previous ones. The starting point was the steam engine. The steam engine kick-started the industrial revolution. Living standards for the average household improved tenfold. People no longer had to spend most of their time worrying about putting food on the table. Instead, they could focus on innovation, education, and other important things. This enabled future inventors to expand their minds, experiment, and build on existing technologies. By the time the Wright brothers had made their maiden flight, there were already rail networks connecting large cities in Europe, America, and Asia.I believe that in order for us to become a space-transversing race, we need a breakthrough in energy. I am currently keeping a close eye on the developments of nuclear fusion. When we finally achieve sustainable nuclear fusion, energy will become abundant. The breakthrough needs to be big enough that it makes the most powerful countries and organizations direct all of their resources into developing this new technology. And just like the steam engine, it will be the new starting point. Living conditions for poor countries will drastically improve and the number of researchers, scientists, and engineers with increase, paving the way for the ‘space revolution’.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-modern-innovations-in-solar-power

7,"I had to sit down and think this one over for a few moments, but surprisingly the answer became rather obvious.

We need cheap launch capabilities and I am not talking about reusable rockets, for no matter how efficient they get they cannot match the cost saving measures, the sheer surface to orbit capacity of many other propposed systems, a number of which we could go and build right now with only a few engineering challenges to overcome.Skytram and the like, that breed of electromagnetic launch systems are a good start. Basically run a tube with the air pumped out up the side of a mountain and electromagnetically accelerate your payload up it and into orbit, it is a space cannon in all but name.You can stick an ablative plate on the bottom of a capsule and after an initial boost fire a big array of lasers at it, boost it up into orbit that way. Combine it with some other launch system as with the one above to put even bigger payloads into orbit.Then you have the launch loop, a giant iron wire that runs around in an oval, one side of it suspended high in the atmosphere. You drop a payload onto it and watch it accelerate away, again through electromagnetic effects. At the highest point it simply flies off into orbit. You don’t need a tunnel for this, which is actually a huge advantage. It is however a few hundred kilometers long and requires a dedicated power station, be it that once the giant rotating cable is up to speed it doesn’t need much to keep it there.Finally we have the orbital ring, again it involves a big iron wire, but this time orbiting the planet, completely encircling it. You basically ‘hang’ stuff from this cable while electromagnetically levitating above it. Then you drop some teathers down to the surface and can take a cablecart from anywhere below it (or a significant distance off to the sides) right into space. This is kinda the ultimate way to cheaply get off the planet, making it as easy as buying a train ticket.There are a few other means as well, like orbital elevators, but we couldn’t build one of those right now given we lack materials of the required strength and we’d need to go tow an asteroid into orbit to serve as the counter-weight at the far end. Everything I listed above we have the technology to make happen now.","5,361 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-important-technology-that-we-need-to-develop-to-turn-us-into-a-spacefaring-race

I don't know if this is the best path for everyone, but it's what I did. I was not working during this phase, and had day and night to study. I treated it like school, took notes on paper and wrote down everything. So here's what you need to know:1. iOS development is primarily done in Objective-C. Obviously you think that's the first thing you'd try to learn, but after a while I found Obj-C difficult to understand and with few learning resources online. Other people and websites recommended learning C first, so I figured I'd strap in and commit to it. I followed ""Learn C The Hard Way"" (http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/) which is free. Admittedly, I skipped some parts and exercises when lazy/frustrated. But it gave me enough of a foundation to start understanding Objective-C. After about 3-4 weeks of daily study, I felt I could start learning more about Objective-C.I then ""enrolled"" in a free video course offered by Stanford for iPhone development on iTunes. I highly recommend this, as the professor is fantastic, and it goes through Objective-C as well as iOS methodologies. His video tutorials even show you how to use Xcode and Interface Builder. You can also follow along with the homework and answers to start practicing your coding. I followed as much as I could before it got too advanced, where I then stopped, and began looking to start making my own projects.I really like following tutorials as a way of learning and I found a ton on http://www.raywenderlich.com/. I simply followed tutorials and re-wrote everything line for line so that I could build ""muscle memory"" so to speak, ingraining common and familiar code into my understanding. Once I knew how to do a few things, like drag an image across the screen, I started to wonder what I could make using the code I already knew. My goal was then to release a simple, polished app to learn how the app store works. After that, you gain a lot of confidence in your abilities. The next project you obviously take on more challenging things, until you get more and more experience and knowledge under your belt and you can produce whatever you can think of.My advice to people learning to programBest of luck.",110 followers,Cory Loo,544,0,0,2012,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-modern-innovations-in-solar-power
