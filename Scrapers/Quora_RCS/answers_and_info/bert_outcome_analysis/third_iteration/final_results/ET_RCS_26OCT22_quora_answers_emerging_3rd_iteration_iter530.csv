Our team at Grammarly has compiled a handy list of common grammatical errors to help make your writing accurate, clear, and professional.Ambiguous (“Squinting”) modifiersA squinting modifier is a misplaced modifier that, because of its location in a sentence, could modify either the phrase that precedes it or the one that follows it.

Our team at Grammarly has compiled a handy list of common grammatical errors to help make your writing accurate, clear, and professional.Ambiguous (“Squinting”) modifiersA squinting modifier is a misplaced modifier that, because of its location in a sentence, could modify either the phrase that precedes it or the one that follows it. In the example sentence, is the subject listening to music slowly or slowly getting a headache? To correct a squinting modifier, move its position in the sentence to clarify to the reader which word you intend to modify.Misuse of lie/layIf you plan to place or put an object somewhere, such as a plate on a table, you should use “lay.” If you intend to stretch out on a bed for a nap, you should use “lie.” The verb “lie” is an intransitive verb, which means it does not need an object. The transitive verb “lay” requires an object.It may take some getting used to this “lay” or “lie” business; after all, misuse of these verbs is common. But if you remember to lay down your fork before you’re full, then you won’t have to lie down later from overeating.Comma splicesHe was very hungry, so he ate a whole pizza.To splice means to connect or join. When a writer joins two independent sentences with a comma instead of separating them with a period or coordinating conjunction, that’s a comma splice.The comma has its jobs to do, but connecting two independent sentences isn’t one of them. Besides, the period gets testy when his sister, the comma, steals his thunder. Periods have their jobs, and so do commas, but never the twain shall meet—unless it’s in the form of a semicolon. Semicolons can also take the place of a coordinating conjunction, such as “and,” “but,” or “so,” among others.Run-on sentencesRun-on sentences, also known as fused sentences, occur when two complete sentences are squashed together without using a coordinating conjunction or proper punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon. Run-on sentences can be short or long. A long sentence isn’t necessarily a run-on sentence.To avoid run-on sentences, see if there is more than one idea communicated by two or more independent clauses. In our examples, there are two complete sentences:Example:Example:Both sentences are complete ideas by themselves; therefore, use a semicolon or a period to indicate that they are separate independent clauses.Using “could of” instead of “could have”“Could have” is always correct; “could of” never is. Writers probably make this grammar gaffe because, when we speak, the contraction “could’ve” sounds an awful lot like “could of.”TautologiesTautologies express the same thing twice with different words. In our example, the word “made” implies that Jack used his own two hands to create the pail. The prepositional phrase “with his own hands” creates a redundancy. Once you know what they are, it’s fun to discover tautologies: dilapidated ruins, close proximity, added bonus, large crowd...The list goes on and on!After reading through this list of common grammatical mistakes, you might be wondering how to remember all these rules as you write.

2,"“Hello, I am struggling to find a job for the summer. Can you help me?”I receive several of these requests every month, on Quora or LinkedIn. I try to be a nice guy and help when I can but a request like that tells me why you are struggling to find a job.“Hello, I am struggling to find a job for the summer. Can you help me?”I receive several of these requests every month, on Quora or LinkedIn. I try to be a nice guy and help when I can but a request like that tells me why you are struggling to find a job.The Importance Of SpecificityRichard Nesbitt and Lee Ross conducted an experiment with Stanford students, who were asked to list the most generous students they knew as well as the most selfish.Lists were created and the researchers contacted these groups, asking them to contribute to a food drive. They split them into two groups, with the difference being instructions given.The first group was given a vague “Dear Student” request asking them to donate food and telling them where they could drop it off and when.The second group was given much more specific direction. They were addressed by name in the letter, given direction on specific foods to bring (i.e. Creamed Corn), a map directing them to the drop box, a specific time to visit and then a follow-up call reminding them of what they learned in the letter.Even one in four jerks showed up with some creamed cornMake It Easy To Help YouWhen I suggest to a job seeker that they need to approach as many decision makers as possible, I often hear “I’ve tried that, it doesn’t work.”Perhaps, you have tried. How many did you reach out to? Five? Ten? How about 500? How bad to do you want a better job?Your alternative is starting your own business and I assure you that you will reach out to far more strangers than 500 to accomplish that.How easy are you making it on those you reach out to? Are you leaving them with open-ended requests to help you?How many decisions do they have to make when they open your email?They now have one decision to make. They can forward the email to someone in their network, who is most likely junior to their position if you did the homework. Or, they can delete your email.It is still likely they will not help you, just like 75% of the jerks in the study still didn’t donate to the food drive. That said, you give yourself a much better chance of sparking an action on your behalf if you are clear, direct and ask for something that requires a quick decision or action.Do the work for the person you need help from. Make it easy to help you.",114 followers,Hemant Sharma,16.7K,151,2.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Who-are-the-top-alums-from-Kellogg-School-of-Management-who-work-in-technology-industry
