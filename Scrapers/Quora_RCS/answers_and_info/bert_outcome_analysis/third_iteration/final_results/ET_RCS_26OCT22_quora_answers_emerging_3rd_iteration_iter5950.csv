But when it comes to actually doing this, the industry is seriously lacking.Shipments are lost, damaged, or delayed too often because of confusion in the chain of custody. For example, many companies have not yet digitized, so their documents must be faxed or scanned. Due to this antiquated process, there’s a high risk of “pen and paper changes,” when someone alters a document, and no one knows who did it, or why it was changed.Even tech-savvy shipping companies can run into trouble. If they’re part of a longer chain of delivery, digital businessesThis causes a lack of trust. If a shipment is lost, you can potentially lose millions of dollars worth of inventory. Needless to say, that’s a gigantic problem. But blockchain has the potential to making shipping more transparent, reliable, and secure.This is a net good that stands to benefit everyone involved in shipping, from warehouses, drivers, customers, and regulators.Here are three ways this technology can usher in a new era of transparency for the industry.1. Blockchain Creates An Immutable Ledger.Blockchain will allow us to easily track changes along the chain of custody. What was modified, who did it, when and why did they do it?The key feature behind this ability to increase transparency is hash functions. A hash is like a mathematical fingerprint, no two hashes are the same. If someone makes a change to a document—even just adding a period, for example—the hash will reflect this. Data is stored alongside a record of who made changes and when, which makes it difficult for someone to tamper with it.Let me give you a real-world example:When independent truck drivers hitch up with major carriers, they often have to make handoffs between trucks. Part of the problem is that many different companies own many different trucks. So, when a driver needs to transport a pallet from Chicago to Miami, he may be dealing with several shippers and vehicles. The chain of command is long, and there’s plenty of opportunities for things to go wrong. With blockchain and hashes, though,This brings some much-needed visibility into the process. And it can also work in conjunction with existing technologies to increase transparency.2. It Offers Synergy With Existing Tracking Systems.Blockchain is certainly revolutionary, but it shouldn’t exist in a vacuum.If you merge Internet of Things (IoT) tracking technology with the distributed ledger, you get an even clearer picture of every step of the shipping process. This will help us determine where and when problems occur.There are so many moving parts, from trucks and warehouses to shippers and drivers. Using blockchain with existing tracking systems will put all the information from the various actors in one visible spot. Let’s say you receive a damaged product. By using IOT with blockchain, you can determine if a certain truck on the route performed hard braking, when that happened in transit, and which driver was responsible for it.Layering IOT on top of blockchain also comes in handy when transporting perishable goods. Think about food, for example. When refrigerated trucks are moving consumables to other refrigerated trucks and warehouses, you’ll be able to track the temperature while the items are in transit.Besides limiting spoilage, this information will increase safety and accountability throughout the entire supply chain.3. It Allows for Secure Oversight and Accountability.International shipments can be problematic for regulators, who have to contend with missing paperwork, documents that don’t arrive in time, and fraud. In the U.S. alone, there’s about $30 billion of reported cargo fraud and theft each year. Because many companies don’t report this, the actual number is much higher.But with blockchain, shippers can provide regulators access to a private key—allowing them to immediately confirm that all the documentation is there and track any edits made. This increases efficiency, for sure, but it also minimizes fraud. Companies who try to dodge customs by under-declaring an item will no longer be able to fool regulators.This oversight and accountability, then, will have positive effects on the economy. Regulators will be able to more accurately assess duties, tariffs, and fines—and the proper taxes will be collected more easily.It doesn’t stop here: the benefits go beyond economic. Using blockchain in the shipping industry will also make us significantly safer. Think about all the dangerous items that could be included in a shipment but not declared. Blockchain technology, combined with sensors that weigh and analyze the contents of cargo, allows the shipping industry to be transparent. We will be able to say with certainty: this is what’s in the cargo and here’s the ledger as proof.Shipping and logistics is an old industry, but we’re already seeing a lot of interest in adopting blockchain technology to increase transparency. This will benefit everyone and bring positive changes including cutting down on paperwork, improving tracking of shipments, and reducing fraud.","84,238 followers",Igor Markov,3.3K,3.9K,49.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-are-emerging-technologies-shaping-the-future-of-logistics-in-India

It is not an exaggeration Bechtel can build entire cities, industrial complexes, and power grids from scratch.Fifty years ago, that was rather special, because Bechtel already had a CV that included the Hoover dam, and BART. In more recent years, Bechtel’s major projects include Boston’s Big Dig, and the Channel tunnel linking the UK with France.Pretty impressive, by any standard. If you have a difficult civil engineering project, Bechtel is the go-to contractor if you need been-there, done-that expertise. It has been the top U.S. contractor for 21 consecutive years, according to the ENR.How much revenue did the top U.S. contractor generate last year?About $25.5 billion.Now let’s cross the Pacific to China, a flight from first world to third to look at the Chinese competition.What’s China’s Bechtel?I would wager a bet very few have heard of this company:CSCEC, or the China State Construction Engineering Corporation.What was their revenue in 2019?1.2 trillion RMB, or $171 billion—almost 7 (yes, 7!) Bechtels worth of business.With a list of completed projects that include:The world’s first operational 3rd gen EPR nuclear power plant in Taishan.Tesla’s Shanghai Gigafactory 3.The Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center.The Guangzhou Opera House.The Xi’an Daming palace.The Shanghai World Financial Center.The $1.4 billion Wuhan railway station.The iconic CMG HQ in Beijing.The Macau Tower.The futuristic Baoan airport.The Haixia Olympic Center.The Chongqing International Convention and Exhibition Center.That is what one third world EPC is capable of, in terms of sheer scale and complexity.What’s my point?Fifty years ago, Bechtel was special, and operated in the rarefied air of exclusivity.Two decades into the new century, third world “upstarts” operate on way greater scale and have just-as-impressive references.The difference this time? They are significantly cheaper and faster while staying on-spec.Which is the same story you will find across the industrial spectrum. There may be few Chinese brands you’re aware of, but I bet there are numerous Chinese-made products in the average household, especially critical components of electronics found in everything from throwaway flashlights to the latest iphone.China has consistently delivered on-spec products at unbeatable prices and speed for decades. That is why she is the world’s factory—entirely on merit.I once asked an industry veteran why businesses are unable to resist the allure of China. He explained it wasn’t a matter of choice. If his competitor moves his factories to China, he has to follow suit or risk irrelevance within a decade. In other words, business models are turbocharged with Chinese production. Unless you have a niche market with moats and high walls, you die, even if you are brontosaurus size.All that talk about IP theft and forced tech transfers is way off base. The companies that went to China made decisions with their eyes wide open. They caught the prevailing wind which blew them into China’s embrace. In fact, many couldn’t wait to get in bed with the Chinese after catching wind of their competitors’ bottomline post-China.Notice the elevated proportion of those 25–34? That translates into tens of millions jobs that won’t be filled by those coming after them (the 10–24).Notice the elevated proportion of those 25–34?

But senior Beijing officials do not plan to discuss the two biggest requests that the Trump administration has made over the past several months, according to people involved in Chinese policymaking.The US Government wants to extort from the Chinese people at least $100 billion per year. They aren’t talking about offering the Chinese people anything of value in return, they straight up want $100 billion per year, let that sink in deeply.This isn’t trade, it is stealing, it is extortion. It is a direct violation of your human dignity and your right to your earnings from trade and working.This is what the US Government thinks of you, this is the level of respect they have for you.If China abandons her long term plans to develop the nation, industry, infrastructure, public education, the people, national security and future then it will forfeit any and all rights to self determination and human dignity as well to a Mass Murdering Thief called the US Government.Surely the Chinese people have more human dignity and human potential than to surrender to the subhuman whims of the US Government?Additional Content & Updates:https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/the-latest-china-says-us-side-to-raise-zte-case-with-trump/2018/05/04/97225652-4f78-11e8-85c1-9326c4511033_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.bba79370f84b6:25 p.m.The Trump administration wants China to reduce the trade deficit with the U.S. by $200 billion by the end of 2020.A U.S. official confirmed the authenticity of a document making that and other requests presented to China ahead of trade talks that ended Friday.The four-page list also included demands that China immediately stop providing subsidies to industries listed in a key industrial plan. The list also includes a demand that China end some of its policies related to technology transfers, a key source of tension underlying the dispute.So now the US Government is officially demanding $200 billion per year from China, up from $100 billion.

Project Managers include both Chinese and local Americans with the end product being a convenient community where you can live, play, hang out at Cafes, shop for fresh seafood and bakery, park your cars, charge the EVs and keep a full staff of American workers employed everyday to maintain the building and handle administrative duties.That’s win win and is made possible by Chinese owner investors who are willing to commit for the long term and don’t feel like they are being made out as the enemy.
