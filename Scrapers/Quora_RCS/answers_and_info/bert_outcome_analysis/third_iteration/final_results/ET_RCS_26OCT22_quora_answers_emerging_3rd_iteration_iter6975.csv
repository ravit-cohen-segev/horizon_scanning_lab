If you get offended by this then I apologize.Africa was at one point more advanced than Europe with many earlier empires like the Abyssinian empire, the Mali empire, the Songhai empire, The Aksum empire, The kingdom of Ghana, The Mossi empire and The Benin Empire. I bet you have no idea that any of those empires ever existed.Empire # 1: The Benin empireEither way The Benin Empire was famous for killing an entire convoy of British soldiers in the 19th century and they had gold streets and wealth in every region around the time period and in its general area. They were also famous for controlling the European trade routes for over 4 centuries. Yes, an African country did bully the entire European continent at one point.Not only that but the empire also designed advanced techniques to create exquisite pieces of art not seen in the world at that point in time. It pretty much stated that it was a empire of art and wealth and everyone who passed it knew about it.Empire # 2 : The Mali EmpireThe Mali empire rose in the 1300s and they controlled more territory than any European country ever had, for over 400 years. It was the first country to ever have a proper constitution in the world, the Kurukan Fuga. The city of Timbuktu for years was the centre of learning in Africa and it garnered the most wealth in the region in that time period.Not only that but the empire was a world leader in arts, culture, literature, and was the world’s university for many years, which is pretty impressive considering the desert landscape of the environment the empire was located in.Empire # 3: The Aksum empireThe Aksum empire at the time of origin was one of the worlds first superpowers, in its time period, which is notable considering the countries position at the top of the horn of Africa. It also was pretty advanced in navigation as they had discovered the countries of China and India years before anyone around the general area of the tiny kingdom had even left their countries.They also developed an advanced alphabet system known as the Ge’ez script, which was notable for including vowel sounds in a language which was one of the first vowel sounding languages.","7,305 followers",Nadhiya Athaide,7K,563,13.3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Why-has-Africa-historically-never-been-technologically-and-militarily-as-developed-as-the-rest-of-the-world

Obviously from theCities however do not live on cosmopolitan elites alone. They require food, and resources. That is where trade comes in, specifically,To give you an idea of how important trade was/is:I am Igbo.So having established the importance of trade to “civilisation”’s progress, I’m putting it down as my marker for the primary cause of divergence between Western Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa. Precisely, the differing capacity in the products that could be ferried by the trade. The trans-Saharan trade helped spread ideas like paper and writing; the city of Timbuktu for example, had plenty a scribe with knowledge of Arabic that would have come in handy translating certain recipes. There however was a limit to the amount of goods a caravan as opposed to a galley could ferry. Keeping it short, the cities of sub-Saharan Africa did not have the advantage (as Rome did) to have Egypt serve as a bread basket.This and a shifting style of agriculture put their cities at a demographic limit. I would using the East-Afrian coastal entrepots of Kilwa, Mombasa e.t.c as a baseline put it at upwards ofOne day, the people that built those smack-dab in the middle of sub-Saharan Africa just up and-left. That Eastern and Central Africa are prone to famines so devastating they remained a central part of folklore across centuries, I’m sure had nothing to do with it. In times of famine, trade helps by shifting resources from thriving regions, to starving ones. The existing transport infrastructure, could not facilitate this.Also with hindsight, we know that all that sailing across the Mediterranean and the Baltic came a bit, just a bit in handy when a certain Genoese discovered the new world. If only camels could cross the Atlantic.Why did you fail us ohh ship of the desert!If you’ve followed me thus far, you might get the sense that I find the idea of continent-wide analyses as less than ideal. You would be correct. It isn’tShifting your question. The cities of Africa managed through various points in its history to approach the development levels of its continental competitors. They were however restricted by factors already mentioned from scaling up, and leveraging global resources to devastating effect, as the cities of Western Europe would.Fun-fact,But? But? what of North Africa! They had all the advantages you say were conducive to development and yet they were still curb-stomped by mighty Europa.

6,"Africa was indeed often as developed and often more developed than Europe throughout recorded history. The following is but a small selection of some of the many contributions Africans have brought to the surrounding world, in no particular order.Much of Europe’s technological development was brought to Spain by black Africans during the time the Iberian peninsula was under Moorish control (711ce-1492ce).In earlier times the Phoenicians, originally from the Middle East, established many wealthy and developed ports in north Africa. One of these, Carthage, battled Rome for control of the MediterAfrica was indeed often as developed and often more developed than Europe throughout recorded history. The following is but a small selection of some of the many contributions Africans have brought to the surrounding world, in no particular order.Much of Europe’s technological development was brought to Spain by black Africans during the time the Iberian peninsula was under Moorish control (711ce-1492ce).In earlier times the Phoenicians, originally from the Middle East, established many wealthy and developed ports in north Africa. One of these, Carthage, battled Rome for control of the Mediterranean and almost won. Even today the exploits of Hannibal, an African general, are taught in military academies.Aksum was another, more successful rival to the Roman Empire, halting its expansion into Africa just as Parthia blocked Rome’s eastward expansion. Many of its leaders were queens, holding power and respect few nations granted women in any time or place.The Medieval churches of Ethiopia, carved out of solid bedrock, rival any of Europe’s cathedrals of the same time (or later for that matter).The relics of libraries, mosques, and fortresses on the Swahili coast remain impressive to those who visit today, and reflect a centuries long cultural trade connecting Africa with Arabia, Persia, India, and even China, at a time when European peasants were huddling in huts, burning women who knew herbal medicines as witches, and shitting in pots which they threw out their windows, not knowing how to build the sewers present in much of the rest of the world, including (you guessed it!) parts of Africa.The language east Africans created to converse with their far flung trading partners is still spoken today: Swahili.The Great Zimbabwe is as worthy an ancient ruin as Angkor Wat or other fortresses found across the globe and quite far south of the equator.Many commercial crops, from bananas, sugar cane, palm oil, yams, and peanuts, came to the attention of the wider world after cultivation in Africa. It is true some of these crops began yet further back in history and location: sugar cane originates in Papua New Guinea and bananas were a product transported by the Indonesians who settled Madagascar, part of the vast international trade Africans held a central and valuable place in nurturing. Coffee comes from Ethiopia, as does the unique grain teff, still cultivated today. Millet is a popular grain also from the African continent and present in much of the beer I drink these days. These and other crops represent an agricultural contribution that should not be ignored.Independent iron forging, a rare technological invention, was part of the Bantu culture of West Africa, and their bronze work remains unsurpassed. Meroe and other east African civilizations exported this technology to Arabia and other neighboring territories, where it was greatly esteemed for its quality.The wealthiest person in history was an African, Mansa Musa. His pilgrimage of Haj is still talked about today.Another African Muslim traveled over three times as far as Marco Polo and his accounts remain read today: Ibn Batutta. Like Mansa Musa, he was a central African.The library at Timbuktu in the midst of the continent was one of the great centers of learning in world history, as was the library at Alexandria centuries earlier during the classical era two thousands years ago.Egyptian construction techniques are admired by engineers world wide even today, in some cases four thousands years after the architects died.The real question here, far too often asked on Quora, is why such blatant ignorance is so common. To that there is unfortunately a simple answer: racism.People don’t believe in their hearts black Africans have accomplished their astounding contributions to humanity across the centuries, so they deny the existence of such accomplishments and pose foolish queries.Those who study history know that until five or so centuries ago Europe, away from the shores of the Mediterranean, connecting its inhabitants with the knowledge and civilization of the Middle East and Africa, was among the most primitive lands found on our planet.Roughly 500 hundred years ago naval technology (much of it learned from African Muslims in Al-Andulus) and gun powder (a Chinese invention brought to Europe via Asian and African trade routes) used in cannons, coupled with a certain amount of ruthlessness and brutality, led to the modern world, for good, and all too often, ill.I find myself reminded of the words of a wise brown man, who started his career defending people of color against the oppression of people of European heritage in Africa a century ago.

There was a balance of power.Things started to get bad for Africa from the time of the industrial revolution. Firearms appeared although during that time they were far from a precision weapon. They were nevertheless sold to our ancestors in exchange for prisoners of war european would turn into slave in the americas. By mid 1800, 400,000 guns were being sold to africans annually [1]. Unfortunately for the african kings, the worst of the worst among those firearms were the one being sold to them.The things really changed after the Franco-Prussian war in the late 19th century. It is during that time that european improved on their firearm technology (loading of the gun and precision of the firing). The military technology of Europe improved drastically during that period and if you notice it is after that war that colonisation of Africa started from the Berlin meeting.European having a clear advantage with their military technology used it oppressively on african and nothing like technology transfer really happened. Even to this day most african countries do not have a military -defence industrial complex.A second boost to the technology advantage of the western world came during the first and especially the second world war (aircraft and space technology, computing, nuclear technology, etc..). No african country benefited from the nazi scientist sharing scheme that occurred at the fall of Hitler. This left african countries in the dust.We have to acknowledge that during more than 60 years (60% of the 20th century), african countries were colonised and the responsibility for development was fully on the invader. Unfortunately the big invaders, France and England did not have any interest in african development. Contrast it to what infrastructure Japan left after the colonization of Korea. The focus of the British and french was just to take the raw agricultural resources and to live a palatial lifestyle in their colonial quarters.Back to our current period in the 21st century, we are unfortunately still in that state in black Africa.

16,"Because USA was actually historically founded as a religiously utopian nation. The earliest settlers from Europe such as Puritans, Catholics and Protestants came for a new start and peacefully practice religion. And the independence of America was religious too, as the slogan ""under god we trust"" and ""God bless America"" implied religion into a nation's philosophy.

17,"Religious freedom.Tocqueville was sent by France to study the American prison system in 1831 but used this as a cover to study American society in general.  His study ""Democracy in America"" is a penetrating and insightful look at early America.  His conclusions are still relevant today in understanding our society.One of his conclusions is that freedom of religion, a completely alien concept to Europeans, fosters greater and more sincere participation in religion than does the forced participation enacted by the European governments.","51,717 followers",Chris Ebbert,8.6K,11.4K,278.6M,2014,https://www.quora.com/Why-has-Africa-historically-never-been-technologically-and-militarily-as-developed-as-the-rest-of-the-world

22,"Blame the Puritans.  The very reason for early settlers to come to the colonies was to practice a stricter form of Protestantism.  Combine this with the ever increasing influence from Latin American - which was settled by the uber- proselytizing Catholic Spanish (and Portuguese), and the current state of affairs seems not so surprising.Also note that the areas with the greatest modern immigration from outside the States tend to be the most secular.Finally, there is the Obama gaffe about folks in the inland clinging to guns and religion.

24,"A2A, thanks. I believe that first and foremost the 1st Amendment created a competetive marketplace for religion not seen anywhere else. Religious competition means that disenfranchised and disillusioned churchgoers can simply join or start other sects.

The monarchy was also the other main driving force in this aspect as far as I understand. Choosing to colonize a new world rather than seek what little comfort and freedom you were allowed in your current state speaks to an adventurous nature, but also one of defiance, so the people that came to America first were quite brave and probably treasonous in some aspects.After both the American Revolutionary War and Civil War, we developed a great sense of self and freedom. The Declaration of Independence, arguably one of the most important documents ever written outlines how exactly individuals should be empowered of their own volition, how the government should behave, and how citizens should behave in the event their government does not. However, this imperative document is still regarded as less important, even by most its drafting members, than the Bible.America has, since before its inception, always believed in a higher power and authority than man. The Constitution of the United States includes many different references to God and that the document exists to outline what God intended for man in many aspects. So, even the United States' founding documents contain dependencies and loyalties to religion. Yes, there is supposed to be separation of religion and state, but rarely are elected officials not religious or announcing they believe in something other than God. It's also political suicide in many arenas to take a purely negative stance towards any religion.The 13th Amendment was also a very important piece of legislation that came out of the Civil War and declared to Americans and the entire world that slavery is not acceptable. Yes, it continued for some time after in America and it was horrible and many ""great men"" were hypocrites in this respect, but both of these events among many others instilled a belief that Americans as individuals were capable of defining what is right and wrong and allowed to define additional moral freedoms and call them God given rights.So, I would say it is a mixture of all of these events throughout United States' history that contribute to a sense of personal freedoms, individual strength, and self entitlement. I don't think this is a phenomenon restricted to religion and I think as the gaps between nations and incomes closes we will see this kind of activity decrease.",UNKNOWN,James W.
