0,"Believe it or not, we actually know quite a bit now about Mars, mostly due to Spirit, Opportunity, the Mars Global Surveyor, and even the Phoenix lander, which confirmed once and for all that there IS water ice on Mars.The 2020 Rover will only add to that knowledge, but the sheer amount of data we have on Mars has grown ten or twenty fold since Spirit and Oppy first landed.

A very good picture of what Mars is really like has unfolded in the last ten years, and that picture is much more clear today. Most of the planet’s surface has now been mapped both in color, and in high resolution.We can now say for certain that there were once shallow seas on Mars, and that liquid water still occasionally makes it the surface, only to sublimate into the atmosphere. The before and after pictures from the Global Surveyor have confirmed this fact. We know there are clouds on Mars, and dust storms that can last weeks or months.We know its atmosphere, and the fact that UV radiation reaches the surface at a rate that would be dangerous to humans, or any life for that matter. We understand that IF, (and it’s a BIG if) there were any life remaining on Mars, it would certainly be found underground and near a water source.We know that the single largest water ice deposit on Mars is underground, and about the size of Lake Superior. We understand that if humans were ever to visit Mars on the long term, that they should be prepared in case of a major solar event, otherwise any humans could be killed in minutes as protons from the sun course through their bodies. Because of this fact, more Mars researchers are coming to the conclusion that any real colony, scientific or civilian, will have to go underground. Mars has little, if any, magnetic field to deflect these dangers. Here on Earth, such storms cause electrical interference. On Mars, they can kill you. The thin atmosphere makes it as dangerous to human life as your average astronaut working on something on the outside of the International Space Station. What NASA doesn’t like to tell people is that if a major solar event suddenly erupts, you can’t actually SEE it until it is upon you, because it comes at you at the speed of light. It goes in cycles, but is still a bit unpredictable.The 2020 Rover will tell us a lot.

The pictures of the landscape from an aerial view will be… absolutely fantastic !Even if it is just 5 minutes or 10 minutes little flight around, it will help us explore the surroundings way better than a ground camera.Then, the Rover will be able to head in the right interesting area.And the helicopter will land on it to ‘recharge’ it’s batteries.How many flights will it be able to do ? Nobody knows, but even just ONE flight will already be an accomplishment.OH ! We’ll have 4K HD video resolution, not black & white blurry photos like Viking !

They just didn’t lose: if a battle was lost, or even if five Legions were lost, thatThe Romans just did notThere were times when Rome lost battles, but it never cost Rome the war. They would win, even if it was through pure exhaustion. Hannibal won every battle, except for one. No matter how well he did, RomeTHEIR EQUIPMENT:The Romans all had iron armor, iron weapons and strong shields, with every Legionnaire given a helmet, sword, large shield, iron chest armor, iron grieves and iron arm guards. They were among the most heavily armored armies in history.Most armies at the time were made of up of roughly 90% Militia and 10% armored warriors. The Militia had light equipment, no armor, and maybe a spear, while the armored warriors sported a small amount of bronze or iron armor. The Romans were more of a 70/20/10 split, though: 70% would have extremely expensive and high-quality equipment, 20% would be Archers and have no armor, and about 10% would be Cavalry. Man to man, they were far better equipped than any other army on earth at the time.THEIR TRAINING:Roman Legionnaires were trained — this wasThe barbarian tribes and other empires would have a small core of trained warriors, but most armies were really just hordes of peasant farmers given a spear and a shield. The Roman Legions, on the other hand, were actually trained before they took to the field. They would drill fighting techniques, working as a unit, how to build forts quickly, and how to take commands on the fly.It is hard to overstate just how important this was. Most nations fielded armies with virtually no training; their men were given spears and pointed in the right direction. The Romans could form complex formations on the fly. They could retreat, turn or advance with only the wave of a flag. They could form into aTHEIR TACTICS:We often have this image of two armies just smashing into one another and the battle being pure chaos. This is actually false, and armies would instead meet up with their men in tight formations.The Romans had a great method for fighting battles:What they would do was organize into big squares, basically. The man at the front would stab and fight for 6 minutes, and then a signal would sound. Once the signal sounded, the Legionnaire at the front would swap with the Legionnaire behind him and move to the back of the square. While there, he could get treated if he were injured, get some water, and then rest for a while.For every hour of battle, a Legionnaire would only have to fight for 6 minutes. This meant that the front ranks of the Roman army were always rested and ready to fight. Other armies did not do this, and after 10 minutes, the men at the front were exhausted and usually killed. While the other army got tired and started to break, the Roman Legions could keep pushing forward all day. These Legions could literally fight for twelve hours andTHEIR ABILITY TO BUILD:Roman Legions could throw up a fort in an hour or two, at the most. This seems crazy to us, but it was true…Roman Legions would travel with all of their equipment. Each small unit of men had their own pack animal, tents, wood, food, water and equipment. Every night the Romans would stop, throw together a makeshift fort with walls, watch-towers and gates, and then rest in the safety of their fort.Just imagine trying to fight an enemy like this. If you gave them two hours, on top of a hill there would suddenly be a fort up there. Taking forts is costly and difficult, and many armies lost to the Romans because of this.At theThere are countless examples of this: they built bridges, massive towers, huge ramps and underground tunnels. They could out-engineer engineers, and were a mobile construction crew that carried their materials with them.THEIR AUXILIARIES:The Romans had fantastic Heavy Infantry, and they knew it. In a stand-up Infantry brawl, Rome was nearly unbeatable, and they conquered nearly all of Europe on the back of these Heavy Infantrymen.However, Rome did not have greatAn auxiliary soldier was a non-Roman soldier that served in the Legions in a specific role. For instance, Caesar utilized Gallic auxiliary Cavalry to great effect, as the Gauls were fantastic horsemen. When Rome conquered some new tribe, they were usually very gentle and non-invasive. They would require men to fight in the Legions, though, and were keen to find good Horsemen, Archers, or other types of Infantry.Rome would go on to utilize these various Auxiliaries to great effect. Sarmatian Cavalry, Numidian Cavalry, Spartan Hoplites, all could be found in the Roman Legions, and this filled any gaps left by Rome's over-emphasis on Heavy Infantry.THEIR LOGISTICAL ABILITY:As I said, the Romans were able to bringFood is often overlooked in the history of warfare. PeopleTHEIR ORGANIZATION:The Roman Legions organized themselves in fascinating ways. The name of the game in all warfare isHere is how the Roman Legion was generally organized:In every Legion, there was a mix of bottom-up and top-down leadership. There were leaders selected by the People, by the Senate and by the Legionnaires. Whenever a decision was made, all three of these groups were represented, and this was an incredibly versatile and organized structure — it allowed for good decisions to be made, and ensured noROMAN MEDICINE:During the life of the Roman Empire, the best most doctors could hope to do was to not make things worse. There were many, though, that were able to make things noticeably better…When injured in battle, Roman soldiers could expect to have their wounds treated, provided they were not too severe. While Roman medicine was primitive compared to our own, it was on the cutting edge of medical technology for the time. Roman doctors took after the Greek tradition of medicine, and approached healing from a scientific perspective, rather than spiritual.Doctors would have a set of seemingly modern instruments (pictured below), and would be able to perform basic procedures to help relieve pain and heal injured Legionnaires. You could even compare this style of medicine to that used in the American civil war.The tribes and empires that Rome faced were not as competent when it came to medicine. The Persians would go on to lead the world in medical technology after the fall of Rome, but this was in large part due to Roman and Greek influence*IMPORTANT NOTEMany people have pointed this out, so I will add it briefly: the army I described above is theI am going to shortly cover it all here, so that everyone can at least have a glimpse of how the Roman military changed over the years:• 509 BC — 300• 300Now, here is the kicker: not only were these men unpaid, but they also bought and financedOnly land-owning citizens could join up, and buying military gear and going off to serve was seen as honorable and noble.

Europeans boast about taking Sicily and invading Constantinople, Bulgarians boast about their early victories, Turks boast about their victories, Arabs boast about the victories.Vandals and Goths were eradicated from Italy and Catholic armies failed to keep permanent holdings in the mainland, Constantinople was retaken some decades later. Bulgarians were eventually conquered and ever since struggling to keep their independence. Turks were almost completely driven out from Anatolia twice and the fact that they stayed has more to due with the mistakes of the Roman emperors rather than the “bravery” of the Turks. Arabs only managed to keep areas where Greeks were a minority.Everyone boasts about their victories and do not talk about their defeats. If Catholics won, Bulgarians won, Turks won, Arabs won, why did they empire last a thousand years with only defeats? It doesn’t make sense. Because the empire was not losing always. After defeating one threat, another immediately took it’s place. When Goths lost, Slavs came in. When Slavs lost, Turks came in. The empire had to deal with not one or two countries but with entire continents on each direction and huge alliances of different cultures. Who else did better?The armies of the Roman empire were effective. What really caused the empire to collapse was it’s ineffectiveness of the court and the nobles.
