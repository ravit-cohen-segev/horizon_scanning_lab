It was easy but a bit mind numbing. There were thousands of these to do and I was just one of the people working on the pile.At first, I worked hard to help clear the queue, but then my boss quit and a new person took over who was disorganized in the extreme. A few weeks into his attempt at managing the department, a major component I needed to do my job stopped working. I reported this to my boss, and to my boss’s boss, and to my former boss. Basically, “um hey I can’t do my job because this program isn’t working.”I was basically told it was being worked on but given nothing else to do.So day after day, I logged in and then proceeded to watch youtube videos, play games, read books… as long as I was near my desk to respond to direct messages (which came infrequently) I was golden. Eventually I got pretty bold and started going to bed to take naps or just heading out to live my life while on the clock. I had the app we used for communication on my phone so if anyone messaged me I could respond from wherever I was and appear totally industrious.I knew I was falling into terrible habits, felt guilty, and figured it was just a matter of time before I was discovered, but this literally went on for 18 months without a single person noticing I was doing NOTHING and getting paid for 8 hours of work a day.Eventually, my new boss was fired or quit. At the same time, the other person working alongside me also left and suddenly I was the only one left. I was by default in charge of the department.Realizing this, I quickly went to work to fix everything. It took several months for me to clear the queue and I worked my butt off. The day I finally caught us up to speed I was heralded as a hero and given a huge bonus and a new computer.I was also given 2 employees to train to work under me to help maintain the newly imparted order. The problem is, 3 employees doing that job is too many. When I evenly divided the work, we had almost nothing to do and could all finish our work in an hour.So eventually I started giving almost all the work to the other two employees and started focusing on ‘running the department’. This was literally the easiest job in the world. Every day I would log in and assign tasks to the two employees, organize all the tables and then basically go back to watching videos online or doing whatever I wanted with the rest of my day while again, getting paid for 8 hours.I am keeping the details pretty vague and writing this anonymously, because that’s what I’m still doing. I do about 10 minutes of work a day and it’s been 2 years.Oh and everyone at the company thinks I’m just wonderful.

She also was not able to reach, lift, bend etc. so cooking, cleaning, and fetching things were tasks I should be prepared for. Sounded like typical home care duties and the lady seemed sweet.My first shift was in October from 10pm to 6:30am. Every night I went into her home and she was already in bed. The house was immaculately clean. The Lady slept through the night and never rang her little bell for the bathroom. I tapped on her bedroom door a few times early on just to check on her, but she always assured me she was fine and she eventually sent word to my agency that she'd prefer I just peek in to check on her rather than knocking and waking her. She also assured me (through the agency) that her day aide would leave a note if there were any housekeeping tasks for me.That was in mid-November, about 5 weeks into the job. Fast forward to the following May… I had literally spent 6 months sitting in this lady's living room watching t.v. or reading. In that 6 months there had been one time that I found a teacup on the drain rack and put it away. Another time, I folded a little afghan that was sort of mussed up on the couch.On this May morning, SHE RANG HER BELL FOR THE FIRST TIME! I was startled and rushed to her room. She asked for a warm wet washcloth to wash her face, but didn't want or need anything else. I took the opportunity to make sure she was comfortable calling me since I am male and had considered that she might not be calling for help for that reason. She assured me that wasn't an issue and that she seldom woke up through the night.I did not speak to her again until the week before Christmas when she asked me to come to work early one night. She had a little snack, cookies, and a gift card for me. At that point, I had been spending 40 hours a week in her home and was just now having my third conversation ever with her.I stayed on that job until I relocated for nursing school and never had any occasion to provide care or even substantive housekeeping task . I just sat there 5 nights a week and got paid for it for slightly 2 years",0 followers,Christian Thompson,5.7K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Have-you-ever-had-a-job-where-you-did-nothing-for-years-and-nobody-found-out

There I was told that before starting the work i will have undergo a 2 week training program and since my manager is still looking to arrange a trainer, I can brush up my coding knowledge in lab meanwhile. Great, i thought.1 week passed and there was no news on when training will start. This was August. I dropped a mail to my reporting manager who said it is difficult to find a trainer for my location so it might take a week more2 more weeks passed, even after dropping multiple mails to both trainer and my reporting manager I got a same reply: please wait it might take a little more timeAfter 2 months i was done with all basic coding assignments given to me and still there was no sign of my training to start. Everytime i mailed i got the same reply, project is in pipeline, it could start anytime soonAfter 3 months this got really boring. No one asked what I did whole day, no one even cared if I even went to training lab or not. Sometimes I would do a swipe in at main gate and go grocery shopping or go for a movie. On other days I would come office for 5 hours which was minimum requirement for my attendance to count as a full day and those days were spent playing table tennis, carrom, darts etc. In meanwhile i would send mails asking when will I get actual work and most of those mails went without replies. In December end I got mail that my training would start from January 14th. I was finally relieved but 14th passed and so did 15th and there were no signs of any training. On raising questions about the training i got the reply that the training was available only on weekends but it was not possible logistically so it had to be cancelled. I stopped asking. Since both manager and HR sat in different office altogether there was no way of face to face communication and no one to really bother me.This continued for 1.5 years. It was the most relaxed time of my life but the worry was always present in back of my mind But I was afraid of quitting since my salary was already way higher than market standards (almost double!) and justifying what I did in previous job would be a task. Eventually I did find an equally paying job although with a lot of struggle but with relevant work since it did affect my profile negatively.Indian service based IT companies can be fickle. Till today i never got to know what happened to my project or training. I wish I would've been informed properly at all stages instead of being given false hopes month after month. But I have no regrets whatsoever because I have made some great memories and friends that time which otherwise i wouldn't have had!",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,8.1K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Have-you-ever-had-a-job-where-you-did-nothing-for-years-and-nobody-found-out

I unfortunately did not qualify for one of the voluntary severance packages as they said that I was a key employee and would not pay for me to leave. I had gone through the emotional turmoil of getting to this decision so my mind was made up to leave. I filled in the normal resignation documentation I received from HR and handed it in to my line manager. He had to check if all the information was correct, sign it and hand it in to HR.To make sure that I have some security in my life, I requested that my full pension payout be transferred to a provident fund. I had saved up some money to be able to start my venture without using any of my pension money.On my last day at work I handed in my Work ID and left without much fanfare as things were still very hectic with the organisational restructure.The next day I started working on my own business venture. I was getting used to the new life of being self employed. Slower internet, new bank account, no longer part of a big company with designated job descriptions. I had to do everything myself. Seeing clients, doing the work and getting my own tea.Things were very hectic for a year and a half and financially very challenging. When I eventually got my act together, I started sorting out all the smaller things that I did not get around to when I first started out on my own.One of the first things I did was go to the bank to close down my old account. I had moved all my debit orders to my new business account and there was no reason to run two accounts. I got the shock of my life when I got to the bank to close the account, thinking there were only a few Rands left. There was almost R500k in the account. I never bothered checking my bank statements when I received them in the post. thinking that there is nothing happening on the account so there is no reason to check. … and I just did not have the time. I thought that the bank had made a mistake so I asked for a 24 month statement. And there is was………. My salary after deductions was being deposited into my account every month.I called the company that was supposed to be administering my Provident Fund. They had never received the money or the paperwork from my previous employer.I called up HR at my old employer trying to find out what was going on but got given the run around and got nowhere.Eventually I decided to go in to their offices and try and sort it out in person. When I got to reception, I gave them my name and surname. And security said “ Oh Mr……., have you forgotten your Work ID at home?” and gave me a temporary ID card and let me into the building.After a lot of toing and froing at HR it was discovered that my line manager never handed my resignation documentation in to HR. I was still in their employ. My pension and medical aid contributions as well as my income tax were still being deducted and my salary paid into my account.I asked how I should return the money seeing that I did not actually work there for a year and a half. The head of HR said that it would be best if we assume that I was in their employ and just did the paperwork for my resignation for the current date. It would save a lot of hassle in terms of the medical aid, the pension fund and most importantly, from the South African Revenue Services.I got paid for not working for a year and a half. The irony is that the amount I got paid in error was very similar to what I would have received had they given me a severance package.Edit 1:Thank you for all the upvotes and comments (especially the ones with the South African slang….. good oneI’m not able to respond to each comment individually thus this edit.The reason I informed them as soon as I found out and did not continue receiving the salary and use itis my own business is because it would have gone against my character.I’m not sure how this situation went unnoticed for the time it did, ( It could be due to the point thatIt is like",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,1.8K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Have-you-ever-had-a-job-where-you-did-nothing-for-years-and-nobody-found-out

Sometimes there was an influx of work so it was tricky to balance both job but I managed. I did this for 3 years. I figured out how to get all my work done while also going to crossfit classes and taking my son to the library, park etc. On one hand, it really was a very cushy gig. How many people get paid a very good salary to do maybe an hours work in an 8hr day and spend the rest of the time tending to their house and child needs. On the other hand, I was mentally bored stiff. Id hated that job since my son was born but its extremely hard to give up an oilfield paycheque, especially when you basically worked 5–8 hrs a week. I was also “chained” to the desk in a sense. Ya i could go places but i risked the chance of my employer calling me for something and me not being at my desk. That pretty much never happened but the guilt was there.Because of my senority, i managed to make it through a couple rounds of layoffs. I eventually became pregnant again which was the plan, then I could justify leaving the job and just staying home. At the end of my mat leave, I ended up getting laid off so instead of walking away with nothing, like was the plan, I left with a pretty nice severence. It worked out even better than planned.Ill always be grateful for those 10 years of employment but Im also so glad I dont work in the oil and gas industry anymore. Im frugal by nature and having to code the invoices of an industry that spends like that, drove me crazy. No wonder our company changed names a bunch of times and went bankrupt the last time.

Justin guessed that the address might be out of date.He went back into the office area, “does anybody have a contact number for Dave?” Somebody did, a UK mobile phone number and the suggestion that he lived somewhere in London. Well, maybe not exactly in London itself, possibly near to London or, at least, in that half of England where London is. Ok, I'll be honest, nobody was really paying attention when Dave left, but he definitely mentioned getting a flight to London.Justin called the number, it was answered quickly. “Hi Dave, this is Justin, your new manager at xxxxxxxx.”“Oh, hiya’, I am just heading out the door to go to the dentists, can I call you back in about an hour or so?”But, dear reader, Dave did not call back. Not even after several hours. Justin called later that afternoon and got several “invalid number” messages before realising that there was no point in trying again.Turns out that Dave (an Australian) had resigned over 2 years’ previously but the HR process had not been followed correctly and they continued to pay him.

The renovation effort was massive. An entirely new team of managers came in to deal exclusively with the remodeling of the store, with their own set of employees.One of the first things they took over was the entryway into the store, where the seasonal aisle and the carts were located.For a little while I tried to join them. I helped get carts and put them in the new area outside the front entrance where they were stored, and when they were all grabbing tables and shelves and other stuff that had to be lugged around, I would belatedly join in and walk the objects back and forth wherever they were supposed to go.They started giving me weird looks and shutting me out. I mean, LITERALLY shutting me out, standing in front of me and blocking me during group meetings, avoiding me during breaks, that kind of thing. After a couple weeks, I took the hint and stopped checking into that area.I started walking around the store, waiting for customers to ask me for help. I would stop by each department and ask if they needed assistance. I swept the floors, front-faced merchandise, re-arranged displays, anything to keep me busy. The regular managers stopped having tasks for me to do, the intercom never called out for a code 70 anymore.Eventually I found a little area in the shipping and receiving section filled with old wicker furniture and all the hooks and tags and hangars from the clothing department. I made that into a little bedroom, and took naps in there and brought in Star Wars Episode I magazines to read. I put together a bike and rode it around the loading dock area. After a while I cautiously pedaled out of the back doors and into the neighborhood. I started calling friends and going to parties while I was still clocked in. I made food for myself at the K-Cafe. One night, I was helping some of the guys unload a pallet and I overheard two managers in the next aisle talking about old employees.“You know who I miss?” one of them asked. “That kid John.”“Yeah,” said the other one. “I wonder what happened to him.”When the summer ended I put my two weeks notice in so I could go to college. The renovation was almost finished and a new GM was brought in to run the whole operation. When I gave him the news he took me aside and told me in confidence that he had really liked what I had shown him, and that he could tell I was headed straight for the top one day. He offered me a position as assistant manager if I would stay.",737 followers,John Hursey,26.5K,286,2.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Have-you-ever-had-a-job-where-you-did-nothing-for-years-and-nobody-found-out

It’s crazy, I know. They’re so fearful of violations, people watch each other and call each other out if they violate something as simple as restocking paper in a printer or wiping up their own spilt drink on the floor.We’ve been though like 7 different supervisors since I started a few years ago. No one seems to notice my job could easily be cut and most of everyone else’s tasks could be automated.Believe me, I am BORED OUT OF MY MIND. At first, it was pretty cool. Now it’s starting to get old and I desperately want a new job. I’m trying so hard.EDITS:No, this isn’t a government job (good guess). It’s actually a huge company in the United States.Many people are suggesting different things I could be doing. I’m able to do some short and discrete things (like checking personal email, read short news articles, etc.) I can’t really do anything like a course or something of that sort because I’m at the front desk of a huge building. People (coworkers, vendors, visitors, etc.) constantly stop by to talk to me. It’s not like I’m tucked away in my own cubicle.Responses to comments (I’ll post them here so I don’t blow my cover.)Cawa - Sometimes I wonder.William Hwang - You’re spot on! All of my predecessors were very good looking women. I’m also female and would consider myself a solid 9.Jon Tucker - I wholeheartedly agree! They do waste a lot of money and offer little to companies.Joe Gonzalez Jr. (and anyone else still asking about my job title) - It’s actually not a receptionist job and I’m not allowed to do anything of that sort. Like I said, strict union rules dictate everything. Also, 90% of the job description was a lie. I don’t do anything remotely close to what you’d think someone with my job title would do.

Firefighters have their own rosters duty and they keep rotating from one centre to another. The senior officer who used to give me most of the work got transfer and he handed over his work to other new officers who had no idea what to do so I never got any query after that. Everyday, toughest task was to decide what to enter in timesheet because I was working there as a contractor. They had contract with our company for multiple projects. Every year I thought that contract of this project is over but to my surprise they kept renewing it!I was there for more than 4 years. Within these 4 years I took maternity leaves 2 times. Each time for 6 months. I felt this job was a blessing for me because I could manage my life with kids very well. I used to pump my milk during office hours for breastfeeding my baby. The shopping centre was right across the road so I used to do all the shopping during working hours. I also used to google everything whole day- vegetarian meal plans, babies recipes, weight loss tricks and what not!Also, being new to Australia at that time, I struggled to understand Aussie accent so I used that time to learn it. I used to spend more time in kitchen because that was the only area where I could get someone to talk with. Luckily all the people there were friendly so always found someone to talk with.Many times I found guilty of not working and getting paid for doing nothing and I also talked with manager to give some work but for him it didn’t matter at all. He just needed a resource to sit there and I was that resource. After 4 years, I started focusing on my career. As one of my kids had started pre-school and another was still young, it was right time for me to switch to better job and my salary was average so I needed more money, too. Being there for so long had affected my career badly bcs I could not upgrade my knowledge and felt out of market. Luckily, I got one with much much better package and I got out of that relaxing job and entered into real corporate world with totally new dreams, new challenges and new struggles.Edit-I saw few negative comments here abusing me. So here is my response for all those people -Before you start abusing, read it twice. I asked for work to manager not once but many times. It was the fault of management. They could end the contract but they didn’t. It was their decision to continue not mine. What will you do if you are not given any work, will you leave the job knowing that it will be hard for you to find another in market and that too at the time when you have just started a young family?No one likes to sit in a corner doing nothing but seeing your career going into drain! I didn’t like it, too. I was hopeful that I’ll get some work after some time but it never happened. I was much relieved when I got out of that job and at my next job I worked extra hours everyday to stay in tune with rest of the team bcs knowledge vice I was far behind them. It took me 5–6 months to update my knowledge. It’s all about situation. I could survive in both - the most boring and then the most exhausting.Edit 2Thank you so much all viewers and for your votes!

In Boston, Mass there were several. One was Franklin St. where NET&T and AT&T shared the building for local and long distance transmission and switching systems.I went to work for NET&T in 1970.Sometime around 1972 I was assigned to work in Boston at one of their larger switching center buildings, to install more gear there. The lead tech on our crew was Henry Hansjohn. He was well regarded and had a reputation for being extremely smart technically, but a person that did not suffer fools. Henry always wore grey… grey shirt and slacks. Always. For this, I thought he got the nickname “the Grey Ghost” for his clothes.I asked him about this… his answer was:“Well, I got hired by the company and trained, then my first assignment was to work at Franklin Street, on the 8th floor.Monday I showed up for work and the supervisor checked his list of guys assigned to him and I wasn’t on the list. The supervisor told me to grab a broom and sweep up and he’d find out what was the story with me. So, I started sweeping.At the end of the week, I came to the supervisor, who was over his head in guys and work, and he said he hadn’t found out yet what I was supposed to be doing or who I was assigned to. He told me to go to the building cashier and see if they had my paycheck, or who had it. Whoever had my paycheck was my boss, he said.I went to the cashier window and a nice woman, the head cashier, checked and said they did not have my check but she would find out after lunch. So, that afternoon I came back and she had my check. I asked her who had had it, and she replied it was delivered to her group as no one knew where it should go. She gave me the check. I asked her what I should do and she replied ‘go back to doing whatever it was you were doing…’ which meant sweeping up. She told me she wanted me to stop by each morning at the cashier window for attendance. I did that every day.Well, I noticed building maintenance wore grey uniforms. So Monday I showed up with grey clothes on and began on the first floor and swept the whole building, then did it again. Friday came and the cashier had my check. She asked me if she could send it to a supervisor to give it to me on Thursdays, and I gave her the name of the supervisor I thought I was supposed to work for. So, she did after that.The next Thursday the supervisor had my check but told me I did not work for him. I asked what I should do, he asked me what I had been doing. I replied sweeping, just like you told me. He said, okay, keep sweeping until I find out about you. While I was sweeping, I had a lot of free time to watch and listen to older guys teach me all about telephone systems. Since there was no time crunch, I was able to study and watch and learn a lot.”A year of this goes on. Henry gets a pay raise and recognition for perfect attendance, yet there is no record of his work and no way someone was tracking his attendance. Henry keeps sweeping.One Thursday, the work on the 8th floor is done and the supervisor and crew are assigned to the Boston Back Bay building to work. Henry asks if he should go with them. The supervisor says, no, because you don’t work for me. Henry asks, then where do I work and who gets my check? The supervisor thinks, makes a call, and tells Henry to get his check the following Thursday from the head cashier and someone will contact him over what his next assignment is.So, Henry starts getting his check again from the woman, keeps sweeping and learning. One of the old guys working in the building on switching systems likes how Henry is smart and puts him in for specialized training. Sure enough, one day the head cashier tells Henry he has been promoted and is being sent for a month of training.Henry goes, learns a lot, gets best grades and results in his class, is sent a letter of recognition for this. The letter, of course, reaches him through the Franklin St. cashier. Henry finishes the school and goes back to Franklin St. The cashier sends him to the VP responsible for the building for NET&T. The VP tells Henry to keep doing what he’s been doing and he’ll find out where he should be working.Henry starts sweeping again.Many months later, after Henry became friends with the team responsible for the huge power plants for the building, he gets another merit raise and sent to a six month school on power systems because the lead guy liked Henry’s abilities and smarts. The raise and school requests were signed by the building VP, even.Henry gets trained, returns to… sweeping. No one knows who is his boss, what his role is, and where he ought to be. He keeps being told ‘we’ll find out, just keep doing what you were doing.’Now, there is one other aspect to Henry… he was an extremely proud Scandinavian, claiming lineage from Leif Ericsson and the Vikings that discovered America. Every Columbus Day, for many years, Henry would march in the Leif Ericsson portion of the Columbus Day parade in Boston (countering the false claim Columbus discovered this place); many times Henry was among the leaders.Well, he would work, then join the parade, then go back to work. So he was in his grey outfit. A reporter from one of the major Boston papers was assigned to interview the ‘nuts and cranks’ in the Leif Ericsson parade, and the grey clad guy in front stood out, so he was photographed with the group’s banner and interviewed. Henry was happy to give his views, tell them he worked for Ma Bell, and that he did nothing for a job.Well, someone in NET&T PR read the article, some VP did too. A hunt was made for this guy that did nothing for work. Finally the hunt came to Franklin St. and the hunters heard about the guy in grey and that no one knew what he did, where he came from or anything about him. He was christened the “grey ghost” and the VP announced he was to be fired on sight. Well, the building VP heard of this and was mad and curious that someone might be feather-bedding in his building. He had a guess it was Henry and knew it all must be a mistake as Henry was one of his best guys… smart, best record at training and the older guys loved him, never a complaint, and perfect attendance.The building VP found Henry and asked him. Henry explained the whole situation. The VP had the biggest laugh over this NET&T typical snafu and he told Henry… go back doing what you were doing. Henry keeps sweeping and learning.This VP then called the VP hunting Henry and told him to stop, then shared part of the story with that VP, who first was mad then laughing. When the hunting VP learned Henry was so smart and good at what he did (helping the old guys working on power) he put Henry in for additional training on the latest power equipment.Henry went to this training and came back ready to either go back sweeping at Franklin St. or do real work. Well, that Monday he arrives at the Franklin St. cashier and they greet him with great news! He is to go to the Back Bay building, report to the supervisor he thought he was supposed to work for first, and that supervisor would assign him work… real work.That afternoon, Henry shows up at the Back Bay building… the supervisor isn’t there. Henry hunts him down at another building, calls, and tells the supervisor he has been assigned to him. The supervisor replies, “first I’m hearing of it. I have no word you’re assigned to my crew. We’re done there and starting a new job at this building. Since they sent you there they must have plans for more work. I want you to report there, call me each morning to report in, and do a full quality check of every new piece of work there to make sure we pass the upcoming inspection. I’ll have the cashiers send your check there.”Henry dutifully did as instructed, making sure the work at Back Bay, even the older work the supervisor’s crew did not do recently, was in perfect working condition. Henry taught himself advanced switching troubleshooting to do this. The Back Bay building was a known poor service system for years that all of a sudden started running flawlessly. (You must understand this was floors and floors of power gear, switching relays, electronics, and hundreds of miles of cables and extremely poor maintenance and installation practices as crews would rush in and rush out as Back Bay was a terrible area to work.)After some months of this, Henry was put in for an award by the building system manager for how he had turned the building around. An inspection team came and gave the whole building, not just the new work, the highest grade possible in its exhaustive check. They also put in for Henry to be recognized. So, he got another award, and a raise. He was elevated to the highest level an hourly employee/tech could achieve. In record time.Still, no real work assignment. Back Bay was running great and there was nothing for Henry to do. He asked his supervisor, whom he had not seen more than once since his assignment there, what he should do. The supervisor called the Franklin St. VP and it was agreed that Henry should be on special assignment to clean up Franklin St. now. But, Henry was to do it just like he did Back Bay… on his own as a one-man crew working for a supervisor he never saw.Henry then worked in Franklin St. for two years cleaning up not only NET&T problems but working with AT&T guys to fix their problems. Finally, one day, Henry had enough. He was at top pay, he worked when and on what he wanted. He still wore his grey clothes to work and he wanted to do something different. And still no one knew what he was doing or whom he reported to.He reported into the building VP and demanded a real job. The VP laughed and laughed. The VP promised to do something about it. A week later the VP found Henry and had him sit for a meeting. The VP told Henry that the personnel department had no record of Henry Hansjohn; the VP had checked several times. Somehow he had an entry in the payroll department, and his awards and training were listed in the building records… but the company had no idea he worked there. Henry was a free man! But, of course, there no such thing as a free man, so the VP came up with a solution… Henry was to continuously rotate throughout all major Boston metro NET&T buildings on his own to do whatever he thought was needed to make them run better, to train new guys on his way of doing things, and to stay out of trouble… all on his own.So, Henry did this for years, reporting daily to the supervisor he never saw, who reported on it to the Franklin St. (now Boston metro area) VP about him.This is how I met Henry. I was a somewhat accomplished tech, but I was a rookie at major power systems. I had been assigned with a small crew to work for an alcoholic supervisor, Jesse, to install the latest in new power systems in the Back Bay building. Now, Jesse had been dried out a couple of times by the company and he was on his last chance before being fired or retired forcibly. Jesse’s wife had recently left him and he was a miserable cussing drunk, but an ok guy otherwise. Jesse was too messed up to run the job and so one day Henry shows up and takes over in his quiet way. My guess is the VP wanted to help Jesse as much as possible..Jesse had met Henry before, when Henry was sweeping up Franklin, and Jesse assumed Henry was there to sweep up Back Bay. Henry let him think that and proceeded to run the crew his way, teach us all a lot, and get a great result from our work. Oh, and Henry showed us how to work smart so that two or three hours of our work netted a day’s work in the view of the company. Thus, we got done ahead of schedule, passed all checks and the systems went into service flawlessly. Just before completion Jesse could not keep up his work and was forcibly retired. We were now a crew without a boss, but we were assigned to Henry sort of. So, we became the grey ghost crew and went on to be assigned to do the same job at another building. And, of course, without a supervisor.We may have lived the rest of our lives out as ghosts except that one of the guys on the crew was dumb… dumber than a sack of sh*t. We had a piece of metal about 15 feet long by 18″ by 1″ we had to get from the basement to the top floor of the Cambridge St. building we were. We had thought about winching it up the rear of the building, but decided the smartest and easiest way was up the stairs. It would take some muscle and some planning, but we could dangle it and slowly move it up in the thin space between stair ways in the stairwell.Well, this guy decides he wants to be real smart. He wants to show us how smart he is and will surprise us, while the rest of the crew was elsewhere, with a trick he thought up. He gets another “real smart” guy and they open the top hatch inside the building elevator and wedge the piece of metal inside the elevator car, sticking several feel out the top. Somewhere between the basement and the top floor, the metal piece caught on some strut in the elevator shaft and buckled, slamming into the neck of the dumb ass. Puts him in the hospital. He sues the company and gets disability for life (yet he was fine). His accomplice escapes without even a reprimand, and the rest of the crew, including Henry, get dragged in front of a bunch of lawyers and VPs.There is shock that a crew has no supervisor and is “running amok.”After several weeks of being in limbo and feeling we were going to be fired, over something we did not even know was happening, we were dispersed all over eastern Mass. to different crews, all with a black mark on our records. All, except Henry. He was just sent back to Franklin St. to await his next job assignment… which meant he went back to sweeping. I heard stories the grey ghost had reappeared there and no one ever knew where he was or what he did.A couple years passed, and I was laid off in Oct. 1975. I went into Franklin St. to get my severance pay and be debriefed by some HR person who let me know I could still work at the company if I wanted to be a part time janitor at some building out in the middle of nowhere. I passed on that and was pretty depressed as my “job for life” was now over and I was lost and pretty down. But, as I was leaving the meeting I bumped into Henry. He was all in grey, a broom in hand. I started laughing and asked him was he really back to being the ghost of Franklin St. He said, yup, been doing it since he last saw me and that he had decided he was in no mood to try and get any other assignment.Never saw him again, other than for another picture in the Boston Globe of a Leif Ericsson rally… led by some ‘grey ghost’ and others.",178 followers,John Egan,697,354,1.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Have-you-ever-had-a-job-where-you-did-nothing-for-years-and-nobody-found-out

What they don’t know is that I have achieved this phenomenal growth by doing nothing.While I do understand that the day they figure out I am dispensable I might be fired, but, I don’t think they will ever take the risk. I was hired based on recommendation of their biggest client and am personal friend with head of their second biggest client (we had worked together in my earlier company).So how do I spend my time each day?Well I read Quora quite a bit, read all the new industry related information (this has inadvertently helped me sound erudite during meetings) , read national newspapers (3 of them), read regional newspapers, stalk people on Facebook, book a meeting room and type something like this: a Quora answer and people think that I am working hard on something.The only time I do work is during performance appraisal of my team (once every year - 2–3 days of work).

After these, I am thinking of picking up Arthasastra by Chanakya.Edit 1:To those who are commenting that I am doing a great job at ‘Managing’, I disagree. I am just fortunate, I have great team and the external business environment is good, hence, the increasing business. If I think it is because of me it will set me up for failure when management skill will really be required. I foresee that happening in 2–3 years (external environment changes).

It seems that the company, which had five locations across the US, was having trouble keeping the production department at the main office busy, so they decided to close down our very successful office and transfer all the work to the main office. They shut down the factory floor, then started laying off administrative employees. The woman who hired me quit. Then I worked for her assistant, who also quit. At that point I was working for the project manager, who was so overworked he also quit, then came back on as a consultant so he’d get paid for his hours.At this point they closed down the office, but kept me on working from home. They sent me home with my computer and some sort of box that allowed me to access their network.That summer things got very busy and I went from 20 hours a week to 32. I quit my minimum wage job at Home Depot (another story) and did this full time, along with other sidework I had. In late August I was contacted by the main office, who wanted to know what I'd been working on. I sent a very complete listing of all the projects I'd done and they were satisfied.In September I went back to 20 hours a week. Of course, it had never taken me the full 20 or 32 hours to do the work they sent me--I'm a pretty good drafter. I figured as log as the work got done on time, they had nothing to complain about. For the first few weeks I got in a regular workload, but then it started to taper off. I contacted the project manager, who told me to hang tight, things would pick up soon. By mid-October I was down to one or two projects a week... then one... then nothing... I touched base with the project manager every week and he told me the same thing--hang in there, work would pick up soon, but it never did, and after a while I stopped contacting him.So for four months I would turn on my work computer in the morning, check the email to see if there was anything for me to do, then sit around and do my own stuff waiting for something to come in. It never did. Nevertheless, every Friday I would submit a time card for 20 hours of work, and every Monday I'd get paid. I figured it was like being on retainer. I was ready and rarin' to go on anything they sent me... they just never bothered to send me anything.In February I got the phone call I'd been dreading—client’s main office asking me for a list of projects I’d worked on. I tried to fluff up the minimal work I'd done, but had to admit that it had been slow and I hadn't had any work at all that month (or the previous three months, but I didn't mention that). She cancelled my gig on the spot. I then got a call from my agency complaining that the signage company had raised holy hell with them about me. I said, “Look, I've been begging you for the last year and a half to find me a new gig and you never did. I’m not my own manager, you are, but you never checked in with me. It’s not my job to inform you that I should be terminated, it’s yours.""I figured that was the end of my relationship with the agency, but a couple of weeks ago someone else from their office contacted me and placed my in another position. So go figure. It's all water under the bridge when money's involved...","1,279 followers",Walter Konrad,1K,636,3.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Have-you-ever-had-a-job-where-you-did-nothing-for-years-and-nobody-found-out

19,"I had a summer job working for the state of OK. Enough time has passed now I’ll go ahead and say - it was for Parks and Recreation Dept. Essentially, my job was to get the snail mail correspondence out to all the state parks and other entities in the state. We did this about once a week, to about 100 locations.These offices did not have computers in most of them - maybe only 10% did (yes, this was a while ago). So, the job was to print the correspondence, put the printed copies in the typewriter (yes typewriter) and fill in the blanks, then print the address labels, and send them out.Turns outI had a summer job working for the state of OK.

So, the job was to print the correspondence, put the printed copies in the typewriter (yes typewriter) and fill in the blanks, then print the address labels, and send them out.Turns out with focus, I could easily do this job in probably 2 days, leaving the rest of the week free. So, I would do other little tasks and study or read when I could get away with it.Now, being bored, I even read the typewriter manual. And there it was. The typewriter was actually programmable! So, I set about putting every address into memory, and setting up each required typing task for the pre-printed letters so that all I actually had to do was feed the letters into the type writer. The envelope labels printed with the touch of a button. First week after doing this I was done in about an hour. The office manager seemed confused. She asked me if I was going to do the mail this week. I told her that it was already done.The second week, I did it again and now she asks how I could be done already. So I explained that the typewriter is programmable and I programmed it to do the mail. Strangely, she did not look happy. Now, when I went to do the next batch, I noticed all the programming had been erased. Strange but I figured I must have made a mistake somehow and erased it. This time, I meticulously reprogrammed the type writer and made sure the programming stayed through any power conditions (by unplugging the typewriter overnite, etc). Everything was fine.You can probably guess the rest. I ran the next batch and then found the programming erased again. At that point, I knew that somebody had to purposely do that with a factory reset or something. I’m certain it was my boss, the office manager. You see, she oversaw the budget that the job was being paid under (and she and her boss’ mission was to grow the budget, not shrink it). Also, I’m sure she was afraid that she might look stupid because something that took a week for the last 15 years could be done in a hour. I tried to explain the typewriter programming and what was going on to a fellow long-time employee. Blank stare and confusion.

21,"Yeah, for about a year and a half. I used to work for a pretty large research company, and all I did was process emails throughout the day. It was a contractor position.

Basically, we sold research, like reports and articles written by our analysts. We also did inquiry calls with said analysts.Here’s how it works:Wondering where I come in?Well, obviously things don’t always go perfectly like in the above scenario. There are communication mishaps and misunderstandings all over the place, lots of back-and-forths. Anybody who has ever sent a work email knows what I’m talking about.Most of the back-and-forth was to figure out what exactly the client’s question is and if we can help them in the first place. Keep in mind that these inquiries are highly technical and sometimes required multiple calls with multiple analysts to figure it out.And that’s where my role came in to play. The specialists don’t have the time to answer emails all day because they’re trying to help answer inquiries, finding research and talking with analysts. All of those little back-and-forth emails were filtered through me and a co-worker, or co-contractor. (About 2 contractors per team, over a dozen teams) It may sound like a lot on my plate, but we were instructed not to communicate directly with the clients. So what the hell did I do you ask?Here’s what the contractors did:That’s it. That was my job.I had two monitors connected to a laptop that was provided by the company. My setup looked like this, except my laptop was open so I had 3 screens.Email on the left and software system on the right. So I would copy everything from the email on the left and just paste it on the right. And then I just forwarded the email to one of the 8 specialists on my team and said, “Please follow up, thanks!” The whole process probably took about a minute. It didn’t matter how long the email was or what it said, I didn’t even have to read it. The only reason I opened the emails was so I could copy the text.I’d say I averaged about 2 hours of actual work a day, and it mostly came during the first hour of the day due to the backup of emails from the previous night.So what did I do all day? I read up on QuoraSo yeah I basically watched Twitch for 7 hours a day for a year and a half and got paid to do it.It sucked.I ended up getting let go because they thought I was playing video games at work.","90,289 followers",Alisha Talks,21.9K,910,103.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Have-you-ever-had-a-job-where-you-did-nothing-for-years-and-nobody-found-out
22,"This is far more common than people realize once you get in to upper management of large corporations or government agencies.

I’m in a CEO level position of a large corporation, and while it can be a pressure cooker environment at times and while I can be fired or removed at any time (i.e. no union protection or employment contract), there are large swaths of time where I have very little to nothing to do. That’s primarily because there is such a large middle management structure at my company. I have so many assistants that handle all the mundane day-to-day stuff, I often have little to do unless there’s a big highly visible project that the board wants my face and name on.So what DO I do? My time is primarily spent on e-mail or social media (and places like Quora, where I’m at right now typing this while I’m at my desk at work), reading various news sites, or perusing industry journals or websites. I’ll walk around the office and visit with people, try to be visible and approachable. Offer advice on something if asked. Sometimes I’ll focus just on personal enrichment or knowledge as well. Like on a particularly slow Friday I’ll commit myself to studying everything I can about the US Civil War, the causes and implications of Brexit, or the history of apartheid in South Africa. I also get a nearly unheard of (at least in the US) amount of paid vacation each year, about 8 weeks. If things get too boring it’s pretty easy to just go home for the rest of the day.That’s not to say I never do actual work. As I said, sometimes it can be a pressure cooker. I can, at a moment’s notice, be called in to a 5 hour meeting with the board or other corporate officials. My weekends can be “cancelled” if something major comes up. It’s not unheard of for me to have to work 15 hour days when tons of meetings hit the schedule all at once. I hate those days because I don’t get to see my kids at all. They’re still asleep when I leave in the morning and they’ve gone to bed by the time I get home. I’m responsible for the overall budget (although assistants handle the day-to-day monitoring). If something goes wrong or something goes over budget, I’m the one who is held responsible. If there are major disciplinary issues or terminations or lawsuits, you guessed it, I’m the one at the front. Lunch and dinner meetings with board members or politicians are common and essentially an unwritten job requirement. It’s your kid’s birthday but the board president wants to schedule a last minute dinner meeting? Sorry honey, daddy will give you your present in the morning before you go to school. Sometimes I’ll spend all day on the golf course with a board member, VIP, or major donor, just because I’m the CEO and I’m expected to. I hate golf.At the end of the day, they pay me an ungodly amount of money for not a lot of actual “work” compared to what all of my assistants do. While it may sound like a dream job (and believe me, I fully realize how lucky I am), there’s still a lot of uncertainty that goes with it as well. Unlike most of the people who work for me, my job is completely “at will.” I’m only in the board’s good graces as long as things are running smoothly. If something bad happens, they’re not coming after my middle managers, they’ll be coming for my head. And while I make good money, I tend to live just within my means (which is typical for the majority of people). If I were suddenly unemployed I’d have to find work pretty damned quickly to survive, just like most rank and file employees. I have no “golden parachute.”",84 followers,Gaye Bockman,1.3K,76,172K,2018,https://www.quora.com/Have-you-ever-had-a-job-where-you-did-nothing-for-years-and-nobody-found-out

He was a big, grumpy bully, refused to engage with meetings or the team and insisted on having the corner desk, where no-one could see him. His supervisor was pretty weak and let him get away with this. With a little monitoring and measuring, it became pretty clear he was only doing a fraction of the work of his colleagues. I had IT check his internet usage, and insisted he move desks. It turned out he and his brother ran a roofing business, and he had been doing all the sales and administration whilst pretending to to work, bullying his colleagues whilst making them cover for his lack of work. Sacking him was especially satisfying, and the team actually became more productive, despite being a man down.Another time, for a large private sector firm, I discovered a guy on the payroll who was supposed to be an account manager. However he only had two active accounts and visited them maybe once a month each. He spent a day a week in the office and the rest of the time… who knows. I never did get to the bottom of what he spent his time on, but he quit shortly after this all came to light.More annoyingly, I helped re-organise the finance function for a large, established Government arms-length body. There was a very experienced and skilled accountant who worked for 3 weeks of the month producing a very detailed report on various aspects of spending and assets. He would produce this 150 page report every month, print it, bind it and have it delivered to the Finance Director. His secretary would then carefully file it in a cabinet full of similar reports. It turned out there had been a need for this 15 years or so back, and he’d just kept producing the report. However, we’d changed FD 3 time in that time and it was impossible to tell the last time the reports had been read. What made this especially frustrating was that this guy worked diligently, yet poor management and a shitty culture meant that he’d wasted something like 10 years of work, a quarter of his career and his employers probably over half a million quid of public money, on filling a filing cabinet.","47,948 followers",Jedidiah Benhur Margoschis Wisely,23.4K,168,18.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Have-you-ever-had-a-job-where-you-did-nothing-for-years-and-nobody-found-out

And on month ends, my paycheck miraculously appears in my account.Frankly speaking; I was gradually becoming comfortable with the status-quo, but after 7 months, words started to get around that there was a staff who has been practically doing nothing for months on end. Consequently, I got summoned by the upper management echelon.When i got there, I could sense an air of hostility mounting up within the gathering. I greeted everyone respectfully and sat down. Then they started quizzing me; we were informed that you haven't been working nor coming to work for several months, Why, or what do you have to say about that? After a few seconds of silence, I managed to muster up my defensive line of response. I started… well first of all, it's a little disheartening for me to be summoned here based on spurious allegations that borders on hearsay. If i haven't been been putting in my required amount of work nor coming to work as alleged, don't you think the best person to confirm this from is my boss? So why don't you ask my boss? (my boss doesn't even know i exist as he hasn't been coming to work himself).Then they became weak and all agreed that they should have confirmed from my boss first. The meeting was thereby dismissed and they promised to get back to me with further information pertaining to my case after getting in touch with my boss. But that was the end of it, the year rolled by and nothing was made of the issue again and I went back to being the ghost worker that i was.Finally, the contract job came to an end at the stipulated time.
