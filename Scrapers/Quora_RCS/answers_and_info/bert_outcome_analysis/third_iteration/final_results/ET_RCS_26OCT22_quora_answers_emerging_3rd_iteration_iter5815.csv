This is because the regular river floods made for fertile soil around the banks and the rivers could also supply fresh water to irrigate crops.

This is because the regular river floods made for fertile soil around the banks and the rivers could also supply fresh water to irrigate crops. It’s no coincidence that as agriculture allowed for denser and denser populations along with more specialized societies, some of the world’s first civilizations developed in these areas as well.Mesopotamia is thought to be one of the places where early civilization developed. It is a historic region of West Asia within the Tigris-Euphrates river system. In fact, the word Mesopotamia means ""between rivers"" in Greek. Home to the ancient civilizations of Sumer, Assyria, and Babylonia these peoples are credited with influencing mathematics and astronomy.

2,"If your univ is trying to commercialize the  technology, it means someone is facing the problem and experiencing the pain without any real or decent alternative.  You have to validate if 1.such a problem exists 2.there are no real alternatives or existing alternatives are not good enough 3. people or businesses willing to spend the money . In some cases, you might realize that your technology is too early for the market in which case people cant envision and understand the value your tech brings..which means they wont pay the price you desired...In summary, it doesnt matter whether its emerginIf your univ is trying to commercialize the  technology, it means someone is facing the problem and experiencing the pain without any real or decent alternative.

3,"For startups, customer discovery is a challenge in itself. Startups got so enchanted with their brilliant idea they forgot that there should be a problem it has to solve.The best thing startups can do during customer discovery is to keep in mind that they deal only with assumptions, not solid ‘real-deal’ data. It is not possible to know who your customers are and what problems they face until you ask them about it.Startup ideas can be all the way brilliant, but rarely unique. Your customers weren’t born yesterday with the problems they face, so somehow they’ve dealt with it and lived. The poinFor startups, customer discovery is a challenge in itself.

The point is to create something more efficient that will solve that problem.So here are some tips for startups that are confused with customer discovery could use:","135,544 followers",Hector Quintanilla,15.1K,1.2K,88.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Mesopotamian-civilization-emerge-and-what-technologies-promoted-its-advancement

So the ""sins"" of religious sects have almost nothing to do with ethics.Perhaps you're a proponent of ""my body is a temple,"" --a quasi-religious tenet of the Me Generation-- in which any violation of one's fleshly house of worship becomes a moral wrong. In which case are cheeseburgers an ethical problem too?I'd be seriously happy to discuss this further if you'd kindly define your terms.",326 followers,Anubhav Jain,4K,4.4K,123.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Mesopotamian-civilization-emerge-and-what-technologies-promoted-its-advancement
5,"There’s no real possible way to rank different developments. And the environment is being impacted most by fossil fuels. Although there is an amazing array of things happening in energy, what really is changing the world is the rapid drop in cost of new wind and solar technology in late 2017. Solar farms, projects over $50 million and 50 megawatts (generally) are now cheaper sources of new electricity than existing old fully paid-off fossil and nuclear power - by a long shot in most cases.For the last forty years new energy efficiency has saved more energy than new generation or new productionThere’s no real possible way to rank different developments. And the environment is being impacted most by fossil fuels. Although there is an amazing array of things happening in energy, what really is changing the world is the rapid drop in cost of new wind and solar technology in late 2017. Solar farms, projects over $50 million and 50 megawatts (generally) are now cheaper sources of new electricity than existing old fully paid-off fossil and nuclear power - by a long shot in most cases.For the last forty years new energy efficiency has saved more energy than new generation or new production of any sort has produced. But efficiency could be regarded as a steady state if you don’t have a legislative and regulatory mix which does the things necessary to make efficiency happen. For example, the U.S. spends about $8 billion per year on utility efficiency, and saves about $30 billion per year as a result, but we could double the savings in a matter of months simply by raising the efficiency program activity in 44 states to the level of the best six states. Don’t count on it.New wind and solar capture the profit motive of private investors in a way that efficiency cannot. In the next year or two we may actually see wind and solar growth overtake efficiency savings. Most people couldn’t care less about that.But the U.S. added enough wind last year to reduce fossil electricity consumption by more than 1.5%, and about 40% as much solar, not including rooftop solar. This is happening globally, although I do not have or track global data the way I do with U.S. data. China built three times as much wind as the U.S. did in 2020, which is more wind than the entire world built in 2019.Literally countless technologies advance because electricity becomes cheaper and more plentiful. Most of the things in Mr.Kumari’s list are advancing specifically because new wind and solar provide cheaper power in places that did not have it before. Many more advances are happening without the public fanfare, just because this world is a large and complex place and we don’t have the ability to consolidate all the information in some ways which might be useful.Electric cars, heat pumps, chemicals and plastics feedstocks from hydrogen made from renewable electricity - all follow. By itself we could have the largest economic growth period in human history just because of wind and solar costs. Together with all the other things, it is harder for us to screw it up. But the more people we have thinking about what this means, the less likely we are to screw it up. How many wars have been fought over fossil fuel resources? That won’t be a thing any more.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Mesopotamian-civilization-emerge-and-what-technologies-promoted-its-advancement
