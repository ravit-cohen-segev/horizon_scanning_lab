I am within a couple of weeks from having a practical purpose prototype that will actually lift into the air. The Centrifugal Propeller will replace all jet engines, rockets, and most air and marine propellers. It will also be used for lifting purposes both commercially and domestically. It has no speed limit in outer space because it will continually accelerate.","135,551 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-ten-emerging-technologies-that-will-define-the-next-fifty-years
