A few years ago, only Germany and Japan could build machines that could do the job, and China had to remain dependent on other countries for boring tunnels. Not until they decided to build this monster:Very few countries, not more than 3 or 4, can manufacture these machines. India has to import all TBMs, we don't have any capacity to build one.They also have this monster:It is used to build railway tracks. It can do the job, much faster and perfectly.In manufacturing, research and development, and technology India doesn't even stand a chance against China. Comparing the two is preposterous. The pathetic state of Indian manufacturing can be gauged from the fact that 69 years after independence, India can't even manufacture products as simple as earphones. Yes, even your earphones are probably manufactured in China, though they might contain a Made in India tag, to fool the Indians.Comparing the two countries would be a great injustice to China. Most of Chinese people don't want their country to be compared with India, they think of it below their dignity, the same way we think of Pakistan. They like to compare their country with countries like America and Japan.Images source:",189 followers,Prashant Kumar,5.7K,428,335.2K,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-advanced-technology-India-has

By splitting the question I get a frame of reference and then the answer becomes fairly straight forward to comprehendThe answer to the first question is straight forward and India is much advanced compared to where we were in 2000. I am not going to elaborate this further because its for us to see. But should we be happy about it? That leads us to my second questionWhile it is true that India has advanced immensely in the last 20 years, the real question is has this made us more dependent on other countries? Most notably the United States and recently China?Despite having a population of 1.3 billion people and being touted as the software superpower (thanks to the IT services industry) not so long ago, India does not have self-reliance when it comes to technology. China created companies like Ali Baba, Baidu and Tencent a parallel to the American tech giants while India (even India’s telecom minister recently) takes pride in being the largest consumer of Whatsapp, and Facebook! Yes almost everyone has a mobile phone in India today and therefore the opportunities for growth is tremendous. But the real question one should ask is, who will be the beneficiaries of these opportunities? The mobile phones used in India are Chinese phones and the software used in these phones are U.S owned. Basically all our data, from our shopping habits to our entertainment preferences are in the hands of foreign technology companies. Now we know IoT is catching up fast and that means more control to these companies and India will be a proud consumer supplying data.One of the many important aspects discussed in Rajiv Malhotra’s latest book “Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Power, Five Battlegrounds” is India’s military dependence on foreign technology. While the manufacturing of Rafale jets will happen in India, the technology is owned by the French and let’s understand when such technology transfers occur between countries, the supplying country will always provide a technology that is one generation behind to the consuming country. That means we are technologically and militarily advanced compared to our previous generations but we are at least one generation behind the innovating countries! In certain areas like military that is not good newsMy last point on this is our pride in our Human resource and how skilled we are! Yes as individuals many Indians are CEOs of big foreign tech giants. But how does that benefit India as a nation? Do we have a stake in the intellectual property of these products? Can we say for instance Sunder Pichai as Google’s CEO holds the same clout in his company as Mark Zuckerberg holds in Facebook? Certainly not! Let’s not confuse individual brilliance with technological advancement as nation.For India to have a grand standing in the world stage as a technologically advanced nation, we need to come out of our consumer mindset and to quote Rajiv Malhotra’s words “be producers of knowledge and technology”.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-advanced-technology-India-has

The Iron Pillar of DelhiThe Iron Pillar is famous for the rust-resistant composition of the metals used in its construction and has been standing tall for some past 1600 years.The pillar has attracted the attention of archaeologist and materials scientist because of its high resistance to corrosion and has been called a testimony to the high level of skill achieved by the ancient Indian iron smiths in the extraction and processing of iron.2. SanskritAccording to research, Sanskrit is one of the most suitable languages for the computers. It is considered to be very efficient in making algorithms. In a report given by a NASA scientist, it is said that the USA is creating the 6th and 7th generation Super Computers based on the Sanskrit language.According to NASA, Sanskrit is the only unambiguous language in the world meaning it is the only language that is not open to more than one interpretation of something.Now no one could have created such a logically accurate and intelligent language accidentally and this definitely would have been a work of some intelligent person(s).3. Time TravelIn Hindu mythology, the Mahabharata mentions the story of King Raivata and Kakudmi, who travels to heaven to meet the creator Brahma and is surprised to learn when he returns to Earth that many ages have passed.Although the idea of time travel hitting someone's mind maybe considered as a sheer coincidence but even a slight thought of time relativity striking in someone's head can't be ignored and it forces me believe that our ancestors do had the knowledge of time travel and may even had done one.4. The Great Pyramid of GizaThe level of skills and technology of the people of Egypt was such that even if we tried to build an exact replica of this pyramid it would not be possible. We do not have the precise technology that the ancient Egyptians had that was necessary to build this pyramid.and now some mythological facts…5. Head transplant of GaneshaIt is said that once there was a battle between Ganesha and Shiva for Goddess Parvati and in the process Shiva beheaded Ganesh.After learning who Ganesha really was, Shiva decided to bring him back to life and told his entourage to bring the head of the first sleeping being they found with it’s head facing towards the North. Well, the first thing they found was an elephant, so Shiva attached the elephant head to Ganesh’s body.Which signifies that very complex surgeries like that of head transplant was possible with the technology of that time.6. Predictions of MahabharataThere are several predictions made in the epic of Mahabharata about today's world which are more or less accurate and clearly describes today's society which speaks volumes for the astrology of the past.7. Flying chariot in RamayanaThe flying chariot as described in Ramayana:""8. Adam's BridgeRamayana describes the construction of a bridge from India to Sri Lanka (1.2 million years ago).The fabled bridge that was constructed by an ape race on the orders of Lord Rama, in the Treta yuga, which according to Indian time or yuga cycles, happened 1.2 million years ago, was discovered by a NASA space satellite. It has been dated 1.2 million years, thus putting it in the time-frame of it’s so-called construction. The bridge, called Adams bridge, a 30km long chain of shoals has been characterized to have a man-made structure.Based on these mythological facts some would feel it's all talking in air, but I do believe these so called gods might have existed long time back on our earth and could have been possibly belonged to some higher races who had more advanced skills and technology then we haveShivaRavanaDurgaBrahmaCheers!!!","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-advanced-technology-India-has
4,"IndiaIndiaIndiaIndiaIndia's analytics industry is expected to touch US$ 16 billion by 2025 from the current US$ 2 billion, as per the National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom).With support from the government, considerable investment and development has incurred in different sectors such as agriculture, healthcare, space research, and nuclear power through scientific research. For instance, India is gradually becoming self-reliant in nuclear technology. Recently, the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project Unit-1 (KKNPP 1) with 1,000 MW capacity was commissioned, while the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project Unit-2 (KKNPP-2) with 1,000 MW capacity is under commissioning.India is aggressively working towards establishing itself as a leader in industrialisation and technological development. Significant developments in the nuclear energy sector are likely as India looks to expand its nuclear capacity. Moreover, nanotechnology is expected to transform the Indian pharmaceutical industry. The agriculture sector is also likely to undergo a major revamp, with the government investing heavily for the technology-driven Green Revolution. Also, several automobile manufacturers, from global majors such as Audi to Indian companies such as Maruti Suzuki and Mahindra & Mahindra, are exploring the possibilities of introducing driverless self-driven cars for India.

The film is about 1% as thick as conventional membranes. Now you need 1% of the power to desalinize water or can process 100 times as much. Let’s say in the real world we’re off by a factor of 10. Ten times as much water or a tenth of the cost is still a major breakthrough for poor dry nations.","1,441 followers",Knowledge Bank,6.7K,117,162.8K,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-advanced-technology-India-has

But others died in training and operations after being selected, but before flying in space. The Soviets lost 4 Cosmonauts in re-entry accidents, never got their big rocket to work, never have sent a person further than Earth orbit. Ditto Russia andMoney.

Ditto Russia and China.Really big rockets to send people to the Moon are similar to what we build now, but bigger and more powerful, Like a 777–300 compared to an A320, Production of the big rockets would have to be restarted, after 40+ years. Or a new design perfected, using multiple, smaller, rockets, and assembling the Moon-craft in Earth orbit.",5 followers,Jake Williams,9.9K,3.2K,76.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-most-advanced-technologies-being-theorised-at-the-moment
18,"We did better.Thing is, technology isn’t a thing. It isn’t just doing everything ten times better. I have a book of a set of postcards drawn from 1899 to 1910, projecting the great things that would be accomplished by the year 2000. Things like newspapers replaced by wax cylinder recordings; this not only misses wireless telegraphy, it misses the way the papers have all but gone away, largely replaced by more diffuse communications (like posts in an online forum).We didn’t spend the years since 1972 making rocket fuel 10x more powerful. It still takes a hell of a lot of energy to get to the MoWe did better.Thing is, technology isn’t a thing. It isn’t just doing everything ten times better.

It still takes a hell of a lot of energy to get to the Moon. No; we spent it making computers — cybernetics to make a robotic probe capable, and miniaturization meaning we could land those probes not just on the Moon, but onAnyone who has paid attention to what actually happened in technology would see we are exactly using those advances we’ve made to continue space exploration. We just aren’t doing it in the way you might have predicted in 1972 — any more than pedal-powered airplanes are all the rage and cavalry is now a machine gun on a bicycle.",443 followers,Dave Lindbergh,819,1.4K,2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-most-advanced-technologies-being-theorised-at-the-moment
