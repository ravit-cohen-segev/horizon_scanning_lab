And thus in the aftermath, there was an extreme shortage of men.Many women used personal ads, networks, dating agencies, every resource available to find an eligible bachelor. And conversely, it was a very good time to be a man.In the 1700’s personal advertisements you even saw “missed connection” type ads that are prevalent today:And, the oldest advertisement I could find, from 1685.We are rather fascinating creatures, aren’t we?","3,345 followers",Yojji Peterson,1K,1.6K,7.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/In-an-age-of-advancing-technology-is-dating-becoming-hard

We spent time together at the company chairity volunteer day and hit it off. We emailed back and forth (he works on the 3rd floor, I work on the 4th- our company allows for relationships as long as they do not interfere with work) for about six months and we finally had dinner. I found out it was a date when he insisted on paying. He is very risk adverse, I am not. He might think I'm attractive or funny, but real me would freak him out. I couldn't.Man two is the father of my child's friend. He is my type. (musician, builds stuff, sensitive, funny) problem is… he's just gone through an awful divorce. He sends out mixed messages because he's hurting and needy. I can't.I don't go out much. My world has gotten very small. Babysitters are expensive. Online dating is not for me. I can't do social gymnastics. Lightning might strike someday, I guess…I'm am odd duck on my best day. And I'm 46. I have a lot of water under the bridge. I'm terrified.It used to be that I was pretty and interesting. That was enough. If I waited something would happen. Someone would happen. Now, I don't know? I don't want it enough to overlook the problems I can see coming up on the horizon.Edit: this answer doesn't say what I wanted to say. It's been bugging me. Still doesn't hit it but, whatever.I find that dating as I get older is more difficult because we all come with baggage and we are less willing to take someone else's baggage on. We all start out at something close to zero and move up from there.In the beginning physical attraction and shared interest is enough. We were all just children a minute ago. Then life happens and we diverge. At some point we see patterns in our lives.“I know what I don't want…ever again”The law of attrition happens. We last, brave soldiers are carrying baggage trains. We drop in and out. We are less physically attractive, we are damaged but yet we still hold some value. We are, in ways, polished.At some point we become desperate…or we don't. It all becomes a factor of how much you want it. I have experience in a bunch of problems I don't want. You probably have experience in a bunch of problems you don't want.I don't really want your baggage train. I can assume I'm pretty annoying. Actually, for an easy-going person, I am really annoying. You don't want my baggage train.Multiply this by all older people and you get an answer. No one wants to die alone but it's more complicated as you get older. Complicated is hard.Too complicated for me.","358,938 followers",Sean Kernan,894,5.6K,726.8M,2017,https://www.quora.com/In-an-age-of-advancing-technology-is-dating-becoming-hard

I am rarely at bats or clubs so where and who I hang with is not the issue. Before my dad died, I didn't speak with him for years. It took a long time for me to understand the way he was and it was something that changed me. I am totally comfortable talking to someone about anything. I talk about books because it helps me understand someone. How they respond determines whether or not i care to get to know them. I ALWAYS bring up Tolstoys short story the Death of Ivan Illyich or Kafkas The Metamorphosis. Tolstoy described Death having never experienced and Kafka described the perception of oneself and the fear of others seeing you as you see yourself.
