TikTok has built great momentum that led it to surpass Instagram with over 49% more app downloads in 2018 alone.Brands are already starting to experiment with the platform. Guess ran the first branded content campaign on TikTok last fall with an #InMyDenim fashion challenge.

3,"Transfer learning in ML models.Humans are really good at generalizing. We only have to see a few dogs before we can recognize a dog when we see one.Machines are not. ML models require millions of examples before forming a reliable classifier, and that classifier is very specific to the data on which it was trained. If your training data doesn't include dogs with three legs, the model won't recognize them. A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one.

A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one. It's hypothesized that the reason humans learn so quickly is that we are fitting new examples into our existing knowledge rather than forming entirely new categories. If we could teach machines to do the same, they would learn exponentially faster and apply that learning more effectively.Transfer learning is a very hot topic in AI research right now, so I expect major breakthroughs in the next few years. I think this may be sufficient to achieve artificial general intelligence, but even if not, it will dramatically extend the range of tasks that machines can accomplish.","45,628 followers",David Seidman,790,3.6K,85.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-TikTok-the-next-big-thing-in-technology

8,"As others have suggested, there’s really no benefit to “flying cars”, and a whole host of problems associated with them, so I can’t see them being common in the future, at least not in the sense that they’ll be as common as car ownership is today.What are the possible advantages of flying cars?

Most people would I guess say that they’d avoid traffic jams and would probably be quicker, both because of higher top speeds and through “straight line” journeys, so are these really true advantages?Avoiding Jams: We have traffic problems today mostly because we have humans behind the wheel. Humans rubber-neck at accidents on the other carriageway, causing unnecessary 10 mile stationary tailbacks, they cause “ripple jams” by driving too close to the car in front, they hesitate at junctions, have accidents, perform 3-point turns (I think they’re called “K” or “Y” turns in the US) on main roads (seriously, I came round a blind corner just this evening to find a Ford Fiesta sideways across a main road with a 60mph limit, in the dark, in the rain, some people are just insane). Autonomous vehicles and even those with only some autonomous features such as adaptive cruise control, collision avoidance and lane control should reduce these accidents and hold ups. Once the majority of cars are fully autonomous, traffic jams should be a thing of the past.Faster: Will personally owned flying cars have higher top speeds than cars? Possibly, but it’s also likely they’ll be limited in the same way cars are today.Crow’s flight: It’s highly unlikely personally owned flying cars will be allowed to fly in any direction, at any height they wish. They’ll almost certainly have to follow “l...",9 followers,Andrew McGregor,605,13K,67.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-TikTok-the-next-big-thing-in-technology
