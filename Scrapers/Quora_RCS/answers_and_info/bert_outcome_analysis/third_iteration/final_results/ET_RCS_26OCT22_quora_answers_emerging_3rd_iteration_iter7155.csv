Delhi, India 1975.In my life experience, I saw people like my father who were technology pioneers. My father was a full professor of Computer Science back in the early 1970s. At a time when India had rolling blackouts several times a day, and it was impossible at times to make a telephone call across town let alone to another city or internationally.

Delhi, India 1975.In my life experience, I saw people like my father who were technology pioneers. My father was a full professor of Computer Science back in the early 1970s. At a time when India had rolling blackouts several times a day, and it was impossible at times to make a telephone call across town let alone to another city or internationally. He knew down to the component level how a Mainframe worked and how to write software for it, even in machine language. His journey was one which encompassed the journey of India, as he was part of a generation of Indians who had seen the end of the British Occupation of India, and then sought to educate themselves in the most unbelievable of ways. He would go to the U.S. to seek higher education in 1957, and arrive in a country where for years he could not even eat a single dish he had grown up with. He had left a life where every need he had was taken care of, he went simply to seek knowledge of a world which had advanced while India had been held under colonialism. This group of Indians who came abroad to study, were largely from well off families, but their lives would be very hard in the West. They were not allowed to work beyond limited hours, India restricted most if not all funding for their families to support them and it was their shear desire to learn which made all this happen as without their willingness to sacrifice their own well being, they would have just returned home.Opening a business in India during the 1970s and 1980s was a task which could take years. Obtaining licensing was a monumental task. Limited consumer choices were the norm during the license raj, Bombay, India, 1975.After living outside and attaining highly specialized skills, many tried to return to India. But, India was a Socialist nation at this time. For my father the issue was our families landholding were under rent control, many businesses including our families utility companies had been nationalized. He saw no way to start a business in India and operate it profitably in the late 1960’s and early 1970s. Though he was offered leading positions in Indian Companies at the time, he wanted to have his own Company. India was still 20 years away from this point and he came back to the West. He would continue to do business with Indian Companies but on his own terms. My father, would become one of the first Computer Dealers and even began to outsource services to India in the late 1980s. Yet India’s socialist business enviornment persisted with hurdles for him to relocate back to India even after his role in high level advisory roles. His heart remained in Saharanpur, and he never could forget our families vast roots in India.My Father Baba Dr. Dina Nath Bedi and myself as a child, 1977.I saw my father as a remarkable person who could function in vastly different cultures but keep his dignity, pride and identity no matter what the situation. His example has never left me, and it is because of him that I speak fluent Hindi, Punjabi and learnt Sanskrit and Persian. He refused to see limits both in technology and in one’s relationship with what this meant with their own being. Technology is a natural field for Indians, as mathematics, and philosophy have historically been part of India. It was said in the 1980s that Indian Sanskrit was the most natural language for Computers, the fact that it was NASA which reached this conclusion was all the more impressive. I remember so well the gleaming pride my father had in his eyes when the research was released.Outside New Delhi, India, 2019.To say India is less developed than China, is very subjective today. I have seen areas of India which are far more developed than many Western Countries. These areas are substantial in size and depth. India’s Airports are at world class standards, along with metro systems and numerous hospitals. Highway infrastructure is on par with developed nations over most of the country. Universities are world class as well. On one occasion I was eating in Delhi one evening, and I wanted some more tea. I looked on the table and noticed a small triangle with a button on it. So I pushed it, and immediately a waiter appeared. He had tea, and I asked him how he knew. He said that after I pushed the button a microphone comes on and stays on for 1 minute, I was talking about tea. He had an earpiece which could hardly be seen. It even told him which table this was.Ola is the dominant Taxi service in India.India’s software apps work better than what I have seen outside of India. Ola had advanced software well in use before its nearest competitors did, and it continues its lead. India’s lead in software development was apparent in 1990s and 2000s, yet this lead has failed to lead to a robust production of proprietary Indian Software Products. The fact is India concentrated on the wrong end of the Computer Industry and while outsourcing services was an obvious way to build the Indian economy in the 1990s it was not an endpoint, as much of the services which were provided are today automated by the cloud. The Indian software industry is to an extent seeing the very same result that my father saw in the early 1990s as large Computer Manufacturers broke relationship with Authorized Dealers to sell direct in an attempt to gain greater profitability and control customer relationships. The end result was the loss of customers and ultimate exit from the P.C. business for most of these companies. Outsourcing has limitations and the evolution of India’s I.T. sector has to be becoming a full scale competitor with unique products and not just services.While many people of Indian Origin are today in leading positions in American Corporations, this does not translate into a positive development for India’s economy. The duty of a C.E.O. of a public company is to his shareholders and customers, not his vision of politics of nationalism which they may or may not have. The real fact that India does not have companies like Google or Twitter on a global scale is obvious. Many Indian startups with the capability of becoming largescale household names were bought up by foreign Multinationals before they could pose a true competitive risk. India does not lack talent but it does lack a national vision of where it needs to position itself. Many are simply overjoyed that Indians are C.E.O.’s of large multinational companies without even realizing that though this is a positive development it translates into nothing more or less for India unless such experience is used to build Indian Companies in the long run.It may take more time than anticipated to “Make in India”, live up to its true potential.So far India has not been able to attract its own high caliber talent to return to India and to create large scale innovation in India. The real challenge of the 21th Century for India is transform itself from a transactional economy into an economy of invention. The transformation once made will ensure India’s return to it’s historical norm. India is not just a modern state but one of the last remaining of the civilizations which began at the dawn of human history, India has historically created trends not followed them. It has broken scientific barriers, and used mathematics in the most innovative of ways. For when the world was believed to be flat Indian philosophers already knew it was round. When it was said the sun rotated around the Earth, Indian treatises had been written in detail with the concept of Gravity and a 364 day year. They were only off by one day for the year in 500 A.D. It was Indian Scientific knowledge that allowed it have the world’s oldest universities before the Islamic Invasion of India. India was the only civilization that China sent its students to study in before the modern age. While claims can be made that China is more advanced than India today, and Indians are leading U.S. companies more so than other groups, the fact is none of this matters as much as it seems. People such as my father and those in his generation began a process of gaining knowledge for the betterment of the world, and especially for the people of India and Indian Origin. India’s road to regaining its historical significance only began 75 years ago, and it can only be imagined where India will be 75 years from now. My father stated in 1983, “India’s greatest resource is renewable for it is the talent of it’s people.”, I have full faith that this resource will surprise the world just like as they have done since the ages of antiquity.",723 followers,Jiangjunling,780,618,1.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-China-much-larger-and-more-developed-than-India-economically-but-there-are-far-more-Indian-CEOs-in-the-US-and-the-technology-industry-than-Chinese-CEOs

The effect of brain drain is a divider and and brain growth exponential. The different is for example 2×2×2=8 and on the other side 2÷2÷2 =1/2…one the fusion and one of the opposite.When 2 tech combine the effect is exponential and when technology is lost in one area the other stagnant.

They put a ban on making more than one baby for a couple. And also, used their existing large population so well. And the population control law, there, was such a success that now the population has started to decrease on a massive rate and also the government has started to encourage people to build up the population to a decent level.Asking “do we need such a bill?” is just a waste of time. Instead, protest against the government for not bringing this bill. We should have done that long ago, but now the water is above our heads. It is high time to take action.Also, it has to be unbiased with respect to religions and castes, otherwise it might alter the demography of the country to a large extent.Educated , logicall Europeans understand that term that's why they living good life ….That's why less religious logical People are rich!!!If don't believe me search in Google example:- Pakistan’s debt is rocketingIf you look back into history, you will see that none of the countries actually became developed with the democratic form of government. They all developed on dictatorship, autocracy, or slavery. Democracy was adopted by all those country at a very late stage after they have already accumulated wealth from all over the world including from colonization. India has a huge political problem which is the greatest hindrance towards prosperity. You do see GDP numbers and several multinational companies creating employment. But that is not all. There is more to that which is required for a country to grow and prosperHow did Europe develop?How did the USA develop?Also refer 2nd answers for MORE info in USASomeone anonymous's answer to If humans are resources, then why is India not the strongest country of the world?After WW2 Europe was all in the rubble. They needed manufactured goods to bring their lives back to the track. The USA was the first choice as it had a good infrastructure for manufacturing and also geographically at safe distance from war-torn Europe. The US developed its manufacturing industry as they had whole Europe as a consumer ready to buy. That brought a lot of money to the US.How did China develop?The priorities are different. The system of governance is different.For Indians, religion is most important.ForWe want to build the biggest statue. The want build the biggest dam. We haven't learned from history. They have.Sure the Chinese system of governance might not appeal a European, with limitations on individual freedom. But, that government has brought hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, through sheer pragmatism, logical planning and perseverance.But, we need not feel bad. Anyway, we will be going to swargaIndia woke up in 1993, too lateNow, we boast India has a huge young population and we are the fastest growing economy. Great! But my question is where is India’s customer outside India? Yes, we have exports but are they really huge enough to turn around India’s economy? China already has so many of its manufactured goods lying around because there are not many customers to buy and so now they are going really bullish to sell in India. By the time India manufacturing sector will become equivalent to what China currently has, most of India will already be using Chineses products and you can see it happening already.Also, you don’t become a rich country by manufacturing and selling your products to your own country people. You become rich by exporting it and bringing in foreign currency. Yes, with more manufacturing we can save money from our imports but they won’t be enough.I am following India’s politics from the last 15 years very closely. It is a HUGE MESS. It is like crabs in a bucket. One crab wants to move forward, others will pull it back with their claws. One leadership wants to do something good, other political parties won’t let it happen.We missed the train and we will suffer and that is a bitter truth.What can be done now? Honestly, I am not smart enough to tell that. There are much smarter people out there who might be thinking about it. However, I can say that the next 100 years are going to be really tough for India.The opportunity to serve United States like they served Europe and become rich and devoloped , so on second line India have to serve United States to accqire wealth from USA .If humans are resources, then why is India not the strongest country of the world?This opportunity was taken by chinaPlease Upvote and suggest more content in comment section ..Credit goes to commenter and upvoters",813 followers,Boni Aditya,5.4K,408,1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-China-much-larger-and-more-developed-than-India-economically-but-there-are-far-more-Indian-CEOs-in-the-US-and-the-technology-industry-than-Chinese-CEOs

However, foreign investment in India is quite different from that in China.Foreign investment in India is aimed at capturing the domestic demand of India,Foreign investment in China, the purpose is not only to occupy the Chinese market, but to meet the needs of the world!Foreign investment in India, more to meet the Indian government's market access requirements,It is easy to judge that Indian made products are not globally competitive and it is hard to see any Indian made products outside India.Second, India may miss out on a fourth industrial revolutionMany people call breakthroughs in high-speed communications, new energy, new materials, life sciences, artificial intelligence and other fields the fourth industrial revolution.But indians are still keen on IT and have invested little in the fourth industrial revolution.I am not saying India is not investing, but very little, less than one tenth of China.In the future, the level of science and technology will determine the strength of a country, or even the destiny of a country.Third, India's environmental crisisAs a Chinese, I have witnessed the destruction of China's environment by industrialization.It is easy to destroy the environment, but difficult to repair it. Today, the annual investment in environmental protection in China far exceeds the sum of education and military expenditure.But it will take generations to repair the environment, and some will never be.Unfortunately, I saw similar environmental damage in India, which has a higher population density and a lower environmental carrying capacity than China.India must solve its environmental problems, which may cause social instability and unrest.Fourth, India's education crisisIn particular, inequality in education,Personally, 20% of people in India get a good education, but the quality and environment of education for the other 80% is really bad.Inequality in education leads to inequality in life development,India should pay special attention to the quality of mass education and invest heavily in it.",88 followers,Rajesh Tiwary,9.8K,71,742.4K,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-China-much-larger-and-more-developed-than-India-economically-but-there-are-far-more-Indian-CEOs-in-the-US-and-the-technology-industry-than-Chinese-CEOs

The secondary school had Wi-Fi.All the villagers wore helmets while riding their electric scooters. Every single one of them could read and write Mandarin, and none of them littered or spat or peed in the open.The women all wore jeans, dresses, skirts etc. and no one judged them and shamed them for “aping the west”. What mattered was their ability, not what clothes they wore.It was completely safe to wander around the village after dark. No one got harassed for their gender, nationality etc. None of the female participants in the homestay program ever mentioned that they felt uncomfortable, or were stared at by men for wearing shorts. None of us faced any racist taunts.I’m not saying that China has no problems, but this Chinese village had better services than most Indian cities (we can still only dream of uninterrupted power supply, or 24x7 water, or pothole-free roads).I cannot say with authority that all villages in China are like this, but I would wager that many of them are. The cities are of course in a different league. I stayed in the suburbs to the north of Shanghai for a few days, not a tourist area. The neighbourhoods were clean, with excellent roads, and footpaths were not cluttered by hawkers. People followed traffic rules. I went to a side street where there were stalls selling street food, and it was clean. No one littered, there was no garbage anywhere.It’s not just their GDP or infrastructure.

Yes, India has a great space program, which is more advanced and capable than China, but that is where it ends. Apart from space field, India has no other advantage over China. If I compare the infrastructure, cleanliness, peoples’ attitude, etc, I believe, India is still decades lagging behind China. I feel sad saying these things, but you need to accept the facts.Hopefully, India is growing now and things change sooner. But, China is growing too, and at much faster rate. And in China, we do not really get to experience corruption at the ground level, which is really great. In India, we are still so much corrupt, that nothing really gets implemented properly. There are big plans by the government, however, while coming down to implementation, most of the money is pocketed by the politicians and bureaucrats, and the work does not get done.

She is incredibly smart and was an accomplished escape artist from the time she figured out the baby locks on doorknobs on. I have never found a locking method for doors or windows that she couldn't either beat or get around. She slept in my bed, otherwise if she woke before me or I fell asleep first, she would do her damnedest to stage a covert jail break. I even had to board up the doggy door, because she would take the collar that unlocked it off the dog and make a hasty exit to the back yard, usually with our goofy Great Dane (who is still her BFF, bodyguard, and partner in crime) hot on her heels.Anyway, one morning after putting my son on the school bus, I forgot to lock the bolts when I came back in. I was friggin’ exhausted, so I lay back down. I must have been sleeping hard, because her getting out of bed didn't wake me like it usually did. She went and got a granola bar and a juice box, which I kept accessible for her (for her safety — she wanted to do everything herself and rather than asking for something she couldn't reach, she'd make a ladder out of anything available) and did her daily raptor-style perimeter testing, looking for any exploitable weaknesses. And the front door was unlocked.A little about my neighbor: he was an elderly gentleman who never seemed to go in his house. He was always either sitting in a chair on his porch or scooting up and down the street with his cane or walker. I didn't pay any mind to him until one afternoon my son got off the bus and found this neighbor standing out front, just staring at the house. We live in an Arizona border town that is plagued by horrific unemployment and crime rates. The best way I can explain it to people who don't live here is that the three banks in town that are most often robbed are all within 100 yards of the police station — cops are close so those banks have more cash on site. Human trafficking is big business here, and my beautiful little blonde-haired, pale-skinned daughter hits every point on the targeted types. I didn't know if this man was completely harmless, a pedophile, or a scout for a team of house-breakers, so like most parents, I assumed the worst. I installed motion-activated cameras outside and considered contacting the cops about stalking or menacing if it happened again (yes, I went a little mama bear, I get that, but he was STARING). I would check the sidewalk before we left the house. I even started taking the long way out of the neighborhood to avoid driving past his house. He made me feel watched, which I have always hated to the point of abject fear and complete avoidance, and I was completely paranoid.So, that morning when my evil genius found her door to freedom, I doubt she hesitated. More than likely the smell of freedom sent her into a frenzy and she hauled ass as fast as her bare feet and pull-up would let her. Mind, I'm sleeping the blissful, untroubled sleep of a parent wrapped in the assurance that they are smarter, faster and more clever than their children. She made it out to the sidewalk and started down the street wearing nothing but her diaper and a smile, looking for something awesome. She made it past three houses, saw this creepy old dude whom mom actively avoids, and decides she's going to figure out what his deal is. She marched across his yard, right up to where he was sitting on his porch and introduced herself.I about jumped out of my skin when banging on the front door woke me up (she closed it behind her, and he didn't want to open it or just send her inside). I ran to the door, so discombobulated that I didn't notice she wasn't next to me in the bed. I opened the door, and there stood my creepy old neighbor, hand in hand with my fearless Goodwill ambassador, both of them giggling like a pair of loony birds. I just stood there like an idiot, completely not understanding why my daughter was with this guy. I was stuttering, trying to get my brain to form a coherent question, and my kidlet piped up, letting me know that she had gone visiting, but he didn't want mom to worry so he walked her home. I guess I still looked confused, so he explained to me that there are a lot of bad people in our city, so he did his duty and returned her home safely. We sat down in my porch chairs and he told me his story…He was a retired police officer. Many years prior, he'd had a daughter who was very adventurous, full to the brim with curiosity, and absolutely fearless, a ringer for my ankle-biter. While he was at work one day, their dog bolted out the front door and his daughter chased after it. Before his wife could catch up with his daughter, both the little girl and the dog were killed in a hit-and-run when she chased the dog into the street and into the path of a car. He explained that no parent should have to bury their child, and he makes it his duty to protect the families in the neighborhood by patrolling 24/7/365. He watched to make sure all the kids got home safely from the school bus, that the houses didn't present an easy mark for burglars, watched unknown cars that might be casing the neighborhood, the whole nine yards.Sitting there, knowing how devastating my day could've been if not for his intervention, I felt like the biggest piece of shit that had ever existed. My assumptions had made me suspicious of the one person in the neighborhood, if not the whole city, who had my back. I had never been openly hostile towards him, so he was pretty stunned when I told him the direction my thoughts about him had taken, but after a minute he started giggling again. He was able to look at his actions from my point of view and found it entertaining. Then he asked me not to tell anyone what a softy he was, because it would ruin his reputation amongst local criminals as a tough guy.I don't have family here and neither does he, so we have frequent whiskey and BBQ dates and spend every holiday together. We're even planning a trip to hit the major California theme parks next summer, so he and my son can indulge in their mutual love of roller coasters and fried dough products.UPDATE: unfortunately, our summer plans had to be canceled. Pops, as we call him, had a moderate stroke in April. While he is recovering, it’s a marathon, not a sprint. None of us wanted to go without him, so we postponed the vaycay until he's well enough to join us. I stay on him about his home exercises, drive him to and from appointments (he can still drive, but without a chaperone he would've quit long ago) and day by day, I can see improvement. He told me a couple of weeks ago that he's grateful to have my rambunctious kiddos around because they motivate him to get up and moving, if for no other reason than to escape their deafening noise. Whatever works, right? I guess this is my turn to watch out for him after all the times he's watched out for us.","246,871 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-China-much-larger-and-more-developed-than-India-economically-but-there-are-far-more-Indian-CEOs-in-the-US-and-the-technology-industry-than-Chinese-CEOs

But at least I had a good laugh.Ruby is like Python but they managed to make it even slower. So Ruby will be discarded and fall out of fashion.Haskell is a scholars language, forget about it, Go is like Swift just a company driven stuff, I tried it, I wasn’t impressed and I can’t imagine that this thing will survive a phase of hype. Still, languages even the worst will live for very long. A friend of mine is quite enthusiastic about it, but actually he’s not doing much with it.TypeScript as a precompiler language to JavaScript has its point and will survive as long as JavaScript doesn’t get replaced by WebAsm, means other languages in the frontend and degrades to just a kind of web assembly. But I think not.Julia, Dart, well, plays no part in real programming, Rust tries to beat C and while the language is nice, it’s coming 50 years too late to the market to make any difference to C, in my humble opinion. So all you do in Rust will be rusty in 5–6 years and gone.Nice language, though, it just can’t compete and the only thing it does is making the language babel worse than it is. It doesn’t solve anything new.Kotlin, Elixir, well these languages just will be replaced with the next FotM language that someone jams into the LLVM compiler package, which is mostly the reason we have such a 90’s like babel of languages these days. I have lived through the last language babel in the 90’s and they are all gone. Nobody’s talking about Modula, Modula-2, Pascal, Occam or Eiffel. And I can add like twenty others that died during that time and I had to learn all of them at some time.It’s all gone and the latest folly will be gone, too. If in five years or in ten is hard to say, but they will be gone.I wish Oracle goes bankrupt, if they do, Java bites the dust. But I think Java will survive for a long time, like the black death was killing off most of Europe through all the middle ages and before we don’t have a cure for Java or kill the plaque of rats that spreads this disease this will live on for a looong time to all our unlucky pleasure.It is just nice, that we have languages like C and C++ (which I dislike, still…), the Assembly languages will stay, OpenCL will stay, Verilog will stay and hopefully Lua will stay, because it’s easy to learn and to keep active even if you don’t program it for a longer time and because it goes hand in hand with C as a perfect partner and team that doesn’t want to do C’s job and C doesn’t want to do Lua’s.And with that it is unique on the market, still the community is too small and maybe that’s my little pet language, but I worked with that thing with great pleasure and success and it did everything a HLL needs to do.BASIC will stay in the one or other form, maybe in Gambas or inside the LibreOffice project.And I personally think, that Brainfuck will live for longer, more intensive than most of those new corporate venus-fly-trap languages that the companies invent lately to bind their own programming-pool.There are old languages that will not go away, like Perl and M4 and others, and which I love very much and a lot of specialized languages, like LaTeX, which has started to revive through LuaLaTeX and many other projects that started to use Lua as a scripting language as many games do now.My advice is, don’t go with fashion, go with the tool aspect. If the thing is open and well combining with other languages, it will survive forever and it will serve you as a tool for much longer than you think. My C programs from 1985 still compile and run without any problem, so C is not a fashion language, it is eternal.And everyone fluent in C knows that.There are more legacy languages than I could count up and that didn’t survive. And many that I hope die soon. If I could cast a necromancy “take life” spell, that will feast on the flesh of a language like the Ark of the Covenant did on the soldiers in Indiana Jones, and I had to name three languages: it would be: Java, Python, Ruby in that order.May this pest be cured and the world stop suffering.Die, Die, Die! And may the spirits of fashion claw your flesh in their bony and substanceless fingers and pull them down into the realm of Hel, into the eternal Ice of the viking hell, that is the incorporation of the Technocracy that is the mother of these stupid lifesucking things.Eternal slowness of corruption and the frozen flow of water in the ice coldness of the frozen desert that is the realm of Hel. With those three languages the abominations of languages that sacrifice the life of the living and fun of programming to the goddess of Technocracy and total order, sacrificing CPU speed with nothing to give back to you but endless lines of unreadable code and code-noise to the point your fingers condense the air to liquid while typing on the keyboard. The cold ice of a frozen screen on the one side and the technocratic monstrosity that is far away from anything that resembles our hardware, that comes with OOP on the other. The cold skin of the girl without life on the one side and the dead cogs of the machine on the other.These three are the unholy trinity of Hel. And I don’t say that lightly.Die! Die! Die!These three are to programming languages whatThat would be a happy life for me, a life and a death with meaning. And I’m sure with such monsters slain the valkyries would take me to Folkvangr, the heaven of good programmers that have managed to keep their souls through their job.",19 followers,Tia Mongla,550,52,658.3K,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-China-much-larger-and-more-developed-than-India-economically-but-there-are-far-more-Indian-CEOs-in-the-US-and-the-technology-industry-than-Chinese-CEOs

33,The one that's caught my eye is Amazon Lambda.This idea of running code in a scalable container without building the whole machine from scratch seems very useful.,UNKNOWN,Nick R.
