0,Medical advancement is the greatest advance in technology that I can think of. Diseases that use to terminate in death are easily treated. The public is giving information that they themselves can take better care of their health. And just think of all the new medical equipment that is being developed for the medical community to use in their quest for healing and treatment. When my father was born in 1904 at least half of children died in childhood. And I imagine with the latest news of certain diseases making a comeback it will be terminated in short order. And people know about sanitation nMedical advancement is the greatest advance in technology that I can think of. Diseases that use to terminate in death are easily treated.

1,Several options are under investigation. These involve technology that sends electrical signals to an electrode grid place on the outside of the brain and others that vibrate the skin with a grid of micro solenoids in response to visual stimuli. The blind subject learns patterns and achieves a type of visual input.,1 follower,James Byrd,5.6K,3.2K,4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-upcoming-technologies-that-you-are-excited-for-in-2019
2,"There is a critical time of brain plasticity in babies where they learn to interpret visual input.For instance, when they crawl towards something, it gets larger in their visual field.People who were blind as a baby and missed this critical period of development will never be able to fully interpret visual input.There is a famous case where sight was restored to a man who was blind since birth. Instead of being a miracle, it was a tragedy. He could never make sense of what he was seeing since he missed the visual development phase.When people walked away, he saw them shrink.
