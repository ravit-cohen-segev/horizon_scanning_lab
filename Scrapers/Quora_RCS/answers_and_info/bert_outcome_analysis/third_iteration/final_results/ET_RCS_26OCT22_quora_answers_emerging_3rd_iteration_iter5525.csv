Some the the biggest advancements that researchers within pharmaceutical companies are making are in the fields of digital health and a new age medicine.One of the newest forms, coined precision medicine, is an approach that integrates clinical data and molecular research to understand the biological mechanisms of disease. This valuable information can be obtained by translating molecular DNA into information that can be processed in order to make powerful predictions. Researchers can use this data to identify specific gene abnormalities, or biomarkers, to understand which types of patients a drug will be most effective for, and who is likely to experience severe side-effects. These research methods effectively aid in the development of new targeted therapies, as well as the repurposing of existing drugs for new diseases and medical conditions.Developments in 3D printing are another one of the biggest innovations of the pharmaceutical industry in this century. Recently, epilepsy drug Stritam became the first 3D printed drug in history to be approved by the FDA. The technology of 3D printing creates the oral medication through a three-dimensional printing process, which generates the pill from scratch by spreading layers of the drug on top of one another until the correct dosage is reached for the patient. This technique allows the medication to deliver a higher dose of medicine while being able to dissolve quickly as needed. This breakthrough clears the way for future 3D printed drug, where by making slight adjustments to the software before printing, hospitals could easily adjust doses specific to patients needs, becoming a process of personalized medicine of the future. As we live in an age in which technology is moving at a rapid pace, these new innovations in pharma will be extremely beneficial for generations to come.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-emerging-technologies-trends-in-pharma-R-D

Leave this, I've once seen a Bounce parked on the Hosur Road flyover!This is a bounce parked in a private property. People have started parking in their apartments and the others cannot take them because the apartment security doesn't allow to. I literally had to fight with the security of an apartment to let me take the scooter even though it was the fault of someone in their building.Moreover, people ruthlessly steal helmets provided by Bounce for free which you can use and keep it back in the boot after you've finished the ride.Sorry to the owners of Bounce, but this business model is surely not gonna work in India. We Indians don't deserve something like this.The idea is amazing though. It should be tried in other countries like Japan where this could be managed much better!Image source - Google.Edit -In these scooters supposedly the battery and GPS system is removed so the company probably can't track it (Not sure, if anyone knows they can tell me in comments)How much does a helmet cost?

During the case, the judge advised that we are not allowed to discuss it, but after the case, he gave clear instructions that we are allowed to discuss the case with anyone, as well as our deliberations.Still, I’m going anonymous because I just can’t take any more drama over this whole situation.There is a lot of nuance to the case, but essentially it comes down to this: a college-age woman and college-age man are friends. At one point, they dated, had sex, but the woman decided to end things. They had some sexual encounters outside of their previous relationship, maintained their friendship, but eventually even the sex stopped. Although they flirted on Snapchat, sexual contact was zero. One day, they agreed to meet up for lunch and the young man offers to drive her to pick up some shoes she had ordered. It was about 20 minutes away from campus, as that was near where her parents lived. He offered to drive, and as she had recently had to pay to replace her car keys and they were expensive, he even offered to pay for lunch. It was by all accounts, a normal day for two college-age individuals.As he’s driving her back to campus, he asks her if she wants to “go somewhere.” During their “friends with benefits stage,” they had occasionally parked somewhere and had sex in the backseat of his car. Those somewheres were usually residential neighborhoods. At first, she said no, she had recently discussed with him that she was not interested in sex for the month of January. She was interested in someone but wanted a break from sex. He didn’t believe that she would last the month of January. At this point, it was a week before the end of January.He asked if he could perform oral sex on her. She agreed only with the condition that there would be no sex, no kissing, and she wouldn’t do anything for him. They both agreed and went to the back seat of his car. After he had been pleasuring her, he really wanted to have sex with her.Here is where the testimony splits. Obviously, since they are on the opposite sides of the case, they won’t agree 100% on what happened. He says he never heard her ask him to stop, she says she asked him multiple times. They both agree in their testimony that he was 8~10 inches away from her face (approximate because obviously they didn’t measure it with a ruler). After he penetrated her, he testifies that he noticed her expression and pulled out. His testimony varies here, as again, he wasn’t measuring everything. First he said one minute, then 30 seconds, then 10–30 seconds. Less than 30, at least 10, maybe not more than 10.Regardless, they put their clothes back on, they get back into the front seat of his car, and she asks, “Why did you do that?”She testifies that he became highly emotional.He testifies that he wasn’t. However, he later testifies that he was emotional because he was in love with her and couldn’t believe that he’d done something she would interpret as rape. His exact words are “I had a meltdown.”At the end of it all, he drove her back to campus, she called her friend to tell her what happened, and cried. He sent her a slew of texts in which he brings up words like “rape,” and “wrong.” He repeatedly texts her saying if she wants him to stop texting her, he will, but please know it was never his intention to disrespect her. He later swears on God he didn’t hear her.What scares me about people is this: He simply can’t see that he didn’t have her express consent. Regardless of whether or not she allegedly gave it or not, at no point does he testify that he had her consent. “She said yes, let’s have sex,” is found NOWHERE in his testimony. He repeatedly says he thought that’s what she wanted.You know, when I was a child, I thought eating watermelon seeds would make watermelon grow in my stomach. Which is why people spit them out. Of course, I was wrong, but just because I really believed it, doesn’t mean it’s true.The lack of a NO doesn’t mean YES. Everyone on that jury was split and it blew my mind that people couldn’t put aside their personal feelings. The problem with court is that people see DNA evidence and shows like NCIS or CSI and believe that it will always be 100% obvious. Where’s the smoking gun, so to speak? Because the only evidence was 39 pages of texts and the testimony of two individuals (as well as secondary testimony from friends, who really only heard about it second hand), everyone said “Well, I have reasonable doubt.”Yes, that’s ok. That’s in the jury instructions and if you have reasonable doubt, you must acquit. But if your reasonable doubt is based off of, “I know women like her and they want to ruin a man’s life,” then I’m sorry, no, that’s not reasonable doubt. That’s bias, and at BEST, you need to recuse yourself, at worst, you are breaking your oath as a juror.I heard WOMEN vote against this woman because, and I quote, “I don’t mean to victim-blame, I’m a woman and a mother of daughters, but…she shouldn’t have been in that car with him.”Why is it that when people say, “I don’t mean to do X, but…” it’s always followed by a statement where they’re doing X??? “I don’t mean to be racist, but all Asians look alike.” That’s racist. To the very core, that is racist. And yet people think they are excused or somehow justified, just by saying that phrase beforehand.I heard a woman say to another woman, “Well you’re not a man, so you don’t know. But how can a man stop in a situation like that?”To which I replied, “As a man, I can say this: we can absolutely stop. But there are those men who choose not to.”Another man said he was molested as a child, which he used as his justification: “Well, you know, I was molested as a child. So I absolutely would convict a rapist. But, I don’t believe her testimony, she has inconsistencies, so I just can’t accept her story. Not guilty.”People continually came back to “reasonable doubt,” but their entire logic was based off of their personal feelings. Did he have consent? “Well he reasonably believed he did, because she was naked in his car.” Ok, but when he testifies that he was 8–10 inches away from her face, and she also testifies a similar distance, you really think he couldn’t tell she wanted or didn’t want sex? You really think the fact that she DIDN’T say “Yes, let’s have sex,” is reason to believe she wanted sex? He never testifies that he heard her say she wanted to have sex or that she changed her mind about not having sex with him. He testifies himself that he heard her say they wouldn’t have sex. BUT BECAUSE HE WANTED TO, he assumes she wanted to and that she would enjoy it once he started. THAT. IS. STILL. NOT. CONSENT.And so, 7–5, the jury voted not guilty. The man, who was repeatedly referred to as “a young man, with a bright future, we shouldn’t ruin his life,” is now free to continue with his loose understanding of consent BECAUSE of the juror’s loose understanding of “objectivity” and using evidence. Every single person that voted not guilty, could not defend their choice beyond a personal belief. Which is the first line in the instructions about being a juror, and which they themselves REPEATEDLY swore they would do if chosen for jury duty: to SET ASIDE their personal beliefs and not let anything OUTSIDE of the case affect their decision.I’m still fuming, not because they voted not guilty. Because they voted without having objectivity. They repeatedly said they didn’t want to ruin a young man’s life, and WOMEN were calling this woman a slut. If they voted guilty for the same lack of rationale and emotion, even if I agreed he was guilty, I still would be fuming. Because they couldn’t do what they promised to do, AND THEY COULDN’T SEE IT.These are kind, compassionate people. Outside of jury duty, they were generous, welcoming, and gave me kind advice about my upcoming wedding. And yet, they let a man off the hook for a decision he made, by claiming men can’t help themselves.So long as society lets us continue to, yes, I believe us men will never be able to help ourselves.Speaking as a man, I can honestly say I’ve never been in his exact shoes, but I know the lack of a No is still NOT A YES. And I hope for the sake of future generations that we start making people accountable for their actions.Sorry for the length.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-emerging-domain-for-opening-a-technology-startup-in-india
