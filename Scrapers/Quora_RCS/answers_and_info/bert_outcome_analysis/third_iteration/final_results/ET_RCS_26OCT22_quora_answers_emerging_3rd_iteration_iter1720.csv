Since compiler writing was hard and labor intensive, those computer languages were specific to a particular mainframe. FORTRAN was originally IBM but spread to other register based machines. IBM supported APL and it flourished only on IBM computers. Algol was the domain of Burroughs stack machines. Burroughs had a culture of freely distributing software source code of the compiler and operating system. Why? They were “open source” but only ran on Burroughs stack computers! So there were many subcultures each around a specific mainframe computer vender.But there were people writing “portable software.” One of the first was SNOBOL4. In the early 70’s SNOBOL4 ran on all the mainframes such as IBM, Univac 1100, PDP-10, and CDC computers. Back then finding the same language on multiple machines was unheard of. FORTRAN was standardized but each mainframe had extensions that were not portable. But one language that ran the same was unique.Skip head to 1995, and Java appears as “Write (and compile) once, and run everywhere.” With a Java Virtual Machine definition and interpreter, one would write code on a PC and have it run on a Linux box.Yes there is a “culture” around Java.

Otherwise Mark Zuckerburg is a far better CEO than engineer.So really what does learning to code get you? Well perhaps you learn enough to build a prototype to go raise money. This is helpful, but then you are a solo founder raising, which is actually quite difficult, so it’s still better to have a technical cofounder with you if not perhaps two of them.Could you shoulder some of the load at the beginning? Not really, because your code isn’t going to be good enough to make it to production, so you really wouldn’t be speeding up the process.What it would help you with is understanding how much time it takes to develop things, but that is something where the complexity only becomes apparent once you have hit scale and only after you have to pay down technical debt. Which again happens after 1–2 years after which point you already have a larger company. And coding isn’t the only way to get that understanding, it’s just basic logic and empathy.The most important things to launching a company are having a well thought understanding of the problem, solution, and market. And then putting together a team that can execute.If you are going to be the CEO even if you knew how to code eventually you wouldn’t so it’s not a skill that will serve you long term. However as a CEO you will always need to hire people. Level up the team. So working on finding talent is a skill that will serve you during your entire tenure.

9,"Honestly, I would probably say Rorschach.He’s not a rich, influential, or overpowered figure.He’s just a sad broken man who believes in his sense of justice. A nobody who tries to make the world a better place through fighting crime their own way, which is the most realistic scenario for a real-world crime fighter.As most of those who want to fight crime would become part of the police, not dress up like a bat and kick criminals on the streets.

Then we get to see the magic. A change made in state of one of the two photons reflects in the other. This way data can be transferred.For sure, this scientific research will have first of its application in communication.Read this article from MIT technologyreview.comFirst Object Teleported from Earth to OrbitResearchers have teleported a photon from the ground to a satellite orbiting more than 500 kilometers above.Last year, a Long March 2D rocket took off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in the Gobi Desert carrying a satellite called Micius, named after an ancient philosopher who died in 391 B.C. The rocket placed Micius in a Sun-synchronous orbit so that it passes over the same point on Earth at the same time each day.Micius is a highly sensitive photon receiver that can detect the quantum states of single photons fired from the ground. That’s important because it should allow scientists to test the technological building blocks for various quantum feats such as entanglement, cryptography, and teleportation.Today, the Micius team announced the results of its first experiments. The team created the first satellite-to-ground quantum network, in the process smashing the record for the longest distance over which entanglement has been measured. And they’ve used this quantum network to teleport the first object from the ground to orbit.Teleportation has become a standard operation in quantum optics labs around the world. The technique relies on the strange phenomenon of entanglement. This occurs when two quantum objects, such as photons, form at the same instant and point in space and so share the same existence. In technical terms, they are described by the same wave function.The curious thing about entanglement is that this shared existence continues even when the photons are separated by vast distances. So a measurement on one immediately influences the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them.Back in the 1990s, scientists realized they could use this link to transmit quantum information from one point in the universe to another. The idea is to “download” all the information associated with one photon in one place and transmit it over an entangled link to another photon in another place.This second photon then takes on the identity of the first. To all intents and purposes, it becomes the first photon. That’s the nature of teleportation and it has been performed many times in labs on Earth.Teleportation is a building block for a wide range of technologies. “Long-distance teleportation has been recognized as a fundamental element in protocols such as large-scale quantum networks and distributed quantum computation,” says the Chinese team.In theory, there should be no maximum distance over which this can be done. But entanglement is a fragile thing because photons interact with matter in the atmosphere or inside optical fibers, causing the entanglement to be lost.As a result, the distance over which scientists have measured entanglement or performed teleportation is severely limited. “Previous teleportation experiments between distant locations were limited to a distance on the order of 100 kilometers, due to photon loss in optical fibers or terrestrial free-space channels,” says the team.But Micius changes all that because it orbits at an altitude of 500 kilometers, and for most of this distance, any photons making the journey travel through a vacuum. To minimize the amount of atmosphere in the way, the chinese team set up its ground station in Ngari in Tibet at an altitude of over 4,000 meters. So the distance from the ground to the satellite varies from 1,400 kilometers when it is near the horizon to 500 kilometers when it is overhead.To perform the experiment, team created entangled pairs of photons on the ground at a rate of about 4,000 per second. They then beamed one of these photons to the satellite, which passed overhead every day at midnight. They kept the other photon on the ground.Finally, they measured the photons on the ground and in orbit to confirm that entanglement was taking place, and that they were able to teleport photons in this way. Over 32 days, they sent millions of photons and found positive results in 911 cases. “We report the first quantum teleportation of independent single-photon qubits from a ground observatory to a low Earth orbit satellite—through an up-link channel— with a distance up to 1400 km,” says the team.This is the first time that any object has been teleported from Earth to orbit, and it smashes the record for the longest distance for entanglement.Do share this awesome upcoming tech!!","246,850 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-upcoming-technology-that-I-can-learn-in-Java-ecosystem-that-tech-companies-are-starting-to-use
