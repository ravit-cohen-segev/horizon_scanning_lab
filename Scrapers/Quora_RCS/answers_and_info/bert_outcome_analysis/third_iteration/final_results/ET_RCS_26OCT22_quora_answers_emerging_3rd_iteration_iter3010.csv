What are they doing on Jupiter?”“It looks like they’re building wells to tap Jupiter’s hydrogen. Now they’re building fusion power plants. Oh, now they’re on Saturn. Looks like they’re extracting helium 3. Now they’re building facilities on Jupiter’s moons.”“Well, let’s nuke them!”“Our nukes will take two years to reach them.

In that time their ships will be on the other side of the solar system. Or they’ll just swat them down. Oh, now they’re doing the same on Uranus and Neptune. Looks like they’re extracting organics deep down. Oh, and they’re building particle accelerators to make anti-matter.”“Well, lets go and stop them!”“We don’t have a ship that will take us that far, and it would take years to reach them.”“Now what are they doing?”“Looks like they’re strip mining mars and building fabrication plants. Oh, and it looks like China is sending nukes at them.”“Hot damn. Let’s send our own too! Did we get them?”“No sir. Their lasers melted the rockets before they escaped orbit.”“Are they coming YET?”“No sir. They’re still on Venus. Looks like they’re using the carbon dioxide there, Jovian water, and Uranian ammonia to create life while shading the atmosphere. It looks like they’re going to colonize venus.”“Well why aren’t they coming at us yet?”“Probably because there’s eight billion of us and we’ve spent twenty years arming to the teeth for their arrival. Oh! But we’re sending out our first wave of warships!”“Yeah! Let’s kick ass.”“We don’t know if they have asses sir. But the warships have been disabled.”“Destroyed?”“No sir. It looks like they shot off the drives, took out the weapons and attached a tug that pulled them to that facility they built on Deimos. Looks like a prisoner of war camp. No casualties reported.”“Is it time? It’s been a hundred years.”“Well sir, the environment is trashed, the population has collapsed to five billion, and we’ve lost the ability to launch. However, it looks as if the aliens are almost done colonizing Venus. From the display, the prisoners taken have bred to almost half a million there. The aliens are asking if we’d like to surrender yet.”“Surrender? We haven’t even fired a shot!”“Sir, at the rate of temperature increase, earth’s human carrying capacity will drop to less than one billion in fifty more years. The aliens transformed venus into a life boat for the human race. At this rate, we’re going to lose technological ability to detect the aliens, let alone fight them.”“Damn aliens! Why didn’t they come down and invade properly and fight us man to… er… tentacle?”“I dunno, sir.

4,"Me to this question -Anyways… let us get to it.There’s a thing called the “Kardeshev Scale” which is a theory of technology in usually alien species and civilizations. The ranking goes like this.Tier I: Garner resources from anywhere on the planet, certainly capable of space travel, but obviously (still) limited. Would theoretically have medicine that can replicate (or eventually) regeneration. Nuclear energy would be a major source of power for them, if not the main one, with other similar and powerful ‘unlimited’ and renewable ways of obtaining resources.Examples: I’d imagine the upper tiersMe to this question -Anyways… let us get to it.There’s a thing called the “Kardeshev Scale” which is a theory of technology in usually alien species and civilizations.

Would theoretically have medicine that can replicate (or eventually) regeneration. Nuclear energy would be a major source of power for them, if not the main one, with other similar and powerful ‘unlimited’ and renewable ways of obtaining resources.Examples: I’d imagine the upper tiers being like the UNSC (Halo), Tau (Warhammer 40k), and the various civilizations in Mass Effect.Tier II: Garner resources from the home-base star, to eventually getting resources from the solar system. These guys can create borderline megastructures, and it would take anywhere from one hundred thousand to a million years to get to their level. These guys would be the infamous (or famous, whatever preference it may be) interstellar traveling aliens that Hollywood derails all the time. They can probably replicate or even clone their inventions for superior production capabilities and so on and so forth.Examples: Low tier Forerunners (Halo), Imperium of Man (Warhammer 40k), Eldar (Warhammer 40k), Legends Galactic Empire (Star Wars). Super low tiers include the Covenant (Halo) or the Federation (Star Trek).Of course, there is Tier III (garnering resources from several solar systems to an entireExamples: Mid to high-tier Forerunners, Flood in Silentium novels/Precursors (Halo), very low-tier the Culture, Necrons (Warhammer 40k).Although not a part of Kardeshev’s original scaling, scientists concluded theories of Tier IV to Tier VII, I figured to barely gauge at Tier III’s enough because the answer is rather obvious from Tier I.Now then, a Tier I civilization alone can outproduce us due to superior resource gains, and still would have the technological progress to kick our sorry asses goodbye. A Tier II alien traveling civilization would probably just look at us from lightyears away and view us as too primitive to really be deemed as a threat.Halo Covenant CCS battlecruisers glassing the surface of a planet.The United States would have to resort to nukes against either, they can probably hold off an alien civilization that is just getting to Tier I, but barely. However, assuming interstellar travel, then I’d imagine they can just absorb whatever damage is done to them, or can just infiltrate the U.S government and its people in just a few short hours to potentially even minutes.Half-Life newspaper detailing the Seven Hour War. A war that ended very shortly due to a “large” Combine invasion. The lore gives a good idea of how a significantly higher technological civilization would induce supremacy over lower ones.If you know the movieAliens that sophisticated wouldn’t need to obliterate our continent with anti-matter or other various tools we cannot understand, they can just infiltrate the country via conversion and leave without ever having a fight. If a fight ensues, then the entire U.S military’s capabilities would be reduced to zero in just fifteen minutes if we’re being generous.We, humans, are a Tier 0.7 civilization, thusly we have no answer to a Tier II or higher Tier I civilization.—T.

Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party. Because radiation from nuclear accidents is apparently scarier than way more people dying of regular pollution constantly and the total annihilation of all life on Earth as the oceans boil away.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-does-the-US-military-respond-to-alien-invasion-with-high-advanced-technology

If we buried it in disused coal mines - then there could only be room for half of it!How would you stop it warming up and turning back into a gas and getting back into the atmosphere?WHAT ABOUT CONVERTING THE CO2 TO SOMETHING ELSE?The clean-coal “experts” will often talk about exciting new ways to convert CO2 into some kind of fuel!!!That’s guaranteed bullshit. CO2 is what you get when you extract all of the energy out of the carbon and oxygen molecules.If you want to convert it into some kind of fuel - then the energy you have to put into the reaction is 100% guaranteed to be more (considerably more) than you got from burning the coal in the first place.CONCLUSION:Clean coal is a flat out LIE.

The name of the festival isUnique thangedi poolu (thangedi flowers)Completely decorated “Bathukamma”Air pollution:As we know now a day we use a lot of Air-conditioners to make our rooms or home cool. These cooling agents have a lot of CFC (Chlorofluorocarbon) emissions. The ancient India as designed a system called Jaali System for the natural cooling of room or house.Here the image of the ancient jaali system which is a natural cooling system..Land Pollution:In the current scenario, we are using a lot of harmful pesticides in the agriculture and farming units. These kind of practices are not only effecting the human health but all, so making a sever land pollution. For this kind of pollution the ancient India has practised the use of cow dung as the natural fertilizer in the agriculture and farming units. This is very effective in killing all sorts of harmful insects which damage the agriculture lands. This will also increase the soil quality and mineral health in it.Here is the image of the lady sprinkling the cow dung power to the palnts…I think this answer satisfied your question regarding the super-advanced technologies to reduce pollution on earth.
