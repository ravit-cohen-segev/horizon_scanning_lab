On the contrary, theOn April 13 last year, I answered the question:“Perhaps they did not nail the future, rather it was the future that nailed them. What I am trying to get at here is, later scientists and technologists took their ideas and made them manifest. I believe it was William Shatner who explained that the doors in the original Star Trek series, did not open automatically when someone approached. On the contrary, there were real people behind those doors, opening and shutting as required. In the present, we take automatic doors for granted.In 1945, Arthur C. Clarke received $15 for writing a paper on communication satellites, and because he failed to file a patent, believed he lost out on 60 billion dollars. On a personal level, as a child in the 1950's, I can recall reading that particular paper (complete with drawings, or rather simple diagrams). It was, if I remember correctly, in one of those 'Amazing Stories' type magazines. Clarke, was later to write a piece entitled: “How I lost 60 Billion Dollars in my Spare Time”.Some time last year I wrote an answer to the question: ““The tale is set in Paris in the year 1960 and paints a very grim picture of what the then future would look like. This last was but one of the grounds why Hetzel returned the manuscript. But the amazing thing is, Verne prophesied so many things that came to pass. In the book, there are references to fax machines, auto-mobiles, high rise buildings, shopping expeditions, electronic calculators and even a form of the internet. And that is the reason it remained unpublished. It was because in the year 1863, these things would be just too unbelievable.”It is quite a mystery as to how Verne could conceive of all the foregoing. Nevertheless, maybe the answer to your question is, because there are so many science fiction writers, and ergo, so many ideas, that at least some of them are bound to eventually come true. When they fail to materialize, it is no big deal, and we take no notice. Whilst there are countless inventions remaining in countless science fiction stories and all unrealized, it is only when they become a reality that we sit up and marvel.”","2,522 followers",Martin Vratny,1.7K,2.9K,9.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-technology-plateauing

Now, it’s as easy as logging onto the internet, engaging several individuals at once (separately), and gaining endless amounts of supply from them all. In a sense think of it this way…Before, a narcissist could only gain individual victims one at a time and only as their time and distance allowed. Now, they can gain individual victims all over the world at the same time. A narcissist’s reach to gain supply and potentially abuse others has grown exponentially.

I literally mean that as chimps(monkey) and how they socialize. I just don’t use my physical strength to dispose of the leader; I use my emotional intelligence. We aren’t all true narcissists. You don’t know what you don’t know. Someone has to be the one that says no, that’s not ok, and there are real consequences to conducting yourself that way. Let’s talk about what language we should actually use. It sounds so childish and immature but the truth is we are all emotional children - even if we are in adult bodies. Try going into an elementary school classroom one day - no one teaches actual life. Middle schools are overrun with disrespectful semi-adult/children. To be socially just our society must establish boundaries for unity and respectful behavior. Yes, we need to teach the very basics, even language. “Instead of ‘hook up’ you might try “can I call you later?” and then actually use your voice. Your voice should be heard.Far too much of our communication is left to the reader’s perception. Too much of our communication has become unnecessarily personal. Shutting it down is not the answer. We need to reformulate our educational goals. We need to teach our children to survive their childhoods long enough for get a formal education.

It’s not bad if it’s balanced.When I read the book “How to win friends and influence people” by Dale Carnegie he said the most important sound to anyone is to hear the sound of their own name. He said to learn how to remember everyone’s name and say it. (Something like that) hmm 🤔I tried it out. It seems to be true! Unless you are the late musician Prince who changed his name to….a sign that no one could pronounce??Technology has become a speaker phone for anyone to show off how ridiculous they are. Well now pretty much everyone can see how foolish we are. Myself included. 🙏 who needs to pay to go to the circus or freak shows anymore? Just hop on your fry phone, the tv or laptop and there is just an over load of freaks everywhere seeking attention. 🤡I honestly don’t think technology has increased the narcissist population. It’s a low percentage of the population. But it has dumbed people down. We live on a narcissistic culture.Technology has allowed us to reach wider audiences to share not so savory behavior and there are just some people with 2 brain cells that can’t think for themselves and follow the highway of stupidity!!I can say I am not the narcissist overlord clicking every person with NPD. How does ANYONE even know for sure how many are suffering from the disorder when many of them don’t ever seek help for it??? My dad won’t. My ex spouse sure as heck isn’t seeking help. He is ALWAYS right and He’s perfect!! End of discussion. 🤦🏽‍♀️Technology doesn’t create a narcissist. People do. Sometimes a pack of wolves might raise a child better than a human. Abuse and narcissism has been around for ever? It just wasn’t broadcasted.It’s just that now, the few narcissists get center stage. Violent news, violent tv shows, films, video games. How well would the news outlets do if all they showed were ponies and tropical fish swimming in the ocean? 🐠 🐠 🤔Im all for sharing awareness. I’m grateful for places for survivors to come together. But in my utopian world… the people wouldn’t pay any attention to narcissists. Tv ratings would suck! Social media?? Non existent. They want the attention. Any attention and the masses give it to them. Sadomasochistic much?I don’t know….because if this world depended on me alone to survive- I’m so sorry. The world would end. I use my fry phone to answer questions and watch educational videos. I do like watching “Karen” videos on you tube. secret pleasure 👀👀 most of the movies I know of are from 20 years ago. I don’t watch tv. I don’t even check the weather. Malls and restaurants would just shutter away to oblivion. Stock market wouldn’t just crash- it would fall out the bottom of the Earth. There would be no president.I’m not trying to sound nihilistic nor depressing. I am just very out of touch. I was married to a narcissist. I’m just not interested in watching them nor participating with when I don’t have to.🤷🏾‍♀️ It’s a waste of time.People annoy me so I avoid them at all costs( in real life). I don’t leave my house to be around others nor watch stuff just to go online and argue with other people. I don’t want to argue. So I stay away. Yet… I have this horrible propensity of attracting others who want my attention and want to strike up a conversation. 🙄 I usually walk away. I don’t care if they think I’m rude or weird. Because I don’t want to have small talk about dumb shit? People get perturbed that I don’t discuss sports, politics, tv shows because I have NO idea what’s going on??I don’t want to debate and I’m not swayed by other’s opinions.My belief is:My mom laughs at me as she says “did you hear the news?? Probably not” she’s right. All news is 4 days old in my world. I sit in my car alone most of the time next to a park reading weird books and staring at trees.Technology is a tool. To be used wisely. It needs to be snatched out of the baby hands of narcissists. And intelligent humans need to discern what to watch and how these devices are used. Don’t blame the Narcissist. Don’t blame technology. Because who’s watching?? You?? Then stop watching.My dad is retired and if he isn’t cutting everybody’s grass obsessively, eating or taking his ritual bath he watches the news and complains about Trump. I’d rather he just cut the grass. But he is a narcissist and need something to complain about. With all us kids grown, gone and none of us visit him- he must be bored as f$ck. Poor him.My histrionic sister always has her tv on. And her cell phone glued to her ear. (Yet I rarely hear from her…) she just sent me photos of her new grandchild last night, but never told me her daughter, my niece, was pregnant. That’s….really interesting. Guess she needs attention. I’m such an ass that I texted back to her: “oh the baby is so cute. I had no idea that Betty * was pregnant.”I knew- my mom told me but I was testing her. She herself never told me. She never changes. She’s almost 50. Lost cause there.I don’t even know where I wandered off to on this answer. Kudos to those who read it to the end.

To ensure that we keep making technological advancements and increase their number, we should consider investing, funding and attracting people to STEM fields because it is more likely to speed up tech advancement with engineers leading the way rather than someone who knows a lot about genders. When engineers in many fields are being produced, then enable R&D activities and financial instruments to incentivise entrepreneurs that bring tech to the market.However, many people may already think thatEverything starts with education.

Elderly, rural, and the impoverished people are increasingly fearful of technology and it's use in payment, social function, employment, ect. There has been a"" killer app gap “ for a little while and I think it's probably a good thing. There is a little catching up to do if we wish to avoid the 3 or so decades of backlash accompaning a biforecated two tier global society in the throes of means equalization.

The move from mono chrome cathode ray tubes to flat plasma screens was pretty quick. Landlines to widespread cellular faster. Almost every aspect of modern life involves connectivity.

25,"Strictly the “speed” technological development is mostly fixed and constant. It take about the same amount of time to “invent” new technologies now as it did 100–200 years ago. This is because the basic requirements of modern manufacturability and costs ultimately combined with limits of human cognition, attention and commitment gate how fast it can ever go.What you can do and which the only actual thing that makes the pace of technology developmentStrictly the “speed” technological development is mostly fixed and constant.

A google search will bring these up and I don’t advertise for free. A last thought, off the question a little, but since it’s summer, look for day camps. Lots of areas have camps run by parks and rec departments that focus on nature, coding etc. It would be great for a six or seven year old.",125 followers,Hannah Yang,7K,148,14.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-technology-plateauing
27,"My go-to toy has long been Legos. They can be as simple or as complicated as you want.Recently, I kept getting an ad for a set of simple machines that could be built using the kit and run on solar energy. After consulting with my husband, I purchased and had the kit sent to my great nephew. He had a good time putting the set together.",326 followers,Anubhav Jain,6.4K,4.4K,123.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-technology-plateauing
28,"ANSWER NUMBER 1: You.After that, I always favored open-ended materials that can be used more than just a couple of times. Often “kits” in toy stores are just that. Use it a couple of times and everyone’s done.Look for things that are challenging but not so much that they will become discouraged. It’s important at that age to allow them to have early success.Also:ANSWER NUMBER 1: You.After that, I always favored open-ended materials that can be used more than just a couple of times.

Later they have plenty of even more technical sets to explore.","56,608 followers",Iva Izabela Miholic,1.2K,251,26.7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-has-science-fiction-affected-the-development-of-modern-day-technology
