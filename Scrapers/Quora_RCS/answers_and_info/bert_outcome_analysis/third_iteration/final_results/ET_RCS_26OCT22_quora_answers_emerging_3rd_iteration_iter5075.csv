1,"Not going to happen. No one seems to remember that people in cold climates used to go and cut use and then sell it. Now we have refrigerator freezers that make ice. Sure, those people lost their jobs. Today, we have software development, and search engine optimization, and a host of other jobs that didn’t exist 100 years ago. We have less unemployment now than back 100+ years ago. Yet, 100+ years ago people cried that machines and automation would take their jobs.history repeats itself.

4,"I believe society is very much behind to the technology. If until now it was somehow justified for an entrepreneur to be “encouraged” to take risks and move ahead, as future comes to us faster than we even imagine, we should reconsider the means of profits and how to share the wealth of the whole world. If most of the products will be made by non-humans, I don’t think it’s fair for the former workers to live in a shack, on 3 meals a day and no means to move outside of their walking distance radius.

7,"Improving technology, a desire to eliminate humans, and plain old capitalism are causing automation. Now, that’s “eliminate” as in “remove from the business,” not “exterminate,” but it stands. Humans are messy and difficult. They need to be recruited and trained, they have work which needs to be scheduled around conflicting priorities like having families and healthcare needs, they pose risks for safety and corporate exposure to lawsuits for everything from negligence to sexual harassment, and so on.

They need to be recruited and trained, they have work which needs to be scheduled around conflicting priorities like having families and healthcare needs, they pose risks for safety and corporate exposure to lawsuits for everything from negligence to sexual harassment, and so on. If you’re a capitalist, you pay workers grudgingly and only because you don’t have a better alternative, and Wall Street is well known for rewarding companies who cut costs by cutting people. If you could make the same or even similar money while cutting out the people, you’d jump at it.Enter automation. Fancier and fancier technologies allow you to take more and more people out of the equation. Travel agents? Spin up on-line booking programs. Operators answering phones? Replace them with an IVR. Bank tellers? Roll in some ATMs. And maybe set up some scanners in the grocery store so you don’t have to employ so many checkout clerks.But the important thing to understand here is that the minimum wageAdvocates of higher minimum wages are, generally speaking, aware of this and figure that employees should at least make a living wage as long as they’re employed rather than make starvation wages for a little bit longer. But that’s a short-term issue. There’s a long-term problem—the collapse of demand as a consequence of systemic downward pressure on wages and lots of those wages being lost to various flavors of debt and a dangerously underemployed population—which needs to be solved. Unfortunately, the solution likely involves, in some way, the wealthiest members of society",36 followers,Adam Ambrozy,579,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/As-technology-is-advancing-through-automatic-production-and-AI-will-replace-many-human-jobs-is-it-fair-for-a-handfull-of-people-to-gain-humongous-riches-while-majority-would-live-on-universal-income-minimum-wage
8,"I used to think that people were born poor and it was up to them to get themselves out of poverty. Then I began to look more closely at the problem and while there have been a lot of people who have escaped poverty, there are many more who never do. What is even worse than that is realizing that during the whole “Occupy Wall Street” movement, a buddy of mine said to me “Doesn’t it feel great to be a part of the 1%” and I did some quick math and told him “Look, I am part of the 2% and based on my calculation you are in the 3%.” The funny thing about that is that so many small business owners thI used to think that people were born poor and it was up to them to get themselves out of poverty.
