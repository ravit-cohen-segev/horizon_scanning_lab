Everybody on board was expecting to see the beautiful & barren sights of the ice fields.What none of them knew was that their fate were sealed by Air New Zealand the night before they left.During the first few flights, Air New Zealand had routed their flight to fly right above Mount Erebus, a towering Antarctic volcano. But that changed after a while. Subsequent flights was routed away from Erebus, flying down McMurdo Sound to McMurdo Base, making it much safer. At the same time, Air New Zealand pilots were given discretion to descend from the minimum safe altitude of 16,000 feet when under radar control, in order to make it better for the passengers to see the sights. This was the flight that was briefed to the crew of the ill fated flight, three weeks prior.But the night prior to departure, Air New Zealand’s navigation section had changed the coordinates of the McMurdo waypoint. For some reason, they neglected to mention the change to the crew. And so the crew took off expecting to fly down McMurdo Sound, but the aircraft’s computer was programmed to fly right above Mount Erebus. The crew’s subsequent actions was fine had they flown on the route they were briefed on, but because they weren’t, it contributed to their doom. Compounding the problem was the fact that the crew wasn’t trained for whiteout conditions which is the norm when flying in snowy terrain. Because of this, the slopes of Mount Erebus looked like flat terrain to them.Which why they couldn’t avoid the slopes until it was too late.However, the worse was still to come. Air New Zealand, which was then owned by the government, realized that they screwed up massively. Subsequently, the government realized that they screwed up massively. They had to try and shift the blame.Which they did, blaming the pilot and orchestrating a massive cover up. Pertinent documents was shredded. Briefing documents that the deceased pilots had kept were confiscated, and in one instance was outright stolen in a break in.The subsequent government inquiry would have sealed the pilots’ fate, had it not been the dogged determination of the man in charge, Justice Peter Mahon. Thanks to his thoroughness, the public found out about Air New Zealand’s careless behaviour, and subsequent despicable actions in trying to shift the blame to the pilots. It was, to quote Justice Mahon, “an orchestrated litany of lies”.Unfortunately, neither Air New Zealand nor the New Zealand government chose humility in that instance. They went after Mahon’s findings, and while the findings of the inquiry remained intact, which ultimately cleared the pilots, Mahon’s allegations of a coverup was found to be improper. Air New Zealand and the government cheered at the time, still not admitting culpability in the deaths of 257 people.It was only 40 years after the disaster, in the hands of a far different New Zealand government and a far different Air New Zealand, that both parties acknowledged how poorly they acted in the days & weeks after Air New Zealand Flight 901 departed on its final flight, on 28 November 1979.While the death toll from the crash was not as high as many other air disasters, the drama that occurred post accident was the reason why it was the most tragic air accident, in my opinion.",924 followers,Suhaimi Fariz,2K,3.9K,7.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/All-planes-that-recently-crashed-had-advanced-technologies-of-landing-on-water-Why-is-it-that-there-is-no-survivors-in-the-recent-plane-crashes

He pleaded mercy from his manager Raymond Thomson asking to be reinstated. Ray refused the plea and kept Burke fired. A frustrated Burke bought a ticket for flight 1771 in which he knew Ray Thomson would fly in as a passenger. This was way back in 1987 when flight and airport security was not what it is today. Burke smuggled a gun thru security and boarded flight 1771After take off, the 4 engine jet cruised at 22000 ft. Burke with full of rage waited for his time to strike. Although the exact sequence of events was never determined, it is documented that Burke had shot dead Ray Thomson, the two pilots and possibly a flight attendant. Once after that, Burke had pushed the yoke all the way forward pointing the nose down before he set all 4 engines to full power.The reason why I think this is the deadliest crash is because this was a controlled crash. Burke literally flew the airplane to the ground. Imagine an airplane flying nose straight down with 4 engines running at full power. It must have been absolutely terrible last few moments of their lives for the passengers.The plane is said to have crashed at a speed little higher than the speed of sound. The aircraft had disintegrated into multiple small pieces while also leaving a crater on the rocky hillside it crashed. The remains of the deceased were never identified. According to wiki the the aircraft experienced a deceleration of 5,000 times the force of gravity. Now, although it would have been a quick death, thinking about the sheer terror sends chills down the spineIt is also said Ray was given a note by Burke before he was shot. The note read‘Hey Ray. I think it's sort of ironical that we end up like this. I asked for some leniency for my family. Remember? Well, I got none and you'll get none’Retrospectively, I hope Ray had the time to tell Burke he would hire him back if he spares his life.Images: Google",0 followers,Mani Jay,1.7K,385,2.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/All-planes-that-recently-crashed-had-advanced-technologies-of-landing-on-water-Why-is-it-that-there-is-no-survivors-in-the-recent-plane-crashes

TheThe plane, assigned to Air Canada Flight 143 was a Canadian scheduled domestic passenger flight between Montreal and Edmonton, ran out of fuel on July 23, 1983, at an altitude of 41,000 feet (12,000 m), midway through the flight. The crew was able to glide the Boeing 767 aircraft safely to an emergency landing at a former Royal Canadian Air Force base inThe subsequent investigation revealed that a combination of company failures, human errors and confusion over unit measures had led to the aircraft being refuelled with insufficient fuel for the planned flight. The root cause wasCanada had gone metric in the 1970s, but like always, learning new stuff is difficult (Finland went euro in 2002, but I counted prices in my mind in Finnish markka until roughly 2007 ). At the time of the incident, Canada was in the process of converting to the metric system in the aviation sector. As part of this process, the new 767s being acquired by Air Canada were the first to be calibrated for metric units instead of Imperial units (gallons and pounds). All other aircraft were still operating with Imperial units.For the trip to Edmonton, the pilot calculated a fuel requirement of 22,300 kilograms (49,200 lb). A floatstick check indicated that there were 7,682 litres (1,690 imp gal; 2,029 US gal) already in the tanks. To calculate how much more fuel had to be added, the crew needed to convert the volume (litres) in the tanks to a mass (kilograms), subtract that figure from 22,300 kg and convert the result back into a volume. In previous times, this task would have been completed by a flight engineer, but the 767 was the first of a new generation of airliners that flew with only a pilot and co-pilot.The volume of jet fuel varies with temperature. In this case, the mass of a litre of fuel was 0.803 kg, so the correct calculation was:7,682 litres × 0.8 kg/L = 6,169 kg = mass of fuel already on boardThe ground crew, however, used the incorrect conversion factor of 1.77,13,597 kg already on board)Instead of taking on the 20,088 litres of additional fuel that they required, they instead took on only 4,917 litres. The use of the incorrect conversion factor led to a total fuel load of only 22,300 pounds (10,100 kg) rather than the 22,300 kilograms that was needed. This was approximately half the amount required to reach their destination. Knowing the problems with the FQIS, Captain Pearson double-checked their calculations but was given the same incorrect conversion factor and came up with the same erroneous figures.Oops.So the aeroplane simply ran out of the fuel mid-flight. Airliners tend to have poor glide ratios (12 to 1), but good enough to glide to a nearest emergency strip if they have enough altitude, and they had.The First Officer Maurice Quintal, a former RCAF aviator, knew the abandoned Gimli airstrip, and decided to land there, and he radioed to the air traffic controller. Captain Pearson was an experienced glider pilot, and decided to land the airliner deadstick (as a glider). Unbeknown to Quintal or to the air traffic controller, a part of the facility had been converted to a race track complex.A sports car race hosted by the Winnipeg Sports Car Club was underway at the time of the incident and the area around the decommissioned runway was full of cars and campers. Part of the decommissioned runway was being used to stage the race.Without power, the pilots used gravity to lower the landing gear and lock it into place. The main gear locked into position, but the nose wheel did not; this later turned out to be advantageous.As the runway drew near, it became apparent that the aircraft was coming in too high and fast, raising the danger of running off the runway before it could be stopped. The pilots briefly considered a 360-degree turn to reduce speed and altitude, but decided that they did not have enough altitude for the manoeuvre. Pearson decided to execute a forward slip to increase drag and lose altitude. This manoeuvre, also known as skidding, is commonly used with gliders and light aircraft to descend more quickly without increasing forward speed.Complicating matters was the fact that with both of its engines out, the plane made virtually no noise during its approach. People on the ground thus had no warning of the impromptu landing and little time to flee. As the gliding plane closed in on the runway, the pilots noticed that there were two boys riding bicycles within 1,000 feet (300 m) of the projected point of impact. Captain Pearson would later remark that the boys were so close that he could see the looks of sheer terror on their faces as they realized that a commercial airliner was bearing down on them.Two factors helped avert disaster: the failure of the front landing gear to lock into position during the gravity drop, and the presence of a guardrail that had been installed along the centre of the decommissioned runway to facilitate its use as a race track. As soon as the wheels touched down on the runway, Pearson braked hard, blowing out two of the aircraft's tires. The unlocked nose wheel collapsed and was forced back into its well, causing the aircraft's nose to slam into, bounce off, and then scrape along the ground. This additional friction helped to slow the airplane and kept it from careening into the crowds surrounding the runway. After the aircraft had touched down, the nose began to scrape along the guardrail in the centre of the race track; Pearson applied extra right brake, which caused the main landing gear to straddle the guardrail creating additional drag that further reduced the speed. Air Canada Flight 143 came to a final stop on the ground 17 minutes after running out of fuel.There were no serious injuries among the 61 passengers or the people on the ground. A minor fire in the nose area was extinguished by racers and course workers armed with fire extinguishers.The aviation authorities were not amused of the accident, which would have been fully preventable. At the same time they praised Pearson’s and Quintal’s professionalism and skill on gliding the airliner to safety.The airliner was repaired and returned to service, and she flew 25 years more. She was finally retired, and scrapped 2014. The aluminium of her fuselage was stamped into commemorate luggage tags. Her cockpit has been turned into a simulator, and is located at Gimli Motor Sports Center, Manitoba, Canada.","1,124 followers",Shane Kai Glenn,1.4K,547,1.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/All-planes-that-recently-crashed-had-advanced-technologies-of-landing-on-water-Why-is-it-that-there-is-no-survivors-in-the-recent-plane-crashes
