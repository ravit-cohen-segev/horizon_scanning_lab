Which is probably the secret of the magic buoyancy of Navalny: many people died strange deaths or were locked up for far less controversy than he has caused. Someone powerful enough around Putin seems to keep him safe as a Plan B in order to use the man as a safety valve the day Putin disappears from the Kremlin.",UNKNOWN,Steven L.

3,"Nope, never going to happen, silicon electronics is here to stay.Photonics is useful in circuits for very niche applications, like high bandwidth data transfer between different electronic IC and logic blocks, or to enable new architectures—like optical links between a compute block and a memory bank—this way all memory becomes cache due to the optical link.

Cache memory is fast access memory because it sits close to the CPU (i.e. on the CPU). But with optical links, the physical distance between compute and memory becomes irrelevant.Some companies likeThus, using photonics with electronics is more useful for moving data around rather than for actually doing computation. There are three main reasons for this: (1) photonic devices are big (several microns) since light can’t be efficiently guided in dimensions smaller than the wavelength, and (2) III-V materials for the laser and other components are far more expensive than silicon, and (3) existing fabs that cost billions of dollars are set up for silicon, and we have learned know how to manipulate silicon extremely well over several decades. Point (1) matters because 1 optical modulator can take the space of >100 transistors.Silicon is way too mature and effective for there to be any serious competing technology. Other novel technologies (like Silicon Photonics) will only augment the existing silicon rather than replace it.","135,539 followers",Hector Quintanilla,3.1K,1.2K,88.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-examples-of-renewable-bioorganic-materials-that-are-replacing-have-replaced-and-will-replace-nonrenewable-inorganic-materials-in-modern-technology-especially-in-electronics
4,"Due to the process of “cracking,” petroleum can be broken down into various components. Gasoline is simply one component. By altering the conditions, a refinery can shift production to favor other products that will still be in demand - asphalt for roads, chemicals for plastics, solvents, ingredients for fertilizer, etc. Some gasoline will still be made as there will be a market for specialized gas vehicles, but it will make up a much smaller portion of petroleum product.",403 followers,Theo Schmit,3.8K,174,929.4K,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-examples-of-renewable-bioorganic-materials-that-are-replacing-have-replaced-and-will-replace-nonrenewable-inorganic-materials-in-modern-technology-especially-in-electronics
5,"Nope, it’s too rich of a feedstock and energy source. The alternatives are coal and natural gas, both of which are good feedstocks for chemicals, fuels, electrical generation etc. but looked at with the same overhyped carbon fear as oil.The other feedstock source would be plant-based (corn, sugar cane, oilseeds, etc.) so you divert higher value food to make less efficient vehicle fuels and plastics. You can do a lot with other feedstocks like wood and some other plants, but it takes a lot of energy, collecting the feedstock like small trees is a significant problem as you scale up to a viableNope, it’s too rich of a feedstock and energy source.

You can do a lot with other feedstocks like wood and some other plants, but it takes a lot of energy, collecting the feedstock like small trees is a significant problem as you scale up to a viable size, and it only produces some of the stuff needed for modern society. Bio-based plastics have been around since the 1880’s but they’re tricky and more limited in function so far.Replacing petroleum plastics with nanotubes, aramid fibers, etc. is more likely but getting those costs down will take decades without major breakthroughs.Algae-based feedstocks are quite promising and evade many constraints of the old systems but when they’ll scale up and be built in sufficient numbers to be noticeable is probably more 20–40 years. It takes a long time to develop and build refineries, especially with the Not In My Backyard idiots blocking and delaying everything.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-examples-of-renewable-bioorganic-materials-that-are-replacing-have-replaced-and-will-replace-nonrenewable-inorganic-materials-in-modern-technology-especially-in-electronics
6,"So we didn't do that in Norway ?The petroleum sector continue to be a key driver for the Norwegian economy. It is the country’s single largest industry. The sector accounts for 10% of GDP, 20% of total investments, 10% of state revenues, and 31% of total exports (not including the service and supply industry). Norway is the world´s 3rd largest exporter of natural gas, and the 13th largest exporter of oil. Indirectly, the petroleum sector contributes around 200,000 jobs throughout Norway.

Norway is the world´s 3rd largest exporter of natural gas, and the 13th largest exporter of oil. Indirectly, the petroleum sector contributes around 200,000 jobs throughout Norway. Norway’s oil and liquids production peaked in 2001 at 3.4 million barrels per day (bpd) and has declined to the current level of around 2 million bpd. Production is expected increase again when Phase 2 of the large, new Johann Sverdrup field comes on stream in 2022 (Phase 1 came on stream in October 2019).Despite the cyclical nature of this sector, downturns in oil and gas prices and high-cost constraints that have emerged over the recent years, the overall mood in Norway’s petroleum industry remains cautiously optimistic. The Norwegian oil and gas industry sector is global in nature.Although the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS) is maturing as an offshore oil and gas play, Norway has had several significant discoveries in the past few years, including the giant Johan Sverdrup field. There are currently about 95 discoveries that could be, or are being, considered for development.There are two kinds of licensing rounds on the NCS, the numbered licensing rounds and the Awards in predefined Areas (APA). The numbered licensing rounds are normally held every other year and include frontier parts of the NCS. APA rounds are announced every year and comprise the mature parts of the NCS, with better known geology and more developed infrastructure. Companies that want to become an operator or licensee on the NCS must be pre-qualified.In June 2020, the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy announced a new licensing round for APA 2020. The Ministry’s objective is to award new production licenses in the announced areas at the beginning of 2021. More information on the APA 2020 announcement can be found on the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate’s website:In June 2020, the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy proposed announcing nine area in the 25th licensing round in frontier areas on the NCS. The proposal was submitted for public consultation. More information can be found on the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate’s website on theResource accounts with estimates of both produced and remaining resources show that there are 8.1 billion standard cubic meters (scm) of oil equivalents (oe) left to be produced on the NCS. During its 50 years of production, Norway has depleted about 7.6 billion scm oe – or 48% of its total resources.The vast majority of Norway’s gas exports are destined for Europe. Norwegian gas accounts for about 20% of total European gas consumption. Norway supplies almost 40% of the UK’s gas consumption, and Norway also provides substantial amounts of gas to Germany and France.Oil and gas production in Norway is only offshore. While there are significant onshore processing facilities, there is no onshore production. The average estimated recovery factor for oil on the NCS is now close to 50% after steady increments during the last decade. Many of the fields that are producing today are of such a magnitude that even a small increase in the recovery factor will yield substantial extra oil volumes.Leading Sub-SectorsLeading sub-sectors for U.S. suppliers continue to be increasingly advanced drilling and well completion technologies. Key areas continue to be zero-surface, subsea and deep water technology; advanced technology facilitating remote/onshore, real-time operations, and solutions advancing the e-field, reducing the need for transportation and the number of personnel having to stay on offshore platforms; unmanned systems and ROVs; innovative solutions for improved recovery and marginal field technology; carbon capture and storage (CCS) and any other technology reducing or avoiding CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions (Norway introduced a carbon tax in 1991, levied on all combustion of gas, oil and diesel in operations on the NCS and on releases of CO2 and natural gas); LNG technology/gas value chain, incl. technology facilitating more efficient and clean production and transportation of gas from remote locations; as oil and gas fields are depleted and production ceases, investments are also needed on abandonment or alternative use of installations.There is growing overlap with other industry and technology sectors, e.g. how to operate in extreme conditions using increasingly advanced technology, sensors and intelligent tools. An example of this is learning and sharing best practices with leaders in robotics, space technology, medical technology, etc.Most purchases for the offshore industry stem from Norwegian and international oil companies operating on the NCS and from local yards and offshore structure contractors building and maintaining offshore installations. There is extensive use of engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts. Most of these major contracts are channeled through Norwegian and international offshore engineering and service companies developing the NCS.Publicly listed Equinor ASA, with a 67% Norwegian Government ownership share, controls approximately 80% of the operatorships on the NCS. Equinor is a Fortune 50 company and is the largest company in the Nordic Region by revenue.Most of the U.S. oil majors and large service companies are present in Norway: ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil (although the company divested its offshore operatorships and licenses in 2019), Halliburton, TechnipFMC, National Oilwell Varco, Schlumberger, Baker-Hughes/GE, Cameron, Weatherford, Oceaneering, etc.OpportunitiesInvestment and operating costs have remained high on the NCS in recent years. The Norwegian government emphasizes that the oil industry needs to strive to make their exploration activities as efficient and cost-effective as possible while at the same time showing due consideration for the environment and the fisheries, especially since exploration and drilling activities are moving further north and into more coastal areas. The remaining resources on the NCS are gradually becoming more difficult to produce, both technologically and commercially. The industry’s development and implementation of new and cost saving technologies, e.g. within seismic surveys, interpretation of seismic data, drilling, and subsea production, will be of crucial importance in this regard. Also of great significance is the information sharing and innovation linking the petroleum sector with sectors such as information and communication technology, maritime industries, finance, and other Norwegian energy industries.The NCS is divided into three petroleum provinces, the North Sea, the Norwegian Sea, and the frontier Barents Sea. Norway continuously seeks new and proven technology to be used in the deeper and more extreme northern waters.Norway is a mature market for the oil and gas sector as it has been producing oil and gas from the North Sea for decades. The challenge that U.S. companies face is the competition from well qualified domestic and regional equipment and service suppliers.Web Resources",289 followers,Deepak Mehta,2.9K,3.9K,105.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-examples-of-renewable-bioorganic-materials-that-are-replacing-have-replaced-and-will-replace-nonrenewable-inorganic-materials-in-modern-technology-especially-in-electronics
