Personally I don’t think that we’ll be seeing any true colonies on Mars in our lifetimes, but the Starship does enable something even more crucial, and that’s the expansion of our industry into space. Once you make launch costs a trivial part of the total project budget, you find that activity in space will absolutely take off (if you’ll pardon the pun). It all starts with extraterrestrial resource extraction and processing. Once you get this established, then manufacturing will logically follow and we’ll see the genesis of a new space based solar economy that will eventually far surpass what we currently have on Earth.",10 followers,Andrew Forrest,1.8K,6.2K,16.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-examples-of-modern-technology
