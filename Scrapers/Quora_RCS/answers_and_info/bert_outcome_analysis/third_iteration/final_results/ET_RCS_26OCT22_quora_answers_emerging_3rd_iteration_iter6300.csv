0,"I suppose hypothetically there is an endpoint for technology progress, however it would take longer then humans will be around. As Technology progresses more foundations for progress are created.For example in the sixteen hundreds there was no thought of FaceTime or Skype like products(instant video messaging) could be created because there were no phones or cameras.However as technology advanced, things that could not have possible be concieved in the past come in full viewAs we go deeper into the technological rabbit hole, the more vast and endless it appears.Benett AssmanI suppose hypothetically there is an endpoint for technology progress, however it would take longer then humans will be around.

1,"Will there ever be a point where we can’t improve technology any further?“Technology” isn’t one thing. It’s quite usual for a new technology to be developed far beyond what its inventors would’ve believed possible, then replaced by a better technology. This happened with photography based on film — the last generation of professional film cameras was marvelous, but digital photography supervened. It’s happening now with automobiles — internal combustion engines and drivetrains are far more reliable and efficient than they were a hundred years ago, and are being replaced by electric motors.

3,"They didn’t, they evolvedWe don’t know exactly when we and our fellow apes diverged from other primates (including the various monkeys) to begin our own branch of the evolutionary tree but it may have been as long as 25–30 million years ago. That was when the common ancestor (of humans and monkeys, in your terms) lived. That figure is based on various evidence, including fossil evidence discovered in 2013.You have a very poor grasp of the theory of evolution which means that your question is based on an entirely false premise.",3 followers,Samuel Bateman,1.1K,102,56.4K,2019,https://www.quora.com/Will-there-come-a-time-when-technology-has-reached-its-limits-and-we-can-advance-no-further

6,"“Using” implies that the technology is exploiting us, the humans, in order for its own benefit. No, I do not think it is doing this. I think that sometimes tech companies, run by sentient humans, do dirty things to manipulate people who use their technologies and services, but I don’t think the technology itself is “using” us ...","220,632 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,783M,UNKNOWN,https://www.quora.com/Will-there-come-a-time-when-technology-has-reached-its-limits-and-we-can-advance-no-further
7,I have a hypothetical scenario in which this might be true. It could be that we are attracted to certain materials and stuff either because of a parasite or a mechanism (who knows what or how) that causes us to build technology. It is definitely sure that technology educates us to make and produce more technology and that one day technology will build technology. From then on it is definitely going to evolve further. It is definitely a question at which point you can start speaking of technology as an entity.Maybe humans are like butterflies.

8,The political system doesn't promote competition or reconciliation of interests. The democratic system is a legalised extortion racket that is intent upon securing a stable and definitive outcome with a populist mandate. Ultimately this leaves everyone alienated and apathetic. Moral standards are the last thing on people's minds. The first is sceptical resignation.,405 followers,Steven Witcher,4K,1.6K,2.5M,UNKNOWN,https://www.quora.com/Will-there-come-a-time-when-technology-has-reached-its-limits-and-we-can-advance-no-further
9,"Well, if since thousands of years women would prefer mating men with morality and judgement abilities, this would have turned out an improvement for reproduction and might have been selected, therefore. However, this condition is rarely met. Thus, these properties have no advantage.On the other hand, I do not think technology evolves; it rather is developed by creators. The ability to create tech things has evolved in humans from the very beginning, the use of fire might be its first appearance, manufacturing obsidian arrowheads another one.",17 followers,Paras Tyagi,3.5K,1.4K,46.5M,UNKNOWN,https://www.quora.com/Will-there-come-a-time-when-technology-has-reached-its-limits-and-we-can-advance-no-further
10,"There’s an inverse relationship between Leftism and Reality. Evolution is not a real thing. All things devolve from a state of superiority to a pathetic state of weakness until extinction is inevitable.Wolves devolve into dingoes, jackals, coyotes and dogs. Sometimes we think things are getting better because we infuse them with new information. We selectively breed animals for size, speed, beauty and a myriad of other things. Although we prefer a hypoallergenic lap dog to a wolf, the resulting lineage is far inferior in metrics that matter for survival. The wolf remains the apex, and the dogThere’s an inverse relationship between Leftism and Reality. Evolution is not a real thing.

Funny you should contrast morality with technology. Common discourse would have us believe that tech is making us better people every day. The truth is quite different. Technology is fueling moral decline at an exponential rate. We now have more time, money and power to deviate from decency.Sorry for the giant black pill, but the evidence is clearly in my corner.","46,128 followers",Steven Haddock,693,25.6K,343.5M,UNKNOWN,https://www.quora.com/If-we-are-still-evolving-can-our-intelligence-evolve-to-decrease-to-the-point-where-we-cannot-use-the-technology-we-made
