0,Yes indeed…We tested some of it recently on all those people who wanted to raid Area 51 over the weekend. The reason they didn’t…we used Mind Control Technology on them.

2,"Sure.The Canadian Army uses the Coleman stove and lanterns based on a design first sold in the 1950s. They could switch to battey powered lanterns and other fuel sources for stoves, but then they would not have heat sources for tents.The Canadian Army uses snowshoes and toboggans. The tech predates European settlement in North America. While there are snowmobiles and ATVs in service nothing competes with the absolute mobility and stealth of snowshoes.Artic tents used by the Canadian Army are at least a 50 years old design.

While there are snowmobiles and ATVs in service nothing competes with the absolute mobility and stealth of snowshoes.Artic tents used by the Canadian Army are at least a 50 years old design. While there are tents you can use to climb a mountain, non are as rugged as an Army artic tent (you pay for it in weight).Army field ration packaging has not changed much since the 1980s. There are dehydrated foods, but they don’t taste as good and they are a lot more expensive.They still have field phones with hand cranks. You can run out of batteries.Our machetes, axes, and shovels can not be replaced chainsaws and backhoes (we use them), there are not enough chainsaws and backhoes, the require fuel and maintance and there are not as mobile.Airborne forces still use static line parachute systems instead of free fall systems. The basic design dates to WW2.The Canadian engineer knife dates atleast the 1970’s. It is a great design.While we use GPS, I can not imagine a Canadian Infantry Senior NCO or officer leaving his house without a compass based on design from the 1950s.Like wise the Canadian Army will still issue whistles to infantry leaders who want them for signalling. Though most use a Fox40. At least a twenty year old design. Pen flares, about the size of a close pin, that use a spring mech to fire date back to at least to the early 80’s but maybe back to the 1950’s.Canadian assault boats look they same as they did in the early 1970’s.Some units still take manual typewiters into the field. They don’t need power and they secure from intercept.We still teach some of our soldiers to canoe.We use thirty and forty year old cross country skis.The M72 light anti-tank rocket (no ones uses it on tanks, but it is ok on light skinned vehicles near it is great for blowing holes through walls was used in Vietnam. It ain’t leaving the system anytime soon.The 50cal MG used by the Canadain Army dates to atleast the 1960’s. It is an awesome weapon.The Canadian Army uses a 50 year old thermos, a sixty year old 1 quart water bottle, a 30 year 2 quarter water bottle, and a 15 year old camelback.They use a forty year fresh food container system (metal not plastic) supplied by a fifty year field kitchen.They use the same stretchers they used during the Korean War.I am sure I can think of more if I took the time.There are, as others pointed out, three reasons for this. They are:There is a lot of equipment. It is very expensive to replace it. Armies focus on the biggest bang for the buck which usually means weapons systems, optics, radars, camouflage and things that will save lives (helmets, vests, medical equipment) before things that will make life more comfortable.Sometimes, primitive is better. It may be more reliable and stronger than the new tech.Third, sometimes, an Army designs the perfect piece of kit or adopts the perfect of piece of kit and nothing new can compete with it (assault boats, pen flares, army rations, hand crank field phones, and knives come to mind).","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Does-the-military-have-advanced-technology
3,"Good question. Who knows. When you think about how much technology has leaped in just the last 10 years (iphones were barely out 10 years ago….), the next 50 will unveil things we cant even imagine yet.Lasers will be real. I imagine space weapons will be the norm. Electronic warfare will rule all.The important thing is that 50 years from now, the weapons are science fiction.

My ideas:The Goldilocks Factor.As an example of 3, the printing press. In China, the printing press was used for authentication of official documents. In the Middle East, when it appeared late, the same thing. You’d think they’d have seen value in disseminating the Koran, but apparently they were more worried about people spreading heretical ideas.Note to the Koreans who keep haranguing me about Korea inventing movable metal type, it’s true. Now prove that it influenced anything outside of Korea. Otherwise, I’ll keep on ignoring you.In Europe, there must have been many people who lamented the printing press, but far too many other people saw advantages, and there was nobody to shut it down completely.As for 1., Britain is an island, close to the mainland, with a history of importing and adapting ideas. Japan is also an island, close to the mainland, with a history of importing and adapting ideas. Hmmm….Personal AutonomyWell, the printing press certainly counts. More people saw it as a way to make money than as a threat.ButAnd autonomous people think they can change the world. So instead of “With printing, we can be sure this royal decree is authentic,” we have “With printing, I can sell books and get rich.”Comparative lack of machismo",168 followers,Tony Heagren,2.5K,215,1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Does-the-military-have-advanced-technology

This happened for various reasons, including the rise of the merchant class, the gradual fall of the feudal society, the discovery of America and new trading route to Asia since the fall of Constantinople and etc.In several eastern countries, the economies were however self sustainable that they had a low demand for import and thus they preserved the traditional agricultural economic model, paused their social and political transformation, which led to no need for new technologies.",342 followers,Cansu Cey,940,308,1.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Does-the-military-have-advanced-technology

A social safety net to prevent large scale poverty and homelessness. There are no trailer parks or homeless camps in Europe. Social housing takes care of it.Cash is still a big thing in America, in Europe it’s more or less forgotten. Digital money took over years ago. We have 5G mobile networks, 100 gig fibre optic broadband everywhere, mammoth offshore wind and solar farms to produce electricity while Trump is trying to “rescue” the coal industry in America. “rescue it” to kill us all? Lunacy…Banking… Europe is light years ahead on this. My bank is on my phone. I can transfer money between my accounts - or to your account instantly with no fees. I can pay off my credit card, buy stocks and shares, then use my phone to pay at the checkout (without any “apps” from Apple or anyone else), log in (in the UK) to the revenue and see how much tax I’ve paid and get an accurate prediction of how much my state pension will amount to in seconds on my phone. I’m not special - ANYONE in Europe can do this.In Europe the question of abortion is long settled and the religious right have no voice in politics, culture or public life. Don’t imagine that Ireland or Italy are any different - they’re not. Europe has grown out of having religion as a guiding factor in politics or culture. All religions are tolerated of course (and celebrated) but none get a grip on, or any voice in politics. “The EU is the largest economy ever to exist and wields the most power globally (While the USA represents 4.4% of global population it houses 22% of the worlds prisoners and 80% of those are from one racial group.
