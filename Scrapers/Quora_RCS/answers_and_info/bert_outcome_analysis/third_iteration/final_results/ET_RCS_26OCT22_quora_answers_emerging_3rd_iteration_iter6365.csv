You can build optical amplifiers - and magnetic amplifiers - or you can use a vacuum tubes. But none of those are as compact or easy to manufacture as silicon transistor amplifiers.",201 followers,Max Williams,3.5K,1.4K,3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Could-technology-evolve-without-transistors
1,"As generalisation - Yes. But not as fast as it does and not as widespread as it is nowadays.Everything we have in our daily life is made by transistor or with transistors. I’m not talking about the obvious products such as PC, mobile devices, communications, navigation, industrial control and other advanced technologies.Even the simplest things - like a plastic chair - is de...",884 followers,John Redford,770,1.2K,1.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Could-technology-evolve-without-transistors
2,"Sure. Technology has evolved in different ways since the beginning of mankind, and the transistor was only invented/demonstrated in 1947. We might not have the electronic stuff we have now, but technology would have progressed in different directions. The telegraph did not need transistors. Likewise for the light bulb, the Victrola, the airplane, and on and on.",366 followers,Brett Alder,1.1K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Could-technology-evolve-without-transistors

It makes us into the Terminator, a relentless killing machine who will stride (or run) implacably towards its target, not stopping until that target is dead. If the animals could talk they would say “Oh god, it just never stops!”. This is calledThe key to this ability is something which is often unwanted, and not really appreciated for the amazing evolutionary advantage that is is:Look at this guy’s skin - it’s soaking wet.That water will turn from liquid into gas, and as it does so it will suck aIf you have fur, sweating just doesn’t really work - nowhere near as well, anyway. The evaporating water might cool your fur down, but it won’t cool your skin down, and thus won’t cool down the muscles underneath that skin, which are the things that really need to lose the heat.So, we lost our body hair in order to become more effective hunters: to become the animal-world equivalent of this guy.","220,617 followers",Franklin Veaux,3K,47.3K,782.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Could-technology-evolve-without-transistors

Technology is advancing very rapidly.My grandfather would have grown up in a world very similar to that of his grandfather, but in just my lifetime, there has been enormous change. When I was a student in the 1970’s, I lived in a house with no central heating, one telephone wired into the wall, and a black and white television with two channels. My Dad had a car, but it was technically not much different to the car he would have had twenty years earlier. My first flight was in an airliner with propellers.Had I been born in 1930, apart from the TV, my world would have been veryYou’re mistaken.

If it was safe enough lots of countries including the US would be doing it.But another note it looks like technology will end up causing a global food crisis in the future…high tech countries like Japan import 60% of their food because they have no arable land left.

Presented below is the U.S. market penetration achieved by nine technologies since 1876, the year Alexander Graham Bell patented the telephone.Penetration rates have been organized to show three phases of a technology’s spread: traction, maturity, and saturation. Those technologies with last mile problems bringing electricity cables or telephone wire to individual homes appear to spread more slowly.It took almost a century for landline phones to reach saturation, or the point at which new demand falls off. Mobile phones, by contrast, achieved saturation in just 20 years. Smart phones are on track to halve that rate yet again, and tablets could move still faster.And setting consecutive records for speed to market saturation in the United States. It is difficult to conclude categorically from the available data that smart phones are spreading faster than any previous technology.Statistics are not always available globally, and not every","41,222 followers",Dave Haynie,929,6.9K,95.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Could-technology-evolve-without-transistors
