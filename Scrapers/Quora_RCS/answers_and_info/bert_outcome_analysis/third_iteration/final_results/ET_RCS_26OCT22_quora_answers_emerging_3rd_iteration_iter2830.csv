There are no AIs currently that can reason about why your girlfriend suddenly got sullen and quiet with you, or why Billy down the street beat up a cat.Then there’s Ray Kurzweil. I’d like to get him on stage and beat him over the head with a mop for the terrible hype he generates regarding the ‘Singularity’. His time frame is wrong, his view is only an opinion, not fact nor provable fact. He angers me for conning the public into thinking humans are going to be threatened by AI overlords any time soon. Not going to happen. Making AIs as smart as people is exceedingly hard and it’s not soon in the cards. I say this as an AI researcher who works on these problems and I see how truly difficult they are. We can, and will solve some of the problems but we are a long way from AIs that can match human minds. An AI that plays Go better than humans is buildable because the game is a closed small universe. What humans have to work with is an enormous complicated world, and much harder to deal with.So, yes, AI is way hyped, and the promoters may be leading us to the next AI winter if they keep up the crap and eventually burn out expectations.",UNKNOWN,Ben Y.

The elderly and the sick depend on the caretakers for even the basic things. It is difficult to expect robots doing all of those things. It’s difficult to expect people to leave the sick, the elderly and children in the care of some robot nanny.Healthcare WorkersSimilar to caretakers, healthcare workers will not be replaced by AI. Doctors and nurses will greatly benefit from AI but the ability of healthcare workers to connect with patients is perhaps irreplaceable.TeachersTeachers are often overworked and underpaid. People skills, empathy, and understanding are crucial for creating well rounded and emotionally confident people, and teachers do just that. Even though they will benefit a great deal from AI applications but how a teacher stands in the class and communicates knowledge and builds better humans will always belong to humans (at least that’s what I’m betting on).TherapistsThe job of therapists is perhaps the best example of the human connection. We visit therapists because we want to heal, for peace of mind, get emotional support and guidance. This job will likely remain within humans and not go to algorithms and apps.","284,850 followers",James Altucher,991,878,91.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Will-artificial-intelligence-blockchain-the-Internet-of-Things-and-other-advanced-technologies-significantly-change-the-way-your-industry-operates-and-how-it-conducts-day-to-day-business

I think AI will kill jobs, and over time, AI might kill most “jobs” as we know them.

I think AI will kill jobs, and over time, AI might kill most “jobs” as we know them. I think that people are somewhat complacent in regard to the economic impact of AI, and will likely be ill-prepared for the changes we have to adapt to in the not-so-distant future.First, let's start with the comparisons to machinery and automation. They did indeed put factory workers out of work. In that respect, I agree AI today is similar in many applications, replacing workers who have less specialized skills, perhaps call center operators, office assistants (in a limited extent), and maybe soon, taxi drivers and truck drivers. But I would argue that AI is fundamentally different from machinery or most of the other analogies commonly made when answering this question, because AI is growing and is unlikely to stop growing. It's growing in breadth (of applications and industries), in geographic and economic scope, and in power (it's capacity to address increasingly complex tasks). A more fitting analogy would be machinery in an automobile plant that not only made the parts one day, but then learned how to assemble them the week after, and then how to design cars a year later.I think that there is little that is out of reach for advanced AI of the future. Let's leave the question of the AI singularity alone for now. Instead, I think that deep learning efforts at Google and elsewhere are making AI systems learn faster and faster, with a growing rate of acceleration. Advanced AI can now address increasingly complex tasks including medical diagnosis, stock market trading, weather prediction and human behavioral modeling. Very soon, it will be able to take the place of certain types of teachers, and find a role in education. It can already deal with complex systems in software and mathematics, and seems to be only limited in applications that require interactions with the physical world (sensors are still imperfect), and with people.So without projecting too far into the future, we can ask the question, what jobs will NOT be killed by AI? Jobs that involve labor are already (or soon to be) replaced. Jobs that require logical reasoning are being replaced, albeit at a slower rate. What are the qualities that humans have that cannot be captured by AI? Perhaps creativity, emotional responses? So perhaps researchers in academia will survive longer than most, and artists (though AI stylistic mimicry is already quite impressive and their results enjoyable), and counselors/psychologists/case workers, and decision makers like CEOs who cannot be predictable or error prone. And hopefully software engineers and algorithm designers who develop AI systems.This leaves a very, very small portion of today's jobs intact. Many say: we just need to train people to fill higher level jobs created by AI, e.g. Programmers, ML researchers. But this is no easy feat. The US educational system is struggling to meet the demands created by advanced technology today. This failure is in part responsible for the economic divide plaguing the country today. The challenge of educating the public for a job market that is both decreasing in scope and increasing in complexity, is nothing we've ever faced before.I am far from original in this opinion. But if I had to guess, I would say that AI will put far more people out of work than we can (re)train in time. That will have significant economic repercussions as corporations seeking to minimize cost will do so at the cost of rising unemployment. There will need to be dramatic changes in social policies in order to avert large scale economic disaster, first dramatic rises in minimum wage, then eventually some type of universal income/welfare. It's the kind of change that requires significant leadership in our government, something that seems woefully absent today.","20,170 followers",Sriraman Madhavan,4.1K,186,7.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Will-artificial-intelligence-blockchain-the-Internet-of-Things-and-other-advanced-technologies-significantly-change-the-way-your-industry-operates-and-how-it-conducts-day-to-day-business
3,"First…Stop it.Artificial intelligence is not ""intelligence"". And it's not ""artificial consciousness"".Everyone is afraid that AI will suddenly wake up, get upset, and take over the world.Or that AI will wake up and take all of our jobs. This will happen. But without the ""wake up"" part.Below I describe what real AI is.If we want to understand the “existential threat” we first need to know what AI is.Then, if you are at a cocktail party and someone says, ""but what if robots are intelligent?"" you can argue with facts, mixed with a little bit of alcohol.---------A) STATISTICSStatistics is at the heFirst…Stop it.Artificial intelligence is not ""intelligence"". And it's not ""artificial consciousness"".Everyone is afraid that AI will suddenly wake up, get upset, and take over the world.Or that AI will wake up and take all of our jobs. This will happen. But without the ""wake up"" part.Below I describe what real AI is.If we want to understand the “existential threat” we first need to know what AI is.Then, if you are at a cocktail party and someone says, ""but what if robots are intelligent?"" you can argue with facts, mixed with a little bit of alcohol.---------A) STATISTICSStatistics is at the heart of most AI programs.Just like statistics is at the heart of a lot of human decision making.For instance, if you see clouds in the sky, your brain thinks: ""Hmmm, the last 100 times I saw clouds this dark, it usually meant it was about to rain"".When you think like that, you are using statistics to make the decision: ""I should _probably_ go inside now.""I'll give an AI example: Siri or Alexa. How does Alexa understand the words you just said?In 1989 I was visiting Carnegie Mellon to decide if I would go to graduate school there.One of the graduate students, Kai-Fu-Lee (now one of the most famous investors in the world and I would check out his excellent recent TED talk on AI) showed me what he was working on:It was speech recognition for the 60 or so commands that might happen on a Navy battleship (ten guesses as to who was funding his project).When you say the word ""Fire!"" a sound wave is created. When you say the word ""hello"" a sound wave that looks different is created.If 100 people say ""Fire"" and 100 people say ""hello"", all of those sounds waves are stored in a database.Now, if a brand new person says ""Hello"" the computer program needs to determine if that person said ""Hello"" or ""fire"".There might be 10 different attributes of every sound wave. It breaks the new person's sound wave into those 10 attributes.Then it compares that ""vector"" of 10 attributes with all of the vectors in its database for ""Hello"" and ""Fire!""It uses a statistical technique called ""Hidden Markov Analysis"" to determine if the sound wave is more like the ""hello""s in the database or more like the ""Fire!"" in the database.Then it says to itself, ""This guy said ""Hello"". ""It then has a line of code that says, ""If someone says ""Hello"" Then say ""Hello"" back"".Additionally, it adds your ""Hello"" to its database.Your ""Hello"" might be slightly different than the other 100 ""Hello""s so it just learned a new way to say ""Hello"". That gives it greater ability in the future to recognize the word ""hello"".In other words, it ""learned"".So it used Statistics to hear you, code to respond to you, and database technology to learn. There's no real intelligence there but it feels like it's intelligence.Multiply that by 30 years and millions of patterns and computers a million times faster and you have Alexa and Siri in today's kitchens.Ask ""Siri"" what gender it is.-----B) EVALUATION FUNCTIONI just mentioned about language recognition. But how does a self-driving car work?Every second it has to make a decision. Does it move forward? Does it brake? Does it swerve to avoid an accident? Does it turn left?How does it get from point A to point B?1) Google Maps. - Using GPS it knows where it is. And it puts itself on Google Maps.2) List all of the possible routes. This is a ""hard"" problem in the mathematical sense (there's no way for it to guess the fastest route. It has to list each route and then sort by the shortest. )But now computers are so fast what would normally be a slow decision (drive me from this corner in Piscataway, New Jersey to the capital building of Sacramento, California) now just takes seconds.3) Waze. Use Waze to eliminate the routes with too much traffic.4) Start driving.5) Statistics: Every microsecond it uses statistics to see if there is blank space or an object that must be avoided or a traffic sign that must be followed.6) Decide what to do according to the code. For each traffic sign, it has code that tells it what to do (if a sign says ""Stop"" it Stops for a second, uses Statistics to see if any traffic is happening on its sides (with radar and cameras to provide the images). )If there is a person standing in front of it, it might just stop.If there's traffic it didn't expect, it might trigger the program to re-route.If it's blank space it will just keep going.If there's a baby crossing the street and it has to swerve to avoid hitting it, but if swerving will cause the car to hit a truck, killing the passenger in the car, then the ""AI"" of the car is dependent on the ethical decisions of the programmer of the car.In other words, in every situation, it determines it's options, then uses an ""evaluation function"" programmed by a coder, to determine which option has the most successful outcome (move the trip forward, don't kill anyone).Eventually the evaluation function will NOT be programmed by a human coder.Instead, through thousands of experiences of other self-driving cars, the experiences plus the outcomes will all be put into a central database.When a new experience is encountered, the code will look up that experience in the database and the database will spit back the best possible outcome.The code will learn statistically what the best outcomes are of each possibly decision and change the code accordingly and send updates to all self-driving cars.-----C) TREESThe hardest game in the world is a board game called GO. With chess, if a computer can evaluate a billion possibilities a second, it can be a world champion level player.But a Go game can involve trillions of possibilities. How did Google make a program, Deep Go, to beat the world's best Go player. This was thought to be impossible.And yet Google did it.For any game, a computer program first builds a tree of possibilities. Much like a human would.A human thinks: ""If I make this move in checkers, my opponent might respond with A, B, or C and then I can do D, E, or F and then my opponent can do G, H, I if I do D or it can do J, K, L if I do E and I'm never going to do F.A computer doesn't select as well as a human so it builds the FULL tree. Meaning, what are ALL of the possible moves it can do, what are ALL of the possible responses of my opponent, etc.And then it uses a programmed evaluation function to look at the leaves of the tree it built.Whichever move results in the best leaf of the tree (as determined by the evaluation function) that is the move it makes.That's how computer chess worked for decades. I'll get to the secret sauce in a second for how computers conquered chess.And then after that I'll describe how computers miraculously conquered Go.It's only a miracle until science can explain it. It's only ""intelligence"" until it can be coded by a programmer.D) HARDWAREEverybody thought for decades (including many Nobel Prize winners) that the best computer chess programs would be developed when scientists encoded the knowledge of the best chess players in the world into the evaluation function.How does the world champion value a position instead of a weak player?This turned out to be wrong.The MORE code in the evaluation function (i.e. the ""smarter"" the evaluation function was from a human perspective) the SLOWER the program.Which meant a smaller tree would be built, which meant less possibilities would be analyzed.What really allowed the programmers at IBM to build ""Deep Blue"" which beat Garry Kasparov in 1997 were two things.Both related to hardware.a. Computers got faster.And finally, they made the evaluation function STUPID in order to use less code so the hardware could value more positions.Then, before anyone caught on to their ""artificial intelligence"" they retired Deep Blue right after it beat the World Champion of chess.As hardware gets faster, artificial intelligence gets ""smarter"".[as an aside, I once gave a date a chip that was the initial chip for “Chip Test” - the “ancestor” of what became the best chess computer, Deep Blue. She was weirded out.]----INTERLUDEWhat I just described is all the basics. You can stop now.The rest of artificial intelligence is simply combining the basics to make more advanced techniques.-----E) STATISTICS + TREERemember the TREE from computer gaming. And STATISTICS from speech recognition.Now let's go to the impossible game of Go. Google developed the program ""AlphaGo"" to win at Go when everyone else thought it would take another 20 to 50 years.First, remember Kai-Fu Lee who worked on speech recognition. And later developed Apple's first attempts at speech recognition in the 90s?At one point in his grad student days, he was getting tired of navy battleship commands (as one does) and decided to focus on building a program to play Othello.He ended up building the world champion of Othello.He took a lot of games, let's say a million, and put them in a database. And each position from each game, he would label, ""winning"" (if it was a position on the winning side) or ""losing"" in a massive database.He would identify several attributes of each position (how many white pieces, versus black pieces, how many corners were controlled, how many pieces were on the sides, etc).Now, if the computer was playing a brand new game, it would determine all the attributes of that position, then use Hidden Markov Analysis (remember: speech recognition) to match that position to the database.If the position pattern-matched a ""winning position"" then it would make the move that would lead to that winning position. If it matched a ""losing position"" it would not make that move.That program became the world champion of Othello.AlphaGo took it one step further.It put in the positions of millions of Go positions and did the same sort of breakdown.It used faster hardware to speed up the process.Then, once it became pretty good at GO, it played BILLIONS of games against ITSELF to put many BILLIONS of new positions into the database. In other words, it ""learned"".Now it was ready to play Go. It crushed the world champion------That's basically it. That's all of artificial intelligence.Let's say a bank wanted to fire all of the employees in charge of lending. And replace them by artificial intelligence.How would the bank lend money?Well, there's 100s of millions of loans already out there. And for each person who has ever borrowed money I know:- their ageI can put all these vectors in a database and divide them into people ""most likely to pay back the loan"" and people ""most likely to default"".Then, just like speech recognition or the Othello program above, I can use statistics to determine who I should loan money to.And if I say ""no"", I don't have to explain. On to the next one!---Let's say I want to fight terrorists.I already have examples of many terrorists who trained in the US and then went on to perform or attempt acts of terror.I know everything about their bank accounts. How often they transferred money. How often they traveled. How often they took out cash versus using a debit card.And so on.I can build a vector of attributes of what a terrorist bank account looks like. Then I can match new people against that database of vectors of terrorists.Believe me, every time you do a bank transfer, some AI program is out there trying to determine if you are a terrorist.----This is all that AI is.It is nothing more. It's not ""intelligent"" from a human sense. It's not conscious, nor will it ever be.Here's how AI has improved in the past forty years (and how it will improve the next 40):- statistics has gotten betterWhat is changing the fastest is data. The land grab of modern society is not land, or gold, or oil.It's data.I have been invested in many companies that collect and sell data. I was an early investor (and on the board of)Believe me when I say, data-driven companies know how many strawberries you ate last summer.And right now that data is used mostly to target you for ads about sneakers. Or politics.But this is AI 1.0. Soon that data will be used to target your every movement, your every want, your every need.Amazon Prime won't be about delivering you what you want tomorrow. Amazon Prime Plus will be about delivering you what you want yesterday.Police 2.0 will be like the movie ""Minority Report"".Even art and music will be driven by AI that studies the neurochemical responses to music you like to music you don't like. And then compose accordingly.Where will humans still be unique?I don't know. Ask the humans with AI implants that enhance their brains so when they look at you they know exactly what answers will make you happy.BUT… will AI replace jobs?The answer (at least in the next decade or so…) is NO.Look at recent examples:A) Many people were worried ATM machines would replace bank tellers.Instead, the banks made so much in profits they opened up more branches than ever, creating new jobs.B) Will autonomous delivery services cost jobs.Right now there are millions of truck drivers involved in delivering goods. With autonomous delivery, less people will go shopping, more people will be required to shop in the aisles, finding products for people.Obviously this is not a high-end job. But this replaces the fact that less cashiers and drivers will be needed.Meanwhile, there will be more high-end jobs. More maintenance engineers for the cars, customer service, marketing, etc.C) Ecommerce. Branding will become less important (branding is VERY important when everyone is shopping at the big box store but advertising will have to become more clever and digital) so the millions in profits that are generated from AI will filter down to more people starting e-commerce ventures and the ancillary businesses associated with that.)Final conclusion:This is probably a net NEGATIVE for society as the higher classes will be able to afford “super AI” capabilities, making them demi-gods to lower-classes.Instead, massive profits will be generated, which will be soaked into the economy through a rising stock market, increase in opportunities, etc.",36 followers,Adam Ambrozy,579,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Will-artificial-intelligence-blockchain-the-Internet-of-Things-and-other-advanced-technologies-significantly-change-the-way-your-industry-operates-and-how-it-conducts-day-to-day-business

Also remember we had space ships like Mercury and Gemini with computers on them that our modern Microwave have more computer power than those. They brought all the technology of the time with them. But this ship didn’t have supplies and equipment to allow them to advance beyond that. Without taking up valuable ship space. They get here about 150 years after leaving their home world with a technology compared to us over 70 years behind us.

It is a very professional place to work. And DAE pays almost 30% extra as opposed to any other central government job of the same scale. Most people only look at the pay-scale and not the allowances admissible to specific departments. Please read about PRIS scheme of DAE, ISRO, DRDO etc.Let me attach some pictures for you:It also has an in-campus institute, HBNI for MTech/MSc and PhD. I believe the eligibility is via GATE. Majorly, RRCAT is involved in non-nuclear research, e.g. lasers, particle accelerators etc. In case you get the chance, please visit it once.Thank You.P.S. There are other campuses of similar size in the country, but they are either in smaller places or outside the city.",374 followers,Mohammed Aamer,653,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Will-artificial-intelligence-blockchain-the-Internet-of-Things-and-other-advanced-technologies-significantly-change-the-way-your-industry-operates-and-how-it-conducts-day-to-day-business
10,"RRCAT is a unit of DAE ,working in the field of particle accelerator and many more. The RRCAT campus is a beautiful place with a lot of greenery and a lake too . For anyone living in cities and is longing for peace can visit RRCAT Indore",201 followers,Kapil Bharadwaj,11.8K,319,1.5M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Will-artificial-intelligence-blockchain-the-Internet-of-Things-and-other-advanced-technologies-significantly-change-the-way-your-industry-operates-and-how-it-conducts-day-to-day-business
11,"Here’s my experience of getting selected as a scientist engineer at ISRO through the centralized recruitment for the year 2016First, a bit of a background. I did my mechanical engineering from a decent state level university college and I got placed into IBM in the final year. Having no other options, I joined IBM after college. But I wanted to work in a field of my engineering background, and so I also took up GATE coaching at ACE Academy. I got a rank of ~4000 in GATE 2016.

I did my mechanical engineering from a decent state level university college and I got placed into IBM in the final year. Having no other options, I joined IBM after college. But I wanted to work in a field of my engineering background, and so I also took up GATE coaching at ACE Academy. I got a rank of ~4000 in GATE 2016. Since I didn’t get into any PSU or IIT with this rank, I had to continue looking for other options, which is when I applied to ISRO.Now, coming to the experience, let me give you an overview of the selection process. There’s 2 stages for ISRO recruitment. First is a written exam, 80 questions, 90 minutes. 3 marks for correct answer and a negative mark for each wrong answer. You can look up the syllabus on their website. The board uses the exam as a way to shortlist candidates for the interview. Your selection depends only on your performance in the interview. The candidates are called for the interview in the ratio of around 8–9 candidates per post.For preparing for the exam I only revised the notes I had prepared for GATE, and then went through all previous year question papers. I bought this book which had previous question papers for ISRO and DRDO. (I managed to get 140/240. The cutoff was around 130 I think. I was requested to come to NRSA Hyderabad for the interview. I contacted one of my tutor from ACE academy and requested for help in preparing for the interview. He arranged a mock interview with the senior faculty at ACE. The director of the institute also spoke to me and gave me tips to prepare for the interview. A big thanks to all of them :).The reporting time for the interview was 8 AM. But I was the second last person to be interviewed and my interview happened at 9 PM. Despite the long and boring wait, I went into the interview hall with a lot of energy and a big smile on my face. There were 6 panel members and a chairman. The chairman asked me to explain what I work at IBM (I work on an ERP tool). Then he asked me to explain my final year project. We had designed a maintenance strategy for dumpers at Singareni Collieries for the project. I explained my project and work experience as being related to Industrial Management, a subject which I love. The chairman smiled and said, ‘so your project and work experience is similar’. Then he asked the panel members to start asking questions. They asked me to go up to the white board.Panelist 1: Draw a shaft. Fix one end of it. Apply torque at the other end. How will it vary along the length?I knew it varied linearly along the radius, but didn’t know how it varies along the length. I tried writing the Torsion equation but could not remember it. I first wrote down the Bending equation. I remember it as (Esther/Rani) = (May/I) = (See/You) i.e. E/R = M/I =Panelist 1: How does it vary along the radius.Told.Panelist 1: What if I remove some material from the center?Told how the variation will be the same, with no shear stress in the area where material is removed.Panelist 1: Which one is better for aircraft application?Told that since we are saving material in case of hollow shafts, I would prefer that ones.Then he asked me to explain Mohr’s circle. And give a condition where stress is negative on all sides. Another panelist asked me to explain how stress varies when bending moment is applied on the previous shaft. Asked me to also write down the formula for the bending stress in case of solid and hollow shafts. Then the previous panelist asked me to explain the concept of Factor of Safety.Then another panelist asked me if he could ask me questions from Engineering Drawing. I said it has been a long time since I last studied it, but yeah sure. They all started laughing. Then he asked me to explain First angle projections and Third angle projections. I could explain First angle projections, but he was not satisfied with my explanation for Third angle projections.Then another panelist who was going through my mark sheets said, ‘You have studied Finite Element Methods (FEM) in a semester, shall I ask questions from it?’. I said sure. Now this was an elective subject and I didn’t remember anything about it. He asked me to explain what finite element analysis is. I told something something about using matrices and computers. I don’t even remember what I told. He told me what I told was wrong. I said then I don’t know the answer.Then the chairperson asked me to name any other 3 Element analysis methods. I told I didn’t know any. Then he asked if I knew Finite difference method. I said I had never heard of it with a sheepish smile. They all started laughing and then he told me that this is the first thing you learn when you study FEM.Another panelist who was outside till now asked what sort of maintenance we had done in my final year project, to which the chairperson told that I had already explained that. He then asked me to leave. I thanked them and while I was leaving the chairperson said ‘You are very pleasant. Please maintain that’.I was not very confident about my selection since I had not answered many questions, but luckily I managed to get in the list of selected candidates. The entire process from applying to getting selected took around 10 months. I will be joining ISRO on 11th May in Bangalore.Please let me know if you have and queries or guidance. Will be glad to help.",244 followers,Harsh Trivedi,760,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/Will-artificial-intelligence-blockchain-the-Internet-of-Things-and-other-advanced-technologies-significantly-change-the-way-your-industry-operates-and-how-it-conducts-day-to-day-business
