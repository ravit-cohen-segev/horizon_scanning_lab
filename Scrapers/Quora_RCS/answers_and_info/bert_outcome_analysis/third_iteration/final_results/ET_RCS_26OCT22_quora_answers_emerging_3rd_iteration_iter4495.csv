As a health risk, social isolation is worse for you tham smoking! As a society, we look after physical health and safety but neglect elderly mental health.An OHSU medical study showed that ONLY face-to-face contact, specifically with family and friends, and minimum 3 times per week, reduces social isolation and halves depression risk. A second, later OHSU study showed that Skype video calling produces the same benefit! Text and voice-only conversion did NOT produce a measurable impact.In summary, humans NEED face-to-face conversation, and the new breed of seniors video phones provide exactly that, in a way that even someone with strong dementia can use to make and answer video calls.And talking about dementia…Another OHSU study showed that increased social engagement via video calling actually increased cognitive function after just 6 weeks of daily calling. The results were so clear and successful that the U.S National Healtg has funded two follow-on studies, looking at Alzheimers / dementia, to quantify the longer term benefit of video calling on brain health. So, there's no question that Skype calling helps… the question being answered by the new studies is, how much can it delay the onset and slow down the progression of dementia?Anecdotally, we have many customers usimg multiple technologies, both within the home and within Care facilities, reporting great success in terms of improved health, safety and quality of life.","13,936 followers",Sally Alter,1.3K,4.1K,32.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-hasn-t-senior-care-been-changed-much-by-technology-I-would-expect-to-see-more-progress-with-having-technology-products-and-services-helping-seniors-to-live-a-more-active-fulfilled-and-engaged-life

My husband died in 2001 and since then I have nothing to show for my life. It upsets me, but there you are.I suppose as you get older you don’t feel the urge to get out there and change the world like you do when you are young. I am quite content to occupy myself with mundane things now, but certainly wouldn’t have been when I was under 50.I look back and see my life in sections, or chapters in a book. Each chapter mostly being divided up into the life I lead with each of my husbands. It is very strange to see how different these life styles turned out to be.I was only 19 when I married husband number 1 and a silly, foolish girl really. I should never have married him, but I was lonely for a family seeing as all my family were dead and gone long before. Of course, it didn’t work out that way as his family did not accept me so I was just as much alone in that marriage as I had been before.It was really a non-eventful marriage of just working, playing and passing the time. I had a number of very ordinary jobs and nothing was very exciting. I left him because he was a lazy bum who gave up work when we got married and lived off my earnings. I finally came to my senses. There wasn’t exactly an ah-ha moment, as far as I can remember, I just decided I had had enough of him spending all his time with his mother who lived next door. I guess I was just plain lonely in that marriage.My next marriage was an adventure. Although it didn’t work out, we had 11 full years which I never regretted. I met him in London when I was 21 and we lived together for 2 years before getting married. Seeing as he was Maltese we went to live in Malta for 4 years. That was probably the best part of my life even though he was a big time gambler and I never knew what was going to happen next.Malta was a dream come true. Something I shall never forget. Many movies are made in Malta because it is so picturesque and brimming over with history. Once the movie ‘Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger’ was being made in Malta and seeing as we were friends with a prominent man on the island, we were invited to all the parties. We even had a party for the crew on our flat roof. I decked it out with candles all around and we hired a band. It was great fun.Jane Seymour was the star of that movie, and we got to know her well. She even gave up her hotel room and came to live with us for the duration of the filming. I remember her brushing her long hair in the bathroom. She was the nicest person you could ever meet, and we went for dinner a couple of times at her house when we went back to London.From there we went to Scotland and I became a nurse. That was a good time in my life, too, but his gambling became too much. He gambled away our house so we had to move back to London and start again. That’s when the marriage fell apart but we remained friends for years after that.At 32 I met my third husband in London. He fixed my washing machine. Seeing as he was from America we ended up living here and that’s where I am now. Prior to that we had many great adventures. I sold my house in London and bought a 200 year old bed and breakfast in Cornwall by the sea. It was my dream house, but we sold it to come here.When we arrived in Miami in 1990 we bought a big motor home and toured the States for 5 years, then went to Europe for 6 months and did the same. We had many adventures in 9 countries in Europe and made a lot of good friends. When that came to an end, we sold the RV and decided to come back to the States as we couldn’t put our dog Ziggy in quarantine for 6 months in England. It was just too long.So my husband, me and Ziggy came back to Tucson where we were going to buy a house. Unfortunately, since we had been there the house prices had gone up too much so we ended up in the Hill Country in Texas which is where I live now.Tragedy struck in 2001 when my husband committed suicide and life was very difficult for a long time. However, you learn to accept your fate and that is what I did. I have made friends and tried to fit in with the community which has been very difficult as I am a Londoner in Texas. I will leave you to imagine how that has been a big hurdle to jump.Of course, many other things happened in my life - indeed I could write a series of books - but here I am now, quite happy, writing on Quora.That is how I look back on my life, and I don’t regret a thing.EDIT: My life has changed drastically lately and I have just published my first book How to Live with Bipolar. It is just out on Amazon in paperback and Kindle. I am now working on my next book.EDIT: 8/11/22Since the last edit, I have written three more books. The first two are about bipolar disorder, the next one is called LONELINESS: A Practical Guide to Happiness and the last one is a book of my poetry. I am working on another poetry book now.",0 followers,Sandy Hall,1.4K,239,82.2K,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-hasn-t-senior-care-been-changed-much-by-technology-I-would-expect-to-see-more-progress-with-having-technology-products-and-services-helping-seniors-to-live-a-more-active-fulfilled-and-engaged-life

But, it also had two rollers attached, so that the soapy clothing could be “squeezed dry”, before taking the clean clothes to the laundry sink, to be rinsed, then hung up on a clothes line, to dry.We had a party line. If we heard two short rings, and one long, we knew we had an incoming phone call. Every home had their own “signal.”We were introduced to flush toilets, when we started Kindergarten, and toilet paper instead of Sear’s Catalogues.We had electric fans, but no air conditioners.We had wall heaters, but no “central heating and air.” We thought a thermostat was a car part.We had a perfectly square box that sat on a table. It was a black and white television. One dial changed channels. One dial controlled the volume. There was an on/off button we had to push, to watch the three or four hours of daily programming, on the three or four channels that broadcast. The rest of the time, it was just a test pattern, with a high pitched, continuous beep.Freeways weren’t built, until President Eisenhower got the approval from Congress. The freeway through my home town was built when I was in 8th grade.Vacuum cleaners had just been invented, when I was born.Mom and Dad’s first purchase, after they married was a sewing machine. Like everyone else, Mom made all our clothing. Fifty pound flour sacks were decorated with locomotives for the boys, and flowers for the girls. Each flour sack came equipped with a “pattern”, illustrating to the mother how to sew a pair of shorts, a shirt or blouse, or a dress.Sliced bread wasn’t invented until after I was born.We had airline travel. We flew in airplanes with propellers. Passenger “jets” didn’t come along until I was in junior high school.We listened to “spacemen” on the radio programs, like “Buck Rogers.” Rocket travel was all the stuff of fantasy.The Polio Vaccine wasn’t created by Dr. Jonas Salk, until I was in elementary school. Every kid got the Mumps, the Measles, Chicken Pox, and Whooping Cough. Not all of us recovered. We were still burying lots of kids.There were no computers, when I was a kid, for anybody, much less a personal computer. There were no cell phones, no tablets,no blackberries, no video cameras, etc.We played pinball games, when I was a kid. The first “personal game computer” the Atari 2600 didn’t arrive on scene until after I had graduated from university.Dad had a crosscut saw for cutting firewood, but there was no such thing as a chain saw. Dad had a hand saw, but there was no such thing as a circular saw, or a reciprocating saw.When I was old enough, I mowed the lawn. There were no gasoline or electric lawn mowers. Our “push mower” was operated by “one little boy power.”With the advent of the computer, the information age has simply exploded in volume. Think of an upside down pyramid. Every year, we learn phenomenal amounts of new information.When I had a knee replacement this year, it was with robot-assisted surgery. The same thing held true when I had prostate surgery.We had no robots when I was a kid. We had no artificial joints when I was a kid.Technological advancement has been like a nuclear explosion. There has been nothing gradual about it.I am buying books, before they become obsolete.I hope you have a pleasant Evening, my friend.",15 followers,Matt Taylor,5.4K,771,19.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-hasn-t-senior-care-been-changed-much-by-technology-I-would-expect-to-see-more-progress-with-having-technology-products-and-services-helping-seniors-to-live-a-more-active-fulfilled-and-engaged-life

They are too mobile and fast that optical detection is an option. Fighter jets are also incredible loud - which again makes it counter intuitive to “hide them”. As most people in war times won’t be able to differentiate a F-35 from a Su-30 (high altitude - extremely short flyover time), optical tracking isn’t really anything effective.Also: optical camouflage is extremely difficult to apply (I don’t even want to become technical, as mostly camouflage can mirror the background - but obviously for a jet which is in a quickly alternating 3 dimensional space it is far more difficult than a tank, which needs to be hidden rather in lesser dimensions) - and the odds, that active camouflage is “compatible” with important stealth technologies are very unlikely. Hence you would trade a proven and very effective system for one which is rather a gimmick.","16,063 followers",Pavel Fekula,1.3K,11K,118.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-hasn-t-senior-care-been-changed-much-by-technology-I-would-expect-to-see-more-progress-with-having-technology-products-and-services-helping-seniors-to-live-a-more-active-fulfilled-and-engaged-life
