Before I forget, thank you for your TED talk aboutWithout question, our society depends on energy. We see this everywhere we look; it is true for the food we eat and the machinery that make it possible for us to live and work in close proximity to one another including sanitation, heat, refrigeration, medicine, light, transportation and a hundred other things.Today, this energy is predominantly provided by fossil fuels. This presents a problem, as some day we will run out. Also, it’s not doing the environment any favors as we keep the fires lit across the world.The solutions to this problem generally fall into four camps:Fair enough, there are valid discussion points in each group. In fact, there are lessons to be learned from each point of view. Although, if I’m honest, the language of the second group is frightening. Anyway, You asked about nuclear.To have that conversation, we need to get past our love affair with solar and wind. We need to recognize why we love this technology and we need to understand the limitations in terms of dynamic energy economics. This self reflection is the only way we can move the conversation toward nuclear energy. Without this discussion, we will forever be stuck in a shallow conversation about the low cost of solar and wind making nuclear unnecessary.For over a year I’ve been attempting to work through this topic here on Quora. Of the hundreds of posts I’ve written, there are two that you may find useful. The first takes the form of a short story. The second is the same material structured as a technical and economic discussion:Sidebar: you spoke of strangerhoods. I wonder… A common theme proposed by advocates of renewable energy is independence. There is a desire to pull in and disconnect from society; independence from the energy company, independence from the community. This is the exact opposite of the community provided by our interconnected power grid; the recognition that we are inseparably linked…What will it take for large numbers of people to embrace nuclear power?TRDL: Give it time. The world is slowly learning the economic lessons as we continue our blind push to support solar and wind without examining the reasons and economics behind this decision. The inevitable cost increase and lock in of fossil fuel will be apparent at some point in the future. When that happens people will embrace nuclear power.Cordially,AaronP.S.

We could also create solar panels on the Moon. It’s useful for fabricating electronics because of the hard vacuum. There are some processes you can do on the Moon easily which would be hard to do on Earth because it is so difficult to get a sufficiently hard vacuum to do them.There are several books by Moon enthusiasts describing this in detail, how it would work.I did a summary of some of the main resources on the Moon for my Case for Moon first. The rest of this answer consists of extracts from the sectionVOLATILE RESOURCESWe have pretty good evidence now of ice at the poles, in permanently shadowed craters, thought to beIt's not a direct detection however, so there is still room for scepticism about it, as rough material would have the same radar signature as radar transparent ice. But craters that are rough when new, are rough both inside and outside the crater rim. While these signatures are found only inside the craters and not outside the rims, which they interpret as meaning that they are caused by ice. The temperatures are also right for ice.If it is ice, it could be ""fluffy ice"".""We do not know the physical characteristics of this ice—solid, dense ice, or “fairy castle”—snow-like ice would have similar radar properties. In possible support of the latter, the low radar albedo and lower than typical CPR values for nonanomalous terrain near the polar craters are 0.2–0.3, somewhat lower than normal for the nonpolar highlands terrain of the Moon and are suggesting the presence of a low density, “fluffy” surface.""In either case, it is not just a little ice; if this is what they detected, there's estimated to be at leastIt also contains other volatiles. We know for sure that there is some ice on the Moon, by the LCROSS impact experiment. Relative to H2O at 100% they foundSo, if the rest of the ice at the poles has a similar constitution to the impact site that's a lot of nitrogen (in the ammonia) and CO2on the Moon at the poles.On the other hand, caution is needed as this is not direct detection. TheLEND mapThey did detect hydrogen, but puzzlingly, it was not correlated with the permanently shadowed regionsAThe Moon may also have ice at lower latitudes too, as there are permanently shaded regions up to 58 degrees from the poles (only 32 degrees from the equator). Though these regions are too warm to have ice on the surface, there may be ice there underground. SeeAt any rate, the Moon does seem to have resources of ice at the poles (though memorably, Patrick Moore in one of the last Sky at Night programs that he did said that he'd believe there is ice at the poles when someone brought him a glass of water from the Moon). More research is needed to find out how much there is and where it is.METALSCritics often say that the Moon is undifferentiated and doesn't have any processes to concentrate ores. Although the Moon doesn't have any liquid water so all the processes involving concentration of resources through water erosion won't work, it still has many processes that can concentrate ores. Including:The Moon has many valuable ores for metals. For instance, the highland regions (probably the original crust of th Moon) consists mainly of Anorthite (a form of feldspar, formula CaAl2Si2O8) which is 20% Aluminium, compared with 25% Aluminium for Bauxite on Earth. So aluminium ores are abundant on the Moon, indeed orders of magnitude more abundant than they are in typical asteroids, but it does require a lot of energy to extract the aluminium from the ore. Either a nuclear power plant or large areas of solar panels.""Aluminium (Al) is another potentially useful metal, with a concentration in lunar highland regoliths (typically10-18 wt%) that is orders of magnitude higher than occurs in likely asteroidal sources (i.e. ~1 wt% in carbonaceous and ordinary chondtites, and <0.01 wt% in iron meteorites; . It follows that, as for Ti, the Moon may become the preferred source for Al in cis-lunar space. Extraction of Al will require breaking down anorthitic plagioclase (CaAl2Si2O8), which is ubiquitous in the lunar highlands, but this will be energy intensive (e.g. via magma electrolysis or carbothermal reduction; Alternative, possibly less energy intensive, processes include the fluoridation process proposed by Landis , acid digestion of regolith to produce pure oxides followed by reduction of Al2O3 (Duke et al.), or a variant of the molten salt electrochemical process described by Schwandt et aMining this for the aluminium would create calcium as a byproduct, which is useful as a conductor in vacuum conditions, a better conductor than copper weight for weight -""Calcium metal is not used as a conductor on Earth simply because calcium burns spontaneously when it comes in contact with oxygen (much like the pure magnesium metal in camera flashbulbs). But in vacuum environments in space, calcium becomes attractive.""Calcium is a better electrical conductor than both aluminum and copper. Calcium's conductivity also holds up better against heating. A couple of figures mining engineer David Kuck pulled out of the scientific literature: ""At [20C, 68F], calcium will conduct 16.7% more electricity than aluminum, and at [100C, 212F] it will conduct 21.6% more electricity through one centimeter length and one gram mass of the respective metal."" Compared to copper, calcium will conduct two and a half times as much electricity at 20C, 68F, and 297% as much at 100C, 212F.""Like copper, calcium metal is easy to work with. It is easily shaped and molded, machined, extruded into wire, pressed, and hammered.""As would be expected of a highland element, calcium is lightweight, roughly half the density of aluminum. However, calcium is not a good construction material because it is not strong. Calcium also sublimes (evaporates) slowly in vacuum, so it may be necessary to coat calcium parts to prevent the calcium from slowly coating other important surfaces like mirrors. In fact, calcium is sometimes used to deoxidize some metal surfaces. Calcium doesn't melt until 845C (1553F).""Utilization of lunar materials will see the introduction of industrial applications of calcium metal in space.""From the section onThe Moon is deficient in copper, at least on the basis of what is known so far, but as well as calcium, aluminium is a good conductor.The LCROSS experiment found silver (a superb conductor) and mercury at the impact site, but the concentration is not known, except that it is far higher than the levels in the Apollo samples, and is probably in a layer below the surface, as the signal was delayed. SeeIt has abundant iron - in addition to ores (which would need a lot of power to extract), it actually has free iron metalIt's in powder form already, and naturally alloyed with nickel and cobalt. The blebs, or ""nanophase iron"" are found inside impact glass particles, so would be hard to extract. The rest though is made up of tiny particles of pure iron, so the obvious thing to try to do is to separate them out using powerful magnets. They are rather small though, most are less than a micron in diameter which could be a challenge. If we can separate them out, we can get five kilograms of iron, 300 grams of nickel and about half a gram of platinum, gold etc. (platinum group metals) in every cubic meter of regolith - as pure metal what's more. (This summarizes part ofHe bases that on aHowever we don't need to speculate any more as Jayashree Sridhar et al of the NASA Johnson Space Center have done the experiment using actual samples of lunar regolith. See""Experimental results indicate promise for the extraction of meteoritic metals from lunar regolith. However, more work is needed to refine the technique and understand more about the variables that affected our results.""The iron is valuable for steel, and is also a conductor, though not nearly as good as Aluminium or Calcium. It would be useful for some applications such as electric railroads on Mars, and is a conductor easy to access in the early stages.Also nickel and iron are useful for making nickel / iron batteries. These could be useful for making batteries on the Moon with in situ resources, for instance to help last through the lunar night.""Iron-nickel batteries are very rugged. Their lifetimes which can exceed 20 years are not affected by heat, cold or deep cycling. They are not easily damaged by rapid discharging or over-charging. On the downside, they have poor performance at low temperatures but they can be kept warm with insulation (e.g. simple regolith) and thermal wadis. Also, they only have a charge to discharge efficiency of 65% and will self discharge at the rate of 20% to 40% per month. Despite these shortcomings, they might be the Moon-made power storage systems of choice due to their simplicity and the availability of their component materials on the Moon. Moreover, these materials are among the easiest of materials to produce on the Moon.""Then, you also have titanium. This is especially interesting as it is rare in asteroids. Apollo 17 samples are 20% high purity Ilmenite, a Titanium ore which is found in the lunar mare. And better than that, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, with its spectral mapping of the Moon, discovered deposits that are up to 10% titanium, more than ten times higher than titanium ores on Earth. (Titanium is also widely used in medicine for hip replacements, dental implants, etc., asTitanium isCrawford writes (page 17)""Therefore, in the context of a future space economy, the Moon may have a significant advantage over asteroids as a source of Ti. The fact that oxygen is also produced as a result of Ti production from ilmenite could make combined Ti/O2 production one of the more economically attractive future industries on the Moon.For more on this, seeSo, yes, there are plenty of metals on the Moon, but it might take a lot of power to extract them, apart from the iron, if that can be separated out using magnets.And that's mainly based on the Apollo results which explored a small region of the lunar surface which has been found to be in some ways unrepresentative. The Moon may have many other surprises in store. Many ores on Earth would not be detected from orbit, and it seems the Moon has a fairly complex geology as well.As an example of one way the Moon could surprise us - Earth is often hit by iron meteorites, so the Moon should be also. The main question is, how Dennis Wingo has hypothesized in his Moonrush book, that the Moon may also have valuableTaking this further, there's a hypothesis by Wieczorek et al that magnetic anomalies on the Moon around the south pole Aitken basin may be from the remains of the metal core of a large 110 km diameter differentiated asteroid that hit the Moon to form the basin. If so, they could be useful sources for platinum, gold, etc.From Wieczorek et al, the North and South poles are marked N and S. Notice the magnetic anomalies clustered around part of the rim of the South Pole Aitken Basin. This is thought to be the result of an impact by a 110 km diameter asteroid. Wieczorek et al hypothesize that the magnetic anomalies trace out the remains of the metal core of this asteroid. If so these could be rich ores, including iron, nickel, also platinum and other platinum group metals (gold, rhodium etc). See page 16 of Crawford'sPlatinum is a particularly useful metal. It is heavy, soft, malleable as gold and silver, easy to draw into wires, very unreactive, and has a high melting point.The platinum group metals might be valuable enough to return to Earth from the Moon, just as suggested for the asteroids, especially if there is water to split and use as fuel available on the Moon or once they set up a mass driver on the MooOf course, you can't just take the current market value of platinum, multiply by the amount of platinum available in a large meteorite - or on the Moon if Wingo and Wieczorek et al are right - and conclude that you'd get trillions of dollars by returning all that platinum to Earth and selling it here. You need to fulfill a need or eventually nobody will buy it. If it's just to replace copper, for instance, in wires, it wouldn't be worth returning unless you could reduce the transport cost back to Earth right down. Dennis Wingo suggested in Moonrush that it could be worth exporting it to Earth for use for fuel cells, as an application that could be high value and yet need a lot of platinum.The gold could be useful too, on the Moon at least. You don't normally think of gold as more decorative than useful but it is used a fair bit in electronics Also combined with the abundant titanium on the Moon you get(density of titanium: 4.43 g/cc. using the atomic masses of gold and titanium, multiplying byThe paper focuses on its medical applications, you can alloy titanium with copper or silver, which are twice as hard as pure titanium, but this is four times as hard. It's also 70% more resistant to wear which will make it last longer and lead to less debris. And has excellent biocompatibility properties. But I wonder if it might also have lunar applications, with the hardness especially and resistance to wear.Probably only the platinum group metals would be worth returning to Earth, since it's going to be easier to mine the Near Earth Asteroids, especially the ones that consist almost entirely of pure metal. However, whether or not they are useful for Earth, they are well worth using on the lunar surface once you have industry there.The Moon has some advantages over Mars indeed for metals, such as the pure nanophase iron mixed in with the regolith, which can only exist in oxidized form on Mars except for rare metal meteorites. Also, it's unlikely it will be commercially worthwhile to return metals from Mars while there are definite possibilities of returning metals from the Moon. SeeLUNAR GLASSThis is a beneficial side effect of all the micrometeorite impacts on the Moon (which you don't get so much on Mars with its thin atmosphere, just enough to filter out micrometeorites). The Moon's ""soil"" or regolith contains large quantities of glass, created during the impacts. It also has free iron, as we saw, at half of one percent of the soil, in tiny micro beads of iron (nanophase iron) which concentrate the microwave energy. Again, you don't have this on Mars.As a result, it is really fast to melt the regolith using microwaves. It took only 30 seconds to melt small lunar sample at 250 watts (typical of a domestic microwave). You can melt the soil to glass as easily as you can boil water using the microwave in your kitchen. SeeHis idea (see Products from Microwave Processing of Lunar Soil on page 194 ofSee alsoThen, there's Behrokh Khoshnevis' idea for making a landing pad on the Moon using tiles made of lunar glass in situ. The idea is to make the surface into lots of tiles by injecting a material that can't be sintered easily using microwaves into the soil first to outline the edges of the tiles, then use microwaves to melt the soil in between.This would make a tiled flat surface for supply vessels to land on. It would also help with the problem of lunar dust by removing dust from the landing area. You canSOLAR CELLS FROM LUNAR MATERIALS - SOLAR PANEL PAVING ROBOTOnce you have glass, it might not be such a big step to make photovoltaic cells on the Moon. And here the Moon has one big advantage, the high grade vacuum so you could use vacuum deposition to make the cells in situ. To start with you'd make the cells themselves from materials sent from Earth, later on mine them on the Moon.This is a report from the Center for Advanced Materials at the University of Houston, suggesting the possibility of anIt would use silicon extracted from lunar materials to make the cells themselves. Of the various methods you could use, magma electrolysis may be best. He uses low efficiency silicon cells which are vacuum deposited on glass, something that is not easy to do on Earth but would be possible in the ultra high vacuum conditions on the Moon. Techy details of this suggestion areIt would requireIdea for a robot to drive over the surface of the Moon leaving solar panels in its wakeStructure of the panelsFor making glass on the Moon see the section above:BASALT (LIKE GLASS FIBER)The basalt itself is a natural resource. If reasonably pure and consistent in composition, it's ideal for making basalt fibre, which is like glass wool, but much better in some ways. The regolith consists mainly of powdered basalt. So might well be ideal for making basalt fibre. See:HELIUM 3I should mention this, since the topic is brought up so often in discussions of lunar settlement. However I don't see this as a major plus point for the Moon at present.The Moon is a source for helium 3, deposited in the regolith by the solar wind, andHowever, we don't yet have fusion power plants at all, and one able to use helium 3 is a tougher challenge. Frank Close wrote an article in 2007See alsoHowever if you use electrostatic confinement, a bit like a spherical cathode ray tube with the fusion happening at the center where the negatively charged ""virtual cathode"" is, then the particles are all at the same high energy and the result is much more feasible with lower power requirements. This is theGerald Kulcinski who has developed a small demonstration electrostatic 3He 3He reactor 10 cm in diameter. It is far from break-even at present, producing 1 milliwatt of power output for each kilowatt of input. SeePerhaps this line of development will come to something. Perhaps one way or another we will achieve helium 3 fusion as the enthusiasts for helium 3 mining on the Moon hope. However it is early days yet, and we can't yet depend on this based on a future technology that doesn't exist yet.However even if we do achieve helium 3 fusion, it might not be such a game changer for the lunar economy as you might think.Even more telling, he also calculates that covering a given area of the Moon with solar panels would generate as much energy in 7 years as you'd get from extracting all the Helium 3 from that region to a depth of three meters.Also - there are many other ideas being developed for nuclear fusion, such as laser fusion, and theThis doesn't mean that there is no point in helium 3 mining however. AsTHORIUM AND KREEP (POTASSIUM, PHOSPHORUS AND RARE EARTH ELEMENTS) ,AND SOME URANIUMThe MoonNuclear power stations built on the Moon wouldn't have the same pollution hazards and hazardous waste issues as stations on the Earth. Perhaps this may be a way to power space colonies, and interplanetary ships fueled from the Moon, so avoiding the need to launch nuclear power plants from Earth to orbit.Thorium is a tracer forWhen the Moon cooled down from the original molten state, then olivine and pyroxene crystals form first, and sink to the bottom of the magma ocean (both made of iron and/or magnesium plus silicon and oxygen). Meanwhile anorthite also forms (made of calcium, aluminum, silicon, and oxygen), which is less dense and floats to the top (forming the lunar highlands). Some of the other elements like nickel are able to squeeze into the crystal lattice and get removed at the same time. But the larger elements can't, and are left in liquid state. They are last to solidify and form the KREEP deposits. It forms in between the olivine and pyroxene deep down, and the floating anorthite on top and may have been liquid for a long time.For some reason, not fully understood, then KREEP deposits on the surface of the Moon are concentrated on the near side of the Moon near the Imbrium basin, with a small amount also in a separate concentration on the far side. The Imbrium impactor probably excavated the KREEP deposits on the near side. But it's puzzling that the much larger Aitken basin didn't lead to large deposits on the far side. Perhaps for some reason KREEP is concentrated on the near side of the Moon. For more about this seeThe abundances of rare earth elements on the Moon are much less than rare earth ores on Earth, and despite the name, they aren't very rare here on Earth. So it's not likely that they'll be worth returning. However the most concentrated spots - the ones marked white in this figure - haven't been sampled on the surface and the spatial resolution is low, tens of kilometers. So it's possible we'll find more concentrated ores on the Moon.It's a similar situation for uranium and thorium. The abundances on the Moon from this map are too low to count even as a low grade ore on Earth. But with such low resolution, there could be richer ore deposits when we look at it closely. (Here I'm summarizing whatPOSSIBILITY OF USING LUNAR SOLAR POWER FOR EARTHThis is a bit further ahead, but it is worth thinking about, whether solar power for the Moon could actually be useful for Earth also. Some scientists think it could be.The advantage of doing this on the Moon is that you can use indigenous materials to make the solar panels. For a small amount of launch mass to the Moon you could have a rover that travels over the surface leaving solar panels in its wake. SeeIt's easy to see this working to supply power to the Moon, but some have suggested it could also be used to generate power on Earth. So, taking this even further, with a large scale operation of this type, using only 1% of the surface area of the Moon, you could supply 2 kilowatts of continuous power per person to a population of 10 billion on the Earth. SeeOr, further ahead, maybe this is more interesting as a talking point than a likely near future concept, the Japanese Shingzu corporation has suggested we could build solar panels in a band around the Moon - at the equatorSeeEarth would get solar power only half the day, so they send the power to satellites in orbit around Earth, which then beam it down to the other side of Earth. Of course they need large receivers to collect the power from the Moon, but only 1% of what they'd need to collect it directly from the sun - that could be worth doing if it is significantly easier to make solar panels on the Moon.On the other hand there are ideas to use large thin film solar panels in space or large thin film mirrors to concentrate the light onto solar panels or furnaces, launched from Earth to LEO. So would the lunar solar plants be a major saving compared to those?Another way that the Moon could help the Earth though, with solar power, is to make the solar cells from lunar materials, and then ship them to GEO or lower orbit. The idea of using lunar materials to make solar power satellites goes back at least to the 1970s, seeFor more on this see theWhether it is useful off planet depends a lot on how easy it is to export the materials from the Moon, and one of the most promising ways to do that is Hoyt’s cislunar tether system which exploits the Moon’s position as higher in the gravitational well than Earth to basically “roll the goods down hill” from the Moon to Earth through a system of rotating tethers.Seein my","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,1.5K,6.8K,91.6M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-will-it-take-for-large-numbers-of-people-to-embrace-nuclear-power

The theory was presented his paper, “ The Internal Constitution of The Stars.” Around 1938, German nuclear physicist Hans Bethe formulated the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis based on proton-proton fusion. This turned out to be the correct explanation for the mechanism by which stars generate energy. Prior to 1920, the source of stellar energy was total mystery. Over all the centuries before, no one knew the answer to the question, “Why do the stars shine?”The series of equations Bethe formulated explained the scientific basis for stellar energy production. The reactions he described involve thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium which releases an enormous amount of energy based on the Einstein formula E=MC2. For this work, Hans Bethe was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1967.As far back as 1938, the idea of building a generator based on fusion was being discussed and after World War II, research in fusion power accelerated. However, it was not long before scientists began to realize that artificial fusion was considerably more difficult than making a fission reactor. Nuclear fusion is possible in stars because the combination heat and immense gravity brings nuclei in close enough proximity that the electrostatic Coulomb Barrier, which keeps atoms apart, can be overcome. At that point, the strong nuclear force ( this being the fundamental force that binds protons and neutrons in the nucleus), predominates and fusion can then take place via Quantum Tunnelling.Beginning in the 1950s, physicists and engineers began efforts to develop a terrestrial generator based on Controlled Thermonuclear Fusion,(CTNF) that would replicate what stars do naturally. It was well known that fusion of light nuclei like hydrogen was capable of producing an amount of energy 3 orders of magnitude greater than the opposite process of fission using very heavy elements such as uranium. Moreover, CTNF does not create high level radioactive waste and the essential fuel for a fusion device is Deuterium ( heavy hydrogen) which can be extracted from sea water. Our oceans contain an approximate 50 million year supply of this fuel.After several decades of research into CTNF, scientists became aware of the enormous complexity involved in the development of a terrestrial fusion machine. CTNF on Earth requires the use of much higher temperatures ( far greater than that found in the Sun), on the order of 150 million degrees Celsius.The past 50 years of fusion research has been focused on devising a mechanism to hold active plasma at this high temperature in an apparatus for long enough to generate usable energy.Given that it is impossible to create a gravitational field on Earth that would approximate that which is present in a star, a correlate had to be devised. The entity that corresponds to gravity in artificial fusion studies is intensely powerful fields generated by superconductor magnets. ITER will utilize a 13 Tesla magnetic field. The concept is that with such a “magnetic bottle” it will be possible to contain , in a stable configuration, fusion plasma which is also sustainable. This difficulty involving plasma stability is perhaps the principle engineering and physics challenge that has made development of fusion a very slow process. Thermonuclear fusion can be started within an experimental machine known as Tokamak which is a toroidal ( doughnut shaped) chamber. The Deuterium - Tritium fuel is heated to the very high temperature which allows thermonuclear fusion to begin. However, as I have noted, the resulting plasma has to be held at that temperature to maintain continuous fusion long enough to generate usable energy.Over the past 30 years or so, it has become clear that an apparatus using the tokamak configuration offers the greatest potential for development of CTNF as a future method for generating energy. This approach is known as the“ Magnetic Confinement” method.Several experimental tokamak devices have been in operation around the world for the past 20 years. These have demonstrated that CTNF can be achieved. Yet, the active plasma can only be contained for brief periods of time that measure in seconds. In present day research machines which do not allow for sustained control, the temperature within the tokamak drops and the active plasma looses coherence and flickers out of existence. It is just as if one had blown out a candle. Thus , the essential problem to be solved is to discover a mechanism that allows one to maintain control of the fusion plasma for an extended period. I would not regard it as an understatement to say that stable plasma confinement is the last remaining obstacle standing in the way practical CTNF.As you are reading this commentary, there is an international group constructing a complex apparatus designed to verify that CTNF is possible. This is the ITER Consortium which is comprised of the European Union, United States, Japan, South Korea, India, Russia and China.ITER is an acronym for International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor. ITER is also the Latin word meaning The Way. This scientific project is going to pave the way for a new method of generating energy. Construction of ITER began in 2010 in Cadarche France. As of 6 June \2020, the installation was 69.3% of the way to full completion. When the apparatus is completed, the first plasma experiments will commence. On the current schedule, the date for initial operation of ITER is December \ 2025. The total cost, to be shared amongst the consortium, will be ~ $20 Billion.At full power, ITER is designed to generate 500 MW of excess power. Once this milestone is reached, the world will be on a direct path to a new source of energy. The way will be open to constructing commercial fusion power stations all across our planet.I have studied the subject of CTNF for the last 30 years out of an innate and profound interest. Within the past few years, in the midst of writing a novel, I have followed closely the ongoing research efforts. Taken together, my natural optimism for the future and my intuitional sense informs me that generation of energy via controlled fusion will be realized. I believe this will happen in my own lifetime. The advent of plentiful fusion based energy will profoundly alter the entire course of Human Civilization. I predict that, in time, the New World which emerges will be magnificent, prosperous and filled with wonders and advances beyond anything we can presently imagine.","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-will-it-take-for-large-numbers-of-people-to-embrace-nuclear-power

Although it involves exotic physics, fission is also a matter of finding something in nature that could release its energy but doesn't without our help.  Fissionable isotopes, such as uranium-235, have nuclei big enough that the tension from electric repulsion of the protons almost competes with the strong force holding it together (seeIf you wait 700 million years, it will eventually break apart on its own through random chance.  But if you hit it with a neutron, it breaks apart right away.If you wait 700 million years, it will eventually break apart on its own through random chance.  But if you hit it with a neutron, it breaks apart right away.Since this process is itself a source of neutrons, you have the potential for a chain reaction so that you don't have to keep feeding it neutrons (which cost energy to produce).  But not yet--- if this were the whole story, then a randomly decaying uranium nucleus would cause a natural chain reaction, depleting all the uranium millions of years ago.Since this process is itself a source of neutrons, you have the potential for a chain reaction so that you don't have to keep feeding it neutrons (which cost energy to produce).  But not yet--- if this were the whole story, then a randomly decaying uranium nucleus would cause a natural chain reaction, depleting all the uranium millions of years ago.These neutrons areTo summarize, (1) uranium 235 is tottering right on the edge between being so unstable that it would have decayed before we got our hands on it and being so stable that we can't ""burn"" it.  (2) Even when we do burn it, we have to do special things that wouldn't occur in nature, or else it would have depleted before we got our hands on it.  The circumstances are so contrived that it only happened once in nature that we know of (Uranium 235 isn't the only isotope that can undergo fission, but it's the only natural one.  At some point in our history, we needed nuclear kindling to make the breeder reactors that now make other isotopes.  The thing that gets me about this story is that2. The energy in the found object has to be coherent, not random.This example might satisfy #1--- we're not producing energy out of nothing--- but it's not possible because random motions can't be converted into coherent motions without outside help (which defeats the purpose of trying to get energyFor instance, the sea has a lot of energy, but if it's just choppy waves flowing in random directions, you can't access that energy.  If you put hydroelectric dams in the sea, the water would sometimes flow in, sometimes flow out, and not turn the generator wheel enough in either direction to make electricity.  If, on the other hand, you put dams in areas with coherent, high tides, the wheel would turn one way at low tide and the other way at high tide.  You'd extract energy and make electricity, but that energy wouldn't be coming from the ocean itself.  It would be coming from the moon's orbit, which is driving the tides.  The moon orbiting the earth is just another example of a rock falling down---Returning to the generalization that humans get energy from burning or dropping things, we can only do that becauseThe two difficulties listed above are the First Law of Thermodynamics (get more energy out than you put in) and the Second Law of Thermodynamics (let the energy flow from coherent to random), respectively.3. Beyond that, every specific technology has specific challenges, and sometimes a problem that has nothing to do with the fundamental idea turns out to be a show-stopper.For a while, I was very excited aboutHowever, when the hydrogen fuses into a helium, the helium flies off with a lot of kinetic energy (great! that's the energy we want), but the muon sticks to the helium, rather than staying in the fuel and catalyzing more hydrogen.  The method satisfies #1: we found the (incredibly abundant) hydrogen in a higher energy state than it would like to be (helium) and the technique for striking the match and allowing it to lower its energy wouldn't happen naturally (low-energy muons are not found naturally).  It satisfies #2: the temperature of the outgoing helium is much greater than room temperature, so it will drive a heat engine.  But the method is unworkable because we don't have the subatomic tweezers to take the muons off of the helium and put them back on the hydrogen.Nature has no respect for cleverness.That's why, in the end, I suspect that our best hope for clean energy is to improve an existing technique, rather than think up a new one.

It has a million components, might light up in 2040 and the million components include no electrical generation bits. When you have something so complex that it has a million components, the odds of it ever being economically viable in any earthbound generation perspective is vanishingly unlikely.After that, we get to the one GW. Nuclear reactors ended up standardizing around a GW for a variety of reasons, but mostly because that was a useful scale for boiling water to generate electricity. There were some smaller ones and some bigger ones, but the likelihood is that if we ever get fusion working economically to generate electricity, it will end up being in that scale. At 90% capacity factor, the nuclear industry average, it would generate about 7.9 TWh in a year, so that’s okay. There are about 450 nuclear reactors running in the 30 countries that built them generating around 10% of the electricity we currently use, so one fusion reactor would produce about 0.02% of the electricity we use globally.As for the all of it model, we have a really amazing fusion reactor parked ‘nearby’. It’s actually 93 million miles away and it’s just sitting there bathing the world in free energy every day. Without it, the Earth would be a lifeless ball floating in space.
