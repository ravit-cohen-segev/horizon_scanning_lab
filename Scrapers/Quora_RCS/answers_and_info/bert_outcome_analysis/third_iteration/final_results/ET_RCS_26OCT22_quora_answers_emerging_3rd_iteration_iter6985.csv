9,"Because the terms are intrinsically meaningless within the development and software communities, and they're generally used as hyperbole and puffery on resumes in place of actual, defined skills and successes.Additionally, calling yourself a ""rockstar"" or a ""ninja"" or even a ""unicorn"" is a way of trying to appear as though you're a unique and special snowflake - amongst a sea of others describing themselves the same way.

The layperson responded, ""why didn't you do the 3000th trial the first time itself?"" Life is a series of experiments and sometimes it can take a long time to get to the answer. Besides the start ofWe took tens of thousands of years to settle down (starting from the migration in Africa). After we settled down, we discovered ways to domesticate plants about 12,000 years ago, discovered metals about 8000 years ago and started writing things about 5000 years ago. Each of these steps helped us bring the humans together and build ideas on top of another. Let us look at some of the major events in human history.Long Answer4.5.6.Until that point we spent most of our time in survival mode. Once we could crop and store stuff, we had plenty of time for pleasure. That meant that we could start building stuff (for worship and living), organizing into more complex groups and start specializing.7.Then we discovered the wheel about 4000 years ago. This allowed us to travel fast and transfer products and humans between regions. Then the rest is history. In short, we spent a lot of time in a trial-and-error mode to find the right places to live and the right things to eat. Given the short life spans and absence of settlements, ideas could not get transmitted. As we discovered ways to keep us warm and bright at night, got spare time due to agriculture we started putting our brains to a good use.Innovation/Invention requires a lot of trial and error and the ability to build on previous results. Until a few thousand years ago, these experiments were local and there was little we could learn from others experiments. Thus, a guy in Ethiopia might have been trying to master fire control even 5000 years after a guy in Sweden has already mastered it. There was no easy way to transfer ideas given the lack of wheel (to enable quick movement), writing systems, broadcast communication etc. The population was also too low to improve the odds of experimentation. Lastly, we were too focused on survival to afford us the time to innovate. Agriculture liberated us from the focus on the daily search for food.Finally, we are constantly discovering about our past and our knowledge of our ancestors is not complete. 100 years ago we didn't know about the magnificent Indus Valley civilization and knew little of Mesopotamia or Incas. New discoveries are constantly pushing back the known history and I would not be surprised if we discover more complex civilizations from 10000 BC that have just been lost due to the passage of time.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,2.3K,5.6K,427.2M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-people-upset-by-terms-like-rockstar-ninja-programmer-Do-they-think-that-there-is-something-wrong-about-the-trend-of-technology-becoming-cool-If-so-is-there-a-better-term-that-people-should-be-using-to-describe-a-talented-developer

Infant and child mortality rates were massive due to lack of medicine. There were no vaccines, no antibiotics, nothing. So people died a lot more, and a lot earlier.We had no real methods of transportation. Hunting and gathering meant you had to constantly look for food. There was no time for science.2. Language was very limited.Progress from science, more or less, requires communication between individuals. When you say ""what were we doing before that?"" you forget that there wasn't really a ""we"" back then. Even if some people did some kind of rudamentary experiments, the odds that they could effectively communicate what happened and why it happened were abysmal. Let's say you were trying to explain the concept of genetics back then. You can forget about the words ""genetics"", ""genome"", ""mutation"", ""chromosomes"", and ""dna"" because they didn't exist. These words had to be invented, they had to be made known to the public, they had to be explained. Every day we learn new words to describe science.Writing wasn't even invented until 3,200 B.C.3. The population of the world was tiny compared to what it is today.There were an estimated 107 billion people that have died on the Earth. The population of the Earth today is 7 billion. Back when the population of the Earth was 10 mil, you have to figure that the amount of people capable of scientific thought was MUCH smaller. The obvious reason being that it's a percentage of the population. The other reason being that you needed to be more intelligent than you would be today to be involved in science. Why is that? Because it was a lot more challenging. They didn't have calculators, they didn't have people teaching them the fundamentals of math, or cells, or physics. They had nothing to build off of. They had to think of these concepts themselves, and figure out how to prove and explain them to other people.Furthermore, today pretty much everyone specializes. Scientists don't have to devote 80% of their time to growing their own food, they can devote all of it to science, and get paid for it (hopefully).","2,691 followers",Peter Losh,744,8.9K,16.8M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-people-upset-by-terms-like-rockstar-ninja-programmer-Do-they-think-that-there-is-something-wrong-about-the-trend-of-technology-becoming-cool-If-so-is-there-a-better-term-that-people-should-be-using-to-describe-a-talented-developer

23,"CORRECTION:It's not what we were dCORRECTION:It's not what we were doing, but what weThe change in climate allowed societies to develop a yearly sustainable agricultural system that allowed sedentary societies to develop, as the climate favoured tubers and but/grain producing plants which could be planted and harvested in a regular cycle.Thus the hunter-gatherers became farmers. As yields increased along with domestication of crop plants, surpluses were created, allowing the settlements and populations to grow, eventually becoming civilisations. Obviously, not everyone would then become a hunter or farmer or tool-maker. These people would instead devote themselves to more intellectual pursuits, which leads to technological progress.","2,072 followers",Che Tianyi,2.1K,111,6.6M,2013,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-people-upset-by-terms-like-rockstar-ninja-programmer-Do-they-think-that-there-is-something-wrong-about-the-trend-of-technology-becoming-cool-If-so-is-there-a-better-term-that-people-should-be-using-to-describe-a-talented-developer
24,"I do not accept the premise of this question.  I don't think virtually all progress for humans took place in the last 10,000 years.What took place over that period was the recording of human progress.  Writing was invented around 10,000 years ago.  It took a while to become popular.  Indeed it is only in the last few centuries where the notion that everyone should know how to read and write became a popular idea.  Before that it was only priests, monks, and Jews who were literate in the West.Before history started being written there were many major developments in human culture and experienceI do not accept the premise of this question.

We learned to control fire and cook food.  Indeed without this there would be no humans.  We learned to make tools and decorative items from sea shells, stones, and eventually metals. We learned to make clothing.  We learned to make war with our neighbors.  We became the true kings of the jungle - the most feared predators in the world.  We learned to build houses of all sorts from tents to masonry buildings.So while human history suggests nearly all of human progress has happened in the last 10,000 years I think this is a remnant from the fact that recording history covers that same time period.

Many business owners make the mistake of developing only one version of their app, but this can be extremely limiting when it comes to reaching customers or maximizing revenue. If you aren’t sure which mobile platform to develop your app on, take some time to consider the pros and cons of each option before deciding which one makes the most sense for your business goals.Here are the top five technologies for mobile app development, along with more information about each option and why they may or may not work best for your business needs.When it comes to the best technologies, one of them is react native. React Native is a cross-platform app framework that is pretty good with JavaScript and mobile design. It’s used to develop highly responsive apps that don’t require users to install additional software from an app store. One great thing about using React Native in an app project is that its components are reusable, which reduces your development time considerably. On top of that, it allows developers to use less code when coding for Android and iOS than what would be required if you were developing separate apps. In addition, since Facebook owns both Instagram and WhatsApp, you get access to a built-in user base and SDKs that can help with advertising and analytics once your project launches.2. XamarinIf you are looking to develop mobile apps for iOS, Android, and Windows and don’t have a lot of resources to spend, Xamarin is your best option. It lets you code in C# and share up to 90% of your code across all three platforms. While that alone would make it one of the best technologies for mobile app development, it also provides an SDK (software development kit) allowing developers to use native UI components so that users can have a seamless experience while using your app.3. FlutterGoogle's Flutter is a mobile application development framework that allows developers to create user interfaces that feel native across multiple platforms (Android and iOS). Unlike traditional hybrid or web-based app solutions, Flutter brings native performance. This includes features like hot reload, smooth frame rates, transitions and gestures - all of which are hard to pull off in HTML5. When you hire flutter developer for your project it means you will get access to many useful plugins out of box such as multi-screen support and push notifications. This makes Flutter a great choice if your project needs complex animations and integration with native device capabilities.4. KotlinSince Google announced Kotlin as an official language for Android development, Kotlin has garnered a lot of attention and interest. One of its best features is being able to create apps that can run on both Android and iOS platforms. Another huge benefit? It’s easy to transition into using Kotlin if you have any experience in Java because they are similar in some aspects. For example, data classes are one of Kotlin’s most popular features, which allow users to create strongly typed collections within their apps at a faster pace.5. JavaLearning to code in Java will help you create stable, quality apps that can be easily ported across multiple platforms. The language also includes a rich set of libraries and frameworks that cover everything from graphics and database access to creating desktop applications—all things developers need when working on mobile apps. Java is one of several languages that are commonly used for Android development; learning it will allow you to work with Android Studio, Google’s official IDE for developing on its platform.ConclusionOf all available mobile app development technologies, there is no one right answer. What’s best is dependent on your business needs and how you want to work with a team.

This approach can greatly increase the number of lines of code, reduce its quality, and violate at least one of the SOLID principles (namely, the Single Responsibility Principle). Such code will be difficult to test and maintain.As a solution to this problem, we separate presentation logic from display using the Elementary package, which is developed and maintained in-house (2. The next common problem: there is no division into main layers, all logic is described in one class / service or in a block, which also violates the SRP principle and ties our hands in terms of testing. For the solution, we use the clean architecture approach, in which the main layers are distinguished:- Domain layer, which declares/describes what data we will work with and what work will be done with this data- Data layer, inside which the implementation of those classes that we describe in domain is described- Presentation layer separated into presentation logic and display This approach guarantees us flexibility, the principle of single responsibility is not violated, and we can always be sure that changes in one component will not affect others.",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,689,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-people-upset-by-terms-like-rockstar-ninja-programmer-Do-they-think-that-there-is-something-wrong-about-the-trend-of-technology-becoming-cool-If-so-is-there-a-better-term-that-people-should-be-using-to-describe-a-talented-developer
