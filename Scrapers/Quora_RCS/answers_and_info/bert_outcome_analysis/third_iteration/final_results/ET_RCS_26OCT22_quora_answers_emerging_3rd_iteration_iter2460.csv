It seems like technology is progressing really fast today, but that is because of all the technology that literally took ages to figure out.How long would it take to figure out how to do any of the simple technologies above, simply by trial and error? It could take a really long time, for example, to figure out what Iron Ore looks like, and how to build a forge hot enough to melt it. Especially if you didn’t even have any idea that Iron even exists.I mean, come on. Everyone knows rocks don’t melt. If they did, how could we use them to build ovens. Right????So there are a lot of hurdles. But once a technology has been figured out, we can build on it to create the next step.These days, we’ve figured out enough things to do a lot. We’ve also figured out something called science, which is the art of figuring out new things.Tasks that were once really hard, become much easier.

Without advancement in sciences and development of complex theories, advanced technologies is impossible.Another important factor is language, specially scientific language.

All real.Imagine for example that I gave you a set of words, that needed to be said in a specific order, at specific paces, and also in a specific state of mind.And that you did it, and by doing it you could for example mentally project your mind anywhere in the world.Now… You had a methodology, you had something you could verify if what you saw and heard was real, and you had something that could be repeated by others.In that case mental projection would no longer be in the realm of fiction or esoteric, it would be science. It would be a phenomenon of the natural world.And when seen that way, then the word magic falls apart and you get something new to add to science.Obviously there are those like Arthur C. Clark, that said that any technology sufficiently advanced would be indistinguishable from magic.He was right then, and he is still right now.The thing about a technology that is sufficiently advanced that it is indistinguishable from magic, is when magic stops being magic, to simply being another field of science we explore and use.Imagine that you met an alien race.Those aliens had a liquid that if you drank it, not only would all the damage in your body be repaired but you would go back to be in your prime, and you would stay in your prime for one thousand years.Now… You might think of the liquid as something magical, but if you asked those aliens to explain how the liquid worked. They might use terms that you don't understand, but in the end you'll see that there was a logical methodology behind the making of that liquid.You may not understand how it was made, or how they arrived at such knowledge, but you can easily see that they aren't simply grabbing things out of thin air.If you ask a real practitioner of the Occult Arts what is the key factor of any ritual they'll tell you, that over 50% of the work is done in the mind.Which is why 99.9% of all those that try to copy what they read in the so called “Spell books” or “Magical Arts books” fail to obtain any significant results.Pop culture from the 80’s and 90’s created this illusion that magic is simply using a bunch of words and some symbols together and BAM you got magic.You get something entirely for free.When the truth is, that nothing is for free.Not even magic.","68,788 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-humans-had-advanced-technology-100-000-years-ago-and-the-technology-was-lost

But since Hell doesn’t exist irl, I don’t know.It’ll be a bit more interesting though. Nowadays, students learn the name of Nazi generals and figures such as Rudolf Hess, Reinhard Heydrich, etc. BJ Blazkowicz and Caroline Becker will be seen as Adolf Hitler is seen today (by people under Nazi-Occupied territories, he’s a war hero under the Second American Revolution) and Anya Oliwa is seen similarly as Eva Braun. Also Max Hass, Set Roth, Bombate, Probst Wyatt III/Fergus Reid (whichever one he picks), Grace Walker, Horton Boone, Paris Jack, and the whole Kreisau Crew will be seen as monsters, looked on by the Nazi world the way we see the Nazi war criminals. Nazi Propaganda will either depict Blazkowicz as an unstoppable killing machine, or an infantile man-child, whatever is convenient at the time. Also the Wolfstone game series is released, starring Hans Grosse: a soldier serving under Wilhelm Deathshead Strasse who critically wounded Caroline Becker and who was killed by Blazkowicz, seen as a martyr.If Bj Blazkowicz does not exist, the world is fucked. The Nazis got the technology some time during Operation Barbarossa. Events play out similarly in real life: Nazis invade Russia, and instead of getting stomped, they deploy Panzerhunds and absolutely shred the Russians. Also they have Supersoldaten and drone things, and way better weapons, so they win the war relatively easily. Some time after 1946. The Nazis will be WAY more powerful because Blazkowicz isn’t there to break out resistance fighters, commit nuclear terrorism, attack moon and mars bases, and stop the Auzmerzer. Also Set Roth isn’t there to sabotage the concrete mix, and even if he was, it wouldn’t make too much of a difference, just some structural damage + some allergies.Almost ALL Jews, Roma, Slavs, will get killed, and in America, slavery exists again. EVEN IN THE BLAZKOWICZ TIMELINE, BJ BLAZKOWICZ/KEEN/DOOMGUY ARE THE VERY FEW SURVIVING JEWS LEFT.

They saw themselves naturally aligned with Japan and Germany. They were Germany’s main raw materials supplier. The Soviets saw this as an opportunity to pick up more territory.After long discussions and proposals, Germany presented the Soviets with a draft written Axis pact agreement defining the world spheres of influence of the four proposed Axis powers (Japan, Germany, Soviet Union, Italy). The Soviets would no longer just be a supplier but a full partner. However, the proposal did not give the Soviets all the territory they wanted.A few days later, the Soviets presented a Stalin-drafted written counterproposal with slight modifications where they would accept the four power pact, but it included Soviet rights to Bulgaria and a world sphere of influence focus on the area around modern Iraq and Iran. Hitler hesitated because of the oil in these countries.The deal never got made and Hitler decided to invade the Soviet Union rather than take them on as a partner. (Part of the decision was Hitler thought the Slavs were inferior) But if the Soviets and German had gotten together, they would have crushed Europe. The Brits would have been forced to seek peace.This was Churchill’s biggest concern. He knew the Soviets were supplying the Germans. If they joined them, Europe could be lost. That is why he embraced the Soviets so quickly when they went to war with Germany. Churchill knew what would happen if they were on the other side.German–Soviet Axis talks - Wikipedia","2,060 followers",Lucas Mund,1.3K,294,1.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-humans-had-advanced-technology-100-000-years-ago-and-the-technology-was-lost

I’ll stop describing it because the scene that follows is just bizarre beyond words.*Anyway, when the audition is over, a Nazi guard walks into your room and you have to quickly kill him. Later on in the mission, you happen to find that guard’s journal…Turns out, he was apparently the friendliest Nazi ever. He made an effort to say hello to every colleague he came in contact with. He was trying to improve his own life and those around him through positive thinking. Worst of all, he was a big fan of the actor your character happens to be posing as.In short, you just killed a guy who only wanted your autograph.",0 followers,Cameron Greene,540,581,11.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-does-one-distinguish-sufficiently-advanced-technology-from-magic-in-a-setting-with-such-game-changing-technology

Stalingrad was home to the Dzerzhinsky Tractor Plant, built in the United States before being shipped to the Soviet Union, one of the largest tank factories in the entire world. By mid-1942, when the Soviets were still struggling with the many problems of setting up the recently evacuated factories beyond the Urals, it was one of the few of the giant tank factories still in complete operational status. Along with the Gorky Automotive Plant, the colossal tractor plant in Stalingrad worked feverishly to meet the Red Army’s immense material needs.Dzerzhinsky Tractor Plant pictured from air, 1942.The Dzerzhinsky plant alone would be reason to shut Stalingrad up, but it was not limited to that. Stalingrad was home to the equally gigantic Red October Steel Works, and the Barrikady Gun Foundry. Between the three of them, these factories were churning out immense amounts of war materiel. The Lazur chemical plant, producing phosgene, chloropicrin and hydrocyanic acid (all classified as chemical weapons) was also located in Stalingrad.Furthermore, while not as significant as Moscow, Stalingrad was a major regional transport hub. It was the origin point of the main rail line to and from Astrakhan, and with the west of Don lost to the Germans, all rail connection between the Voronezh area to the northwest and anywhere south of Stalingrad had to go through Stalingrad, or divert far to the east and reach Astrakhan via Verkhniy Baskunchak. As long as Germans held on to Rostov, the only rail line of reasonable length from the Caucasus north to say, Tambov or Voronezh, was through Stalingrad.Rail map of the Stalingrad area.If you wanted to get from Voronezh in the north to Krasnodar in the south via train in 1941, which is a distance a little over 800 kilometers in a straight line, you had three routes. Your primary route would take the rail line towards Millerovo, then head to Rostov, and finally reach Krasnodar. That’s a bit over 900 kilometers, total.If that rail line was cut for some reason(such as an enemy occupation of significant segments of it, including Rostov) your main route was to take the rail line to Stalingrad, then to Salsk, and finally take a straight rail line to Krasnodar: the total distance was around about 1300 kilometers.If you lose Stalingrad as well? You first head east to Balashov, then from there to Saratov, take a train east and then south to Verkhniy Baskunchak, from there to Astrakhan, south to Kizlyar, and finally take the rail line to Krasnodar… for a distance not that short ofThe loss of Stalingrad would have cut off all major rail lines save the very long-winded Verkhniy Baskunchak route between the North Caucasus region and the whole rest of the Soviet Union. Coupled with the cut-off of the Volga river traffic, a vital transport avenue would mean that the transport of oil and lend-lease material from the Caucasus to rest of the Soviet Union, and men and military materiel from rest of the Soviet Union to the raging battle at the Caucasus, would beGerman mountain troops manning an AA gun somewhere in the Caucasus region, September 1942. The Germans had thrown two German and one Romanian army into the push for the oil fields: for the Soviet personnel opposing them, the rail and river transport from Stalingrad proved a significant aid.The blow to the Soviet war machine the fall of Stalingrad would have struck is one thing, but one also must keep in mind how dangerous the city must have looked to the Germans back during the summer of 1942 when they were debating whether to wait at the Don or go for the city. There stood one of the Soviets’ largest industrial hubs less than sixty kilometers from the banks of the Don. Certainly, when judging where should Germany’s ‘winter line’ be, it should have been and was considered how defensible a position it would be, and how fast before theHowever, one also had to consider the ease with which the enemy could assault one’s positions, and in that summer of 1942 when the Germans considered staying in the Don bend, Stalingrad in such close vicinity must have felt intimidating. An accessible transport hub connected to the north, south, and east with river and rail, located right where any Soviet offensive intended to break the Don bend was likely to mass, to which troops, supplies, and reinforcements could be flooded with relative ease during preparation or offensive phase. And if that in itself was insignificant, any Soviet offensive prepared or deployed to a German defense of the Don bend would have the advantage of their war materiel produced nary a hundred kilometers behind them, in one of the country’s largest industrial centers. Germans would be defending the river bend from a torrent of tanks and guns produced right behind the battlefield.German tanks cross the Don near Kalach, less than sixty kilometers from Stalingrad.Did the city’s status as an important industrial center and transport hub, and its status as a significant threat to a German force not proceeding past the Don, justify the risk Germans took in sacrificing their highly defensible positions along the river Don in order to seize it? It’s a question that must be discussed, especially requiring one to decide how much of the Stalingrad catastrophe was because of the simple fact that Germans decided to go for the city, instead of the specific details ofWith all this in mind, there can indeed be a strong argument that important though Stalingrad was, it was not worth the military risk Germans took in trying to seize it. But accusing Germans of misjudging either the risks or the rewards involved is one thing, and claiming their focus on Stalingrad, or for that matter that of the Soviets, purely stemmed from who it was named after, as if the city itself held no value beyond what being named for Stalin gave it, is another. And it’s not a defensible, accurate, or historical position to hold.That fateful year of 1942, in the City of Rats on the banks of the river Volga, Paulus’ 6th and Chuikov’s 62nd were fighting for something far more vital and far more tangible than the pride of two dictators.Soviet defenders among the ruins of the Red October Steel Works.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-the-Nazis-gained-the-advanced-technology-they-have-in-Wolfenstein-what-would-the-world-have-really-looked-like-after-they-won
