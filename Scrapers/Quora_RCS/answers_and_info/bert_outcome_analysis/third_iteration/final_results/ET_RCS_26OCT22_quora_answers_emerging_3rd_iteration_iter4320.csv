0,"Bitcoin is one example of a solution to blockchain technology. there is the same difference between bitcoin and blockchain as Email and web. blockchain is essentially a distributed ledger technology or a way to store data in a distributed fashion. Yes, almost all of the other cryptocurrencies are based on blockchain or DLT. Besides crypto, there are other solutions as well Eg: Blockchain Grid, supply chain management and many more.",27 followers,Benjamin Price,1.2K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/While-blockchain-technology-powering-cryptocurrency-seems-revolutionary-why-does-cryptocurrency-feel-like-a-scam
1,"It was supposed to be a satellite incase they have to wage war with any east asian nation.But having a disobedient servant and paying for garisson in that area is too costly. So just edit their history books and say they are messiah that gave them education, and put a military base there along with a pro USA media. You no longer need to colonize the People living in it as their minds already favor their master. in short, they already colonized their thoughts.So they left PH so PH can deal with the rebellion problem of their own. While still favor any USA interest in the area",27 followers,Winston Badayos,686,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/While-blockchain-technology-powering-cryptocurrency-seems-revolutionary-why-does-cryptocurrency-feel-like-a-scam
2,"I would vote for GPS. It has changed every operation we do on our farm, from planting, to tillage, to crop dusting, to harvesting, to the installation of buried drip lines. The simple ability to go to exactly the same place again and again is a huge benefit, odd as it might seem. Georeferenced satellite images allow one to locate a small anomaly in an otherwise vast space.I would vote for GPS.

3,"On scale and with the major grains, it’s the US. Historically it’s been a center of capital and technology, farms are large, and labor costs are high. Europe, which otherwise might be competitive, but favors many traditional methods (and this is reinforced by both consumer preferences and regulation).Farming as rocket scienceBut there are plenty of exceptions. It’s not that simple of an answer. The Netherlands probably wins in horticulture (look up their robotic greenhouses). Israel’s known for their irrigation.

Some of the best research in agricultural genetics comes out of Australia and Germany. The US is way behind on using drones (I’ve heard more out of France and China). Canada and the US are very closely aligned and for Canada’s small population, it has had some outsized contributions in some areas and at times. Smallholder agriculture also has value, and the US is probably not a leader there. That requires very localized technology.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Aside-from-poor-technology-and-politically-motivated-infighting-what-factors-led-to-the-failure-of-the-Philippine-Revolutionary-Movement-in-the-early-20th-century

5,"Transfer learning in ML models.Humans are really good at generalizing. We only have to see a few dogs before we can recognize a dog when we see one.Machines are not. ML models require millions of examples before forming a reliable classifier, and that classifier is very specific to the data on which it was trained. If your training data doesn't include dogs with three legs, the model won't recognize them. A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one.

It's hypothesized that the reason humans learn so quickly is that we are fitting new examples into our existing knowledge rather than forming entirely new categories. If we could teach machines to do the same, they would learn exponentially faster and apply that learning more effectively.Transfer learning is a very hot topic in AI research right now, so I expect major breakthroughs in the next few years. I think this may be sufficient to achieve artificial general intelligence, but even if not, it will dramatically extend the range of tasks that machines can accomplish.","20,170 followers",Sriraman Madhavan,4.1K,186,7.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-revolutionary-recent-technologies-and-developments-in-the-field-of-agriculture
6,"No, but her invention will be.Take polymer chemist Stephanie Kwolek.In 1964, Kwolek was trying to invent a fiber strong enough to replace the steel belts in tires. She came up with something that was nearly as thin as water and opaque like milk. (Most polymer resins are thick and transparent.) She convinced the guy who ran the machine that turns resins into fibers to run this glop through it, and got a fiber that was stronger than nylon - which at the time was the strongest synthetic fiber made. Turns out that pound-for-pound it’s also stronger than steel.

That one contribution to the human experience is an undeniable inflection point that dramatically changed the world.The impact of his contribution is worthy of splitting history into a new age. The impact of his contribution can not be understated. None of the other men you mention can make thier contributions without electricity.Our society would collapse entirely if his contribution were to be removed. We depend on it like food.One might argue that computers have made an impact along the same line as electricity. But who invented the computer? Is that man famous?His name is Alan Turing. History has mostly forgotten him already. His contribution was made in the 1950s. He doesn't so much as get a mention in most high school textbooks.A sad fact of life is that we are all irrelevant. There are very few names that will have an enduring place in history.That said, if a woman were to make a contribution on par with Edison I believe history would recognize her accordingly.—pm","31,158 followers",Phillip Remaker,884,11K,78.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-revolutionary-recent-technologies-and-developments-in-the-field-of-agriculture
