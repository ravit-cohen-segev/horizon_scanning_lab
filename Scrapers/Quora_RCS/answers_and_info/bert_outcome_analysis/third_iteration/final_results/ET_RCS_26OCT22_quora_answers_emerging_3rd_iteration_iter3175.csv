0,"Absolutely not. Often the more technologically advanced way leads to products which aren't not nearly as good as those produced in a simpler manner. For example cows milk, technologically advanced methods of production necessitate huge level of efficiency. So they cram millions of cows who produce tons of low quality milk into shit living conditions. Impart this to a family cow. And the milk you get literally has 1/2 the milk fat of the milk you get at home while also being pasteurized which destroys most of the vitamins. At which point they replace a couple of those vitamins with less bioavaiAbsolutely not.

And the milk you get literally has 1/2 the milk fat of the milk you get at home while also being pasteurized which destroys most of the vitamins. At which point they replace a couple of those vitamins with less bioavailable versions. If you have a single family milk cow there is no real need to pasteurized as the risk is so incredibly minimal, that and most of the risk is based around your own level of cleanliness and is no more dangerous than cooking with poultry.The more technologically advanced things tend to be less reliable due to numerous unnecessary features and functions. The increased complexity means decreased reliability.In the end it is the rare occasion where I prefer the more technologically advanced solution. I literally try to buy older less “advanced” stuff because the simpler design tends to be more reliable and in the end more cost effective and less wasteful.","68,778 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-technological-advances-are-always-good

3,"Definitely.Why did we call cavemen, “Cavemen”?The only reason we call them that is because they were ancient, and lived in caves. They were not modern, and so we considered them primitive.So, to the future people, they will develop new technologies that to us seem impossible, and to them, we will be cavemen of some sort. To them, computers and smartphones and cars and anything else that seems modern to us now will be primitive to them.What would we be called?I have some ideas:I know these are horrible.Tell me if you think of any more!",UNKNOWN,DurgaPrasad (దుర్గా ప్రసాద్),546,183,3.5M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-technological-advances-are-always-good
4,"That “cavemen” were a phase of human evolution is TV fiction.For most of human evolutionary experience, humans were nomadic hunter-gatherers. They stalked animals and learned the botanical habits of medicinal and edible plants. There is no reason that any hunter - gatherer could not understand today’s technology - if he had a reason to. Most of modern technology is not relevant to the lives of hunter-gatherers. They would no doubt be bored by TV, or the internet.","37,425 followers",Xavier Amatriain,1K,297,8.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-advanced-technology-a-caveman-could-learn-to-use-without-demonstration
5,"For about the 200th time…. There were no “cavemen”. That’s not a scientific or anthropological term and none of our ancestor species lived in caves… Though they may have sheltered in same occasionally.So this would depend which human ancestor species you were talking about, and what you meant by a “modern” human.As noted, we know that Neanderthal was stockier and more muscular than our own species, Homo Sapiens. They evidently hunted large animals and attacked them with spears and similar weapons.Sapiens, on the other hand, was rather “gracile”… Taller and more slender, and built for running lFor about the 200th time…. There were no “cavemen”.

They evidently hunted large animals and attacked them with spears and similar weapons.Sapiens, on the other hand, was rather “gracile”… Taller and more slender, and built for running long distances…. That was the method of hunting for a very long time; to simply run down game animals to the point of exhaustion.As to an earlier species… Erectus… They seemed to be built more like Sapiens as they are generally considered our direct ancestor.Now… If you took a contemporary average modern human… Chances are that at least in civilized society they would not be very strong at all. Not even compared to our ancestors living perhaps 100 years ago when literally everything was done by hand labor and there were very few modern labor-saving devices.But….If we step outside of the average to look at the best of modern humans… I think we’d find they were much larger and stronger than any of our ancestors, ancient or relatively modern.Certainly even a stout Neanderthal fellow (who might have only stood about 5’ 4”) would not compare to a modern NFL lineman…. Or a heavyweight powerlifter.Modern nutrition, training methods, sports medicine, and genetics all combine to allow some humans to be both quite large and very, very strong.",256 followers,Priyal Gupta,9.7K,0,0,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-advanced-technology-a-caveman-could-learn-to-use-without-demonstration

7,"Stone tools! And I don’t necessarily mean the hobbyists who enjoy “flintknapping”— making replica stone knives, axes, arrow points, etc. Things like this:Blade by Alan Altizer. Hobbyist? Hell, the man’s an artist! Check out more of his work here:But obsidian—”volcanic glass”—can make exceptionally sharp edges. A freshly flaked obsidian edge may be 30 Ångstroms wide (3 billionths of a meter), or about ten times narrower than a steel razor blade edge. ObsidiStone tools!

A freshly flaked obsidian edge may be 30 Ångstroms wide (3 billionths of a meter), or about ten times narrower than a steel razor blade edge. Obsidian scalpels are occasionally used today by some surgeons, in situations where scarring must be minimized (e.g. cosmetic surgery) or where even traces of metal cannot be used. So there’s one very practical use of flaked stone tools.A side-by-side test showed that obsidian scalpel scars may not actually differ from steel scalpel scars in the long term, but they do seem to heal faster and with less inflammation (See:","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-advanced-technology-a-caveman-could-learn-to-use-without-demonstration
