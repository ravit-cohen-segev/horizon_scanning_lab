You can change teams in two ways:1) You are naturally promoted to the next level.2) You can apply internally for the profile you like. But you need to be in the current role for at least 12 months with consistently good performance before applying for a new role.","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,631,1.5K,2.9M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Can-a-MTS-Member-of-Technical-Staff-get-transferred-to-ATL-Advanced-Technology-Labs-in-Adobe-India

In the final battle, Luke Skywalker flies his X-wing fighter at extremely low level through a trench on the powerful Death Star, in order to fire missiles at the space stations core. His super space fighter is equipped with a navigation and targeting computer. The cockpit display looks like this :This system presumably helps Skywalker to fly as low as possible without hitting the surface. It also acts as a bombing computer, basically telling the pilot when to push the fire button to hit its target. This was 1977 Sci-Fi level technology.Now, twelve years earlier, in 1965, very real US naval aviators, flying the very real A-6 Intruder bomber, were flying bombing missions over North Vietnam. The A-6 had what was called DIANE (Digital Integrated Attack/Navigation Equipment). The pilot’s display looked like this :Instead of looking outside (and seeing nothing, since the A-6s flew at night in bad weather), the pilot watched this screen that clearly - for a trained eye - showed relief and distances. It also conveniently provided navigation hints.This picture actually shows what the late 80s A-6E Intruder Vertical Display Indicator looked like. The Vietnam era VDI was more crude, and at one point orange, I think, instead of green. That being said, it was still an impressive piece of technology for its time :> Kaiser Aircraft & Electronics (now Kaiser Electronics) built the first instrumentation system in the late 1950s. The original operational display presented ground and sky texture to the pilot with a well-defined horizon for attitude, “highway in the sky” for steering and numerous other symbols for execution of various attack maneuvers.“Life of the Intruder”, Naval Aviation News, 1997 [ https://www.history.navy.mil/content/dam/nhhc/research/histories/naval-aviation/Naval%20Aviation%20News/1990/1997/september-october/intruder.pdf ]Here is how Brian Bryans, former A-6 pilot and author of Flying Low, describes the VDI as he discovered it in the mid 60s :> An A-6 pilot had the world’s largest attitude indicator centered on the instrument panel right in front of his face. It was similar in size and appearance to the early TV screens and was called a VDI. It had a pale orange glow and showed an artificial horizon across the middle of its screen with puffy white clouds over it. […] When it got real black outside, you turned up the rosy glow on the VDI and it looked like you were over Kansas on a sunny day. […] The computer generated a curved path on the VDI, so all the pilot had to do was to follow the yellow brick road across “Kansas”.The Terrain Clearance Mode (using the data from the Terrain Following Radar) allowed the pilot to fly low and follow the relief to avoid radar detection and Surface to Air Missile. (The A-6 autopilot could not, as I had first written, do terrain following.)The A-6 also did its own bombing.
