It used to be commonly used for applications programming 30–40 years ago, but today it’s primarily used for systems programming (OS kernels, device drivers, embedded applications, compilers, system tools, etc.). C underpins nearly all of the systems software in the world, so in this sense, it is absolutely foundational to the IT industry.","56,375 followers",Charlie Cheever,5.9K,1.5K,9.4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-emerging-new-applications-technologies-in-the-field-of-C-language
1,"For a while some friends of mine were into doing woodwork, building cabinets and the like.

They and I and some other pals shared a small-ish wood shop (although I would use it to do soldering because it had a nice big table and lots of light and electrical outlets - and they didn’t mind if I occasionally accidentally lit some component on fire or fried something).One day someone sprung the cash to get a nice new big table saw. It was fancy and had various bells and whistles and an accompanying dust extractor was also installed - which is like a big fan intended to remove sawdust from the saw as it is made, rather than letting it pile up around the place.There was one problem, the dust extractor would suck all this sawdust up and dump it in a bin right outside the shop. Since the bin was on the other side of the wall and not very visible, we quickly noticed that if no attention was paid to it, it would fill up and the dust extractor would get stressed, sawdust would probably be shooting out into the lot on the side of the house and other bad things would happen. We needed some kind of alarm inside the shop to indicate that the dust bin was full.Now while my friends were having much fun and excitement installing and messing around with the saw and dust extractor, a *sensor* - that was an interesting problem to me.After looking at some different options, and seeing what I could do with little time and on a shoestring budget, I decided on a design that worked like this:All the code was written in C. It was horrible and hacked together, with chunks commented out from tests of things that didn’t work, and code copied from other projects for expediency. But still, I would have to say this is the “best application” I’ve written in C.","56,977 followers",Flavian Mwasi,1.4K,678,73.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-emerging-new-applications-technologies-in-the-field-of-C-language
2,"I believe the biggest advance in technology in the next 7 to 10 years will occur when we can use the internet as an integral part in a whole new scheme of education. Kids today at least know HOW to find a answer or an explanation using the internet. The fashion of teaching today relies too much on assignments, homework and cooperating in work groups.

It would not surprise me to learn that the high achievers at higher levels of education came by their talent by the process of ""self discovery"" (by this I don't mean that they are discovering themselves - but that they are discovering ""things"" which when fitted together becomes understanding).Think about the economic benefit of a ""self-learning"" society. No teachers. No bullies. No homework or assignments. No deadlines. No examinations. Just - free to learn!

Why should we put any money into anything about exploration and learning about the nature of the Universe and more.The answer says it all.“Ask ten different scientists about the environment, population control, genetics and you'll get ten different answers, but there's one thing every scientist on the planet agrees on. Whether it happens in a hundred years or a thousand years or a million years, eventually our Sun will grow cold and go out. When that happens, it won't just take us. It'll take Marilyn Monroe and Lao-Tzu, Einstein, Morobuto, Buddy Holly, Aristophanes .. and all of this .. all of this was for nothing unless we go to the stars.”So no.

It failed to compete against the more common water cooled uranium reactor because of one defect; it was an inefficient means of breeding weapons grade plutonium for the Cold War. Its primary advantages were its clean and safe modality, its practically impossible to have a Chernobyl or Fukushima with this type of Nuclear cycle. It also has an advantage of effectively recycling and reprocessing older nuclear waste into medical isotopes, deep space mission batteries (both currently severely a shortage) and new nuclear fuel for Small Modular Reactors that are walk-away safe (currently a major venture of Bill Gates)There are other technological developments that require wide dissemination and knowledge, to effect as a factor of common use.","105,669 followers",Dave Consiglio,1.6K,6.8K,91.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-emerging-new-applications-technologies-in-the-field-of-C-language

We have seen numerous instances over the years of overreach from top to bottom of the government. The power of some agencies is too great already. It is easy to see several agencies being weaponized against individuals or groups of individuals and at the same time difficult to hold those in power fully accountable for their actions.
