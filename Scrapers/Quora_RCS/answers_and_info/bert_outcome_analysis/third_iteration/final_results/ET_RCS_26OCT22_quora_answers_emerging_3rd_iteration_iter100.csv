I was working at the Apple Store and I wanted a change. I wanted to start building the tech I was servicing.I started looking into Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).There’s so much going on in the field.Every week it seems like Google or Facebook are releasing a new kind of AI to make things faster or improve our experience.Don’t get me started on the number of self-driving car companies. This is a good thing though. I’m not a fan of driving and roads are dangerous.Even with all this happening, there’s still yet to be an agreed definition of what exactly artificial intelligence is.Some argue deep learning can be considered AI, others will say it’s not AI unless it passes the Turing Test.This lack of definition really stunted my progress in the beginning. It was hard to learn something which had so many different definitions.Enough with the definitions.How did I get started?My friends and I were building a web startup. It failed. We gave up due to a lack of meaning. But along the way, I was starting to hearing more and more about ML and AI.“The computer learns the things for you?” I couldn’t believe it.I stumbled across Udacity’s Deep Learning Nanodegree. A fun character called Siraj Raval was in one of the promo videos. His energy was contagious. Despite not meeting the basic requirements (I had never written a line of Python before), I signed up.Three weeks before the course start date I emailed Udacity support asking what the refund policy was. I was scared I wouldn’t be able to complete the course.I didn’t get a refund. I completed the course within the designated timeline. It was hard. Really hard at times. My first two projects were handed in four days late. But the excitement of being involved in one of the most important technologies in the world drove me forward.Finishing the Deep Learning Nanodegree, I had guaranteed acceptance into either Udacity’s AI Nanodegree, Self-Driving Car Nanodegree or Robotics Nanodegree. All great options. I was a little lost. “Where do I go next?”I needed a curriculum. I’d built a little foundation with the Deep Learning Nanodegree, now it was time to figure out where I’d head next.My Self-Created AI Masters DegreeI didn’t plan on going back to university anytime soon. I didn’t have $100,000 for a proper Masters Degree anyway.So I did what I did in the beginning. Asked my mentor, Google, for help.I’d jumped into deep learning without any prior knowledge of the field. Instead of climbing to the tip of the AI iceberg, a helicopter had dropped me off on the top.After researching a bunch of courses, I put a list of which ones interested me the most in Trello.Trello is my personal assistant/course coordinator.I knew online courses had a high drop out rate. I wasn’t going to let myself be a part of this number. I had a mission.To make myself accountable, I started sharing my learning journey online. I figured I could practice communicating what I learned plus find other people who were interested in the same things I was. My friends still think I’m an alien when I go on one of my AI escapades.I made the Trello board publicThe curriculum has changed slightly since I first wrote it but it’s still relevant and I visit the Trello board multiple times per week to track my progress.Getting a jobI bought a plane ticket to the US with no return flight. I’d been studying for a year and I figured it was about time I started putting my skills into practice.My plan was to rock up to the US and get hired.Then Ashlee messaged me on LinkedIn, “Hey I’ve seen your posts and they’re really cool, I think you should meet Mike.”I met Mike.I told him my story of learning online, how I loved healthtech and my plans to go to the US.“You may be better off staying here a year or so and seeing what you can find, I’ think you’d love to meet Cameron.”I met Cameron.We had a similar chat what Mike and I talked about. Health, tech, online learning, US.“We’re working on some health problems, why don’t you come in on Thursday?”Thursday came. I was nervous. But someone once told me being nervous is the same as being excited. I flipped to being excited.I spent the day meeting the Max Kelsen team and the problems they were working on.Two Thursday’s later, Nick, the CEO, Athon, lead machine learning engineer, and I went for coffee.“How would you like to join the team?” Asked Nick.“Sure.” I said.My US flight got pushed back a couple months, I’ve also got a return ticket.Sharing your workLearning online, I knew it was unconventional. All the roles I’d gone to apply for had Masters Degree requirements or at least some kind of technical degree.I didn’t have either of these. But I did have the skills I’d gathered from a plethora of online courses.Along the way, I was sharing my work online. My GitHub contained all the projects I’d done, my LinkedIn was stacked out and I’d practiced communicating what I learned through YouTube and articles on Medium.I never handed in a resume for Max Kelsen. “We checked you out on LinkedIn and we were impressed.” My body of work was my resume.Regardless if you’re learning online or through a Masters Degree, having a portfolio of what you’ve worked on is a great way to build skin in the game.ML and AI skills are in demand but that doesn’t mean you don’t have to showcase them. Even the best product won’t sell without any shelf space.Whether it be GitHub, Kaggle, LinkedIn or a blog, have somewhere where people can find you. Plus, having your own corner of the internet is great fun.How do you start?Where do you go to learn these skills? What courses are the best?There’s no best answer. Everyone’s path will be different. Some people learn better with books, others learn better through videos.What’s more important than how you start is why you start.Start with why.Again, no right reason. All are valid in their own way.Start with why because having a why is more important than how. Having a why means when it gets hard and itGot a why? Good. Time for some hard skills.I can only recommend what I’ve tried.I’ve completed courses from (in order):They’re all world class. I’m a visual learner. I learn better seeing things being done/explained to me on. So all of these courses reflect that.If you’re an absolute beginner, start with some introductory Python courses and when you’re a bit more confident, move into data science, machine learning and AI.How much math?The highest level of math education I’ve had was in high school. The rest I’ve learned through Khan Academy as I’ve needed it.There are many different opinions on how much math you need to know to get into machine learning and AI. I’ll share mine.If you want to apply machine learning and AI techniques to a problem, you don’t necessarily need an in-depth understanding of the math to get a good result. Libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch allow someone with a bit of Python experience to build state of the art models whilst the math is taken care of behind the scenes.If you’re looking to get deep into machine learning and AI research, through means of a PhD program or something similar, having an in-depth knowledge of the math is paramount.In my case, I’m not looking to dive deep into the math and improve an algorithm’s performance by 10%. I’ll leave that to people smarter than me. Instead, I’m more than happy to use the libraries available to me and manipulate them to help solve problems as I see fit.What does a machine learning engineer actually do?What a machine engineer does in practice might not be what you think.Despite the cover photos of many online articles, it doesn’t always involve working with robots that have red eyes.Here are a few questions an ML engineer has to ask themselves daily.I borrowed these from a great article by Rachel Thomas, one of the co-founders ofFor more, I made a video of what we usually get up to on Monday’s at Max KelsenNo set pathThere’s no right or wrong way to get into ML or AI.The beautiful thing about this field is we have access to some of the best technologies in the world, all we’ve got to do is learn how to use them.You could begin by learning Python code.You could begin by studying calculus and statistics.You could begin by learning about the philosophy of decision making.Machine learning and AI fascinates me because of this intersection of fields.The more I learn about it, the more I realise there’s plenty more to learn. And this hypes me up.Sometimes I get frustrated when my code doesn’t run. Or I don’t understand a concept. So I give up temporarily. I give up by letting myself walk away from the problem and take a nap. Or go for a walk. When I come back it feels like I’m looking at it with different eyes. The excitement comes back. I keep learning.There’s so much happening in the field it can be daunting to get started. Too many options lead to no options. Ignore this.Start wherever interests you most and follow it. If it leads to a dead end, great, you’ve figured out what you’re not interested in. Retrace your steps and take the other fork in the road instead.Computers are smart but they still can’t learn on their own.

You should be careful in keeping these terms separate, as they mean entirely different things. I like analogies, so here’s a simple way to illustrate the differences. The terms “computer science”, “cloud computing”, and “ARM processors” are entirely distinct. CS is like AI: it denotes the scientific study of computing, all the way from the theoretical abstraction of Turing machines to realizable architectures such as von Neumann or quantum computers. Likewise, AI denotes the technology independent study of intelligence as an abstraction.Turing defined an imitation game in his classic 1950 paper in the journal Mind as an interactive dialogue between a human and another entity, possibly a computing machine, which is considered intelligent if it is indistinguishable from a human, not in appearance, but in terms of its responses to questions posed by a human. In one stroke, Turing brilliantly abstracted the problem of AI as that of the abstraction provided by the imitation game.It’s worth quoting the introduction to this paper, as it officially defines the field of AI 71 years ago:“1. The Imitation GameI PROPOSE to consider the question, ‘Can machines think?’ This should begin with definitions of the meaning of the terms ‘machine’ and ‘think’. The definitions might be framed so as to reflect so far as possible the normal use of the words, but this attitude is dangerous. If the meaning of the words ‘machine’ and ‘think’ are to be found by examining how they are commonly used it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the meaning and the answer to the question, ‘Can machines think?’ is to be sought in a statistical survey such as a Gallup poll. But this is absurd. Instead of attempting such a definition I shall replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words.The new form of the problem can be described in terms of a game which we call the ‘imitation game’. It is played with three people, a man (A), a woman (B), and an interrogator (C) who may be of either sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart from the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by labels X and Y, and at the end of the game he says either ‘X is A and Y is B’ or ‘X is B and Y is A’. “.Now, let us turn to the term “machine learning”, originally defined by Arthur Samuel, who built the first reinforcement learning program in 1959 that learned to play checkers from self play using temporal difference learning, thus anticipating the work done by thousands of researchers who came after him, including most recently the Alpha Go program of Deep Mind that worked exactly the same way as Arthur Samuel’ program did 60 years ago. It’s worth noting that Samuel’s program ran on an ancient IBM 704, a vacuum tube monstrosity of a computer that filled an entire room and had no graphics, interface, keyboard, mouse or programming language. Consider the phenomenal achievement of Samuel the next time you blithely run your favorite deep RL program on 10,000 GPU machines! Whatever you do cannot match Samuel’s pioneering work.However, we still need a precise definition of the term machine learning. The late economics Nobel laureate Herbert Simon, a pioneering founder of AI and a true polymath, gave the best definition of machine learning in a brilliant article titled “Why should machines learn?”.‘Learning denotes changes in the system that are adaptive in the sense that they enable the system to do the task or tasks drawn from the same population more efficiently and more effectively the next time”.Note the abstract way that Simon defines the term machine learning, as it does not refer to any particular method like deep learning or boosted regression trees or reinforcement learning. Note also that machine learning is entirely different from Turing’s imitation game. An imitation game playing machine may or may not use machine learning. Consider the well known IBM Watson Jeopardy program. If it was hidden behind a curtain and only allowed to respond textually, no one would have guessed Watson was a machine. Pointedly, Watson did not use learning during each game of Jeopardy. Within the domain of the quiz show Jeopardy, Watson was indistinguishable from a human in the sense that Turing meant.Finally, we come to the term “deep learning”. This loosely refers to computing models that are vaguely brain-like, in the sense that the function mapping each input to the output is computed by a network of artificial neurons that are trained by gradient descent on a fixed dataset. The cartoon model of a neuron used in deep learning has nothing whatsoever to do with the way real neurons work. The back-propagation algorithm also is completely implausible as a biological model, and no scientific evidence exists showing the brain uses anything like back propagation.So, in short, AI is the scientific field of designing machines to play imitation games, machine learning is the field of designing self-improving machines that may or may not be useful in imitation games, and deep learning is a particular technology that is currently useful in building self-improving machine learning systems. Defining deep learning as AI is like saying designing Tesla cars is equivalent to studying physics! It’s a silly statement and if you hear some reporter or even a researcher make such a statement, they don’t know the AI field.Incidentally if you want to read a completely alternative model of how brains work, one that completely rejects the view that brains work like digital computers, I highly recommend the series of books by the Nobel prize winning biologist Edelman.Edelman won the Nobel prize for discovering how the immune system works, a discovery that is central to our ability to design COVID vaccines. Edelman was puzzled how the immune system could so rapidly “learn” how to recognize an alien bacterial or viral infection in our bodies and manufacture a solution in real time. A sensational result of his work is that it largely follows the same principle of Darwin’s natural selection principle: a large number of possible variants are tested quickly to find one that works, which then rapidly multiplies in the body’s grad school for the immune system, your lymph nodes. Inspired by this result, Edelman spent the rest of his career in advancing the radical idea that the brain also works by Darwinian natural selection principles. The core of his argument rests on the fact that embryology has shown that when cells multiply from a single fertilized egg to form all our body parts, including the brain, many cells, including the neurons in the developing brain, die in the process! According to Edelman, this noisy stochastic process can only work reliably if there were some natural selection mechanism at work that adapted the surviving neurons to do categorization, learning and thought. I won’t pass judgement on whether Edelman was right or wrong, but his many books on the subject are written in a detailed manner full of the intricacies of the complex biology involved. Nothing we do in AI comes remotely close to matching the sheer complexity of the 100 billion neural machine between our ears, the most complex structure in the universe. It will take much more effort to crack this mystery, and our current theories in AI are play toys compared to the real thing.","284,845 followers",James Altucher,991,878,91.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Will-a-MS-degree-in-machine-learning-from-Carnegie-Mellon-University-help-me-get-a-data-scientist-role-in-a-top-technology-company

I’m always walking around with an earbud in wherever I go. I have a Spotify playlist for every language I’m currently studying. (That would be Spanish, Swedish, German, Chinese, and Japanese.) My current target language is Spanish, and so most often I will listen to my Spanish playlist. The best way to learn is to just immerse yourself.I read lots of books in all of my languages. Bear in mind that I don’t understand, nor expect myself to understand them. Most people think that reading books is simply an elite technique for advanced-level learners to use to improve their already fluent knowledge of their target language. When I read books, I simply scan the pages and look for words I understand. When I find words I understand, I look at the words surrounding them. Can I infer the meaning of that word based on the one I understand next to it? Sometimes I’ll write the words down. I see reading as a really great way to study the syntax and vocabulary of a language.I also watch a lot of movies and TV in my languages. I have been watching a lot of Spanish dubs of cartoons like Avatar: The Last Airbender lately. I also watch a lot of movies and TV shows in Spanish.Before my computer fried itself during an update, I used to play Skyrim… A lot. One of the useful things about it was that, yep, you guessed it, IT CHANGES LANGUAGES. We aren’t just talking subtitles, no no, for seven languages, English, German, Spanish, French, Japanese, Polish, and Russian, Skyrim has been FULLY re-voice acted professionally. I’ve noticed a lot of inaccuracies in the translations however, like in languages with different levels of formality, for example, French and German, the two others that I’ve played in, NPCs never stop referring to you in the formal tense. I haven’t played in Japanese, but I just KNOW that they are bound to have some problems with formality as well. Also, they use a lot of archaic words, so video games should really only be used for immersion and not as an actual study tool.I only ever use picture flashcards, which I actually got the idea of from Quora. I recommend picture flashcards because it helps you memorize words by concept and not by your native language equivalent. This gives you a deeper root of the language and starts to make youThe most important however, is to SPEAK. Speak, speak, speak, speak. You may know a native speaker of the language you're learning, so TALK TO THEM. It can be embarrassing to spit and stutter compared to the fluency of a native speaker, but when you get that feedback from an educated speaker of your target language, you are getting better. You are learning through the single most powerful force on this planet, which is human connection. Most native speakers will be more than excited to hear a foreigner speaking their language, and more than eager to help.Overall, you can’t start learning a language thinking it will be easy. It won’t. Don’t be deceived by the “simplicity” of the language after you learn ways to say hello and goodbye. Every natural language on the planet is unique and is difficult in its own way, just as every language is easy in its own way. Rather, when approaching a language, you should expect nothing but a challenge, and be eager to take on that challenge with passion and patience.That’s all.EDIT: Wow!

I was working at the Apple Store and I wanted a change. I wanted to start building the tech I was servicing.I started looking into Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).There’s so much going on in the field.Every week it seems like Google or Facebook are releasing a new kind of AI to make things faster or improve our experience.Don’t get me started on the number of self-driving car companies. This is a good thing though. I’m not a fan of driving and roads are dangerous.Even with all this happening, there’s still yet to be an agreed definition of what exactly artificial intelligence is.Some argue deep learning can be considered AI, others will say it’s not AI unless it passes the Turing Test.This lack of definition really stunted my progress in the beginning. It was hard to learn something which had so many different definitions.Enough with the definitions.How did I get started?My friends and I were building a web startup. It failed. We gave up due to a lack of meaning. But along the way, I was starting to hearing more and more about ML and AI.“The computer learns the things for you?” I couldn’t believe it.I stumbled across Udacity’s Deep Learning Nanodegree. A fun character called Siraj Raval was in one of the promo videos. His energy was contagious. Despite not meeting the basic requirements (I had never written a line of Python before), I signed up.Three weeks before the course start date I emailed Udacity support asking what the refund policy was. I was scared I wouldn’t be able to complete the course.I didn’t get a refund. I completed the course within the designated timeline. It was hard. Really hard at times. My first two projects were handed in four days late. But the excitement of being involved in one of the most important technologies in the world drove me forward.Finishing the Deep Learning Nanodegree, I had guaranteed acceptance into either Udacity’s AI Nanodegree, Self-Driving Car Nanodegree or Robotics Nanodegree. All great options. I was a little lost. “Where do I go next?”I needed a curriculum. I’d built a little foundation with the Deep Learning Nanodegree, now it was time to figure out where I’d head next.My Self-Created AI Masters DegreeI didn’t plan on going back to university anytime soon. I didn’t have $100,000 for a proper Masters Degree anyway.So I did what I did in the beginning. Asked my mentor, Google, for help.I’d jumped into deep learning without any prior knowledge of the field. Instead of climbing to the tip of the AI iceberg, a helicopter had dropped me off on the top.After researching a bunch of courses, I put a list of which ones interested me the most in Trello.Trello is my personal assistant/course coordinator.I knew online courses had a high drop out rate. I wasn’t going to let myself be a part of this number. I had a mission.To make myself accountable, I started sharing my learning journey online. I figured I could practice communicating what I learned plus find other people who were interested in the same things I was. My friends still think I’m an alien when I go on one of my AI escapades.I made the Trello board publicThe curriculum has changed slightly since I first wrote it but it’s still relevant and I visit the Trello board multiple times per week to track my progress.Getting a jobI bought a plane ticket to the US with no return flight. I’d been studying for a year and I figured it was about time I started putting my skills into practice.My plan was to rock up to the US and get hired.Then Ashlee messaged me on LinkedIn, “Hey I’ve seen your posts and they’re really cool, I think you should meet Mike.”I met Mike.I told him my story of learning online, how I loved healthtech and my plans to go to the US.“You may be better off staying here a year or so and seeing what you can find, I’ think you’d love to meet Cameron.”I met Cameron.We had a similar chat what Mike and I talked about. Health, tech, online learning, US.“We’re working on some health problems, why don’t you come in on Thursday?”Thursday came. I was nervous. But someone once told me being nervous is the same as being excited. I flipped to being excited.I spent the day meeting the Max Kelsen team and the problems they were working on.Two Thursday’s later, Nick, the CEO, Athon, lead machine learning engineer, and I went for coffee.“How would you like to join the team?” Asked Nick.“Sure.” I said.My US flight got pushed back a couple months, I’ve also got a return ticket.Sharing your workLearning online, I knew it was unconventional. All the roles I’d gone to apply for had Masters Degree requirements or at least some kind of technical degree.I didn’t have either of these. But I did have the skills I’d gathered from a plethora of online courses.Along the way, I was sharing my work online. My GitHub contained all the projects I’d done, my LinkedIn was stacked out and I’d practiced communicating what I learned through YouTube and articles on Medium.I never handed in a resume for Max Kelsen. “We checked you out on LinkedIn and we were impressed.” My body of work was my resume.Regardless if you’re learning online or through a Masters Degree, having a portfolio of what you’ve worked on is a great way to build skin in the game.ML and AI skills are in demand but that doesn’t mean you don’t have to showcase them. Even the best product won’t sell without any shelf space.Whether it be GitHub, Kaggle, LinkedIn or a blog, have somewhere where people can find you. Plus, having your own corner of the internet is great fun.How do you start?Where do you go to learn these skills? What courses are the best?There’s no best answer. Everyone’s path will be different. Some people learn better with books, others learn better through videos.What’s more important than how you start is why you start.Start with why.Again, no right reason. All are valid in their own way.Start with why because having a why is more important than how. Having a why means when it gets hard and itGot a why? Good. Time for some hard skills.I can only recommend what I’ve tried.I’ve completed courses from (in order):They’re all world class. I’m a visual learner. I learn better seeing things being done/explained to me on. So all of these courses reflect that.If you’re an absolute beginner, start with some introductory Python courses and when you’re a bit more confident, move into data science, machine learning and AI.How much math?The highest level of math education I’ve had was in high school. The rest I’ve learned through Khan Academy as I’ve needed it.There are many different opinions on how much math you need to know to get into machine learning and AI. I’ll share mine.If you want to apply machine learning and AI techniques to a problem, you don’t necessarily need an in-depth understanding of the math to get a good result. Libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch allow someone with a bit of Python experience to build state of the art models whilst the math is taken care of behind the scenes.If you’re looking to get deep into machine learning and AI research, through means of a PhD program or something similar, having an in-depth knowledge of the math is paramount.In my case, I’m not looking to dive deep into the math and improve an algorithm’s performance by 10%. I’ll leave that to people smarter than me. Instead, I’m more than happy to use the libraries available to me and manipulate them to help solve problems as I see fit.What does a machine learning engineer actually do?What a machine engineer does in practice might not be what you think.Despite the cover photos of many online articles, it doesn’t always involve working with robots that have red eyes.Here are a few questions an ML engineer has to ask themselves daily.I borrowed these from a great article by Rachel Thomas, one of the co-founders ofFor more, I made a video of what we usually get up to on Monday’s at Max KelsenNo set pathThere’s no right or wrong way to get into ML or AI.The beautiful thing about this field is we have access to some of the best technologies in the world, all we’ve got to do is learn how to use them.You could begin by learning Python code.You could begin by studying calculus and statistics.You could begin by learning about the philosophy of decision making.Machine learning and AI fascinates me because of this intersection of fields.The more I learn about it, the more I realise there’s plenty more to learn. And this hypes me up.Sometimes I get frustrated when my code doesn’t run. Or I don’t understand a concept. So I give up temporarily. I give up by letting myself walk away from the problem and take a nap. Or go for a walk. When I come back it feels like I’m looking at it with different eyes. The excitement comes back. I keep learning.There’s so much happening in the field it can be daunting to get started. Too many options lead to no options. Ignore this.Start wherever interests you most and follow it. If it leads to a dead end, great, you’ve figured out what you’re not interested in. Retrace your steps and take the other fork in the road instead.Computers are smart but they still can’t learn on their own.

What I feel funny is how some people make fun of it. I'd ratherLet's come to the reasonsI have seen people (even on Quora) who say things like “PHP is not the best language to teach you about how things work. In fact, it teaches nothing except language-level features. If you want to learn web programming without getting in too much details, PHP is the best. ButRemember that it is not C, C++, Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, Haskell or any of those stuff that you need to learn. What you need to learn is 'programming'; to command the machine and make it do what you want. Anything works (no, really, it does). If your program can be written in Basic and Basic does the job - Basic is the language you need to learn. Fortunately, PHP is way more powerful. PHP wasn't built by idiots. If it did, it'd have been dead by now. But look, it is the most dominant. Also, let me repeat it for you - just because something is easy, does not mean it is not powerful.A language should ideally be consistent as well as well designed. But if you know about PHP’s history a bit, you would likely forgive it’s craziness at times (and there are some, in every single language). PHP was not supposed to be a full fledged language. PHP was just a small hack at programming a web page dynamically. It was designed for non-programmers in a time where C and C++ were the most popular languages. Even Java wasn’t really around!

Use Your Sleep.However, something that we did find out is that our minds use our deeper phases of sleep (The dream phases or REM [Rapid Eye Movement] phases) to put information from our short-term memory into our long-term memory.Knowing this, we can actually use our sleep to our advantage.If we study or learn something and then sleep right after that, we increase the chances of our mind transferring this new information from our short-term to our long-term memory.The only requirement is that we have to reach a stage of deep enough sleep (REM sleep which usually happens between every 60–90 minutes).This means, if you take a nap in the middle of the day that is around 90 minutes long, right after you studied, or study at the end of the day before you go to sleep, you will increase the chance to transfer some of what you learned.Just make sure not to put any activity between the learning and sleeping.2. Start Early. Do Little.But the truth is that if you want great grades, if you want a degree that is worth something, and if you want to get the job of your dreams,That doesn’t mean you have to spend 3 hours or more every day studying or learning or improving.If you want to, that will get you to your goals faster, but the point is that one hour a day over the course of a couple weeks and/or months will be much more beneficial to you than studying 8 hours every day 7 days before the exam or test.Start early and do a little bit every day.This will give you more time to facilitate what you must learn, more time to ask the questions you need answered and, most importantly, it will reduce your level of stress tremendously!Plus this is a great habit to get into for after you are done with your degrees as well, for in the working world you can still learn and improve.If you spend 1 hour a day to improving your skill and learning more, you will be climbing the corporate ladder quickly and effortlessly.3. Set Up Triggers.Triggers are used to remind yourself of your biggest goals and they can be anything from a 10 Million Dollar check (Source: Jim Carrey) that you write to yourself to a post-it note on your computer screen.Do this so you do not forget your purpose and know why you are working so hard.Take a couple post-it notes and place them everywhere around your house where you frequently look at.On these notes should be pieces of information that are very important for the exam, or that you have trouble remembering, things that you want to learn or raise your awareness for.It could be important formulas for Math, Vocabulary that you are struggling with, or even a picture of a concept you need to memorize. (For those already past the exam age these could be reminders of your dreams, triggers for personality traits you wish to adopt or reminders of who you want to be).The trick then, is to not only look at the nice post-it note, but to think about it whenever you see it.Stop what you are doing and take in what is written on the note for just 30 seconds.Over the course of just a week you might make it up to 30–60 minutes depending on where this post-it note is, but it will be the repetition that will set the information in your mind.Put some across the toilet on the wall, on the door to the fridge, on your pillow, even on your water bottle.4. Teach Others.Teach a topic to them like they have absolutely no background knowledge.If you are showing them how a concept in Biology works, imagine that they never took a science class in their life.This will make you pay close attention to the details and you will not just assume they know what you are talking about, challenging your knowledge even more.Sometimes you will trip over very simple things that you do not understand as good as you thought you did.Not only will that make you remember more, but you will also be able to connect the concepts in more ways, enabling you to remember it in multiple ways in case you freeze on one of them during the exam.If you do not have a study or mastermind group to teach, then go online.Join forums, talk to people about what you learned, visit book clubs or write or record videos.5. Read, Ask Questions, Read Again.We like to think of the classes as giving us the information required to pass the test, but that is not always the case.Instead of thinking of your class like that, think of the book as being the required baseline for the exam and the class just being there to summarize the chapters again for you.If you think about it like that you will pay much closer attention to the book and will try to understand it more than what is being taught in class.This will do a much better job to get you good grades during the exam, because even if you get something wrong, you can always refer your teacher back to the book where you got it from. They usually do not argue with the Books!The trick here is to read the chapterThat way you have a strong baseline, already know the difficult concepts and what to pay attention to, and you will be able to ask the specific questionsThen, after class, go back and read the chapter again.When I was in high school IThis is the tip that has worked the best for me so I encourage you to try it, even though it might take some time to read, it is all you need to do in the end!As for those reading to improve or learn, the same concept applies.Read the book, write down notes and questions as you read, try to answer them and then re-read the chapter.This will facilitate the information much deeper in your mind as you actually interact with the content you consume.",UNKNOWN,Andy Bernard,504,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-technologies-should-one-learn-in-2019
