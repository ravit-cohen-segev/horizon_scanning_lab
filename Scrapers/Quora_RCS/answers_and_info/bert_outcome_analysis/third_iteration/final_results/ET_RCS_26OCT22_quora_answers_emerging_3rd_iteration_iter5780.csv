1,"There is one simple problem - all other problems stem from this.People like Larry Page are mathematicians - they can see the power of the algorithm and know its power in making what appears to be very complex, truly simple.Business people see a different imperative. They know that if something looks simple, even if it isn't, you can't charge much for it. The trick is to create something which is simple to do, but looks hard and complex - then you can charge lots of money for consultancy fees, make fortunes as gurus attending conferences etc. Theirs is the cult of the magician or alchemist - sThere is one simple problem - all other problems stem from this.People like Larry Page are mathematicians - they can see the power of the algorithm and know its power in making what appears to be very complex, truly simple.Business people see a different imperative.

The trick is to create something which is simple to do, but looks hard and complex - then you can charge lots of money for consultancy fees, make fortunes as gurus attending conferences etc. Theirs is the cult of the magician or alchemist - smoke and mirrors.A rocket is one of the world's simplest machines. Yet we have the ""It's not rocket science"" myth. In the same way we have an IT myth, created in the first phase when no-one knew what this new-fangled computer stuff could do or what was involved. People appointed themselves as experts and charged fortunes. A whole generation of aggressive companies grew up around providing horrendously expensive hardware and tying companies into inflexible long-term contracts based on number of CPUs, concurrent users and all the language of the confuseopoly - a way to charge more.When the hardware myth was finally busted, these companies moved onto software. SAP, Oracle and IBM bought up every available software company and created the myths of ERP, CRM and HR Management as ways to sell software - not forgetting the aggressive, tie you in and lock the other guy out, pay for lots of seats you don't use and 20% maintenance contracts - oh and the £1k/day per consultant to actually push the buttons to make it do anything.Those myths are busted too. So where do those companies go - into data, of course. The last frontier of IT complexity (well maybe not - they're in Internet of Things as well). They've brought their methodologies with them.BigData - as in ""big, frightening, you couldn't possibly understand it""They're still peddling consultants at a grand a pop. Still saying hand your company to us. Still tying you into long term contracts you can't easily get out of. Spinning buzzwords so you gain job status points by buying the latest jargon. New field - same old aggressive sales techniques. And are you fooled - you betcha! Hence questions like this - these people want you to believe datascience is hard and beset with problems only they can solve (so get out your cheque book).That's not DataScience. That's snake-oil. And it is killing the benefits big data can truly offer both companies and individuals.","12,843 followers",Bradley Voytek,651,193,4M,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-common-characteristics-of-emerging-big-data-technologies

Few years back, I could develop an Intranet application for a hospital with complex workflows (with roles, approvals, email alerts, personalisation etc) with Drupal with very very little amount of programming.General pattern of applying these kind of tools is, 80% percent of the requirements can be realised in a remarkably short period of time. But to realise the rest of the essential features, you need expensive and complex extensions or you face a dead end. Aspects like extensibility and performance is a different story.Developing a malleable software product to suit most of the requirements has serious limits. One reason for this is, in developing software and other technological products, we make serious trade off decisions to gain something. Thats why we have vast amount of database systems to suit various applications. CAP theorem is about compromising.So the effect of these tools to programming job demand is negligible.Despite AI, programming jobs are ever changing by nature. In the near future, at least, most programmers will have to familiarise with basic AI concepts to apply 3rd party AI services (APIs) provided by major vendors.Despite all of these, I find entering into programming is bit challenging with competing technological choices, paradigms etc.",35 followers,Noah Green,578,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-common-characteristics-of-emerging-big-data-technologies

However, there were very strong incentives to follow the letter of the plans, not the intent. As long as the numbers matched, factory management got their bonuses, and this created the perverse motivation to “optimize”.For instance, if a nail factory had a quota to produce a million nails, they would make a million tiny nails as these required less materials. When they were required to produce a hundred tons of nails, they would make huge railroad spikes as these required less labor. Any “savings”were usually stolen or wasted, so the management could win twice - get the bonuses and also get the stolen materials. Country-wide production numbers were actually quite decent in Soviet Union but somehow there was always a shortage of everything that people actually needed.In summary, as long as human ingenuity and greed is pitted against the planners, it always wins, even if AI and ML had been available.The text says:",18 followers,Ollie Tizzard,1.3K,113,1.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-common-characteristics-of-emerging-big-data-technologies

However, the technologies that you mention, get their power from access to information. They feed on information, and they need a solid dense information transmitting network to thrive. And, of course, the network must be free for all information to travel on.Soviet communist party could never do that. They could never ever allow information to flow freely. Just look what happened, when Gorbachev started with his glasnost reforms. Glasnost was not absence of all censorship, it was just censorship loosened up a bit. And it devastated the Soviet society, because up until then, the Soviet citizens could read only about glorious successes of their revolutionary society, be it economic successes, technological, scientific, sports, whatever it was, news had to be positive. So while censorship was tight, people only knew of what was going on around them, they only knew of the problems in their own immediate environment, their town, their neighbourhood, their locality. But with glasnost, people suddenly realized, that they had those same problems everywhere, and that communism wasn't paradise, it was hell. And it collapsed because of that.So, if the Soviet Union wanted to use modern technologies, it would die a lot sooner than it did, because in order to use those technologies, you have to free up information.

But this was mostly due to the centrally planned regime dragging the USSR though a period of crash industrialization.Coal, steel, wheat, butter. Factories, railways, tanks, guns, Rayon ties.It was a country where maximizing gross outputs were what mattered, in ever upward quantities. The problem was how all those raw materials should be arranged into products people actually wanted.A planned economy sounded good on paper: No longer would people be left vulnerable to the fickle vagaries of the free market. A planned economy could decide what needed to be produced, where, for the good of all. Sadly, no one had a clear idea of how this should work. By the mid seventies, possibly before, the machine was starting to stall….We are used to a world awash with data. The Soviet planning system was remarkably data poor. One man,…thought this could be remedied by connecting up all soviet industries with simple computers and telephone lines. His massively ambitious plan was calledMaterial stocks, manpower, budgets, plan targets, all could be communicated between the producers, and^^^ The BESM1 an early Soviet “super” computer around the mid 50s, capable of 10000 operations per second and the kind proposed to be used for factory level production planning as part of the larger network ^^^It would have been crude by today's standards and dealt with the rudimentary, in-kind details of product inputs and outputs (nuts, bolts, widgets, staff, etc.),Compared to the existing system ofMoscow would connect to as many as 200 mid-level computer centres in prominent cities, which would in turn link to as many as 20,000 computer terminals distributed across key production sites in the national economy.Ultimately, as the system was bedded in, all citizens of the Soviet union would be able to access this system and traditional Roubles would be able to be replaced with essentially^^^ A rough map of OGASs proposed command centres ^^^These two attributes actually were actually sources of its undoing……The Soviet state consisted of people firmly entrenched in their positions of power, with something of a rivalry between Gosplan and the other ministries. OGAS would have not only handed greater power to Gosplan itself, but also would have become a far too distributed entity than the Politburo were comfortable with.It also would have been hugely expensive. Cost estimates were said to be the equivalent of the H bomb project and Space program combined, if not more.20 billion rubles were initially proposed and it would have required 300,000 operators be trained to install and use it over 30 years. It was to be a long term super project to locomotive the USSR into the bright economic future.Lets not forget that the USSR defined itself by its competition with the USA,Glushkov’s meeting at the Kremlin in 1970 with the then General Secretary and Premier, Breshnev and Kosygin, to propose his plan, did not go well.It is said that the Ministry of Finance had had words in Kosygin's ear prior to the meeting.Upon Glushkovs arrival he found Brezhnev and Kosygin's seats at the table unoccupied.His two potential main supporters absent, the Project was not approved save for a hollowed out version that saw OGAS’s sophisticated command control system being used for switching the lights on and off in chicken hatcheries.The enormous body of work in cybernetics developed by Glushkov, and his predecessors, remained and he continued his endeavors somewhat embittered, away from the eyes of the Authorities.Today an interconnected, cybernetic world facilitates market relations and is a tool of capitalism, not socialism. But ironically it enables human beings to cooperate in far more socialistic ways than the Soviet Politburo, so-called vanguard of the workers, ever allowed.The USSR stumbled on, leaving its best ideas in the dust of its collapse….","23,887 followers",Robin Daverman,4K,2.3K,40.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-will-the-emergence-of-websites-and-technologies-like-Wix-Bubble-and-AI-affect-jobs-for-future-programmers

Not the kind of person you need to explain ropes of a new technology.Soviet scientists offered to change the currents of the rivers in Siberia from north to south to ameliorate southern steppes and to drill a hole through the Earth to the antipodes, among other things, and also banned the science of genetics.American historian Simon Ings wrote, “Soviet science was at once the glory and the laughingstock of the intellectual world.”The Arctic in particular received a lot of attention from radical Soviet scientists who believed that there lay the key to man-made climate change (they erred on timeline and the method).Elon Musk would approve of this proposed bridge across the Bering Strait with two levels of rail tracks for super-fast trains to connect nowhere with nowhere.Block the Bering Strait that connects Alaska with Siberia with a dam to stop the discharge of warm waters from the Pacific Ocean to the Arctic, and bring English weather to the eastern coast of Chukotka. The length of the Bering Strait is 86 kilometers. For the purpose, cyclopean pumps would be built to pump water using nuclear energy through the dam.Soviet architect Kazimir Luchesky drew a plan for Beringov, a unique, one-of-a-kind Transcontinental Highway City. A cozy place with low-rises arranged in steps, to be visible from afar. He envisioned travelators - moving sidewalks, and electric cars.Evgeny Pastors, an enthusiast from Latvia, proposed sending 25 ships with “suitable power” to the Arctic to push all the ice into the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, where it would melt. To speed up the process, Pastors came up with the idea of attaching sails made of tarpaulin to the ice floes to move them south with the fair wind.After the end of Great Patriotic War, Engineer Savinov suggested detonating a few dozen nukes across the Arctic Ocean to clear an ice-free passage for year round navigation.Soviet climate scientist Mikhail Budyko proposed to destroy the Arctic ice with soot, which should have strengthened absorbing properties. The ice would melt faster from solar heat and radiation. According to Budyko’s calculations the process would be irreversible.Additionally, special algae would be grown on a monomolecular film so that the water does not cool during evaporation.Dreamers push boundaries and eventually change the world.
