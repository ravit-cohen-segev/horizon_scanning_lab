I know for a fact that they all are desperate to hire top notch software developers.This is the golden age for developers. Companies run after great developers and the kind of opportunities that Github and other tools offer in terms of showcasing your talent never existed in the past.However, you cannot just “know” C++/Python. You have to live it. It has to be something you think in the shower, while having dinner, while you drive and while you shop. Coding is an art and great artists get consumed in their art.I was recently hiring someone for a senior development position and was surprised to find out that he was not as interested in coding everyday. Only those folks who consider coding as a super awesome thing to do and something that is not just a train to get you somewhere - but is the destination - succeed in hard core development. Rest go on to become managers or worse.And coding is not mere copying a piece of code from Stackoverflow and building a sample app. Those stuff are akin to building small lego structures from a picture manual. Working in a large company is like building a skyscraper where you have to make additions without bringing down the structure.To build these large structures, you need to understand common algorithms and some of the common patterns. You need to understand which problems are tractable [at least in polynomial time] and which cannot be easily tackled without some optimization procedures.Most importantly, you need to be building all the time. I don’t consider myself to be a great developer now, but I was coding random procedures and subroutines from the time I was 12 and coding that way for 10 years until I was hired at Microsoft HQ to build Windows. During my college I spent 6–7 hours coding everyday.My peers at these top companies also were coding for many years with passion. That is the one trait that I believe differentiates the folks who succeed in these companies versus those who don’t.Sure, books on coding interviews can give a leg up, but nothing can beat solid coding all the time you have available. You should love coding so much that you might be building some procedures or simple algorithms even while waiting at a restaurant. That zeal and passion for coding makes the 10x developers that companies so eagerly seek.If you really want to be a developer plan on spending 7–8 hours coding every single day before getting hired, after you get hired. You will be building projects ranging from silly to something super cool. And you will go far beyond just tinkering with sample code and snippets available on the Internet.If you have not built any such complex project, you might still get hired in some company by random chance. But, you might find yourself in a job you don’t like and overshadowed by peers who have built those. If you don’t build coding projects before getting hired, you need to seriously ask yourself whether you are indeed a developer and want to make a career out of it.If you are building code - not because someone asked you to do so, not to impress someone and not because someone paying for - but just because you can and because you find happiness in it, you can succeed as a developer. And same is true in any complex art - painting, acting, physics research or medicine.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,10.7K,5.6K,427M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Are-questions-related-to-technologies-like-Java-Python-HTML-CSS-C++-etc-asked-in-interviews-for-top-companies-like-Google-Oracle-Microsoft-etc-at-IITs

We made sure they’re good programmers in the language they already know, they’re solid software engineers, and they evaluated well in interviews.It’s taking some time for them to adapt their knowledge of C++, C, or Java to C#. They are productive within a month or two, and fully adjusted in less than a year. That’s a pretty good return on investment.Don’t worry about choosing between C++ or Java to get a job at the Googles, Microsofts, and Facebooks of the world.

Do you want to do this on easily obtainable hardware - or does your concept require a new kind of CPU and hardware?If your goal is ""How are bootable 'Live CD's"" (or ""OS on a thumbdrive"") made, then look into how this has been done for some open source OSes like Linux, FreeBSD, FreeDOS, etc.",92 followers,Falo Tewed,689,105,442.1K,2016,https://www.quora.com/Are-questions-related-to-technologies-like-Java-Python-HTML-CSS-C++-etc-asked-in-interviews-for-top-companies-like-Google-Oracle-Microsoft-etc-at-IITs
24,"Operating systems aren't necessarily such big projects. My first big software project was to develop an embedded system but first I had to write a multi-tasking operating system for it. It took a couple of weeks. When you are in control of the hardware and the software that is to be run on it, writing an operating system is academic.But if you plan on writing an operating system that supports all manners of software and all kinds of hardware and the many requests of users, you need a big crew and a lot of expertise.You have to implement interfaces that support the huge variety of hardware capaOperating systems aren't necessarily such big projects. My first big software project was to develop an embedded system but first I had to write a multi-tasking operating system for it. It took a couple of weeks. When you are in control of the hardware and the software that is to be run on it, writing an operating system is academic.But if you plan on writing an operating system that supports all manners of software and all kinds of hardware and the many requests of users, you need a big crew and a lot of expertise.You have to implement interfaces that support the huge variety of hardware capabilities for disks, graphics, networking, and so on, as well as software that emulates all of those capabilities so that you can also support very minimal hardware. And you must do so while taking care to deal with security, performance, and interoperability.You have to develop APIs galore for the zillions of configurable capabilities that software may make use of. For instance, if a program wants to use a certain network protocol that another program may also want to use, then you have to implement that protocol in the OS, make it configurable, and expose APIs that all such software can make use of.And users must be able to automate tasks, configure all settings, and so forth; so you have to provide languages, environments, and many software tools. Users will want to do certain things like text editing and networking without installing additional apps, so you must implement those capabilities.And in order to create a popular OS, you have to design a high performance file system, mountable auxiliary file systems, support a variety of interfaces and protocols, and on and on.And, since hardware is ever-changing, new software is released constantly, and users demand additional functionality, you will always be overwhelmed with development tasks.Good luck.",306 followers,Kirsten Bañuelos,574,221,2.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Are-questions-related-to-technologies-like-Java-Python-HTML-CSS-C++-etc-asked-in-interviews-for-top-companies-like-Google-Oracle-Microsoft-etc-at-IITs

Students are exposed to interdisciplinary problems and encouraged to develop leadership skills.Automobile EngineeringThe Department of Automobile Engineering at MIT was established in the year 1949, with under-graduate Programme in Automobile Engineering for Science graduates (BSc). Subsequently, on the formation of Anna University in 1978, MIT has become one of the constituent institutions of the University and hence, the Department has also become a department of Anna University. The postgraduate Programme was started in 1978. This is the only pioneering Institute which offers both UG and PG Programmes in Automobile Engineering in the whole of India, besides offering MS (by research) and Ph.D. Programmes. Since 1996 4 year B.Tech undergraduate programme for higher secondary education is being offered.Production TechnologyThe mission of our department is to develop technically competent, socially committed and disciplined manufacturing engineers with creative ability...",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,1.5K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Are-questions-related-to-technologies-like-Java-Python-HTML-CSS-C++-etc-asked-in-interviews-for-top-companies-like-Google-Oracle-Microsoft-etc-at-IITs
