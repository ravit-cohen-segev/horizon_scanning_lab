0,Would now be a good idea for Tesla to engage in a buyout of VW using its stock or should Elon Musk just keep on building Gigafactories and improving Tesla's battery technology till it is producing ten million cars a year?Let’s just say that Tesla could simply “buy” VW for its current capitalization$85 BillionWhat would Elon Musk get for all that money?A Dealer network - he does NOT want one of those!!A number of obsolete Car DesignsA number of factories set up to produce those obsolete car designsIMHO he would be much better building factories to make modern electric cars,196 followers,Chang Liu,3.1K,7.1K,23.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Would-now-be-a-good-idea-for-Tesla-to-engage-in-a-buyout-of-VW-using-its-stock-or-should-Elon-Musk-just-keep-on-building-Gigafactories-and-improving-Teslas-battery-technology-till-it-is-producing-ten-million-cars-a
1,Musk would not be that dumb. He has no need for all the deadweight of the old technology at VW. Or the old factories.He has determined that the best way forward is with a clean slate where things can get done in new and hopefully better. With no deadweight from the old ways.Besides his risk would go way up from all money he would need to borrow to take over such a huge company. Chances are such an attempt would break him.I think he prefers to be seen as an innovator who brings new ideas to life. Not as an industrialist who would pursue bigness for the sake of being large.Now he is the biggestMusk would not be that dumb. He has no need for all the deadweight of the old technology at VW.

2,"Better for Tesla to do what it’s doing: plowing its revenues into factory building. They have the best factory designs in the industry and are making improvements in that all the time.Tesla buys out a company, not to siphon off its revenues, but to acquire that company’s technology. VW offers nothing important to Tesla in that regard.",12 followers,Johnny Le,601,1.5K,4.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Would-now-be-a-good-idea-for-Tesla-to-engage-in-a-buyout-of-VW-using-its-stock-or-should-Elon-Musk-just-keep-on-building-Gigafactories-and-improving-Teslas-battery-technology-till-it-is-producing-ten-million-cars-a

Space travel does need a Rocket Scientist (engineer). Lots of themAnd for one of your premises:I was starting aeronautical engineering studies at MIT in 1969, just after the first Moon landing.  And No, none of us believed that we would have a Moon or Mars colony in 2014 or anything neat that.There is some similarity to the development of permanent bases at the South Pole.  During the 1910's everyone was fascinated with reaching the South Pole.   Once they did, then it took over 50 years before anyone built a permanent base there (scientific research), and it is Much easier to get the South Pole than it is to the Moon.Indeed there is an X-Prize to put a rover on the Moon, by the end of 2015, and no one is even close (private ventures only).However, good luck with your ideas and concepts and keep thinking out of the box.All the best.",1 follower,Nathan Resnick,32.7K,219,4.2M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Would-now-be-a-good-idea-for-Tesla-to-engage-in-a-buyout-of-VW-using-its-stock-or-should-Elon-Musk-just-keep-on-building-Gigafactories-and-improving-Teslas-battery-technology-till-it-is-producing-ten-million-cars-a
5,The original moon shot was treated as a battle in the Cold War and given as much money as it took to win.

6,"I started my first company when I was 19.I literally started with a Google search, how to start a company.I had the idea to create the first leather watch strap without holes.It’d work like a zip-tie and allow for twice as many sizing options.All I had was this idea.Most people would stop there.I didn’t.Instead my first step was to get a sample made.I used to live in China and speak Mandarin so that’s what I did.I found a factory which could produce this product.At the time, I didn’t really know what I was doing.So I contacted Andy Laats, the founder of Nixon watches.

They’re a $400 million dollar watch company.I thought this meeting would give me all the answers.It took me six months to land this meeting.When we met, I felt like a idiot.Looking back on it, I was asking him the most basic questions about ecommerce.I really had no clue what I was doing.He probably left thinking my company would remain an idea.(We met before I had my first sample).Flash forward a year and my company was doing just over six figures in sales.I then heard of a talk Andy was giving.I went to the talk and stayed after, eager to catch up with him.As I approached, he said, man you look familiar!He was stoked that I had actually turned my idea into my own business.Andy gets requests to meet with hundreds of entrepreneurs a year. Most don’t go forward with the next steps of starting a company.Most first time entrepreneurs get caught up and don’t actually grow.They expect a mentor or coach to do the work for them.First time entrepreneurs need to know that there isn’t a magic box or person with all the answers.Your path to success will be different than someone else’s.Finding your own way is part of the journey.Though having a great mentor can help, you can’t expect them to do the work for you.The watch strap I invented!",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,1.6K,996,156M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Would-now-be-a-good-idea-for-Tesla-to-engage-in-a-buyout-of-VW-using-its-stock-or-should-Elon-Musk-just-keep-on-building-Gigafactories-and-improving-Teslas-battery-technology-till-it-is-producing-ten-million-cars-a
