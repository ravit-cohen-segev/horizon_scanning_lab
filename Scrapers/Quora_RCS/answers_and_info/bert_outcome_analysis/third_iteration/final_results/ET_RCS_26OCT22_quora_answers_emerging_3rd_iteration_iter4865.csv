If you ask me to provide book information, I can provide it to you through other channels. )1. army.As early as the outbreak of World War II, Soviet tanks had a leading edge.In operation Barbarosa, T-34 was superior to German tanks III and IV. Its pioneering use of tilt armor, diesel engine and suspension system not only enhances the tank's protection ability and produces ""bounce effect"", but also is not easy to ignite when hit (the internal combustion engine of the ""tiger"" tank is easy to burn), and the terrain adaptability is more excellent. At the same time, the coil spring suspension system also enhances its terrain passing rate.General Gudrian, the ""father of armor"" of Germany, once commented on T34 as follows: “countless T-34 tanks rushed to the front line and severely damaged the German tank soldiers. Before meeting the T-34 tank, German tank was our pride. Now, the situation is reversed. The situation has changed so fast that we can believe that the early German victory will soon be over.”T34 has revolutionary significance, which affects the development direction of the world tank.The postwar T54 and its improved models are undoubtedly revolutionary. It is equipped with a powerful V-54 12 cylinder water-cooled diesel engine, with a power of 520 horsepower, its maximum driving speed reaches 50km/h, and has a super long range of 400 km.The 100 mm rifles were powerful enough to defeat all the tanks in the west at that time. It is the first time to use infrared night vision instrument, install nuclear biological chemical weapon protection system, use fire-fighting device and smoke bomb for the first time, and consider the prospective development direction of wading ability in the design. The final output of 37000 vehicles is enough to shake the land of Europe. During the Hungarian incident in 1954, the British were shocked when they first came into contact with the T54 tank at the embassy. They used the technology of imitation to design the ""chieftain"" tank.Later, T62 tank was equipped with liner gun for the first time. The 125mm tank gun of T72 tank, the first use of autoloader and gun launched missile, greatly stimulated the West. For this reason, the United States developed M1 main battle tank, and Germany also stepped up the development of ""leopard"" 2 main battle tank. When the time came to the 1980s, the disadvantage of the Russians appeared. With the development of electronic industry and material chemistry, Russian tanks began to lag behind the West. In the Gulf War, the complete failure of Russian tanks after encountering American tanks not only declared the end of an era,2015.T-14In the Red Square parade in 2015, T-14 tank was born. It is known as the first ""fourth generation main battle tank"" in the world.Its magical shape has attracted the attention of the West. Compared with the third generation main battle tank, its front projection area is quite small. Its new type 2a82 125mm tank gun, because it is equipped in the unmanned turret and the smoking device is cancelled, the chamber pressure of the gun is increased and its combat power is increased. The muzzle energy of the gun is 17% higher than that of the western rh120-l55.Russia has been leading the Western active defense technology, and has made greater progress in this tank.T-14 obviously attaches great importance to environmental detection and survivability. At present, millimeter wave radar (also known as centimeter wave radar) facing four sides can be identified from the turret to detect the approaching anti war vehicle weapons. In addition, omni-directional optical monitor can be seen, and 360 degree omni-directional environmental vision can be established.Equipped at the base of turret ring, the large-scale grenade is an active grenade defense system that has been studied for many years. With radar, it can automatically launch ammunition to destroy the enemy's anti war vehicle weapons, especially to counter the threat of anti war vehicle missiles popular in recent years.The two sides above the turret are equipped with the latest small rotatable projectile launchers, which can be judged to be used for launching jamming projectiles. In particular, there are quite a number of jamming projectile launchers on the left rear side of the turret, which are vertically upward. The number of jamming projectile assembly is greater than that of all previous chariots. Its new remote control weapon war is powerful with street war and urban anti-terrorism war.Using the 12 Н 360 (a-85-3a) diesel engine of chtz, the 4-stroke X-type 12 cylinder design, the normal output is 1500hp, and it can reach 2000hp when needed. When the output is 1500 HP, the life time is 2000 hours. When the output is reduced to 1200 HP, the life time can be up to 10000 hours, which is completely controlled by an intelligent computer. With 12 segment automatic transmission, the maximum speed can reach 80-90km / h (50-56mph), and the maximum travel can reach 500km. It can be said that this is a very advanced power system.The ""Amata heavy crawler system"" adopted by the company enables t-14 main battle tank, T-15 heavy infantry fighting vehicle, BM-2 rocket gun, 2s35 self-propelled gun and t-16 armored maintenance vehicle to integrate organically, realize the ability of parts exchange, equipment sharing and system construction, and exert the power of ""Amata army"". This is a very advantageous main battle tank.(of course, there is still a big gap between T14 and the West in the field of electronics, engine materials and reliability, and artillery manufacturing technology, but as the first main battle tank with the design idea of ""fourth generation integrated combat armor platform"", it deserves our praise.)俄T72坦克曾令西方为之颤抖 海湾战争为何被彻底碾压2. Navy.Russia's leading edge in this area is supercavitation technology.First of all, what is supercavitation?Supercavitation is a strange physical phenomenon. With the acceleration of moving speed of underwater objects such as torpedoes in water, the water pressure on them will decrease. Once the water pressure decreases to a certain extent, the water in contact with underwater objects will vaporize and form cavitation. These cavities will not only change the flow pattern of water, but also reduce the propelling efficiency of propeller or water jet propeller, and produce strong impact of bursting, which greatly shortens the service life of underwater objects.However, it is strange that with the further increase of the speed, when the moving speed of the underwater vehicle exceeds 50M / s, there will be ""supercavitation"" phenomenon on the surface of the navigation object, that is, the formation of water vapor bubbles at the back. The density of sea water is about 900 times that of air, and the resistance of sea water is 900 times greater than that of air, while the resistance of objects sailing in supercavitation is only 1 / 900 of that of water. If certain technical means are used to make the ""bubble"" wrap the whole navigation object to form a ""gas coat"", the object can always navigate in the supercavitation made by itself, so as to avoid the viscous resistance of water to the maximum extent and realize high-speed navigation. In addition, the phenomenon of supercavitation will not only reduce the water resistance greatly, but also will not impact the surface of underwater objects due to the bursting of bubbles.Supercavitating torpedoes began to be studied in the Soviet era. In the 1990s, Russian scientists developed storm torpedoes. This is a kind of submarine high-speed torpedo. It is a kind of ""supercavitation weapon"" successfully developed by the former Soviet Navy after more than 10 years of secret research and development. It was equipped with Russian submarine forces in 1997. Storm torpedo has a length of 8.23 meters, a diameter of 533 mm, a weight of 2600 kg, a warhead charge of 250 kg, a speed of 200 knots, a range of 15000 meters and a maximum depth of 400 meters.The torpedo body gradually becomes thicker from the head to the tail. The head is the warhead, the tail is the engine, the center of the tail is the rocket engine nozzle, and there are eight small start rockets around. The head of the storm torpedo is equipped with a cavitation generator, which is in the shape of a round or oval flat plate and tilts forward to form a ""impact angle"" to generate the lift supporting the front part of the torpedo body. Immediately behind the cavitation generator are several annular vent tubes, which inject the rocket exhaust gas into the cavitation bubble to enlarge it.After the torpedo is launched from the launch tube on the submarine, eight Rockets will start to work to accelerate the torpedo to the supercavitation speed. When sailing, the local bubbles are produced by the bubble generator first, and then the gas is injected into the local bubbles by the vent pipe to make them expand into supercavitation. Then the main rocket engine works to make the torpedo run at high speed in the water. When the storm torpedo moves in the water, the air is discharged from the head and covered by bubbles on the surface of the torpedo body, forming supercavitation. Therefore, its water resistance is very small and its speed is very high, which is much higher than that of ordinary torpedoes. A guide wire is towed at the tail of the torpedo to control the movement of the torpedo and detonate the warhead.The appearance of Russian ""storm"" supercavitating torpedo represents a revolutionary leap of underwater combat weapons, which is likely to change the way of future naval battle. With the continuous improvement and development of supercavitation technology, not only the speed of underwater weapons will change dramatically, but also it may be applied to underwater or surface vehicles, which will greatly improve the underwater or above water speed of vehicles. At that time, there may be the phenomenon that the speed of underwater vehicles is faster than that of in air hypersonic vehicles. It can be seen that supercavitation technology has broad prospects and important military value.3 air force.In May 1999, a plasma generator was installed on a ""MIG"" test machine.What is plasma stealth technology?The principle of plasma stealth technology is realized by the interaction between electromagnetic wave and plasma, in which the plasma frequency plays an important role. Plasma frequency refers to the collective oscillation frequency of plasma electrons. The magnitude of the frequency represents the speed of the plasma's reaction to the electric neutral destruction, which is an important feature of the plasma. If the plasma frequency is higher than the incident electromagnetic wave frequency, the electromagnetic wave will not enter the plasma.At this time, the plasma reflects the electromagnetic wave, and the external electromagnetic wave only enters the uniform plasma about 2mm, 86% of its energy will be reflected. However, when the frequency of plasma is less than the frequency of incident electromagnetic wave, the electromagnetic wave will not be cut off by plasma, and can enter the plasma and propagate in it. In the process of propagation, part of the energy is transmitted to the charged particles in the plasma, and is absorbed by the charged particles, while its energy gradually decreases. The higher the electron density in the plasma. The higher the oscillation frequency, the higher the collision frequency with ions and neutral particles, and the greater the absorption of radar wave. At the same time, when the radar wave propagates in the plasma, because there are a lot of neutral molecules or atoms in the plasma, there is also dielectric loss. In the process of polarization, the electric charge passes over the barrier repeatedly and consumes the energy of the electric field, such as conductance loss, relaxation polarization loss, harmonic loss and so on. In addition, the plasma ejected from the plasma generator to the outer space of the aircraft is an unbalanced plasma, which is in a non thermal dynamic equilibrium state. After a certain period of time, the collision between the ions can reach a thermodynamic equilibrium state that tends to be uniform in density and temperature.Compared with B-2, F-117, F-22 and other widely used shape and material stealth technologies in the United States, plasma stealth technology has the following unique advantages:(1) absorption frequency bandwidth, high absorption rate, good stealth effect, easy to use, long use time, and extremely cheap price;(2) there is no need to change the aerodynamic shape design of aircraft and other equipment, because there is no absorbing material and coating, dimension The cost of protection is greatly reduced.(3) experiments in Russia show that the use of plasma stealth technology will not only not affect the flight performance of the aircraft, but also reduce the flight resistance by more than 30%.Plasma stealth technology has made a lot of progress in Russia, and its research results are ahead of those in the United States. It is reported that the first and second generation plasma generators have been developed by the Russian keldesh Research Center, and the practicability of this stealth technology has been verified by experiments in ground simulation equipment, natural conditions and aircraft. Russia's keldesh research center is currently developing more effective third-generation products. It is speculated that the third generation product may use the electrostatic energy around the aircraft to reduce the radar reflection cross section of the aircraft. The latest experiments in Russia show that the third generation plasma stealth technology is applied. In the frequency range of 4-14ghz, the RCS value of MIG test aircraft can be reduced to 1% of the original value.4.Ace killer.In the state of the Union address on February 20, 2019, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a number of killer weapons to deal with the United States.I. Anti ship missile.The Russian navy is about to equip a new type of hypersonic ""zircon"" anti-ship missile. The speed of this type of ""zircon"" anti-ship missile in the test has reached an incredible Mach 8. This weapon is planned to be equipped on Russia's fifth generation husky class nuclear submarine. The technical properties of zircon are still in secret, with a range estimated at 300 to 400 km. Zircon cruise missile inherits the basic characteristics of Russian anti-ship missile ""strong penetration"". Since it is hypersonic, its basic speed is about Mach 6-8, and its penetration capability is unprecedented. All kinds of antimissile systems equipped by the United States, such as ""haigongyang"" antimissile system, dense array system and other air defense antimissile systems, have certain interception ability to the former Supersonic Missiles, but they are not enough to intercept the ultra-high sonic missiles. (imagine that when a Russian missile is launched, a U.S. warship 400 kilometers away will be attacked in 151 seconds, and no trace of it will be found on the radar screen.)II. In rs-28 salmatSalmat.Russian: РС - 28 Сармат; NATO Code: Satan 2), is a Russian liquid fuel, MIRV equipped, ultra heavy thermonuclear equipment intercontinental ballistic missile developed by the makyev rocket design agency in 2009, aiming to replace the previous r-36m ballistic missile.Its large payload will allow up to 10 heavy warheads or 15 lighter or up to 24 hypersonic gliders, yu-71, or warheads and a large number of combinations of measures designed to defeat anti missile systems; it is hailed by the Russian military as the U.S. response to rapid global strikes. General Sergei karakayev, commander of Russia's strategic rocket force, said in an interview with the Red Star newspaper on the 15th that many performance parameters of Russia's new salmat intercontinental have been greatly improved. The fifth generation heavy intercontinental ballistic missile ""salmat"" weighs more than 200 tons, with a range of 17000 kilometers.The warhead adopts advanced penetration technology, which is said to break through all existing anti missile systems and accurately attack any target on the earth. The first ""salmat"" missiles are planned to be put into use in 2021, replacing the ""Satan"" ICBM developed in the Soviet era.III. Poseidon global submersible.In April 2019, Russia 09852 ""bergerod"" nuclear powered submarine was launched in North devonsk, Russia. This submarine will be the first one to carry the ""Poseidon"" unmanned submarine. Poseidon can sail autonomously for an indefinite period of time. Its underwater speed is about 200 kilometers per hour, and no torpedo can catch up with it. The diving depth of this equipment has not been disclosed. However, it is reported that Russia has tested the strength of the body of the submarine, which can dive to a depth of 14 kilometers. As a result, Poseidon is likely to have no depth limit. This kind of AUV can be used in real deep water research. Poseidon is also equipped with the latest generation of sonar to ensure underwater environment and seabed terrain can be seen in 3D mode, and high-resolution cameras can be installed.5.Russian secret weapons exposed after the accident.IAccording to the statement of the former Russian Ministry of defense, an explosion occurred at a naval launch site in arhangersk state, Russia, resulting in two deaths and six injuries. The latest news is that five people have died and three people are still in treatment.Russian officials said the explosion occurred while testing a liquid missile engine, noting in particular that it did not cause nuclear pollution. But just after the explosion, Russian media reported that the local radiation once peaked, several times higher than the natural background radiation. Although this radiation level will not cause great harm, the rescue team is still dressed in full clothes and radiation proof clothes, which exacerbated people's concerns about nuclear leakage.Therefore, Western critics believe that the missile that exploded is likely to be the nuclear powered cruise missile that Russia is developing - ""petrel"".In March 2018, Russian officials officially disclosed the existence of ""petrel"" nuclear powered cruise missile. In July 2018, Russian officials released the production and test video of ""petrel"" cruise missile. The missile is numbered 9m730, and NATO named it sc-x-9 ""Tiandiao"".According to the video, ""petrel"" cruise missile is equipped with ramjet and rocket booster, similar to the conventional ramjet missile. The rocket booster may use liquid fuel, ignite when the missile is just launched, and give the cruise missile a higher initial speed to achieve the starting speed of the ramjet.The biggest feature of the missile is the unprecedented use of nuclear power.This makes ""petrel"" performance beyond common sense. ""Petrel"" cruise missile not only has fast speed and infinite range, but also has unpredictable flight path, which has strong penetration ability. With fuel that doesn't need to be spared, ""petrel"" missiles can set their course at will to avoid all kinds of defense systems.In theory, if the ""petrel"" cruise missile flies at three times the speed of sound, it will take seven or eight hours to launch from the Arctic Ocean and attack New York 10000 kilometers away. In this process, the flight route of ""petrel"" can be set to pass through any sea area or land at will, almost without considering the geographical interference factors.It can be said that the ""petrel"" nuclear cruise missile is a nightmare for any missile defense system. Because the range abnormal ""petrel"" can attack from any direction. But unfortunately, ""petrel"" missile as Russia's only open nuclear power missile, or even the world's first nuclear power missile, must be strictly tested in the country. In the real-time test of the missile, even if it does not carry a warhead, it has to carry radioactive materials to meet the needs of the engine.Therefore, the test of this kind of missile is extremely dangerous. Even if the test is successful, the missile engine carrying nuclear material will fall to the ground or sea. If the test fails, the harm is even more unpredictable.t can be said that it is a very dangerous ""killer weapon"" for all people.II. Mysterious submarine accident, science fiction submersible.In July 2019, a major military accident occurred in Russia. A fire broke out at the bottom of the sea on a ""scientific deep-sea submersible"", killing 14 soldiers on board. The 14 soldiers mentioned in the news, in order to protect the experts working at the time of the fire, took the initiative to close the fire sealed cabin, and then put out the fire with all their strength. Unfortunately, they died because of inhalation of toxic substances. The 14 people who died were not sailors. Among them, there are 7 naval colonels (2 of them are Russian heroes), 3 naval lieutenant colonel, 2 naval major, 1 naval captain and 1 lieutenant colonel and medical officer. Among them, the Russian hero, also known as Venus. In this accident, two heroes of this level were sacrificed to protect the experts at work, so the importance of this task is beyond our imagination.After the accident, Putin immediately cancelled the original plan to meet with the defense minister. Vice President burns also canceled his trip to New Hampshire and returned to the white house without giving a specific reason. This really shows that this incident is not an ordinary accident. There are rumors all around. Maybe this incident has touched the core secrets of Russia. Later more details were revealed. The wrecked submarine was 1083.1, the boat was as-12, and the boat was named losharik. It was a new concept special nuclear powered deep-sea submersible, which could be carried by the new service nuclear submarine ""bergorod"". Russian media also specifically disclosed the technical details of the nuclear submarine: the boat is 70 meters long, with a displacement of 2000 tons and 25 people. It is said that the underwater speed is 30 knots, the maximum depth of the submarine is 3000 meters, and its self-sustaining capacity can reach several months. According to other information, the maximum submergence of the submarine can reach 6000 meters, which is very amazing! (the ship uses a 5-megawatt nuclear reactor. Russian media say that the maximum speed can reach 30 knots, but some people estimate that it is only about 12 knots (if the reactor is only 5 megawatts, it is unlikely to reach 30 knots). The displacement of the 1083.1 Mini nuclear submarine is up to 2000 tons, which is comparable to the normal submarine. However, this tonnage is very small for nuclear submarines. At present, the world's smallest attack nuclear submarine is France's ""Ruby"" class, with an underwater displacement of 2700 tons, a reactor power of 48 megawatts and a maximum underwater speed of 25 knots. Because it is very difficult to miniaturize the nuclear reactor, it is very difficult to miniaturize the nuclear submarine. All of these reflect the leading advantages of relevant technologies in Russia.The United States still has the most powerful military force and scientific research capability in the world. However, under the strategic threat of the United States, each opponent has developed its own superior weapons. Although Russia's economy is lonely, it still inherits the military foundation of the Soviet Union, has strong scientific research capability and develops a variety of deterrence weapons. I believe there are still many killers in the fog.These advanced weapons of Russia undoubtedly show the determination of the Russians. When NATO under the leadership of the United States continues to expand eastward and threatens the ""living space"" of the Russians, Russia has a strong counter attack force. This strategic deterrent force will make the West dare not bear the risk of war.My English is not very good, especially for the answers that need to query a lot of professional materials, I am very worried about the accuracy of term translation.

This was seen from Norway, there are numerous videos of it on internet. And pictures.A little while later Russia came out and said that this was a failed Bulava Missile test. Which is a next-generation ballistic missile, purportedly.However, as you can see from the video, this is either:a) Not a traditional missile which does something traditionalThe same missiles were then seen in successful tests - launched from somewhere near (probably Arhangelsk, NW Russia) to a target in apparently central asia (Kazakhstan, i remember).Except the missiles were observable from middle east:From the same test streak Russia had in those few months - look how crazy it sent people on internet - these are combined footage from many different places around the world:Finalization of these tests have changed the tone of political talk in international politics. For what reason, hard to detect. But the chances are high that these missiles can probably evade any kind of existing 'missile shield' setups. Or, even further, these weapons are not conventional missiles at all...............Then comes something even more unconventional than the above - What's below are currently in rumor status, however there are far too many rumors and testimonies from different sources, and too many incidents which can be explained by them. They all involve Electromagnetic Warfare :First,http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/10/21/russia-winning-the-electronic-war/It’s just one part of a sophisticated Russian electronic warfare (EW) effort in Ukraine that has proved a sobering experience for the U.S. Army. Faced with how the newly modernized Russian armyBasically commander of nato forces in Europe, Ben Hodges recently complained about the extensive reach and effectiveness of Russian EM warfare technology, especially in regard to its capability of shutting down enemy systems. And extremely hawkish, neocon Foreignpolicy com is screaming about it.Now we come to the funny stuffWhat frightened the USS Donald Cook so much in the Black Sea?In this reported incident, a Russian Su-24 flanker uses an EM (electromagnetic) Warfare device attached to a pod under it, disables US Donald Cook's electronic systems (Radar, ECM, ECCM, all gone) and flies over it from very short altitude 11-12 times.The incident happened, Pentagon itself declared that a Russian jet did 12 passes over ~120 m altitude over the ship, and ignored all kinds of warnings. There is nothing contestable about that.What is curious is the EM angle given to the incident by numerous independent outlets. When respectable ones like Voltairenet also narrated the same story, US Navy released a video regarding the incident, in which a Russian jet is seen passing just once, filmed by some people from a deck on the US navy ship - not too descriptive or illuminating.After the incident the ship leaves vicinity of Russia post haste.One could easily take this as a 'conspiracy theory', despite a noticeable number of respectable outlets reporting them. And rather easily too.However;There were reports in major Turkish discussion forums about a number of cases in which Turkish aircraft which were flying near Syria were illuminated with radar for 2 to 3 minutes - this means that a radar locked on them, and tracked them for 2 to 3 minutes. Normally combat aircraft don't turn on their radars unless necessary or in combat situation, since this not only gives out their position, but also gives out important information regarding the nature of the aircraft/equipment and also makes them trackable.The catch here is that Turkish aircraft were not able to detect the place and source of the radar beam which was tracking them. They should have been able to - its a given. But they weren't. Which is extremely unusual. These fighters are F-16s or modernized F-4s with modern electronic equipment, and they should have been able to detect the source of the radar beam, since the moment you turn on an active radar beam you expose your location and become trackable.Next morning this caused very strong language being used by Turkish government, which ended up in meetings with Russian ambassador in Ankara, after which wordage of cooperation and understanding were issued to the press.This could easily be discarded as a rumor. However, the cases keep piling up, and we come to a very interesting and rather hot case:Fort Russ remembers... XYZ: What would happen if the Russian army really invaded UkraineRemember the quote from Foreignpolicy regarding 'sobering experience of usa in ukraine' and the ability of Russia in shutting down enemy systems.The above article basically says that the Russian backed elements in eastern ukraine used these brigade and platoon level weapons to totally black out all kinds of electronic systems, communications, ECM and ECCM systems of Ukrainian army, their potential US advisers, and the private mercenaries which Ukrainian government contracted. To the extent that they werent even able to realize that they were being surrounded in the famous Debaltsevo cauldron, which ended up a massive number of Ukrainian units having to surrender and leave their equipment behind.Then happened the Minsk truce............As a sidenote, Fort Russ is an indigenous blog which writes about the situation in eastern ukraine / donbass / lugansk, and the civil war which goes on there in between Donbass militia and the central ukrainian government.The blog is suspiciously well informed about quite detailed events, and has a history of giving up to date info from events as they happen, and even reporting stuff that are about to happen.............Now, EM warfare is not new. Measures and countermeasures exist for everything since a long time.But, in the end, these devices work through emitting electromagnetic waves - actually all modern equipment do - an ECM system an ECCM system, a jammer, a radar, a telecommunications system, a radio, a battlefield awareness device, whatever you can imagine.EM wave sending and reception is a two way street. In the end, its an I/O (input/output) affair, and there is an interface/port through which it sends and receives EM waves into the world.So any device which receives EM waves is vulnerable to anything that can mess with it by sending the receiver any sort of EM wave.It was inevitable that eventually someone would come up with some EM warfare setup which would totally invalidate all kinds of electronic devices in a battlefield. Actually, modern weapons have never been used in any war in between two major powers, so the concept of extreme 'electronicification' of the battlefield and extreme reliance on devices which communicate through radio waves was kaput from the start - imagine a battlefield which is filled with EM waves from aircraft radars, their ECM, ECCM systems, IFFs, ground based radars, artillery spotters, drones, guided missiles, tanks, AFVs, any device that is carried in a platoon, the radios of the soldiers themselves - a freaking EM mess. Such a war would be a mess from the start in between two major powers, and the devices and military outfits using those devices could easily be rendered useless solely through the EM mess that is going on in the battlefield itself.So the concept of totally blocking an enemy's electronic devices and rendering them useless is not far fetched, and Russia may have done just that.Actually, seeing how NATO is yelling and screaming about it and saying that Russians are far too advanced in EM warfare, its not even likely - it seems its what has happened.Which means that all the advanced multi million dollar vehicles, devices and weapons developed in the past two decades are null and void. Huge.There. I hope this was more colorful and interesting than any conventional answer you could expect...","20,087 followers",Ben Kolber,27.6K,324,21.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-Russian-military-technology-that-is-superior-to-its-US-equivalent

At 48 tons, it is 30% lighter than the M1 Abrams. The T-90 has remote controlled machine guns, unlike the M1 Abrams which requires the operator to be exposed. The T-90 could apparently shoot guided missiles through its turret, so it could defend against helicopters; the Abrams cannot. The T-90 uses explosive reactive armour (ERA) that was pioneered on the T-80, defending the tank by exploding a bomb in front of an incoming projectile or missile to deflect and bleed out its kinetic energy; the Abrams only recent got this technology.The T-90 also has an array of countermeasures to fool infrared anti-tank missiles, guiding them away from itself (the ""glowing eyes"").The T-90 probably cannot win against the M1 Abrams 1v1, but it costs less to produce and support.

From what I’ve seen (and found) on the battlefield, most of Russia’s newer stuff (post-Soviet era) is of a very low quality. While most Ukrainian combat soldiers are equipped with decent body armor (level IV plates and ballistic helmets), almost no Russian infantryman is equally well equipped. This might be one of the reasons why their casualty rates are through the roof (another one is their completely obsolete medical care system).To briefly summarize it: the equipment of the Russian Army certainly could be better but it's good enough to fight a war with. Their abysmal performance certainly has other reasons (e.g. bad leadership, insufficient training, wrong tactics, weak logistics, low morale, etc.).If you want to help me support Ukrainian volunteers (civilian and military, foreigners and locals), please use the contact email in my profile description.","16,461 followers",Chris Everett,855,11K,79M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-Russian-military-technology-that-is-superior-to-its-US-equivalent

The passive radar system is able to classify a target as a missile or an aircraft. Then it can transmit the target's coordinates to a nearby air defense system or to the command post.

AN-94 AbakanThe key improvement of the AN-94 over the AK-74 is the introduction of the 2-rounds burst mode, added to the standard single shots andfull auto mode. The two rounds bursts are fired at very high rate of fire, and a trained shooter can make a single hole in the target at 100 meters in this mode.This allows for significant increase in lethality, stopping power and body armour penetration over the single shot mode, with the same ""singles hot"" accuracy. The full auto mode of AN-94 consists of the two stages -first two rounds are fired in the ""high rate"" fire, and the remainin grounds are fired in low rate of fire, until the trigger is released or the magazine is emptied. In the single shots or the full auto mode, there's no significant advantages over the AK-74. At this point, one can ask ""is all this complication of the AN-94 mechanism worth the achieved results""? Frommy point of view, there's no simple answer. The trained professional warrior can use the 2-rounds burst capability of AN-94 to the great degree of success, but prior to this, a lot of time and resources should be spent to train this professional soldier to use AN-94 effectively",21 followers,Dan Rosenthal,1.4K,1.7K,16.4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-Russian-military-technology-that-is-superior-to-its-US-equivalent

The Tor and Buk are both point defense systems that can be tethered to the S-400 and integrated with it. They are designed primarily to defend military installations against cruise missiles and other munitions. There are no comparable systems in the West.Russia’s Iskander missile is by far the most advanced tactical, ballistic missile on the planet. It is capable of striking targets, including moving targets, to within 5 m despite the fact that the missile travels at mach 7 and maneuvers violently in flight to throw off air defenses. Ground-launched variants of the Iskander are believed to have a range of 1000 km, over 3x as much as the US’s equivalent: the ATACMS missile It is also the basis for the Kinzhal air-launched hypersonic missile.Russia is also the first country to deploy an air-breathing, hypersonic cruise missile: the Zircon. The missile is capable of reaching speeds of mach 9, with a range of 1000 km. Although the Zircon has already entered service with the Russian armed forces, the US estimates that it will be about a decade before they deploy a similar missile.Lastly, Russia is about 2 decades ahead of the US in ICBMs. Russia has a mixed fleet of lighter, solid-fuel, road-mobile ICBMs and heavier, liquid-fuel, silo-based ICBMs. Road mobile ICBMs like the RS-24 Yars are far more useful in the event of a nuclear deterrent, because their mobility makes them far more difficult to target than silo-based ICBMs. The Yars can carry up to 6 warheads. However, it’s payload is not just limited to nuclear warheads. It can also carry EMP warheads and precision-guided, conventional warheads, which are designed to replace tactical nuclear weapons for many applications.The SS-18 Satan is the backbone of Russia’s silo-based rocket forces. It’s liquid-fuel design allows it to be far larger and carry a far heavier payload than a solid-fuel rocket. As such, it can carry more warheads. While it is limited to carrying 10 nuclear warheads by treaty, it can carry up to 38 precision-guided, conventional warheads, enough to decimate any air or naval base, anywhere on the planet without going nuclear.Russia is also ahead of the US in unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) technology. Vladimir Putin recently unveiled the Status 6 or Kanyon, a nuclear-powered UUV, capable of carrying a massive nuclear warhead, designed to incinerate coastal cities in the event of a nuclear war.Russia also recently unveiled the Burevestnik, a nuclear-powered cruise missile. The missile is believed to use a liquid flouride thorium reactor (LFTR), which has significant potential for civilian energy production applications. Although more difficult to engineer, LFTR reactors have less potential for a meltdown and could produce energy far more cheaply than conventional nuclear power. The Burevestnik is believed to have virtually unlimited range by virtue of its power plant.","43,425 followers",Misha Firer,5.1K,1.3K,133.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-Russian-military-technology-that-is-superior-to-its-US-equivalent

The Iskander-M has a range of 400km, can carry a 700kg warhead of several varieties, and has a circular error probability of around five meters. This makes it deadly to airfields, logistics points, and other stationary infrastructure along a broad front of conflict.  Especially given the irregular and broken nature of Russia’s border with NATO, the Iskander gives the Russian military the opportunity to threaten targets deep in Europe.The Iskander can put pressure on NATO missile defenses, but also on NATO air forces.  Jets operating from forward bases will immediately come under threat of attack, or at least immobilization. If positioned in Kaliningrad, Iskander launchers could threaten a wide array of military and political targets across NATO.Consequently, we can expect that NATO would target mobile Iskander launchers in the first stage of any conflict. As the history of tracking and destroying mobile missile launchers has been sketchy at best, however, NATO would have to be wary of SRBM attacks deep into the war. And successful attacks against the Iskander launchers depend on the achievement of air superiority over the theater of operations.2. Su--27 Flanker Family  -Designed as the USSR’s answer to the F-15, the first Flankers entered service in 1985, but production troubles kept their numbers low until the early 1990s. At that point, the collapse of the Soviet Union significantly reduced the overall production run. The aircraft of the Flanker family combine size, range, speed, and wicked maneuverability into a single deadly platform.  With gaunt, unforgiving lines, the Flanker is not a beautiful plane, but its appearance does suggest danger.Designed as the USSR’s answer to the F-15, the first Flankers entered service in 1985, but production troubles kept their numbers low until the early 1990s.

The aircraft of the Flanker family combine size, range, speed, and wicked maneuverability into a single deadly platform.  With gaunt, unforgiving lines, the Flanker is not a beautiful plane, but its appearance does suggest danger.The Russian Air Force continues to operate several hundred Flankers in various configurations. The basic Flanker frame has proven remarkably flexible for upgrade, and has become the platform of choice for discerning fighter customers. Variants of the Flanker include the Su-30 multi-role fighter, the Su-33 carrier-based fighter, the S-34 fighter-bomber, the Su-35 air superiority fighter, and several Chinese knock-offs.3.The entire Western way of war depends on the achievement of air supremacy. NATO forces have not fought against a modern, capable air defense system in a very long time.  During that time, the cost of NATO fighter-bombers has metastasized, making the loss of a single aircraft very nearly a national fiscal catastrophe.The entire Western way of war depends on the achievement of air supremacy. NATO forces have not fought against a modern, capable air defense system in a very long time.  During that time, the cost of NATO fighter-bombers has metastasized, making the loss of a single aircraft very nearly a national fiscal catastrophe.An S-400 battery has three kinds of missiles, each intended to engage aerial targets at different ranges. The longest ranged SAM can engage at 400km, with shorter-ranged missiles compensating with enhanced capabilities for killing fast, maneuverable targets.  The S-400 can also engage ballistic missiles, although it’s unlikely that NATO would use such weapons. The sensor systems of the S-400 are thought to be extremely effective, especially as Russia can layer S-400 defense zones in nearly every conceivable theater of conflict. Positioning the S-400 at Kaliningrad could endanger NATO air operations deep into Europe.In combination with the Iskander and the Flanker, these missiles would make the job of NATO air forces in the early days of a conflict very difficult, indeed. Russian sensor systems (ground and air) exceed the capabilities of any opponent that NATO countries have fought in the last twenty-five years.  The SEAD (suppression of enemy air defense) mission against an integrated air defense network (Russia has a wide variety of shorter-range systems for point defense) would prove extremely treacherous.At least in the early days of the war, the S-400 and its associated systems could neutralize NATO airpower, undermining one of the central pillars of the Western way of war.4. Akula class submarines -NATO forces developed an extremely capable anti-submarine system during the Cold War, including aircraft, attack submarines, stationary sensors, and surface ships. The collapse of the Soviet Union dramatically reduced the Russian submarine threat, with the eventual consequence of a reduction of NATO anti-submarine warfare (ASW) capabilities. While NATO forces (and especially US forces) have continued to pursue ASW, they no longer can draw upon the resources they enjoyed during the Cold War.The best NATO subs can still track and defeat the Akulas, although the latter’s high speed makes catching them an iffy proposition. But even if NATO can sink the Russian subs, they can still wreak an enormous amount of havoc before they submerge for good. This could mean killing a carrier, or simply causing enormous, unexpected damage to critical infrastructure ashore.5. Spetsnaz -During the Cold War, both the United States and the Soviet Union conceived of special operations forces primarily in terms of support of conventional operations. Even at the time, however, the Soviets interpreted this mission more broadly than NATO.  Spetsnaz (an umbrella term that has come to encompass special forces operators under several organizational designations) were expected to undertake offensive operations concentrating on the sabotage of communications, the preparation for conventional advance, and even the wreaking of political havoc.As with all other elements of the Russian military, the special forces deteriorated in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union.  However, the Russian Army took advantage of the Chechen insurgency to reconstruct and redevelop its own commando/special forces capabilities.  It has built these units into a formidable military and political tool, capable of having an impact on all areas of warfare. This reconstruction took place parallel to the expansion of Western special forces under the aegis of the War on Terror; indeed, NATO and Russian special forces sometime undertook joint training exercises to improve effectiveness.As they now exist, Russian special forces represent a major problem for the West at all levels of escalation.  In the event of conflict, we could expect Russian special forces to operate at various stages of the conflict, as they have during the Ukraine crisis.  If war develops over a border dispute between Russia and one of the Baltics, we will undoubtedly find Russian special operators there ahead of us. In the case of general war, special forces may deploy from submarines or other vehicles to launch attacks throughout NATO’s depth.Although not a “weapon” in the technological sense, Russian special forces represent one of the most effective tools in the Russian arsenal.  They will have a major impact in any conflict with NATO, possibly even before NATO realizes the conflict has begun.Conclusion -","43,425 followers",Misha Firer,1.7K,1.3K,133.8M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-Russian-military-technology-that-is-superior-to-its-US-equivalent

I suspect they would respond by asking/telling the US to stand down while everyone tries to figure out what happened and who ordered it. I suspect the Chinese government would take a stronger stance but also no military involvement for the same reasons.Japan would likely be the most vocal of any country since the aircraft carrier would likely be hit while adjacent to Japanese waters or within 300 miles of them.

A primary consideration in the design of a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is the ability to move 30km in the flight time of an ICBM, so that it isn’t under the explosion. The top speed of a nuclear aircraft carrier is classified, but I know a person who served on one who said he’d been on it going 60 knots (!!!). He also said that the factor limiting the top speed of a carrier is the strength and rigidity of its propeller shafts.

But it’s North Korea, so that sort of comes with the territory.So, let’s assume the improbable and unarguably insane nuclear attack against a CBG is launched and succeeds, what is America’s response? First, the President calls an emergency joint session of Congress to vote out a Declaration of War. Then, the President calls up the nuclear powers in the region (Russia, China, India, and Pakistan) and informs them that he intends to use nuclear weapons in response to a first attack, that under no circumstances will they be targets of nuclear weapons, and he will probably invite high level observers (military attaches from their embassies in Washington) to witness any authorizations of nuclear release as an assurance measure.At that point the Joint Chiefs and relevant combatant commands begin building a target package. Usually capitals are avoided, because decapitation of the command authority leaves nobody to surrender, but the Kims are clearly insane and their being rendered to their constituent atoms is probably for the better, so Pyongyang is on the chopping block. Any nuclear weapons capable platforms (aircraft, silos, and TELs) plus support infrastructure and R&D facilities are going to receive a Can of Instant Sunshine. If the Joint Chiefs think it’s probable the North Koreans will use their hardened artillery sites in the mountains to gas Seoul, then each and every one in range of Seoul will receive the loving attention of a nuclear bunker buster. In all, you’re looking at between 50 and 500 weapons being used in retaliation, depending on the situation as it relates to Seoul.Fallout wouldn’t actually be that bad. Airbursts would suffice for most targets and as US nuclear weapons are over 90% efficient at fissile conversion (as opposed to roughly 15% for Fat Man and Little Boy), the vast majority of fallout is going to be the very nasty but very short lived byproducts of a thermonuclear initiation. If the HART sites are hit, that’s going to be more problematic, but frankly it’s easier to mitigate and clean up fallout than it is VX and far fewer residents of Seoul would die as a result.On the diplomatic front, there’s not a lot anybody can say to the US after they’ve been the victims of an unprovoked nuclear first strike. Everybody knows the consequences of attacking the US like that.

(No Donald, you can’t “nuke Syria” even if they’d nuke you first, you need a state actor for that, like NK.)The US Nuclear Posture review 2010 explicitly states that:The NPR reflects a commitment to strengthen deterrence against the range of 21st century threats. In particular, deterrence must be strengthened to deal with regional actors seeking nuclear weapons in violation of their treaty obligations and in defiance of the international community.You can find a nice overview of contemporary nuclear doctrines in this great document, published by some cool Russians.Of course there is deep consideration on how to formulate auch a response, for exactly the reason you state: the US would definitely want to avoid any escalation, be seen as powerful but humane, etcetera. The US might use a dozen warheads or so (maybe two?), to take down the country’s nuclear infrastructure and to disrupt the ability of it’s government, as they would clearly go for regime change. Aside from that, I guess they might seek UK support in the usage of tactical warheads on Seoul-threatening invasion forces or artillery concentrations. That would be justified in defence (or preemtion) of a devastating attack on Seoul, and potentially savinh hundreds of thousands of civillian lives.The rest of the operations (of which there will be many - that’ll be nightmare for the decade to come, as well as a financial sinkhole) would likely be dome conventionally. I’d expect nuclear powers to completely support the strategic response, and secretly be greatful that it wasn’t them who were attacked first, thus letting the Americans to sort out the whole mess.
