If we could develop technologies that unlock hydrogen from water cheaply and with renewable energy, we could eliminate most carbon emissions quickly and without much change in daily life.

2,"Cars efficiency has doubled in the last 2 decades, and emissions have dropped. Plants designs have improved for efficiency and low NOx burners, new Cogen plants have been built which improves power generation efficiency by 35% from 48 to 65%. in the last 20 yrs a lot of these have sprung up in Alberta. At least 10% of Provincial load I am sure. And, 5 of 7 coal plants shut down outright in Alberta and the remaining 2 converted to natural gas. 10’s of thousands of people out of work due to this, and incompetence in Ottawa dealing with it, feathering their own nest as usual now with what they caCars efficiency has doubled in the last 2 decades, and emissions have dropped.

3,"The possibility ofIn that sense new types of batteries for local storage and vehicles along with hybrid battery-capacitors for vehicles can help in reducing the problem, but hoping for quick and cheap fixes with amazing future technologies is something that can increase the problem by encouraging a bit of foot dragging.","105,667 followers",Dave Consiglio,561,6.8K,91.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-technological-fixes-for-climate-change
4,"Fight against Climate Change? I’m assuming you are asking which technologies are going to reduce the “human footprint” on the Earth that might cause worldwide temperatures to develop that are more than ±10°C from average.Anything that is going to control the acquisition or use of things that produce chemicals or heat by humans is going to have some impact. Many of the best technologies are not necessarily going to make humanity as a whole more neutral to the Earth’s many systems. There’s little that would erase all the impacts that eight or more billion humans ( and their work and farm animalsFight against Climate Change? I’m assuming you are asking which technologies are going to reduce the “human footprint” on the Earth that might cause worldwide temperatures to develop that are more than ±10°C from average.Anything that is going to control the acquisition or use of things that produce chemicals or heat by humans is going to have some impact. Many of the best technologies are not necessarily going to make humanity as a whole more neutral to the Earth’s many systems. There’s little that would erase all the impacts that eight or more billion humans ( and their work and farm animals, pets, etc) have on the spheres.For example, let’s say that everyone believes the biggest problem is the current anomaly trend and atmospheric carbon dioxide being at .042% of the total. So tech is created that reduces carbon dioxide to pre-industrial levels, and as time marches forward in another of that same 270 year period between 1750 and now, the carbon dioxide levels are reduced back to only .028% of the total. Imagine world population and technology levels stay where they are now. Further, that the carbon dioxide level stays at 280 ppmv for another 270 years past that 270 years from now. What if during that same 540 years, the “global temperature” stays where it is now as well? How about if the temperature goes up 4°C anyway regardless of what carbon dioxide is. Or if the interglacial ends, or not, and the temperature goes down 4°C. Then that question would be, depending on what happens between now and 2558, was that the best technology, did it address the correct issue, or was everyone wrong. Who knows. We can’t experiment on the actual system, there’s no way to falsify anything, most of the information we have is proxies or computer simulations based upon imperfect data, the time frames are nothing geologically, nobody lives that long, and there’s never been an Earth exactly like the one it’s been the last few hundred years.All in all, the answers seems that if a technology is going to fightThere are many that are promising in such ways, but many that even over decades and centuries might not to do anything to either pause or reverse human impact, since a large part of any problem is due to the level of technology and number of people. And most no technology is going to do anything about the natural parts, even if everyone could know or agree what those are to start working on tech to do so.",0 followers,Paul Noel,1.9K,14.2K,22M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-technological-fixes-for-climate-change
