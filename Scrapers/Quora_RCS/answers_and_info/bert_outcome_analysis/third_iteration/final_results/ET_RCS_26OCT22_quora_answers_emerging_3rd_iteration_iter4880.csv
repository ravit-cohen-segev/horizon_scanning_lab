1,"If you’re looking for lasers, that’s a long way off and may never really be viable as small arms. There are experiments going on but they are all vehicle mounted, since they need a large, stable power supply amongst other things.However, railguns and gauss rifles are a bit more realistic. Whereas the process of creating a weaponized laser is extremely complicated and even given tremendous amounts of electricity, focusing it into a damaging beam is a huge difficulty, magnetic weapons are incredibly easy to build to an operational level.Magnetic weapons have two varieties; railguns and coil gunsIf you’re looking for lasers, that’s a long way off and may never really be viable as small arms. There are experiments going on but they are all vehicle mounted, since they need a large, stable power supply amongst other things.However, railguns and gauss rifles are a bit more realistic. Whereas the process of creating a weaponized laser is extremely complicated and even given tremendous amounts of electricity, focusing it into a damaging beam is a huge difficulty, magnetic weapons are incredibly easy to build to an operational level.Magnetic weapons have two varieties; railguns and coil guns. A railgun works by passing a current through the projectile, which rides along two rails in the gun. The rails sit above an array of magnets (simple neodymium magnets, not much more powerful than the ones on your fridge, would do perfectly) which create a magnetic field. A moving charged particle (a current is shit-tons of moving charged particles) experiences a force when moving through a magnetic field, so the current in the projectile acts like a slingshot and pushes it down the rails. Such a contraption is not difficult to build - you could build it around a strong piece of 3x2 timber with some inexpensive button magnets fastened down on top of it (they must all face the same way up!), aluminium rails (you might be able to use a non-purpose built piece of scrap for this since it only really has to be long, straight and conductive) and a big DC battery with a switch. As ammo I’d recommend some form of flat, dense metal disc, I would probably start by looking at scientific weights or something. Nestle it between your precisely positioned rails (get a shape that fits it between them while maintaining contact. Some sort of curtain rail, maybe?) and wham bam, you have a fully functional railgun with no use of tools you couldn’t find in the average garage. To get maximum power you would need powerful magnets and a high voltage power supply, but that drives up costs a bit much for a garage project.You can build a coilgun very easily - it’s just an electromagnet wrapped around a barrel. I made one when I was 15 for kicks and shot some nails around with it. The problem is timing - they work by pulling small ferromagnetic projectiles toward the magnet and shutting it off as they pass through the magnet to avoid pulling it straight back into the gun, but that takes precise timing. You could build a simple timing circuit to pass current through the coil for exactly the right length of time before shutting off to do this automatically at the press of a button. To increase coilgun power, simply line up several more electromagnets with longer timing circuits on the same barrel.The point is, magnetic guns are damn easy to make and with even the most basic tools you can make them moderately powerful, perhaps comparable to a weak air rifle. With more time and resources, there is nothing to stop you from making powerful railguns or coilguns to compete with any firearm. As we’ve seen, the US Navy built some monster ones. But that is being fed power by a *nuclear reactor* on board that ship. And not every soldier can carry one of those around with him to power his personal railgun.The thing holding back magnetic guns is battery development. If you could make a safe, high voltage, high capacity power supply that was light enough to carry into combat, you could definitely make magnetic weapons to compete and perhaps outperform firearms of a similar weight class. As others pointed out, firearms technology is not advancing very quickly at the moment. Firearms have reached a plateau.Consider the enormous innovations made over the last 200 years - from brass casings and rifled barrels that hugely increased the accuracy and rate of fire of the individual soldier, to the rapid, competitive race to build the best military rifle leading to such excellent weapons as the original G98 and Lee-Enfield bolt actions, and later to the considerable innovation (if perhaps not a great weapon of war) that was the M1 Garand and the dawn of GPMGs with German MG34s and 42s, to the development of the assault rifle to a usable weapon platform with such revisions as the AKM and the M16A1, firearms technology came a long way in any individual era, to the point where one infantry unit from so much as a decade or two ahead had a massive advantage compared to their older counterparts. Think of how 1960s assault-rifle armed infantry would have fared in the urban combat of WWII compared to the mostly bolt-action armed combatants of the day? The advantage would be gargantuan off their small arms alone.Then think of today. The US is still using a modified version of the same weapons platform they introduced in the 60s. The advancements have been slight ergonomic improvements, nicer sights, bullpup guns are a thing for some god-awful reason, but the guns aren’t far superior to what they were back then, because it’s plateaued. They’re not getting better, not a very fast rate anyway.Now consider battery development. Look at what a battery could hold in 2000 compared to what it can hold in 2010, compared to now, in the same size and weight profile. The increase in performance is massive! They got cheaper, too. Battery science is advancing a heck of a lot faster than guns are and when it reaches the point where powerful power supplies are light enough for soldiers to carry into battle, we see magnetic weapons issued to infantry.I mean, in the perfect future world, we wouldn’t need infantry anymore…","28,187 followers",Murphy Barrett,791,12.3K,157M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-will-replace-bullets
2,"I think we’re pretty close to a plateau in bullet technology. Slightly better alloys, marginally better propellants, perhaps combusting explosive cased ammunition, but essentially man portable weapons in 50 years will look very similar to the ones today. What may change is size of the weapon and the projectile carried by soldiers. As load bearing frames and exo-skeleton type technology progresses it’s probable that troopers will carry larger caliber weapons, likely on the order of 20mm, and assorted types of ammo for different tasks. Lasers/light weapons aren’t particularly practical since smoI think we’re pretty close to a plateau in bullet technology.

As load bearing frames and exo-skeleton type technology progresses it’s probable that troopers will carry larger caliber weapons, likely on the order of 20mm, and assorted types of ammo for different tasks. Lasers/light weapons aren’t particularly practical since smoke and dust could make use very difficult, cooling for multiple rapid shots is presently impractical, miniaturization would be difficult, and the energy budget is huge. Railguns pose similar challenges. Something that a lot of folks disregard is the fact that a battery/energy source potent enough to power a laser or rail gun in a man portable weapon would be very much like having every soldier walking around with a bomb. Not a little bomb either, on the order of 250 rds of 5.56 ammo either like they already carry. A big bomb, not broken down into units that cook off individually, like bullets. All that said despite the fact that they’re not apt to change very much I think it’s unlikely that anything will replace bullets per se in our world. They’re weatherproof, light, durable, cheap, easy to make, and quite lethal to humans. Why bother to spend billions building a better mousetrap when the one we have already kills mice dead and can be explained to the average 9 year old in about 20 minutes? Lasers and rail guns may play a role in the future, but the role they play will be complementary to, not a replacement for, bullets.As an aside, I’m using the word “bullets” instead of cartridge since the that’s how the question was posed.","4,828 followers",Steve Dutch,1.7K,22.8K,26.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-will-replace-bullets
3,"Well, none, we will just make bullets better, at least that's what I would bet.Think about what a bullet is, a projectile launched by a controled explosion inside a barrel. Even to this day we are using gunpowder to make that explosion happen but why? It's not because it is the most powerful explosive material we know of but because it is one of the safest. There is still a substantial margin of improvement if we manage to replace powder with something else, more energy dense and, yet, safer. Chances are this new technology will come to tanks first, in the form of a spark ignited new chemicalWell, none, we will just make bullets better, at least that's what I would bet.Think about what a bullet is, a projectile launched by a controled explosion inside a barrel.

4,"'Bullets' are defined by their carry mechanics as the necessary volume (dead air inside and around the casing) and weight (barrel and bolt carrier, mag size) as well as their effects. The former issue is largely a packaging as thermal effects conditioned (alloy) problem and is best solved by not going there with a totally different effects generator.The biggest influence on the latter is treaty influence on cruel and unusual wounding but there are also major drivers with regards to barrier penetration, recoil and rate of fire effects upon accuracy. All of which are endemic to the system physic'Bullets' are defined by their carry mechanics as the necessary volume (dead air inside and around the casing) and weight (barrel and bolt carrier, mag size) as well as their effects. The former issue is largely a packaging as thermal effects conditioned (alloy) problem and is best solved by not going there with a totally different effects generator.The biggest influence on the latter is treaty influence on cruel and unusual wounding but there are also major drivers with regards to barrier penetration, recoil and rate of fire effects upon accuracy. All of which are endemic to the system physics (more MV = flatter trajectory = more recoil from more energetic propellant load = longer/heavier barrels to recover max energy from gas = heavier and more unwieldy rifle etc.) in a kind of iron triangle of ballistic limitations.If I was going to design a new weapon that replaced kinetic projectiles, it would most likely be something that negated one or more of the carry problems while having a new, unique, biophysical interaction with the body that went past the treaty limits on wounding and/or allowed for decisive engagements with fewer shots so as to limit down range effects, beyond the target. Particularly in collaterals dense urban environments.I might also consider range extension, as a function of lowered recoil and reduced ballistic variables within the round and also as a result of active tracking within a much shorter shot pathway.Finally, mitigating thermal and corrosive effects on the gun might be something worth looking into. High ROF use in firefights where suppression is used to dislodge as much as engage threats can permanently distort ballistic properties of the barrel and receiver, effecting accuracy and safety while destroying surrounding furniture (fore grip especially).Lasers have a lot pluses here, provided they are restricted from deliberate dazzle/eye blinding roles (very hard to do when all's you have is a head shaped target area, sticking above a roofline for instance).Weaponization threshold on a laser is nominally 100KW but we have used 60KW to shoot down drones from upwards of 2km distances in tests. PIKL (Pulse-Impulsive Kill Laser) was a testbed whose 'rifle class' hardware was around 20KW, delivering about 400 Joules energy at the target face (vs. 663 Joules from a 5.56 round) with the large laser but almost 1KN of force, compared to only 66 Newtons for the bullet, from the ablative detonation effects. The beam was almost an order of magnitude below program desired lethality levels but was only pushing a single 'color'. Multiple waveform frequency stacking would several wavefronts to overlap on the target face, which, when detonated would have much higher mechanical force. Modern FO and Slab lasers can be built with exactly this frequency stacked emission tuning in mind, simply by doping the glass. The key is how short a pulse length you can pack the coherent lase energy into and that's all digital at the beam controller (electronic, not optic) side of things where we have really good understanding from decades of RF research in the radar/comms fields.With PEPs, there is absolutely no need for megawatt class power levels in infantry weapons. At that level, you are talking multi-ton turrets (coherent light has acoustic interactions with the emitter that have to be damped and cooled) in a MIRACL or YABL type weapon class.Two things that people don't often understand is that, at a high enough power level, thermal weapons have kinetic interactions with targets. Not simply 'steam explosions' from sublimated water volume in tissues but even thing things like ballistic vests can be made to explode in a way that generates enormous levels of mechanical (torsion) stress on a target.This is again a result of layering 'colors' as particularly short pulse lengths so that each successive photonic wave front adds to the plasma build over the target face without cross interference and once a given power level has been achieved, detonated (this can also be done in mid air making incredibly loud 'BANG!' noises, as an LTL deterrent).What we have recently discovered is that this plasma field has an electric component which can interact with the Nociceptor pain nerves in the body. Medical research here has shown great promise in lowering the pain threshold in post operative conditions and burn traumas where the skin is particularly sensitive while avoiding the depressed systemic function inherent to a traditional, pharmacological, alternative.There have been some _serious_ debates however as to the morality of releasing this technology to the military as the potential for abuse, particularly in intelligence gathering and by non-state actors is extreme and the pain can be ratcheted up so fast and so high that it creates permanent mental debilitative effects, even without permanent nerve damage to the effected area.In terms of volumetric design and effective CG displacement (key factors with increasing numbers of short-limbed women warriors being pushed into combatant roles), the ability to displace the laser generation train away from gimbaled focussing optics theoretically allows a much shorter, vertical, weight displacement axis with the 'barrel' running through the grasping hand and the focusing optics resting atop it hand.In combination with autotracking/stabilization of the optics head, this would allow much more accurate aimpoint control without the biomechanical difficulties of a rotated wrist and elbow strain on a fore and pistol grip greatly affecting accuracy when looking down the sights.Imagine the difference between a spray bottle grip and a pistol hold with the optics ball compensating for the more natural wrist angle.Now add an HMDS with retinal tracking and it becomes possible to rapidly designate targets within a trained eye scan, marking each one with a designator power setting on the laser (and a FLIR secondary channel to the co-boresighted weapon aperture on the optics ball, following the thermal contrast), thereby allowing a 'shoot list' generated streaming engagement as a serial traverse/elevation slew with rapid, precision, lasing as the constant emission laser cross target bearing for emission of the X-Wave conditioned 'Pulsed Energy Projectile' detonation signal down the beams pulse train.Detonating the target surface plasma or 'tuning in' the laser to a nociceptor electric (Hz) response threshold.This has an enormous advantage, relative to the point-click school of sight picture capture in that the weapon tracks the designated targets and/or muzzle blooms across the FLIR field of view, even after the shooter has moved his eyes off the target and/or can remember shooter positions after the target has temporarily dropped from view.While nominally hand-held, such a system could also be equipped with a spiked tripod. Allowing it to be quickly jammed into dirt or drywall and treated as a sited weapon aperture, for remote operation. Removing laser operator from beaten zone return fire exposure altogether.Take this weapon approach outside of the optics band and into the UWB impulse radar equivalent and (probably from a much larger platform installation on something like a UAV) and now you can _theoretically_ generate a through-wall sensor capability to image threat occupancy spaces and then target fixed amounts of radiation into 'life signs' areas of biomass tissue density or doppler backflash to again, attack nociceptor pain nerves and/or incapacitate threats with effects similar to the better known ADW.The biggest problem with bullets is that they are LOS limited to the environmental application they are used in. Being man made (doors, stairs, windows, walls) these require a trained shooter to bring the rifle or SMG etc. to bear with rapidity of accurate point fires. The threat does not need to respond in kind however, as the shooter position is defined by things like doorways TCPs. This results in random casualty levels on all sides, inherent to the predictability of these very narrow fire lanes at very close ranges where traditional soldier skills of marksmanship and discipline mean very little and secondary effects (IED, grenades etc.) as well as ambush defilades (behind the couch/closet door/next room entry etc.) can come to be dominant attrition drivers, even against low quality, insurgent, enemies.Furthermore, since winning those kinds of wars is typically about gaining intelligence with which to establish dominant surveillance and targeting of much deeper networks than the frontline trigger pullers (bomb makers beat Shahid bomb truck drivers etc.) on which to F2T2EA drive a killchain through the organization, it really doesn't help much to splatter walls crimson with dime a dozen guerillas. More volunteers will walk in off the street, the next day.Remote Stun beats Bullet To Face here. Because when they wake up, drugged to the eyeballs, you can start asking serious live-or-disappear questions.The question then becomes how far are you willing to neck down your combatant forces to gain this level of capability, because this kind of weapon offers such an enormous improvement in accuracy and lethality over range that there is no reason to believe it would remain unstolen and proliferated and once it became universal, it would largely obsolesce conventional infantry, so long as power density levels (battery vs. bullet on a weighted volume basis) allowed reasonable shot counts, per man.PIKL was putting quarter sized holes in dummy infantrymen from more than a mile away, back in the 90s. But the optics test bench was the size/weight of a pool table and the power came out of a washing machine sized generator.To protect against that or even a dazzler equivalent capability (which is now fielded in rifle sized 'PHASR' levels, good to over 1,000m), would require an exosuited infantryman with powered hard plate as standoff effects negation and a distributed sensor system as visionics protection and could easily end up costing a military a million per man (SNU levels), just for his gear and weapons.This is why it is of penultimate importance that if we are going to move beyond projectile systems towards directed energy follow-ons, we have in place the social systems to reemploy the several million 300 MOS infantry who would no longer be getting personal discipline training in their 18-25 hormonally difficult years.And that we also consider systems packaging as scaling levels which can preempt or at least rapidly reduce and contain conventional close quarter UO fighting as the best means to avoid force on force numeric disparities beyond the ability of a limited infantry component to resolve without resort to heavier/explosive fires to devolumize massed threats.When you have a scalpel as a weapon, you don't get into bar fights with baseball bats.LINKS-PEPs and Pain LasersPIKL",1 follower,Graham Moore,527,6.4K,5.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-will-replace-bullets
5,The entire history of weapons shows that the object of their use is to project force beyond the range of the human arm.Beginning with rocks and sticks and advancing beyond spears and bows and arrows to bullets weapons have always been designed to send more lethal projectiles to greater ranges.Any future weapon that doesn’t use projectiles will probably use energy of some sort.,"2,005 followers",Kenneth Merchant,920,162,9.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-will-replace-bullets
