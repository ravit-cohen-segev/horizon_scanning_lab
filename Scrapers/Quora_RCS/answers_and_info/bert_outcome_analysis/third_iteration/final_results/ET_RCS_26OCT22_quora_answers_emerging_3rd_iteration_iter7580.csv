Cryptocurrency mining is where a number of computers will race to finish an easy, but highly inefficient, equation in the hope of earning a cryptocurrency reward. The most well-known cryptocurrency blockchains such as bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether and litecoin all follow this validation process, and each user will be rewarded by the appropriate cryptocoin if they validate first.At the moment this mining process, known as ‘proof of work,’ takes up a significant amount of computational power and time, and by extension, electricity. As we all know, electricity isn’t free, so there is an associated cost with this process. There is also a continued need to upgrade computer hardware, chips, cooling mechanisms, and support infrastructure to make sure you have the fastest equipment out there. If you’re not the first to validate a block, then there is no reward.When we’re trying to value a cryptocurrency, there is an argument to suggest that the base cost of how much it costs to mine an individual coin is going to be the ‘fair value’ of what that coin is worth. In the same way as a drilling rig wouldn’t extract oil at a cost of $120 /barrel if you could only sell that oil at $60 /barrel, crypto miners are unlikely to continue to mine (or at least sell) their coins if the free market value is less than the cost to mine.Rather than mining to get Bitcoins, I advise that you invest with trusted cryptocurrency investment companies like Coinparadise (www.coinparadise.tech). An active Billion-dollar cryptocurrency investment company I have been investing with that pays double your investments after 7 days. Try them and thank me later.How much does cryptocurrency mining cost?A big factor affecting how much a cryptocurrency costs to mine lies in the cost of electricity and the relevant tax implications based on geographical location. The cost to mine can even change based on where you live in a single country. For example a recent blog post published by CESCO from January 2018 showed that the cost to mine a single bitcoin in Hawaii was almost $9500 while in Louisiana, which came as the cheapest state in America, just over $3200. This was when the price of bitcoin was about $15,000 on the open market.Alternatively, you can look at the average cost to mine bitcoin. If you take the average cost of electricity in the United States to be $0.12/kWh, and assume the entire bitcoin network was mined at a requirement of 27.6/tWh, then the cost of producing one bitcoin is roughly $5041.China, as you may expect, has a significant concentration of miners due to their low electrical costs, relatively cheap technology, affordable rent, and efficient labourers. Areas like Alaska and Iceland are being investigated more and more as miners look to reduce the cost of cooling their computers with the ambient temperatures, and therefore increasing efficiency. If you know the cost of electricity, then you at least have a start.However, even if you know the cost of electricity in each region, you will still have trouble figuring out how expensive it is to mine a cryptocurrency, as it’s unlikely there will be a fixed energy requirement. Most blockchain systems have a variable mining difficulty which adjusts the hash power needed to mine a single block. In the case of bitcoin, a new block is mined roughly every ten minutes, but the ability to mine in this time is dependant on how much power you have on the network as a whole.If the network suddenly receives a boost to the computational power it’s receiving (which should in theory cause each block to be mined quicker) the bitcoin algorithm will increase the hash difficulty (which should reduce each blocks mine time back to a consistent ten minutes). These changes will use more/less energy in a non-linear scale depending on the adjustment. Essentially, it’s not only difficult to calculate, but it’s difficult to predict.How does cryptocurrency mining profitability affect valuations?As with everything, the price of an asset is based on supply and demand, and the utility (or perceived future utility) it may have. Mining itself is going to have a knock-on effect on the price of that asset, simply because it doesn’t make sense for an individual miner to sell their cryptocurrencies reward if the market price doesn’t match or beat the equipment and electrical cost it took to generate that coin.To put it another way, if it cost you $1000 to set up the hardware and $4000 to pay for the electricity to mine a single bitcoin, you’re unlikely to sell if the current market price doesn’t match at least $5000. If you take this basic principle, factor in different energy and hardware costs, project it globally, and then take the weighted average of how much it costs to mine a single crypto (for example bitcoin), you’re going to have a good base of where miners are unlikely to sell below. This, in theory, creates a soft floor or level of support for the price of a crypto asset. Calculating it is the hard part.How can we value crypto assets based on mining?At the moment it’s very hard to judge how we can value cryptocurrencies based on mining, and there isn’t a simple formula yet. All the required data is out there, including where the hash power is focused, how much electricity costs in those regions, and how many bitcoin ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) chips are being bought to stay on top of the competition, however it’s scattered around and difficult for an individual to find and analyse.When it comes to hardware, it’s ever so slightly easier because hardware costs are simpler to research and the required hash rate to mine a block in a single month is fairly consistent. At the time of writing it requires about 3000 TH/s. This alone would require about 115 ASIC AntMiner S9s which would cost just shy of $150,000. If we assume that bitcoin is priced at $9000 (as it is at the time of going to print), the 12.5 BTC reward is only going to generate $112,500. Without factoring in electricity, you’re not going to be making money in month one at the current market prices.ConclusionIf the cost to mine is more than the current market price, there is less incentive for a miner to sell their cryptocurrencies and this can have a significant impact on the global crypto costs. Bitcoin, as an example, has about 1800 coins mined each day, but if all miners globally stopped selling their coins (because it wasn’t favourable at current market prices) then that would take $160,200000 a day off of the downside selling pressure. Assuming all other things are equal, less sell side pressure would lead to an increase in asset value.Valuing crypto can be tricky, however there are a number of like-minded traders on IG Community who are discussing crypto trade ideas and market movements.

The incentives for various members in its ecosystem, such as miners and traders, will change. The cryptocurrency's network will also transform, and its participants will be different from the retail traders that populate its current ecosystem.Will Bitcoin Ever Reach the 21 Million Cap?Before delving into the implications of Bitcoin's 21 million cap, it might be interesting to consider the question of whether it will ever reach that figure. Based on the cryptocurrency's current codebase and mining process, some observers say that Bitcoin may fall just shy of the 21 million figure.High prices for bitcoin enable miners to cover operational costs and sustain business profits because they can sell their rewards stash in cryptocurrency markets.When Bitcoin is close to reaching its limit, the reward amounts may not be enough to cover operational costs at miners, let alone generate profits. If and when the supply limit is reached, Bitcoin rewards are supposed to vanish. That’s why I often recommend that asideThe 21 million figure is an asymptotic cap on the number of bitcoin in existence. In simple words, this means that, while it may reach very close to figure, the cryptocurrency will never reach that limit. This is because block rewards and Bitcoin supply are never expressed in exact terms. Therefore, a total supply of 6.2589 bitcoins will be rounded out to the closest smallest integer, in this case 6.What Happens When All 21 Million Bitcoin Are Mined?A consequence of Bitcoin not reaching its planned cap is that it leaves open the possibility that the cryptocurrency's network will remain functional for a long time after 2140. No bitcoins will be issued, but transaction blocks will be confirmed, and fees will become the primary source of revenue.That said, it is difficult to predict the effects of Bitcoin almost reaching the overall supply promised by Satoshi Nakamoto. This is partly because Bitcoin's ecosystem is still undeveloped.The Bottom LineBitcoin's 21 million supply cap is meant to control inflation that might, otherwise, result from an unlimited supply. But it has inflated the cryptocurrency's prices by making it a scarce commodity.When Bitcoin reaches the supply cap, it is likely that miners will shift from block rewards to transaction fees as their main source of revenue.","29,209 followers",Mattias Petter Johansson,1.1K,1.1K,16.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-does-mining-affect-the-value-of-Bitcoin

In this guide, we’ll show you how to mine your digital treasure in the most profitable way.Obviously, the big money is going into costly bitcoin ASICs. If you are already in that position, you probably knowHow do I start?Choose your currencyThe process of mining digital currencies involves solving complex cryptographic puzzles. By doing this, miners are providing ’proof of work’ that is rewarded with digital currency. Broadly speaking, there are two proof-of-work hashing algorithms in use today: SHA-256 andThe right rigDepending on your budget and the type of currency you intend to mine, there are two ways to go when setting up your mining system:Power upMining requires electricity –Consider the following two cases, for example: A PSU that is guaranteed to supply 860W and is 93% efficient would actually draw 925W (860W/0.93). By contrast, a 750W power supply that is only 80% efficient would actually draw 937.5 W (750/0.8) – thus using more power, but supplying less.When building a mining rig, you will need to take account of the power requirements of all the components you are using ­– especially all those graphics cards. Plus it’s a good idea to provide some excess capacity to deal with unexpected events and provide the potential to overclock your system.ASICs, on the other hand, can do far more calculations with far less power because they are highly specialised devices. And since they ship with an appropriate power adapter, you won’t have to worry about doing all the maths to find one that is up to the task.The mining efficiency of different systems can be compared by taking the ratio of the number of hashes it can perform in a second, divided by the power it consumes:Hashing speed / power consumption = mining efficiencyCheck your billsAfter the initial expense of your rig, the essential thing you need to know to calculate your ongoing profitability is the cost of your electricity. Check with your provider, or take a look at your last bill. If the power charges add up to more then you earn, it obviously isn’t a good business model.Pool your effortsRather than go it alone, it usually makes more sense to join a pool, where you combine resources with other miners. By joining a pool, you earn a share of the coins mined by all members of the pool and stand a greater chance of solving a block.Miners earn a share of the rewards if the difficulty level of the blocks they solve is greater than the level set by the pool operator. That level is always somewhere between 1 and the difficulty level of the currency.Problems to be aware ofSpend to earnInevitably, the difficulty level of all currencies increase with time – a fact that will reduce the chances of your equipment earning coins or mining shares. As a result, it is important to start with the best equipment you can afford, in order to mine profitably over the longest period of time.The volatility of the currency being mined also affects your long-term profitability. If the price suddenly drops, you will be faced with the choice of either selling at a low price or hanging onto your coins until their value increases. In the former case, you would have to keep mining for longer to recoup your expenditure on equipment and electricity.Keeping coolWhichever way you mine, it’s a computationally intensive operation that creates lots of excess heat. Mining efficiency decreases as temperature increases, so make sure your rig has adequate ventilation and cooling. As mentioned above, this is why some mining rig builders use beer crates rather than PC cases – to maximise airflow around their components. Even a standalone desktop fan can help to keep your kit cool.Power problemsWhen building a DIY mining rig, it doesn't make sense to save money by buying a cheap PSU. Any instability in the power supply could hit performance, or even cause a system crash that will lead to downtime, so do invest in a high-quality unit.Avoiding downtimeIf your hardware isn’t mining, you are losing money. Here are some ways to minimise downtime:Hidden costsThere are costs involved with mining, of course, like the rig and the ongoing electricity costs for starters. However, some extras are less obvious:Doing the sumsProfitability calculatorsFor assistance with some of the calculations miners need to make, there are several websites that provide profitability calculators. You can input parameters such as equipment cost, hash rate, power consumption, and the current bitcoin price, to see how long it will take to pay back your investment.As a test, we entered the specifications of two mining systems into the calculators below. For our Scrypt GPU mining rig, we used the system described,With a UK electricity price set at £0.20 per KWh (which equated to $0.33), these are the recommendations and profits that the following sites presented:(Note that these figures were correct as of January 21st, 2014, and that they are all subject to currency volatility and shifts in difficulty level.)Multicurrency calculators:DustcoinCoinWarzBitcoin specific calculators:TradeblockBitcoinxHopefully, this gives you an idea of the spread of results across these services, given the same data at the same time.Data miningRegards.(www.mininghub.io)",18 followers,Albert Brown,602,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-does-mining-affect-the-value-of-Bitcoin

7,"When Satoshi Nakamoto designed the Bitcoin system, in order to control the overall issuance of Bitcoin, it was stipulated that after every 210,000 blocks were generated, Bitcoin output was halved. At the beginning, each block produced 50 bitcoins, and then gradually halved until it approached zero. Because Bitcoin has set a difficulty factor based on its computing power, it generates an average block in about 10 minutes, so it is halved approximately every four years. According to this rule, Bitcoin will reach its set limit of 21 million by 2040.(Bitcoin chart, the picture comes from the netwoWhen Satoshi Nakamoto designed the Bitcoin system, in order to control the overall issuance of Bitcoin, it was stipulated that after every 210,000 blocks were generated, Bitcoin output was halved.

According to this rule, Bitcoin will reach its set limit of 21 million by 2040.(Bitcoin chart, the picture comes from the network)Throughout the history of the Bitcoin market's reaction to the price halving, Bitcoin assets have shown a clear upward trend. For example, from the first halving in November 2012 to November 2013, the price of Bitcoin rose by 82.1%. Similarly, after the second halving in July 2016, the bitcoin price jumped from $ 651 to $ 2518 and tripled in just one year. Through a longitudinal comparative analysis of the historical data of Bitcoin's two production cuts, we see that Bitcoin will have a short-term (up to several months) upward trend before the production cut date comes; twice the bitcoin halving is closely followed by This is the bull market in the cryptocurrency market. Therefore, at present, there is generally a good expectation that the currency price is expected to increase by half.After a lapse of four years, Bitcoin will once again halve in May 2020. What impact will it have on the Bitcoin ecosystem?1.1.1 Analysis of Bitcoin halving event from supply and demandThe halving of production will give investors the expectation of a decline in supply in the future, breaking the original balance of supply and demand. According to the analysis of economics pricing principles, it is assumed that the supply growth rate will decrease and the price theory will increase under the condition that the demand growth rate remains unchanged. Of course, the actual price change result is also affected by many other factors.The relationship between supply and demand is the lowest order in economics. Price is determined by supply and demand. If demand remains unchanged and supply decreases, prices will rise. In practice, demand is not fixed. When the obvious event of reduction in supply is approaching, most people will overdraft supply in favor of expectations, so that the price increase caused by the reduction in supply will be transformed into unquantifiable demand, resulting in a price bubble. When the supply declines, but when the demand keeps returning to balance, then the price appears to fall. Therefore, bit halving will also follow this price law.(1) Consensus demand is the main factor that determines the price of BitcoinDue to the limited supply of bitcoin, the price will continue to rise under the premise that the public is optimistic about bitcoin, and bitcoin can obtain a premium for valuation. It will increase; if the number of people who approve bitcoin becomes less, people's demand for purchases will decrease, and the price of bitcoin will fall. Once the mining cost is broken, miners will give up mining. Will decrease. Therefore, the consensus demand determines the bitcoin price, and the bitcoin price affects its network-wide computing power and mining costs.There are many factors that affect the demand for consensus. In addition to the network performance and technical updates of the Bitcoin network itself, and the development of competing currencies, the influence of public opinion, security incidents, and national policies also determine the demand portion of Bitcoin. In addition, Bitcoin prices are also directly affected by certain types of global political and economic events.(2) Feedback cycle between price, difficulty of computing power, and mining costUnder the premise that the infrastructure remains unchanged, the higher the bitcoin price, the more attractive the mining. At this time, the competition of miners becomes more intense, the computing power of the entire network increases, and the difficulty of mining becomes higher (the system will adjust the difficulty in the next cycle, with a certain lag), and the mining cost becomes higher. Once the price cannot cover the mining cost, the mining It will no longer be profitable, and small miners will withdraw or be merged.The decrease in the number of miners reduces the computing power of the entire network, and the difficulty of mining also decreases (plus the gain effect of the system itself adjusted according to the difficulty of the previous cycle). At this time, the miners who have withdrawn from the market have a tendency to sell, and the price of bitcoin increases. Of decline. The accumulation of market selling sentiment has caused the price to fall further, and more miners will withdraw from mining until the new equilibrium currency price no longer falls. Once the market turns warmer and the price of coins rises, it is less difficult to mine at this time, mining profits increase, the attractiveness of mining increases again, miners join again, and competition returns to fierce.Therefore, the mining cost also reacts to the price through the behavior of the miners.(3) Factors that affect the cost of Bitcoin mining by minersThe essence of mining can be simply understood as all the mining machines in the world work together to draw a random number hash value. The probability of winning is the computing power of the mining machine / the total computing power of the world. The factors that affect the miner's bitcoin mining cost are: block rewards, computing power, network-wide computing power, and operating costs.The breakeven cost is very important for miners to mine. The breakeven cost refers to the miner ’s mine is under normal operation, and the profit obtained by mining with a mining machine is not enough to pay the currency price of the electricity consumed by mining. It can also be understood The mining cost price or shutdown price for digging a certain coin. If the currency price falls below the ""shutdown price"", then mining will naturally lose money.The price of the shutdown currency is mainly related to the performance of the mining machine itself, electricity cost, block reward and computing power of the entire network. Among them, the two factors of miner performance and power cost are basically fixed, while the factor of block reward is There are changes (involving handling fees), but the overall change is not large. The only thing that fluctuates greatly is the computing power of the entire network.Therefore, the formula of mining machine breakeven is:Operating cost per day for a single mining machine = BTC revenue per day for a single mining machineOperating cost of a single mining machine per day = average number of coins mined by the mining machine per day * shutdown currency priceShutdown currency price = daily operating cost of a single mining machine / average number of coins mined per day by a single mining machineThe operating cost of a single mining machine is basically unchanged, and the Bitcoin mining reward is halved. In theory, the average number of coins mined by a single mining machine in one day will be halved, so the calculated ""shutdown currency price"" is about the original double. In other words, the ""intrinsic value"" contained in a single bitcoin has tripled, and the ""mining cost bottom"" will also double. Of course, the shutdown currency price is actually adjusted dynamically, and the influencing factors include the proportion of a single miner's computing power in the entire network, the difficulty of mining, block rewards, and operating expenses.Commodity prices are affected by the relationship between supply and demand, and fluctuate around value, which is the form of expression of the law of value. The rising cost of mining will cause Bitcoin to fluctuate around a higher value.3.1.2 Impact on stakeholders(1) Miners: For the Bitcoin miners produced separately, as the global computing power continues to increase, their BTC mining revenue must gradually decrease and gradually approach zero. Facing elimination. The halving caused the miner ’s mining reward to be halved. When the currency price did not increase in the same proportion, the absolute profit of the miner ’s mining decreased. Once the price fell too much, the high-cost miners would have to choose to shut down.In fact, the computing power of BTC has dropped to a certain extent after the last halving. On August 27th, Bitcoin made the first difficulty adjustment after halving, which reduced by 7.61%, which means that some miners withdrew from mining the behavior of.(2) Mine pool: halving the mining cost will increase, which will cause BTC to fluctuate online and offline around a higher valueThis makes miners have higher requirements for the lowest price of Bitcoin. In the case that the mining hardware remains unchanged, the halving of BTC will cause the probability of personal miners digging into coins. Therefore, the way in which individual miners mine will make the profit time more uncertain. This will hinder the rate at which ordinary users enter the field and become miners and prompt more miners to join the pool to smooth the income. Therefore, halving BTC will increase the risk of pool concentration.(3) Mining machine manufacturer: The relationship between bitcoin price and mining machine order is essentially a supply-demand balance. When the price of bitcoin rises, the mine owner or mining machine investor expects that the future bitcoin income will increase and the mining machine order will increase; When the price of bitcoin drops, the mining owner or mining machine investor expects that the future bitcoin revenue will fall and the mining machine orders will decrease. The increase in the cost of mining has put forward requirements for more efficient mining machine research and development.",5 followers,Russell Woodrow,894,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-does-mining-affect-the-value-of-Bitcoin

You can make your research and if you find the platform deem fit then you can go ahead just like i did.In the past, these Bitcoin halvings have correlated with massive surges in Bitcoin's price. The first halving, which occurred in November of 2012, saw an increase from about $12 to nearly $1,150 within a year. The second Bitcoin halving occurred in July of 2016. The price at that halving was about $650 and by December 17th, 2017, Bitcoin's price had soared to nearly $20,000. The price then fell over the course of a year from this peak down to around $3,200, a price nearly 400% higher than Its pre-halving price.4﻿﻿The theory of the halving and the chain reaction that it sets off works something like this:The reward is halved → half the inflation → lower available supply → higher demand → higher price → miners incentive still remains, regardless of smaller rewards, as the value of Bitcoin is increased In the process.In the event that a halving does not increase demand and price, then miners would have no incentive as the reward for completing transactions would be smaller and the value of Bitcoin would not be high enough. To prevent this, Bitcoin has a process to change the difficulty it takes to get mining rewards, or, in other words, the difficulty of mining a transaction. In the event that the reward has been halved and the value of Bitcoin has not increased, the difficulty of mining would be reduced to keep miners incentivized. This means that the quantity of Bitcoin released as a reward is still smaller but the difficulty of processing a transaction is reduced.This process has proven successful twice. So far, the result of these halvings has been a ballooning in price followed by a large drop. The crashes that have followed these gains, however, have still maintained prices higher than before these halving events. For example, as mentioned above, the 2017–2018 bubble saw Bitcoin rise to around $20,000, only to fall to around $3,200.4﻿﻿ This is a massive drop but Bitcoin's price before the halving was around $650. While this system has worked so far, the halving is typically surrounded by immense speculation, hype, and volatility, and it is unpredictable as to how the market will react to these events in the future.Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat do you mean that Bitcoin halves?The term ""halving"" as it relates to Bitcoin has to do with how many bitcoin tokens are found in a newly created block. Back in 2009 when Bitcoin launched, each block contained 50 BTC, but this amount was set to be reduced by 50% roughly every 4 years. Today, there have been three halving events and a block only contains 6.25 BTC. When the next halving occurs, a block will only contain 3.125 BTC.When have the halvings occurred?The first Bitcoin ""halvening"" occurred on November 28, 2012, after a total of 5,250,000 BTC had been mined. The next occurred on July 9, 2016, and the latest on May 11, 2020. The next is expected to occur in the Spring of 2024.Why are the halvenings occurring less than every 4 years?The Bitcoin mining algorithm is set with a target of finding new blocks once every ten minutes. However, if more miners join the network and add more hashing power, the time to find blocks will decrease. This is remedied by resetting the mining difficulty, or how hard it is for a computer to solve the mining algorithm, once every two weeks or so to restore a 10-minute target. As the Bitcoin network has grown exponentially over the past decade, the average time to find a block has consistently been below 10 minutes (roughly 9.5 minutes).Does halving have any effect on Bitcoin's price?The price of Bitcoin has risen steadily and significantly since its launch in 2009, when it traded for mere pennies or dollars, to early 2021 when the price of one bitcoin exceeded $51,250. Since halving the block reward effectively doubles the cost to miners, who are essentially the producers of bitcoins, it should have a positive impact on price since producers will need to adjust their selling price to their costs. Empirical evidence does show that Bitcoin price tends to rise in anticipation of a halvening, often several months prior to the actual event.",0 followers,Melissa Aldridge,501,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-set-up-a-bitcoin-miner-in-CoinDesk
11,"Bitcoin has become immensely popular around the globe. The last 12 months were monumental for the growth of this cryptocurrency. This fame came with a challenge. One that experts saw coming but, probably not so soon. It’s a known fact that there are just 21 million Bitcoins. The cap was put by Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto to make the cryptocurrency scarce and control inflation that might arise from an unlimited supply.The concept is simple - if there is limited supply of Bitcoin, its value will eventually rise as there will be more demand and less supply.

One that experts saw coming but, probably not so soon. It’s a known fact that there are just 21 million Bitcoins. The cap was put by Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto to make the cryptocurrency scarce and control inflation that might arise from an unlimited supply.The concept is simple - if there is limited supply of Bitcoin, its value will eventually rise as there will be more demand and less supply. The challenge is that Bitcoin reached 90 per cent of its maximum supply earlier this month.According to research byIt’s obvious that once the remaining Bitcoins are mined, Bitcoin as an asset, will become more scarce and miners will be dependent on transaction fees, instead of block rewards.For those who are unaware, the miners are awarded a block of Bitcoins for performing a set of transactions successfully, as part of the mining process. The reward is halved every four years. In 2008, the miners would get 50 Bitcoins. In 2012, this was halved to 25 Bitcoins, later to 12 Bitcoins and by the end of 2024 it is expected that miners will only earn 1.56 Bitcoins for verifying a block of transactions.The process will continue till every single Bitcoin is mined. As perHonestly, it’s tough to predict how Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market will react when the Bitcoin supply runs out. The crypto is relatively young, and a lot will depend on how the demand shapes up.One thing is for sure, that Bitcoins will no longer be mined and fees will become the primary source of revenue. Ultimately, Bitcoin's network may function as a closed economy, in which transaction fees are assessed much like taxes are.As of now, about 3.7 million of Bitcoins mined, have gone out of circulation. They have been lost because of loss of access to one’s private key, death and other reasons. It hasn’t had a negative impact on the value of crypto.As far as the investors go, this may shape up another interesting scenario. As mentioned before, there is a general belief that Bitcoin prices will go up once the supply reduces. But, nothing is for sure.There is also a great chance that Bitcoin has a more defined purpose by the time its supply runs out. For example, India has been trying to classify cryptocurrencies as a digital asset. This way you may not be able to purchase anything using Bitcoin but can use it as a store of value. Just like Gold.At this point, it’s difficult to accurately predict the future of Bitcoin but the possibilities seem endless.I’ve been in a successful side in bitcoin mining in the last five(5) years which makes me reliable.
