3,"Theoretically, no, but there is a catch. Throughout the history, there has been only handful of companies able to reach the market cap of 1 trillion dollars USD, and no company ever maintained that 1 trillion dollar market cap.Among US companies, Apple briefly reached 1 trillion market cap twice but got back down. Microsoft also recently reached 1 trillion market cap but went back down as well. If you look at Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, and Google, these companies all have the potential to surpass the 1 trillion dollar market cap but no company ever did. Why?1 trillion dollar is a very huge valuTheoretically, no, but there is a catch.

Microsoft also recently reached 1 trillion market cap but went back down as well. If you look at Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, and Google, these companies all have the potential to surpass the 1 trillion dollar market cap but no company ever did. Why?1 trillion dollar is a very huge value even for a company like the size of these Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, and Google. To grow and to maintain such a ultra mega-cap sized company, the company has to be some kind of conglomerates that need to reach the variety of industries and become all successful at these fields. This is exactly why Google is trying to capture the hardware markets with Google Pixel and Google Nest while looking for other moon-shots like Waymo or other Google Cloud leveraged ventures like Google Stadia. This is exactly why Amazon bought Wholefoods, try something off-line concept using Amazon Go, and pursue the venture in space industry. Microsoft wants to steal some market share from Amazon Web Service cloud and want to pursue Microsoft Hololense and other ventures. Apple now wants to become more than a hardware company by selling Apple Music.Will they be profitable and keep growing forever? Possibly, yes. Many of these companies and few not mentioned like Facebook all have a decent shot at breaking through 1 trillion dollars market cap and keep growing further. But, again, making an idea is just one thing, while executing it well and actually turning the idea into another billion dollar worth of revenue industry is even a bigger and challenging feat. We have to put our AR glasses and observe how everything unfolds.So, the short answer is: theoretically yes, but very challenging based on the historical data.","45,615 followers",David Seidman,799,3.6K,85M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-an-upper-limit-to-how-large-and-profitable-the-top-technology-companies-can-become-Amazon-Google-Apple-etc-or-will-they-keep-growing-forever

You could buy freaking anything- clothes, tools, tractors, even houses off of the Sears catalog. Just wait 6–8 weeks for it to ship and it will come to your door, or you can come pick it up in your semi-retired conveniently located local store.K-Mart came in and ate a large slice of their pie by selling a smaller selection of fast moving goods at a discount (purchasing economy) and locating closer to customers.Then Wal-Mart came in with a superior supply chain strategy and was able to undercut k-Mart prices and offer more selection to boot.Then Amazon revolutionized the shopping world with free two day shipping and a selection of just about everything in the world.So what's next in retail? If Amazon keeps its eyes open, they have the talent and horsepower to stay King of the Hill. But if they get complacent, some other company will change the rules right out from under them and win the advantage. That's why at Amazon we talk a lot about how ""It's always day 1"" and we stay relentlessly focused on doing better for our customers.What about the others?Well Facebook bought some time by acquiring Instagram and copying the best parts of Snapchat (stories), but their core product isn't all that cool anymore.Apple hasn't done anything new in a while, and eventually people will stop getting so e...","72,244 followers",Rohan Kamath,4K,213,29.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-an-upper-limit-to-how-large-and-profitable-the-top-technology-companies-can-become-Amazon-Google-Apple-etc-or-will-they-keep-growing-forever

So let me tell you how I overcame this obstacle.First, let me paint the picture. I was a new single father of 4 young children. (Full custody) And after a year of commuting from PA to my job in DC, I just couldn't do it anymore and I lost my job.So I decided to start my own business. I borrowed from family and I dipped into the modest savings I had. This first business had a nice run (24 months), but after signing a bad deal with a national distributor, the business failed. I was broke and already $100's of thousands in debt to friends, family and vendors.However, I didn't want to quit. So I swallowed my pride, applied for food stamps and low income health insurance for my kids. I then signed a really shitty deal to access the tiny bit of equity I had in my house. I moved my whole family in with my parents and I rented out my house. Between my parents help, $500/month positive cash flow from the rental, a credit card with $6k limit and the government assistance, I was able to live and my children didn't suffer too much.I used the equity in my house to hire a tech firm to build out a prototype of a product idea I had thought of during my first business. (I'm a non-technical founder) I went to our local sheriff's office and asked them if they would be willing to try using the prototype, they said yes. When I ran out of money the prototype was about 40% complete, but the sheriff's office had already made an arrest that they generated from tips delivered through the technology. So, they invited me to present it at their annual conference (I told them I was broke, so they didn't charge me).At the annual conference someone watching my presentation asked me to build a version of the tech for their crime stoppers program. $7,200.I then starting building the tech using the prototype as the base point. At this same time I crossed paths with a friend from college. He was out of work and I asked him to help me. He agreed and he cashed in on a small savings he had and we used that $25k to float us.At the same time all of this was happening I learned of a local program (Ben Franklin Tech Partnership) that just started to help create tech companies in my area. (Rural Pennsylvania). I contacted the program director she interviewed me and invited me in.I was accepted to their program. The first challenge they gave me was build a team, so I found two brilliant developers that were looking to build names for themselves. We worked out a deal and I had a team. With a team in place, I received an investment of $25k through the program.They then gave me challenge number 2, get a real customer. So I went out and showed several of the regional police departments and district attorney's what I was building. One of them saw the vision, and purchased out tech for the entire county (at a heavy discount), but still a low 6 figure deal.(I'm adding this note because it is important. I have a Sass model, the first county deal was 16 customers and I had them prepay for 3 years of subscription at a heavy discount to generate cash up front. When self funding, this is a crucial trick for success. Prepaid subscriptions)From there we received another investment of $75k. (These investments are designed to create jobs, they go toward payroll) We spent a year building version 1.0 and launched that with 16 police agencies in July, 2013.After that, building on one success after another we received another $225k investment and we now have 55 paying customers.There was a lot of struggle here so I don't want you to think it was easy. And I am by no means yet successful, but my technology works and I built it with hard work and sacrifice!! You can do it too as long as you believe in yourself.UPDATEThere have been many ups and downs since I first wrote this answer. Building a company is the hardest thing I have ever done. Harder than being a father, husband and son. The company is on track to hit 200 customers in 5 states by the end of the year. We have reached break-even after 7/8 years and may actually throw off a little profit for the first time in 2020.We have not raised additional money, despite the constant pressure of feeling like that is a bad idea. We have had plenty of people and groups wanting to own a piece of the company, but I just can’t get past the feeling that everyone is just “playing start-up”.I tell early stage people all the time, focus on building a business. The product, the idea, the business plan they want you to write..it all is meaningless if you’re not cashing checks.

Optical character recognition? Voice recognition? Face boxing in images?It’s not, or we wouldn’t have those names for it; it’s been spun off, and AI went back to being a research field immediately afterwards.None of this is really readily applicable to replicating someone else’s product.","135,472 followers",Hector Quintanilla,2.3K,1.2K,88.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-an-upper-limit-to-how-large-and-profitable-the-top-technology-companies-can-become-Amazon-Google-Apple-etc-or-will-they-keep-growing-forever

Think on the scale of a 6–12 months project.We had a PM who was excited to push us to some arbitrary deadline so that his boss could be happy with him hitting the deadline. There was a nice set of timelines and charts and whoozits and whatsits and so on explaining this brilliant plan.The entire team of developers and QA’s was stoked. We were going to do this in like 2 months with plenty of time to hit the 3 month later launch date. Oh, and this was attached to a larger arbitrary goal (ever heard of OKRs? or KRs? Or Quarterly Targets? Or Big Rocks?, it was one of those deals).After the full presentation of the plan was complete, I raised my hand and asked a question.“That’s a great plan, but what happens when it doesn’t work?”The room filled with silence. I got some sour looks, but I continued.“There are a bunch of unknowns. We don’t know how long issues X, Y, and Z will take at all. We are guessing and hoping for the best. Yet, every time we do this we uncover some messy thing that often takes weeks or months to unravel. What makes you think this will be any different?”The PM went on to explain that we really needed to hit our quarterly targets and that reality was basically unacceptable to them or their boss.I said, “Okay, well best case scenario is 6 months, it will probably take 12. Even if you don’t like it, plan accordingly.”Long story short, it took at least 12 months. I left the team before the project finished.The point of the story is not that I was right. It’s that most programmers love optimistic estimates. They want to say that something will be done quickly so that they look good to their boss and teammates.In almost every case something goes wrong that makes things take longer. Unforeseen problems and so on.In my experience, great programmers know that things will go wrong. They plan for it. They can usually tell you in advance what parts of the software are most likely to cause problems and sometimes even can pinpoint why.Unfortunately, honesty can be quite unpopular as great programmers aren’t often listened to unless they are in a position of authority. It is often the opinion of the most optimistic (or foolish) person that wins the day, even if it leads to catastrophe.Great programmers know-BrianP.S.
