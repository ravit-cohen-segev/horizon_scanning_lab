There is a project which has got a masternode very easy to set up and pays back pretty good. The Divi Project has got a Divi masternode which has got five tiers, and you can start by getting 100,000 Divi tokens.","3,398 followers",Raymond Scottman,1.1K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-profitable-Cryptocurrency-to-mine-in-2020-and-later

2,"NoCrypto can seem very remote, mining for me connects me to it all in a physical bridge. It keeps me interested.X16r arrived in March 2018 to hold back the tide of asics so interesting developments are abound!I use the pools to spot new projects and mine them. I also use solar and battery storage to make mining cheaper.There are always ways and means!",2 followers,Kelly Pearson,1.7K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-profitable-Cryptocurrency-to-mine-in-2020-and-later

Elon Musk wants to change the world we live in.De facto, everything Elon Musk says is listened to.Unlike other CEOs, Elon Musk has always been very close to his followers on social networks. He communicates in a direct way on Twitter to share his more or less crazy thoughts with more than 47 million followers.When Elon Musk talks about Dogecoin, everyone apparently takes his words serioElon Musk is a very successful entrepreneur.He is a visionary who has achieved extraordinary success with SpaceX and Tesla in particular.Many people worship him as one of the greatest entrepreneurs of our time.

He communicates in a direct way on Twitter to share his more or less crazy thoughts with more than 47 million followers.When Elon Musk talks about Dogecoin, everyone apparently takes his words seriously.Even though he said he was joking with Dogecoin, some people don't understand him at all. This triggers Pump & Dump movements on this cryptocurrency which is nothing but a joke.Elon Musk is so influential that he manages to do almost the same on Bitcoin by sending contradictory messages. He supports Bitcoin and then says that Bitcoin is almost as ""bullshit"" as fiat money.The best advice I can give you is not to attach too much importance to what Elon Musk says about cryptocurrencies.This will save you time and money.","8,618 followers",Abdullah Shiryar,9.2K,182,7.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Did-Elon-Musk-start-a-cryptocurrency

And although he didn’t mention it, I’m pretty sure he insists not just on low energy usage, but also on transactions “sticking” :D You don’t want to send somebody a Tesla only for them to gPretty much any Proof-of-Stake crypto will do.In PoS consensus isn’t based on how much energy and hardware you have, but how much money you have (which in the end is what PoW does as well, except with an intermediary step - it uses your hash rate as a proxy for how much money you have - so PoS just “cuts out the middle man”, basically).Only problem is, PoS is quite complicated, and currently a bit untested.

It's hard to know for sure but by comparing Elon with most other bright people that I have worked with, I would put his IQ at 160-165. He is very smart but he is also very determined and hard working. Together with his intelligence and vision, hard work is what makes him so successful. Did I mention that he works very very hard?
