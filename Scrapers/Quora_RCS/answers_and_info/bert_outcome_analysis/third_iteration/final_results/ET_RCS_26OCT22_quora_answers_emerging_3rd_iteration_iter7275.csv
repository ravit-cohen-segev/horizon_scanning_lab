0,"Believe it or not,Leopards instinctively have a hunting style that seems to specialize on nabbing humans more than anything else. They ambush near water or open land, and they only strike when the back of your head is to them. They have no problem jumping on anything taller, bigger or louder than them. They have a history of not letting weapons spook them (which lions and tigers almost always ran from). And two legged creatures frequently show leopard attacks in the fossil record.

They ambush near water or open land, and they only strike when the back of your head is to them. They have no problem jumping on anything taller, bigger or louder than them. They have a history of not letting weapons spook them (which lions and tigers almost always ran from). And two legged creatures frequently show leopard attacks in the fossil record. They can burst up trees to kill tree climbers, and the natural human bed (tree limbs, homes on stilts, hammocks, tents) don’t seem to stop them.To make it worse, animals that we as humans have had a long history of taming (wolves, dholes, cheetahs, baboons, sheep, small bears, manageable monkeys and apes [docile, easy to control, won’t maul you]) actually get leopards attention, and become major targets for leopards too. Meaning they may see our pets just as appetizing as us. Meaning if we have our furry friends with us or not, we’re screwed either way. (Congolese and Ugandan people had a very long history of taming and controlling leopards and hyenas, possibly on purpose due to this. Leopards in Congo, Benin, Uganda were seen by those empires as “the finest/top tier/diamond standard of guard dog/pet anyone could have.” Like having a Limited SE Spyder GT today.The tiger has a reputation for manhunting too, but we know tigers have cultures. One watches how something is done and copies it, or either sits down and figures out something. Then, that is taught to the children, who pass it on to their own kids and to their peers. Tigers easily could’ve watched leopards and simply copied it and passed it on. Same for lions.Another terror we have learned of thanks to oral history that has been kept for a VERY long time, would be the(Remember, oral history and how it is kept is NOT the same as urban myths or rumors. Ancient cultures, and any culture that is determined to keep oral history of things follow a tedious, exhausting and rigorous method. Gossip was one thing, but oral history, it’s keepers, and the apprenticeships for it were taken as more seriously than many today would take something like Yale.)Harpagornis belonged to the harpy eagle family, which is the strongest family of eagles to exist. A small harpy eagle can crush a man’s arm bones just by squeezing tight on a perched arm. Take into account that when a eagle kills prey, the usually like to pick up speed, and slam into their victim with those long talons, breaking bones, shattering nerves, tearing muscles, and puncturing organs and arteries. A American golden eagle can pick up a small goat, so a adult harpagornis would have no problem hunting and putting down a human being less than 5′8″ and under 180 pounds if it really wanted to. A eagle like that could kill someone as huge as 6′7″ and 340 pounds by slamming into them at peak speed and in the back or chest. They probably couldn’t carry the corpse away, but still, the prey is dead.The closest we can get to learning historical accounts of harpagornis is only by getting a glimpse into by reading about the poukai.PoukaiPoukai - WikiVividlyEDIT:But, our main offenders would be, more than anybody else, more than any cat, bear, or large carnivore…ISEDIT:EDIT:The Artist & The Story-keeper",2 followers,Sergio Diniz,3.9K,2.1K,17.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-animals-used-to-hunt-early-humans-And-at-which-point-did-early-humans-develop-sufficient-technologies-that-allowed-them-to-no-longer-worry-about-predators

Fire predates most weapons as creating them requires fire. Once again, in Africa most predators hunt during the night to avoid overheating from chasing a prey. Fire at night could keep pretty much all of their predators away.I think the question is asking what was the weapon that ultimately turned early humans from being a prey to a predator on a constant basis.",4 followers,Euan Monaghan,650,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-animals-used-to-hunt-early-humans-And-at-which-point-did-early-humans-develop-sufficient-technologies-that-allowed-them-to-no-longer-worry-about-predators
3,"Even in modern times polar bears and tigers (in the Sunderbands) routinely hunt humans who enter their environment.And sharks, bears, wolves, lions, crocodiles will on occasion hunt humans if the opportunity arises.So we’re really talking about a gradual transition from predation being a routine fact of life for our ancestors to it being a rare and unusual event that we would not expect in day to day life, most of the time.The biggest inflection point in this transition was probably the invention of controlled use of fire, roughly 1 million years ago.",116 followers,Pearl Cloudi,12.5K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-animals-used-to-hunt-early-humans-And-at-which-point-did-early-humans-develop-sufficient-technologies-that-allowed-them-to-no-longer-worry-about-predators

5,"What preyed on early humans?Oh, the usual suspects: lions, leopards, hyenas, perhaps even baboons.What technology allowed them not to worry about predators?I don’t think they could ever stop worrying, but they could keep them at bay for a while.It is very likely that the first weapon that could drive off predators were thrown stones. A troop of twenty hominids could keep up a barrage that could drive lions from their kill. The stones need not have been thrown with great force or accuracy, if enough were being thrown, and were heavy enough to hurt.What preyed on early humans?Oh, the usual suspects: lions, leopards, hyenas, perhaps even baboons.What technology allowed them not to worry about predators?I don’t think they could ever stop worrying, but they could keep them at bay for a while.It is very likely that the first weapon that could drive off predators were thrown stones.

FRWhy do the French use the rooster as a symbol of their country?Why don't the French use air conditioning?Why do French people eat snails?Why don't the French speak English?Why are the French so romantic?Why do French people like to surrender?Why do French people have black hair?Why don't the French install air conditioners?Why don't the French eat pork feet?Why are the French so thin?Why are there so many blacks in France?Why doesn't France sell air conditioners?Why is France a permanent member of the UN Security Council?Why did France surrender so quickly?Why does France not allow air conditioning to be installed?Why does France beat Libya?Why is there no air conditioning in France?Why does France help Lebanon?Why can't France beat Germany?Why does France like to surrender?4.

At present, the United States bans Huawei and can restrict TSMC's contract manufacturing for Huawei. It also closes the Chinese consulate and rivals China.Americans are tall and like to drive pick-up trucks, they do not eat carps, do not use WeChat, do not wear masks, are not afraid of the Covid-19 virus, they are very bad, killed Indians many years ago, and drink hand sanitizer. Americans do not like Chinese.Britain is a country with no air conditioning, many gay men, a small country, and a queen. Britain has separated from Europe and has good relations with the United States, and has returned Hong Kong to China. It used to be a country where the sun never sets, but the current cure rate for the Covid-19 is very low.The British are prone to baldness, they like to wear wigs and hats, they love to hold a walking stick, they like to drink tea, especially black tea, and they also like Chinese women. The number 13 is taboo. They are bad but smart.France is a country with many blacks who like to surrender and surrender quickly. It is still a permanent member of the United Nations. This country can't beat Germany, but it beats Libya. PS, France does not sell or allow air conditioners to be installed.The French are very thin, some have black hair, are very romantic, do not eat pig's feet, do not use air conditioning, do not speak English, like to surrender, and use roosters as a national symbol.Germany is a powerful country that has launched World War II. It has slaughtered Jews, raised Nazism and attacked Poland and the Soviet Union. There are currently US troops on their land.The Germans once hated and killed Jews. They love garlic and potatoes, live long, and are smart.Japan is a country that once invaded China, did not fight the Soviet Union, but sneaked into the Pearl Harbor of the United States, and then was bombed by nuclear weapons, thus surrendering unconditionally. This country is now very developed, also called the Neon Country, and there are many pornographic films.The Japanese were short, abnormal, and terrifying. They invaded China and killed many people in Nanjing. They like Chinese women, eat natto, drink ice water, live a long life, and have a culture of suicide by cutting their abdomen.That’s it, pretty stupid thinking about western countries, right?

And the ranking of 5 countries in each province of China is the same.What I want to say1. This answer is still highly one-sided. Although I have used Baidu's data, it cannot fully express the comprehensive understanding of ordinary Chinese about these five Western countries.2. Stupidity knows no borders. When I see these stupid questions raised by Chinese people about Western countries, I feel familiar, just like the many stupid questions about China I have encountered on Quora.3. People always tend to use simple labels to understand different countries and their people. This approach does not require brainpower and has a good spread effect, but this is the worst way to understand the whole of humanity.4. The sad thing is that many politicians are using the characteristics of ordinary people labeling things to gain their political interests. For example, the famous “king of know”, Mr. Trump.5. Human beings should be seen as a whole. If we can tear off the labels attached and to learn and understand the history, culture, customs, economic, military, and political structure of each country and nation, then we can possibly build a better world and peaceful life.

20,"It is a very US English centred question. I just answered another simpler variant asking is it necessary to learn foreign languages. Thing is it is necessary and it is law if you are a European. In fact it is common place globally. I have spent years working with language services and teaching and translating. Oscar Wilde said that the Americans and British are divided by a common language. It is true. We use different filler words, our language is nuanced differently & very importantly we pace our speech at different rates.

I just answered another simpler variant asking is it necessary to learn foreign languages. Thing is it is necessary and it is law if you are a European. In fact it is common place globally. I have spent years working with language services and teaching and translating. Oscar Wilde said that the Americans and British are divided by a common language. It is true. We use different filler words, our language is nuanced differently & very importantly we pace our speech at different rates. Many Irish and British people will have felt interrupted by US speakers who misinterpret pauses as a sign that that we have finished our thoughts and are opening. I often joked to my students that it would be easier to teach native speakers of English how to speak clearly in a manner which was easy to understand. To a certain extent “globish”& so most Europeans learn English as their foreign language. The quality of acquisition varies a lot. Nederlands and the Nordic states (Iceland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland) are generally regarded as having the finest speakers of English as a foreign language. In most of those cases the native languages belong to the same language family as English (Germanic) but in the case of Finland it may probably be blamed on them having the best education system in the world. One reason why they are ranked so high (they say) is that homework is forbidden and learning is child centred. Language acquisition in southern and eastern Europe is markedly lower. There is an interesting contrast between Spain (or the Spanish state) and Portugal. The Portuguese are ranked higher than their neighbours. This is often put down to the use of subtitles. The Portuguese use them on TV whereas the Spanish dub. Many Spanish speakers I have taught were already bilingual having grown up Catalan. Their excuse was that they already speak a global languageI would argue that except for the majority of Americans (ignoring those who speak Spanish as first tongue) it is a silly question. IT is law in Europe. It is part of required education even if we are home schooled and taught that the world is 400 years old and dinosaurs ran around with the twelve apostles¨’ wives.As a translator and speaker of 7 languages married to a linguist and speaker of 9 (5 of them different from each other) our little homestead is a wee bit reliant on others not doing the language thing. We are also the sort of people who get to try out apps and software. We make money cleaning up the mess such software leaves. AI has not reached that stage of cognitive linguistics.I’d read again that before lying there.think about that - what does it mean??I had read (past tense) again before telling an untruth over in that place yonder??I would read that (conditional) again before placing myself in a supine or prone position& on and on - ambiguity. context, nuance, slang, sarcasm…..When a European (Irish/British/Scandi/Dutch) says they are pissed - they are drunk. When a US/Canadian says they are pissed they are angry.how does an app tell the difference? My wife is true polyglot, her abilities are outstanding. Her English is almost “too good”. When she wants she sounds US and wanders around her accents and dialects. Other times she sounds Scandinavian. Sometimes she sounds Irish but not my kind of Irish. Perhaps an app could be designed to recognise accent? (I very much doubt that) but in her case - how would it really know??? I often suspect that many Americans are in fact scared of learning languages and it is a psychological weak point of their culture, the soft underbelly of arrogance. I do not wish to be rude. But that is often how it seems. Not too long ago I remember an incident in a bar where a young American insisted that the person she was speaking with was wrong. Her app had translated the word properly. She trusted the app. The person she was speaking to heads up the linguistic faculty at the local university. Because that person spoke English without an accent (to the American girl at least) she presumed that she was a valley girl. vocal fry and whatever -Learn languages - it will enrich you. & in the future it may save your economy.what follows is the answer I gave to another variant of this question a few minutes ago.The necessity of learning a foreign language at any point in history has hinged on the needs of an individual and their wants or ambitions for their future or in certain cases the most simple decision made to simply survive & how those factors are effected by location.I am European, my native language is English but my national language is Irish Gaelic or Gaeilge. Both languages are official in my state. ‘in addition as of 2017 Shelta is recognised as the language of the Irish traveller ethnic minority. In the north of Ireland, English, Gaeilge and Ullans or Ulster Scots are recognised under the British Irish peace process. There are 24 official languages of the European Union.Historically those arriving in the USA had to learn English to integrate in society and find work opportunities. Of course the very first European settlers relied on those who had learnt the native languages to trade, guarantee their food supply and seek medical assistance. & I daresay many speakers of Iroquis learnt themoving on..,So of the speakers of the 3 first most spoken mother tongue languages on Earth, Mandarin, Spanish & English, we may quite properly term a great number of the anglophones andI could go on——I shall.The second biggest religion by number of adherents on Earth is Islam in one of its many forms or other. Practioners of all variants of Islam must learn prayers in classical Arabic are required to make a sincere effort to read their holy scripture in that language and that language alone. Even in Saudi Arabia that language is not native and may be properly considered “The Italian writer Primo Levi in his great workI would consider that this necessity to learn a foreign language is still felt throughout the world by prisoners.",0 followers,Claire Jordan,655,45.6K,295.7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Which-animals-used-to-hunt-early-humans-And-at-which-point-did-early-humans-develop-sufficient-technologies-that-allowed-them-to-no-longer-worry-about-predators
