The same sort of great thinkers that spent 200 years claiming heavier than air flight was impossible had to eventually shut up because there were wrong for 200 years and never were smart enough to know it. The current rash of “jobs will never go away” people are just as misguided.Jobs today are currently being replaced as fast they are being destroyed for two reasons.

The same sort of great thinkers that spent 200 years claiming heavier than air flight was impossible had to eventually shut up because there were wrong for 200 years and never were smart enough to know it. The current rash of “jobs will never go away” people are just as misguided.Jobs today are currently being replaced as fast they are being destroyed for two reasons. The first, and most important, is that society forces everyone to create new jobs for themselves if they want to eat. If you can’t find a normal job, you have to become self-employed and stand on a street corner and beg for money so you can eat. Or you become a criminal and steal for a living. Or you “fall in love” with a rich person and use their money to eat. Work, or die, that’s the society we live in, and that is preventing our work weeks and retirement age from shrinking as automation grows. If we had learned to start sharing the wealth of our automated economy people would be working for less than 40 hours a week and would be retiring sooner. That hasn’t happened because we haven’t learned to share, especially in places like the US and other underdeveloped nations.The second reason that we keep working is that our automation and AI aren’t as smart as humans yet. Our intelligence keeps us useful to the economy, it gives us a monopoly that pays. Even minimum wage workers have adaptive learning skills that surpass the best and most expensive AI systems. We cope with the unexpected far better than any AI current AI system.Currently, AI systems are smarter than any human but only in limited domains, like playing chess or Go, or other specific tasks. They don’t have our general adaptive learning skills yet. But every year, the scope and power of our AI systems expand. AI research has been on a constant growth path for 50 years whereas humans are not smarter today than they were 50 years ago. We are standing still, and AI is growing at lightning speeds compared to human intelligence.But in the next couple of decades, AI systems are on track to reach general human intelligence and then fly right past us. When this happens, the monopoly on intelligence that makes us useful to the economy will vanish. We will become outdated, unemployable workers that can’t compete with the machines for any job any more than we can do math better than a calculator today.It will take more than just the powerful technology for us to lose our jobs. The entire economy has to be retooled to convert from a human-centric workforce to an automated workforce that will take decades. Just as the internet explode in the 1990s once technology passed a cost and power threshold but here we are in 2022, almost 30 years later, still trying to retool our society to convert the entire economy to a network-connected phone app. The conversion from an economy driven by human workers to one driven by machines will take time as well. But in time, humans will no longer work for a living at all. The machines will do all the stuff we call “work” today.But most importantly, we have to stop forcing everyone into wage slavery before we can take advantage of automation. We will still need to use capitalism for the machine economy to optimize itself to maximize the gq2uality and value of goods being delivered. But we won’t have to work to get money to pend. People will get their money as a free handout, just like we don’t have to pay for the right to vote, and won’t have to be wage saves for the right to use a share of the robotic output. Everyone will get free money in the form of a Basic Income from birth to death. This will represent our individual share of the output of the automated economy. We will convert society from one driven by competition and wage slavery, into one where people are truly free to do whatever they want with their lives. We will be very busy working to create the best life we can, but we won’t be slaves to money anymore.We should already be using a Basic Income system today to share the wealth of automation. But because most people can’t understand what is happening, we cling to a backward view of work and purpose that makes everyone wage slaves that can’t even afford to retire anymore while the 1% control trillions of dollars of automation wealth like Bezos, Zuckerberg, etc.Even though people could still work for money in a post automation society, it won’t be a job in the sense it is today. Just as someone might pick up a hobby business for the fun of it in retirement today, people in the future might have hobby jobs as well. We will do some type of work because it’s something we find it fun and enjoyable, and the money we make will not support us, but it will help pay for our hobby. It's easy to have a hobby job when all your basic survival needs are taken care of with a pension — which is what everyone will have staring at birth in the post-automation world. So though some people will choose to charge for their hobby work, it won’t be anything like the “jobs” of today in our work or die world, so I don’t think it’s fair to call them “jobs”. This is why I say 100% of jobs will be lost.","2,590 followers",Aakash Dhoundiyal,4.7K,99,2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-first-three-jobs-you-can-think-of-off-the-top-of-your-head-that-were-killed-by-technological-advances
7,"I feel compelled to answer this question, because I disagree with most of the answers here.The common answer here seems to be: yes it will kill jobs, but only the jobs low on the food chain, and it will create more jobs to at least offset the jobs it does kill.I disagree. I think AI will kill jobs, and over time, AI might kill most “jobs” as we know them.

I think AI will kill jobs, and over time, AI might kill most “jobs” as we know them. I think that people are somewhat complacent in regard to the economic impact of AI, and will likely be ill-prepared for the changes we have to adapt to in the not-so-distant future.First, let's start with the comparisons to machinery and automation. They did indeed put factory workers out of work. In that respect, I agree AI today is similar in many applications, replacing workers who have less specialized skills, perhaps call center operators, office assistants (in a limited extent), and maybe soon, taxi drivers and truck drivers. But I would argue that AI is fundamentally different from machinery or most of the other analogies commonly made when answering this question, because AI is growing and is unlikely to stop growing. It's growing in breadth (of applications and industries), in geographic and economic scope, and in power (it's capacity to address increasingly complex tasks). A more fitting analogy would be machinery in an automobile plant that not only made the parts one day, but then learned how to assemble them the week after, and then how to design cars a year later.I think that there is little that is out of reach for advanced AI of the future. Let's leave the question of the AI singularity alone for now. Instead, I think that deep learning efforts at Google and elsewhere are making AI systems learn faster and faster, with a growing rate of acceleration. Advanced AI can now address increasingly complex tasks including medical diagnosis, stock market trading, weather prediction and human behavioral modeling. Very soon, it will be able to take the place of certain types of teachers, and find a role in education. It can already deal with complex systems in software and mathematics, and seems to be only limited in applications that require interactions with the physical world (sensors are still imperfect), and with people.So without projecting too far into the future, we can ask the question, what jobs will NOT be killed by AI? Jobs that involve labor are already (or soon to be) replaced. Jobs that require logical reasoning are being replaced, albeit at a slower rate. What are the qualities that humans have that cannot be captured by AI? Perhaps creativity, emotional responses? So perhaps researchers in academia will survive longer than most, and artists (though AI stylistic mimicry is already quite impressive and their results enjoyable), and counselors/psychologists/case workers, and decision makers like CEOs who cannot be predictable or error prone. And hopefully software engineers and algorithm designers who develop AI systems.This leaves a very, very small portion of today's jobs intact. Many say: we just need to train people to fill higher level jobs created by AI, e.g. Programmers, ML researchers. But this is no easy feat. The US educational system is struggling to meet the demands created by advanced technology today. This failure is in part responsible for the economic divide plaguing the country today. The challenge of educating the public for a job market that is both decreasing in scope and increasing in complexity, is nothing we've ever faced before.I am far from original in this opinion. But if I had to guess, I would say that AI will put far more people out of work than we can (re)train in time. That will have significant economic repercussions as corporations seeking to minimize cost will do so at the cost of rising unemployment. There will need to be dramatic changes in social policies in order to avert large scale economic disaster, first dramatic rises in minimum wage, then eventually some type of universal income/welfare. It's the kind of change that requires significant leadership in our government, something that seems woefully absent today.",169 followers,Ian Mathews,500,106,13.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-first-three-jobs-you-can-think-of-off-the-top-of-your-head-that-were-killed-by-technological-advances

Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party. Because radiation from nuclear accidents is apparently scarier than way more people dying of regular pollution constantly and the total annihilation of all life on Earth as the oceans boil away.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-first-three-jobs-you-can-think-of-off-the-top-of-your-head-that-were-killed-by-technological-advances
