But generally,Technology is backed by science, and science to the ancients was a philosophical activity. Scientific research as we know it, did not exist, and there wasn’t any sense of a “scientific enterprise” or “scientific endeavour”. They didn’t invest in science as something from which vital aspects of ordinary life, pubic order, general economy and even the environment depended on; which is what we do.In Antiquity, technologies were considered instrumental to attain what were thought to be higher aims. These were usually defined by philosophy, and were essentially about goodness, virtue, fame and honour, happiness and fortune; about the human person, power and glory, society, politics, and how men related to the gods. Because if the gods were not on your side, you were lost, and no technology could have helped you; on the contrary, it would have turned against you. To the ancients, therefore also to ancient Romans of any age, a more advanced people would have been one who had developed an extraordinary sense of religious “piety”, and therefore was dear to the gods, and was able to fathom their laws and designs, mainly through divination, astrology, or even some sort of direct contact as it happens in early epics. It would also be a people which lived a life of honour, civility, tranquillity (or else fame and glory), and enjoyed good governance. Technology was at best subsidiary to all that, and in that sense was considered no less important than rituals and magic. In fact, from the golden maids forged by Hephaestus inJust to give an idea of the context in which one should place ancient technology to better understand what it meant to the ancients (Romans included), think that many scientifical treatises were written in verses; so were Empedocles’ and Lucretius’Consider also that to live an “advanced” life, the ancients already had the most intelligent, versatile and sophisticated machines possible: human beings. Slaves, legally tools and not persons, were regarded as indispensable to ensure decent living standards to any respectable freeman. Arguably, reliance on slavery was one of the main reasons why ancient technology (so as ancient economy) never went very far. Besides this, high-end technology had also a much lower diffusion than modern one. Technological gadgets and complex machines were produced for very specific uses, like the Antikithera mechanism, Heron’s inventions, or Archimedes’ mirrors. They were meant mostly for institutions, not for single individuals. Each piece was unique because it had to be crafted by hand. They were all works of highly specialized craftmanship, therefore way out of the financial reach of the common people.

In my article, I talk about the Greek historian Thoukydides (lived c. 460 – c.  400 BC), who rejected the idea of an ancient Golden Age. Instead, he believed that humanity was growing steadily more advanced and that the Greeks of very early times must have been exceedingly primitive compared to Greeks of his own era.There were certainly Romans who thought similar things, although I cannot think of any specific examples off the top of my head. Nonetheless, I’m sure that even the ancient Romans who did realize that humans were growing more technologically advanced probably wouldn’t have imagined the kinds of technologies we have today.Back then, technological progress was moving much more slowly than it is today and I’m sure that even most progressive-minded Romans probably would have assumed that it happened at a constant rate. As it turns out, though, technological progress is exponential; every new invention makes the next invention come a little bit faster. Consequently, we have technologies today that few people in ancient times would have even dreamed of.ABOVE: Image of a man dressed in a less-than-historically-accurate Roman soldier costume riding on a Segway poorly disguised as a chariot",18 followers,Ollie Tizzard,4K,113,1.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-advanced-thing-humans-have-made

The modern world is embodied by the “Revolution of Expectations” which means that each generationThe very instability of the 21st century is the failure of conditions of the average person to improve in accord with expectations. This leads to massive discontent, which is profoundly destabilizing to institutional government. The rise of fascism and communism, government by “strongmen” and dictatorship in general are direct outgrowths of this fundamental discontent. None of that existed in the Ancient or Medieval world. Society was static, history was static, and hardly anybody expected the future to be in any real sense “better” than the present. Quite the opposite!The Medieval Church adopted a similar mythology to the Ancients:These mythological ages are sometimes associated with historical timelines. In the chronology ofThis attitude is not only backward looking to an imaginary “Golden Age” but it is essentially static. Things cannot improve in the future as a result of improvements in technology, because the morals of man are corrupt. The best that can be done by government is to order society so that the natural violent and greedy impulses of man are suppressed.This naturally excuses all kinds of tyranny. The rule of aristocracy is based on that premise — the inherent fallibility of man. Human society reflects man’s essential corruption and cannot really be improved.The modern world today is essentially a battle between the Enlightenment view embodied in the Declaration of Independence and similar documents all over the world — that “that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights and that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness” — versus the ancient view of man, which is almost totally the opposite; that Man is fallible and imperfect and the search for human happiness on earth is a hopeless quest; thus people should just defer to authority because existing institutions are as good as anybody can hope for.Technological change and improvement in Man’s power over nature can be either good or bad, the future can be fundamentally better or worse, depending on human choice (do we address Global Warming for instance, or throw up our hands in despair and submit to the destruction of civilization)? But, this very view of man’s perfectibility is a totally modern invention.

You get to be friends with your adult kids and then have time to live your own life too.Also, when your kids are young and require a lot of energy investment from you, you'll have it to give.  From carrying a pregnancy to labor and delivery and right through walking all night with a colicy baby to teaching a kid how to walk and then ride a bikeIMO the belief that people can be just as good parents when starting later is a huge piece of cultural misinformation, a fantasy we tell ourselves to justify our over-emphasis on career at the expense of family.People should become parents when and if they want (and should have only as many kids as they want), but waiting longer makes things more difficult, not easier.",94 followers,Miranda Drew,1.4K,0,0,2011,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-advanced-thing-humans-have-made

I was planning to become a Master/Mistress of the Universe and had been pregnant at 20 (and terminated the pregnancy) before, so I did not think fertility would be an issue once I stopped using birth control.  Fortunately my female mentor, a very powerful EVP at a Fortune 100 company, told me that her only regret was not having children.  She told me that if I wanted a family I should start sooner rather than later.At 30, I started trying to get pregnant.  After a year of not conceiving, I consulted with my OB/GYN;  she put me on Clomid, which made me moody, sick, and tired.  After a few months I stopped taking it and decided if I did not get pregnant in the next year, I would re-visit with her to discuss the next steps.Fast forward to age 33, three years after initially pulling the goalie;  I was finally pregnant without aide.  But one year without getting pregnant is considered ""infertile"" in the medical community.  Wanting to have additional children after my first child took almost-heroic measures (seeing a fertility specialist, etc.). Finally, almost four years later, I had my second child.  I was ""only"" 37.  I have been off birth control since the age of 30;  I have had one miscarriage since my last child (at age 39), and have never been pregnant since.  My OB/GYN said my last pregnancy was likely an abnormal fetus that had miscarried.If I never had the ""children"" discussion with my old mentor, I might have waited until I was too old to have children.  I might not ever had the ability to become pregnant, and that discussion happened when I was 28.","15,438 followers",Steven Ussery,749,20.4K,29.1M,2014,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-advanced-thing-humans-have-made

I feel I received a lot of practical life experience that came with the wisdom of the two of them. I can wrap presents and curl ribbon. I can use a drill and change a tire. I can feed my children and myself with something creative and under 10 bucks. I can make homemade salad dressing withour using google. I don’t have to be constantly entertained. I think the amount of patience I have as an is largely due to the massive amounts of errands I ran with my mother. No electronics to entertain me! I had my good old fashioned mind, and a book if I was lucky. How I ever became a nurse is a mystery- as we used home remedies for illness. My parents had routine and structure, they worked hard, got up on time for work, and gave me lasting life lessons that unbeknownst to them have helped me through major hardships in my life.But they are old. And now I have the worry and the grief of knowing that they will not be around as long as other parents of my peers. My dad- once a stubborn and independent man has given up his car keys, and is embarrassed when I reach my hand out to steady him when he stands. My parents show visible signs of sadness when they are unable to play with my children outside and become unnerved at their noise and speed. My older sisters had the luxury of having their own children while my parents were still able to participate in events. My father will not see my children graduate, or marry. And that makes me sad.The worst, is comforting my mother while she confides in me that she feels that the world has no more use for her at her age. (She isn’t suicidal or depressed, just simply going through the last psychological stage of life). I do everything I can to comfort my parents and to protect them. Occasionally I will feel selfish and wish I could have them worry about ME. But that instantly disappears and we return to the topic of blood pressure medicine and the neighbor’s cat who has seizures.I love them dearly. I think if you are not in good health or have significant problems that could render you unable to provide for a child for years to come, then it might be wise to think on the decision for a bit. But I think we all have something special to offer as a parent- part of who we are and part of who we were.Edited to include the following:While I generally attempt to use good syntax and grammar, and appreciate those who spend their own personal time correcting others and pointing out errors, please understand that occasionally I will type as fast as I think, and this might result in a very offensive lack of a quotation mark or similar.

He had a little trouble when he came out, but once they helped jumpstart his breathing he could do it fine on his own.It was a difficult extraction and I ended up needing a blood transfusion because of a ruptured artery in my uterus.

If you face challenges getting pregnant at 30–35 chances are you would have had the same challenges even at 30. Before 30 is a different ball game because in addition to being in your 20s you will also have plenty time on your hand to try again a year later as well. You don't have that liberty when you're a few years older. You will however have a more settled life, likely a better partner, more patience and maturity to raise a child. Energy is debatable because I see lazy and less energetic and unfit 20 somethings who never worked out in their life and I can beat them at the gym at running or weight lifting hands down. So you can still have tons of energy in your 30s and 40s if you are fit and watch what you eat and workout. I feel like the pros outweigh the cons when you are 30+. 35 + is tricky and you will need a lot of patience and positive attitude and likely need artificial methods to get pregnant in most cases. That might be physically financially and emotionally challenging especially with possibilities like Down syndrome and other genetic issues. Then there are other things that happen when you may be pregnant and 35+ like increased chance of gestational diabetes etc. So while there are women who argue one can get pregnant at 35+ easily and things can go great, well things can but not for majority of them. But less than 35 yep likelihood of everything going well is very high and worth the risk of waiting until you're 30+.","115,111 followers",Daveed Phoenix,1.2K,9.9K,160.5M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-advanced-thing-humans-have-made
