Hell, the universities that got hooked up early let undergraduates on it.It just wasn’t very well known to the public, because unless you had certain qualifications (including having certain types of US government research grants) you couldn’t get connected.

So at first, there were just a few dozen schools and a very small handful of companies directly involved in supporting the network connected. So here is a map of pretty much *every single system* that was on the Arpanet in March 1977:It’s hard to make much of a dent on public consciousness when only the people at those sites that had userids on those particular computers had access.There was also the minor detail that the idea of a consumer-class personal computer did’t happen until the Radio Shack TRS-80 and Apple II in 1977 - so even if it *was* accessible to consumers, they wouldn’t have had anything to connect to it….Even by the time the university I worked for at the time got connected in 1984, there were only some 3,000 to 4,000 computers on it. Our connection of the 30 or 40 computers that were Ethernet networked grew the size of the Internet by around 1% on that one day - and this was the largest engineering school in New York state (sorry Cornell and RPI, Clarkson graduated more engineering students per year :)Oh yeah. At the time, Ethernet wasn’t a $5 chipset that moves bits at a gigabit. If you wanted to put a PC on an Ethernet, you were looking at a $500 plug-in card that did a whole whopping 10 megabits/second for short distances (inside a building). Systems that came with an Ethernet were usually workstations or servers or mainframes costing $5K and up.In fact, the “Al Gore invented the Internet” meme was actually more like “He wrote the legislation that changed the NSFNet’s (National Science Foundation Net) Acceptable Use Policy so that organizations that didn’t have those certain types of research grants could also get connected”. And that was a major game-changer that allowed widespread adoption of the technology and changed it from a research network into what we know today.Hobbe’s Internet Timeline gives a year-by-year breakdown of the history:the definitive ARPAnet & Internet history",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,739,9.4K,195.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Was-the-internet-a-top-secret-technology-used-by-NASA-in-the-60s-and-70s
1,The law changed in July of 1989 to prohibit smoking inside buildings at Kennedy Space Center. Prior to that time people regularly smoked in offices and conference rooms. It was horrible. I remember going to meetings and trying to hold my breath for an hour at a time.I'm not sure when smoking was prohibited in the Launch Control Center but I never saw that happen in the 80s.,1 follower,Tom Knight,828,532,1.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Was-the-internet-a-top-secret-technology-used-by-NASA-in-the-60s-and-70s
2,"Communicating with staff.I was talking with a retired engineer today about his experiences designing the actuators for the Apollo landing radar, and something occurred to me. You’d think the biggest difference between then and now is computers—what we can model today using high resolution computational fluid dynamics, back in the ‘60s required slide rules, estimation, batch mainframe processing and model studies. But in fact, those methods work, and while they are more expensive and inherently limited, they work very well.What’s really different, though, is that engineers in those days had noCommunicating with staff.I was talking with a retired engineer today about his experiences designing the actuators for the Apollo landing radar, and something occurred to me.

But in fact, those methods work, and while they are more expensive and inherently limited, they work very well.What’s really different, though, is that engineers in those days had no Google, no online journal search, no skype or email, no ubiquitous digital cameras or ability to send video files.If NASA needed to contemplate a change, they had a whole logistical system of secretaries and couriers and logistics services, just to get word out. They set up phone conferences by special arrangement using leased telephone trunk lines. They sent pictures—whether still or film—by physical mail. When time was of the essence, they got people on planes and flew in for a face-to-face meeting.And once they came up with a solution, they had typing pools to type up and copy memos to let people know, change-order processes to distribute the word and ensure compliance, and manuals printed and bound in three-ring binders so that pages could be replaced with updates or addenda could be added.And with all these limitations, they got to the moon after only an 8-year development program.","35,154 followers",C Stuart Hardwick,1.2K,12.3K,142.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Was-the-internet-a-top-secret-technology-used-by-NASA-in-the-60s-and-70s

5,"In order to compare the two, one needs to come up with some criteria first. It will not be an easy task though, as universities and times seem to be quite different.Soviet MIPT was conceived as a project to establish scientific leadership of USSR in the World. From the very beginning it was a small boutique organization that put all the best available people and resources together. Students were literally hunted across USSR and went through multiple very rigorous and non-standard tests administered by top academics face to face to be admitted.

From the very beginning it was a small boutique organization that put all the best available people and resources together. Students were literally hunted across USSR and went through multiple very rigorous and non-standard tests administered by top academics face to face to be admitted. The same academics were then teaching them in small groups (~5-10 people) in the beginning and in one-2-one setting later. The institute had a number of its own well equipped labs, but one of the innovations was that students were required to work on real research projects in leading academic institution of the country starting from the third grade (of 6). The main focus of the institute was fundamental science, although some engineering disciplines were also present. On the down side, this was a rather closed community. Students had less opportunity for collaboration and ideas exchange with other countries in comparison to US universities nowadays.I am less familiar with MIT, but to me it looks like a more typical university of outstanding quality. It is clearly larger and has a broader range of disciplines (including e.g. business administration and the likes). The entrance exams are standard, but the cut off is high. It is significantly more open to the world and significantly better financed. My understanding is that most students do their research in the labs of the institute, while studying, which is very different from MIPT.If you want to compare the quality of knowledge average student had in comparable subjects after completing either of the univetsities then and now, then I believe this could only be some fundamental discipline (everything changed a lot in 70 years passed) and here MIPT would have won hands down. The reason is the unique students taught individually by world famous scientisis with much less distraction and much greater commitment. Still, as I said, my knowledge of MIT is limited and situation is too hypothetical to consider this assessment seriously.","1,002 followers",Michael Woods,1.5K,107,598.1K,2016,https://www.quora.com/Was-the-internet-a-top-secret-technology-used-by-NASA-in-the-60s-and-70s

But sports games are hobbies, not events. There’s a key difference. For instance, see one of our best fields:Quite respectable, full-sized track, well-kept yard, logo, etc. But note the distinct lack of seating? Yeah, we play for fun, but we don’t expect anyone to actually come watch.In my entire time at the Institute, not a single person ever asked me to come watch a single athletic event.4: Lots of NumbersWhat did I study?
