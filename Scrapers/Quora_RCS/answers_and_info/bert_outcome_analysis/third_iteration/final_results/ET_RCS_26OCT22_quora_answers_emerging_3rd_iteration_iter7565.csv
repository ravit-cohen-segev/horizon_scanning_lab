Bitcoin, the first decentralized currency introduced in early 2000. Mining cryptocurrency is a complex procedure of verifying transactions and adding them to public ledger (blockchain). This ledger of past transactions is called the blockchain as it is a chain of blocks. The blockchain serves to confirm transactions to the rest of the network as having taken place. The blockchain is also responsible for releasing new bitcoins. Each of the many crypto coins in presence depend on the core idea of the blockchain.Process of MiningCryptocurrency was intended to be decentralized, secure and unalterable. So each and every transaction is scrambled. Once that scrambled transaction happens it's added to something many refer to as a ""block"" until the point that a settled number of transactions has been recorded.That block at that point gets added to a chain - the blockchain - which is available publicly. During mining cryptocurrency either Bitcoin, Dash, Litecoin, Zcash, Ethereum, & more, the miner has to compile recent transections into blocks and crack a computationally difficult puzzle. There are several online bitcoin mining sites. It has become a very popular way to earn money.Cryptocurrency is cryptographic, which means that it uses a special encryption that allows controlling the generation of coins and confirming the transaction. A block is pretty useless in its currently available form. However, after applying the algorithm to a specific block. Upon matching, the miner receives a couple of bitcoins. For earing bitcoin via mining, the miner has to be technical. Bitcoin mining for profit is very competitive.Bitcoin price makes it difficult to realize monetary gains without also speculating on the price. The payment is based on how much their hardware contributed to solving that puzzle. Miners verify the transactions, ensure they aren't false, and keep the infrastructure humming along.Best Coins to MineBitcoins are not a decent decision for starting diggers who take a shot at a little scale. The current in advance speculation and upkeep costs, also the sheer scientific trouble of the procedure, simply doesn't make it productive for buyer level hardware. Presently, Bitcoin mining is saved for expansive scale activities as it were. Litecoins, Dogecoins, and Feathercoins, then again, are three Scrypt-based digital forms of money that are the best money saving advantage for apprentices.At the present estimation of Litecoin, a man may gain somewhere in the range of 50 pennies to 10 dollars for each day utilizing customer level mining hardware. Dogecoins and Feathercoins would return marginally less benefit with a similar mining hardware yet are ending up more famous every day. Peercoins, as well, can likewise be a sensibly fair profit for your venture of time and vitality.As more individuals join the cryptocoin surge, your decision could get more hard to mine since the more costly hardware will be required to find coins. You will be compelled to either contribute vigorously on the off chance that you need to stay mining that coin, or you will need to take your income and change to a less demanding cryptocoin.Understanding the main 3 bitcoin mining strategies is likely where you have to start; this article centers around mining scrypt coins. Likewise, make sure you are in a nation where bitcoins and bitcoin mining is legal.Goal of MiningHow about we center around mining cryptocurrency. The entire focal point of mining is to accomplish three things:1. Give accounting administrations to the coin network. Mining is essentially every minute of everyday PC accounting called 'checking transactions'.2. Get paid a small reward for your accounting administrations by accepting fractions of coins each couple of days.3. Hold your personal expenses down, including power and hardware.Some Basic TermsA free private database called a coin wallet. This is a password-secured container that stores your earnings and keeps a vast record of transactions. A free mining software package, similar to this one from AMD, typically made up of cgminer and stratum.An enrollment in a web-based mining pool, which is a community of mineworkers who consolidate their PCs to increase profitability and wage stability. Enrollment at an online money exchange, where you can exchange your virtual coins for conventional cash, and the other way around. A reliable full-time web association, ideally 2 megabits for each second or faster speed. A hardware setup location in your basement or other cool and air-conditioned space.A work area or custom-fabricated PC intended for mining. Truly, you may utilize your present PC to start, yet you won't have the capacity to utilize the PC while the digger is running. A separate dedicated PC is ideal. Tip: Do not utilize a laptop, gaming console or handheld device to mine.These devices simply are not sufficiently successful to generate wage. An ATI graphics processing unit (GPU) or a specialized processing device called a mining ASIC chip. The cost will be anywhere from $90 used to $3000 new for each GPU or ASIC chip. The GPU or ASIC will be the workhorse of giving the accounting administrations and mining work.A house fan to blow cool air across your mining PC. Mining generates substantial heat, and cooling the hardware is critical for your prosperity. Personal interest. You absolutely require a solid appetite for reading and constant learning, as there are continuous innovation changes and new methods for upgrading coin mining comes about.The best coin mine-workers put in hours consistently considering the most ideal ways to adjust and enhance their coin mining performance.Cryptocurrency Mining Profitability Each time a mathematical issue is comprehended, a constant amount of Bitcoins are created. The quantity of Bitcoins generated per block starts at 50 and is halved each 210,000 blocks (about four years).The present number of Bitcoins awarded per block is 12.5. The last bock halving happened on July 2016 and the following one will be in 2020. The estimation of profitability can be made via use of various online mining calculators. Development of digital currency standards, for example, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash has prompted tremendous ventures by companies and this is required to aid in substantial development of the market in the near future.Cryptocurrency mining is a computationally intensive process, which requires network of several PCs for verification of the transaction record, known as the blockchain. The excavators are offered a share of transaction charges and gain a higher probability of finding another block through contributing high computational power.These support transactions help in giving enhanced security to network clients, and guarantees honesty, which is relied upon to be the noticeable factor affecting development of the global cryptocurrency mining market.",27 followers,Benjamin Price,1.2K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-mining-crypto-currency-still-profitable-and-how-do-I-do-it
1,"On the surface, Bitcoin and Litecoin have a lot in common. At the most basic level, they are both cryptocurrencies.

Whereas state currencies such as the U.S. dollar or the Japanese yen rely on political and legal mechanisms for value and legitimacy, cryptocurrencies rely only on the cryptographic integrity of the network itself. Yet Bitcoin and Litecoin also differ in important respects.Litecoin’s own developers have long stated that their intention is to create the “silver” to Bitcoin’s “gold.”Let me get started by telling you more about Bitcoin;it’s very easy to get started with an account and integrate it into your accepted forms of payment. Bitcoin walks you through the very short implementation period that involves a very straightforward set-up process. You don’t need a merchant account or any special equipment. It just requires a Bitcoin wallet that is located on your hard drive, mobile device, or in the cloud.However, I’ve found that Bitcoin lets you choose certain fees — plus, there’s no fee to receive Bitcoin. I’ve seen it improve my clients’ bottom line by cutting down the transaction fees they’ve paid.Bitcoin is just as real as fiat money, except Bitcoin can’t be printed endlessly.Payments are irreversible with Bitcoin and more secure than any traditional payments, merchants do not have to take the cost of chargeback fraud plus and can assure their customers that it’s a secure transaction process. Additionally, Bitcoin uses highly complex encryption, which makes it virtually impossible to fake a digital currency transaction. This encryption code is very difficult to break.Anyone, from any country, of any age can accept Bitcoins within minutes. There is no ID card, passport or proof of address that all conventional banks required to open an account. All you need to do to start sending and receiving Bitcoins is to download a Bitcoin Wallet program and generate a Bitcoin Address.You could have 1000s of different addresses if you wanted, there is no limit to the number of Bitcoin Addresses that you can have.Litecoin; litecoin can be said to be the Sliver to Bitcoin's gold. Litecoin (LTC) is a decentralized peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that was released on October 7th, 2011, and went live on October 13th, 2011.Litecoin serves the exact same purpose as Bitcoin. After all, it was one of the first Bitcoin forks.Litecoin is different in some ways from Bitcoin.The Litecoin Network aims to process a block every 2.5 minutes, rather than Bitcoin's 10 minutes. The developers claim that this allows Litecoin to have faster transaction confirmation.Litecoin uses scrypt in its proof-of-work algorithm, a sequential memory-hard function requiring asymptotically more memory than an algorithm which is not memory-hard.Do you know that you can earn so much more on cryptocurrency during this current fluctuations around Bitcoin and the likes? The platform that I have used in the past and recommend is: Cointerminal (cointerminaldotorg) I always try to introduce investors to the only platform i have invested and made a lot of profit on.I would love a lot to benefit from this opportunity cointerminal(www.cointerminaldotorg) is giving to support young investors interested in investing in any crypto currencies of there choice.They are currently giving more than 100% bonus i know this opportunity will not last forever and i am happy i benefit from it and right now i am still investing and making my profit . As a verified investor analyst I will advice Investors should try to invest in platforms like cointerminal(www.cointerminaldotorg) where investments can be multiplied and have your coin doubled after few days of investment.You will make a lot of profit.By far the most fundamental technical difference between Bitcoin and Litecoin are the different cryptographic algorithms which they employ. Bitcoin makes use of the longstanding SHA-256 algorithm, whereas Litecoin makes use of a comparatively new algorithm known as Scrypt.The main practical significance of these different algorithms is their impact on the process of “mining” new coins. In both Bitcoin and Litecoin, the process of confirming transactions requires substantial computing power. Some members of the currency network, known as miners, allocate their computing resources toward confirming the transactions of other users. In exchange for doing so, these miners are rewarded by earning units of the currency which they have mined.SHA-256 is generally considered to be a more complex algorithm than Scrypt, while at the same time allowing a greater degree of parallel processing. Consequently, Bitcoin miners in recent years have utilized increasingly sophisticated methods for mining Bitcoins as efficiently as possible. The most common method for Bitcoin mining consists of the use of Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). These are hardware systems that, unlike the simple CPUs and GPUs which came before them, can be tailor-made for mining Bitcoins. The practical consequence of this has been that Bitcoin mining has become increasingly out-of-reach for the everyday user.Scrypt, by contrast, was designed to be less susceptible to the kinds of custom hardware solutions employed in ASIC-based mining. This has led many commentators to view Scrypt-based cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin as being more accessible for users who also wish to participate in the network as miners. While some companies have brought Scrypt ASICs to the market, Litecoin’s vision of more easily accessible mining is still a reality, as most Litecoin mining is done via miners' CPUs or GPUs.While Bitcoin and Litecoin may be the gold and silver of the cryptocurrency space today, history has shown that the status quo in this dynamic and emerging sector can change in even a few months. It remains to be seen whether the cryptocurrencies with which we have become familiar will retain their stature in the months and years to come.I hope this write up help you with your question.",2 followers,Maurizio Fava,519,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-mining-crypto-currency-still-profitable-and-how-do-I-do-it

In other words, bitcoin is the money of the internet, unlike fiat, it is based on a totally different system (blockchain), is smarter and secure. This was a brief intro, I suggest you reading their whitepaper, you will get all of your answers there.Mining is the process of earning cryptocurrencies. Everyone can mine with appropriate hardware. Since blockchain is a decentralized platform, its members keep the security and they also need to solve certain puzzles that has been set up by the system. The system uses those puzzles to retain the supply balance of cryptocurrencies and the security of the blockchain. Those, who solve those puzzles first, enable new transactions to proceed, and they get the commission for those transactions. Also, the system issues rewards for the work in the form of cryptocurrencies. As a result, the miners earn cryptocurrencies with the help of their computational machines(hardwares) by opening new blocks for the transactions.This is basically how mining works.Blockchain is the system upon which cryptocurrencies (and not only) operate. The logic is that the information is being stored within blocks that are interconnected with each other. The members of the blockchain have free access to the information and they retain the security of the blockchain, since each of them has his/her own copy of records. If someone tries to scam any information, all of the members will immediately fix that, so it is impossible to cheat the system. The interconnection of the blocks makes sure that the operations within the blockchain are in proper order and derive from the logic of the previous block (like a computer programming code that follows step by step defined in the lines).","99,918 followers",Alcatraz Dey,9K,1.4K,68.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-mining-crypto-currency-still-profitable-and-how-do-I-do-it

So to keep track oImagine you live in an apartment with three friends. You guys sometimes do favours for each other like if you go to the store bob might ask you to pick up a beer and then pay you back 2 dollars later. Or you might ask Charlotte to give you a neck massage and pay her 10 dollars later. Now it really inconvenient going to the bank multiple times a day to pay people off immediately. So to keep track of this you write on a piece of paper, called a ledger, each of these transactions on a new line. The ledger may look something like this:“Bob owes Charlotte two dollars”“Colin owes Peter 1 dollar”and so on…At the end of the month you tally up all the debts and you find who gets what. Now once a month you go to the bank and cash out.Bob, Charlotte and You pictured above:)So why once a month… why not once a year. Why not just have the knowledge of who owes who and never actually cash out unless you need to.Well there are a few concerns with the above proposal but first lets see where bitcoin comes in.Think about bitcoin as IOUs , which you could cash out whenever you wanted. Instead of just separate IOUs you can trade them. For example if Charlotte owes me a dollar and I owe Bob a dollar well I would have one bitcoin from Charlotte which I give to Bob. So Charlotte owes Bob a dollar simplifying things.Now on our ledger we have each line representing a different transaction and that corresponding to each piece of data per transaction. While the ledger uses lines Bitcoin stores the data per transaction in something called a block. Like all the lines come together so we can see the entire ledger we arrange all the blocks together in a chain hence the method Bitcoin (Which is just the information about the transaction) tranfers over is called the blockchain. Now we can see who owes everyone per block. But lets say I only have 10 dollars in my account well if I give Charlotte 7, Bob cant do something for me that would cost 5 -right or I would have negative money. So bob has to know how much money I have.So each time a transaction in a block happens the computers broadcasts this to the rest of the world so everyone knows what has happened. (It turns out that the block has to be decoded then its appended to the end of the chain ~ this is where bitcoin mining comes into play)Finally whats to stop Bob just writing Charlotte owes me 100 dollars on the wall.

What if currency were regulated by mathematics rather than by any governments?Cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin etc..) are a digital form of money that run on a totally new monetary system, one that is not regulated by any centralized authority or tracked by some regular institution. Each digital currency is supported by a decentralized peer-to-peer network called the blockchain. Blockchain technology ensures that all cryptocurrencies are kept track of, regardless if they are being held in a digital wallet or being used in trading.The running of such a system effectively, however, requires an infrastructure that ensures that cheating and gaming the system isn’t possible. Bitcoin was the first to market, setting up a system in which two people - the sender and the receiver of coins - must sign off on payments to create a digital signature. Each person has a public and a private encryption key, which makes this possible. Every transaction is verified for accuracy, and the system is anonymous and totally transparent. At the center of this infrastructure is the ledger. So let’s dive into how that works.The Ledger: How Does It Work? & Who Owns It?A cryptocurrency has a ledger, where all transactions are made public so that total visibility is provided. Having a ledger forces everyone to ""play fair"" and takes away the risk of double spending.The ledger is a list of entries in a database that nobody can change without fulfilling specific conditions. Nobody owns the ledger or the cryptocurrency blockchain; instead, it’s decentralized meaning self-run and self-governed without the interference of outside parties.Verifying Transactions & BlockchainLet’s say that you want to invest in cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, through a major cryptocurrency exchange. After purchasing it, you decide to spend it. What happens now? At first, the transaction is unconfirmed, which means the transaction is not yet official, and it doesn’t become ""set in stone"" until it goes through a verification process. Once confirmed, the transaction becomes part of a record of historical transactions housed on the blockchain.Cryptocurrency Miners verify the transactions and then add them to the public ledger. They use powerful computers to solve complex math problems that are the key to the verification process. Cryptocurrency Mining is open source, so anyone can confirm a transaction, and the first miner to solve the problem gets to add a block to their transaction ledger. This process is called the ""proof-of-work system.""After adding a block to the ledger, the miner is given a reward for their efforts, which varies based on the cryptocurrency. For example, Bitcoin originally awarded 50 BTCs, but that award halves at preset times and today has decreased to 12.5 BTCs.",19 followers,Eric Muller,709,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-Bitcoin-and-how-does-it-work-How-do-I-get-a-Bitcoin

But I've been there. When you've seen your balance literally exploding overnight, suddenly it seems a looooong way down from where you are to where you were. To see a coin go from $1,000 to $10,000 in a month and then drop back down to $900 is like stepping into the ring with Iron Mike. The anticipation, expectation, thrill, mania, aggression and euphoria, until the opening bell rings, followed three seconds later with you on the canvas in cerebral-palsy-like defeat.Yeah, it's not fun. But if you want to enter the crypto world, you need to have your eyes wide shut (meaning closing your eyes to the horrors before you). That's the territory. Love it or leave it.Maximizing gains comes down to a number of factors;How patient are you at dealing with fear of financial losses if your crypto suddenly flash crashes or stays in a prolonged bear run, while dealing with other stresses in your life. Can you avoid the temptation of not cashing out some of your crypto to pay bills? Do you have the skills for delayed emotional gratification? While terraforming this new planet, do you have enough oxygen in the tank to wait for atmospheric equilibration? Can you switch off from focusing on crypto and forget it for six to twelve months while other things demand your attention? Tough questions you need to ask.If you have a steady job, are you prepared if you are retrenched and have to seek alternative employment? Do you have a Plan B to Plan Z when the shit hits the fan? You have to be able to ""go dark"" very quickly (see the bad things which can eventuate), knowing the world can be a tough place, and learn how to distinguish the shark fins from the dolphin fins. If you've never been punched in the face financially, all those magic plans can vanish in an instant. I'm not proud to admit I can go dark in about ten seconds. But it's what the past has taught me.How comfortable are you with your current lifestyle. If you're on a decent wage and are meeting current expenses, you might be able to put aside the short-term gains of crypto and wait. Factors such as relationships and children may put pressure on your need to expand your income to tolerate fluctuations in household expenses. If you don't want to suffer short term discomfort or seriously stress your comfort zone, just do what sensible people do, buy BTC and hold.Buy and hold. It may seem boring to some but it works.
