Computers and other such devices we given to us for making our life easier, but too much dependency on such devices has brought us to present alarming situation.Computers have been trained to paint pictures and compose music, but they have not yet masteredAs Conclusion, i feel technology is making us lazy as well as less intelligent. The amount we depend on technology today is unravel-able and this rudimentary conundrum has to be avoided.

3,"Servers, or more generally, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Designing infrastructure is a waste of time and energy for most solutions. Learning to design and configure server infrastructure is like learning to build log cabins or pound out horse shoes. Is there still demand for infrastructure design? Sure.

Beyond a general understanding, definitely not.Our company built a ridiculously complex application using nothing but Platform as a Service (PaaS) and serverless technology.

Beyond a general understanding, definitely not.Our company built a ridiculously complex application using nothing but Platform as a Service (PaaS) and serverless technology. We spent zero time and energy designing or specifying infrastructure. Focusing effort and investment on the actual problem allowed us to deliver sooner with higher reliability. And the cherry on top is that we only pay for service used. When our users are all snug in their beds, we’re not paying for idle capacity.There are two nuggets of advice to be found in responses to this question. First, do your present self a favor by learning what is necessary to solve the problem at hand. Second, do your future self a favor by learning a few additional things that look like they will soon become important and make you more valuable as a professional. Let me add one more thing. Do your soul a favor by learning something that makes you feel good for knowing it, whether it’s professionally valuable or not.",23 followers,Fred Mitchell,635,2.4K,7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Who-are-the-leading-providers-of-sentiment-analysis-for-social-media-data-and-which-companies-use-them-versus-developing-their-own-technology
4,"I think I say the same thing just about every time this question comes up:Don’t learn technology, learn to solve problems.Languages, frameworks and even computers themselves are just tools that help you solve a problem.

But just like any other tool if you don’t solve the problem first the tool doesn’t help.A very simple, very silly example:You are asked to build a 2 story building. You currently own a hammer. It’s your favorite hammer of all time and it truly is great.The non-problem solver would try to figure out how he/she could use the hammer to build the required building and spend a lot of time perhaps in the process. The really inexperienced non-problem solver probably would start hammering away on things since he/she does have the most favorite hammer.The problem solver figures out based on the problem what is needed to build the building, then goes and gets those resources and tools.Another example targets software developers. Typically, younger software developers start to develop favorites. IE they love C, or python, C# or Java, Swift or whatever. Then the younger developer tries hard to force fit a project into their favorite language or framework. Even if it is really the wrong tool for the job.A simple real world example: You love C#, .Net, mono etc. But you have to get something running on a BeagleBone Black running Linux.

5,"Lots of good answers already but here’s my perspective from three decades of experience.For any given software developer,I had a friend and coworker once tell me that “Every software job posting in Boulder requires Ruby on Rails now.” This was not true at the time and is very far from true today, about 5 years later.Developers need to keep abreast of technology and be learning constantly (or for at least a couple of decadeLots of good answers already but here’s my perspective from three decades of experience.For any given software developer,I had a friend and coworker once tell me that “Every software job posting in Boulder requires Ruby on Rails now.” This was not true at the time and is very far from true today, about 5 years later.Developers need to keep abreast of technology and be learning constantly (or for at least a couple of decades). However, since nobody can learn all the new languages, etc., its important to prioritize. Here are my rules of thumb.

Besides, if I am in the middle of something not completed, I feel silly talking about it at all. It’s not done yet!!!!If I need help with something, I know where to go find it. A colleague, Google, the internal Confluence, etc.I think it’s perhaps more beneficial for the juniors in the team. Some of the time. But even then, I wonder.Oh well, what can I do? It’s a fact of life in today’s world of software development. Perhaps the place I currently work at is doing it all wrong, anyway. Well, that is most certainly the case.Spinning forward a year later, I have left the software field, for the most part. I am making more money these days as a Patent Architect. No smelly sprints. No annoying stand-ups. All of it is gone.My vast knowledge of software technology coupled with my experiences with patents made me uniquely suited for this new job, for where else can you find someone who both knows software engineering and the law?Ironically, I have my ex to thank for the legal knowledge, as the divorce dragged on for 8 long years. I had to fire my lawyer early on and learn about the legal procedures myself. My patent was also involved in a counter lawsuit by the company I sold it to. So I learned a lot from those experiences.So what I am doing now is largely stress-free. And I like it that way. More money, less stress.

7,"We call something a waste of time is when we consider the time spent to perform the activity would be better spent doing something else. Otherwise, it’s a time well-spent.Since it depends on how the person conducting the activity thinks the activity contributed to what they want to achieve, what’s considered a waste of time for one might not be a waste of time for another.I personally don’t think learning any technology in particular would be a waste of time, since by learning it we can also learn about the perspectives of its user base and developers—and also the specific problems it’s designWe call something a waste of time is when we consider the time spent to perform the activity would be better spent doing something else. Otherwise, it’s a time well-spent.Since it depends on how the person conducting the activity thinks the activity contributed to what they want to achieve, what’s considered a waste of time for one might not be a waste of time for another.I personally don’t think learning any technology in particular would be a waste of time, since by learning it we can also learn about the perspectives of its user base and developers—and also the specific problems it’s designed to solve.But in the cases where we have to optimally use our time to the biggest return of investment, given a certain set of goals, there will be some technologies that we need to prioritize over the others. Then again, it’s highly dependent to the goals we’re trying to achieve.If the goal is to become a great network architect, learning about network protocols and network management tools should have a higher return of investment than learning how to build a web application front-end with React.When the goal is to become a skilled web front-end developer, learning the C programming language might not be the best way to spend our time—but it might be worthwhile to spend time and effort learning it if we want to do systems programming instead (while spending too much time learning CSS might not be a wise decision).Even learning about programming languages such as Brainfuck and Whitespace would be worthwhile if our goal is to become a Brainfuck or Whitespace expert, despite the possible impracticality of the languages for building serious large-scale software projects.As for me personally, I haven’t learned any particular technology that I consider a waste of time—since when I learned about them my goal was simply to get myself acquainted with how it works out of curiosity. For the cases where I have certain goals that I need to pursue with some time resource constraints, spending a lot of time learning the technologies that wouldn’t contribute much to the realization of my goal during that particular time frame should be considered a waste of time (but maybe not when under some other circumstances).The feeling of wasting time is pretty context-dependent, we need to consider what we’re aiming to achieve and whether what we’re learning aligns with our goals.","8,323 followers",Jeff Meyerson,682,340,2.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/As-a-software-developer-engineer-what-technologies-do-you-feel-are-a-waste-of-time-learning-Why
8,"I am going to say something taboo: machine learning.Not that the technology itself is a waste of time, but I believe those who do master it will build abstractions that alleviate the need for most programmers to know the nitty gritty.Kind of like writing drivers and other low-level machinery.Obviously it's crucial, and we need experts to lay the foundation, but at a certain level it is more useful to work with the abstractions and since we only have a limited amount of time on the planet, It's reasonable to say it'd be a waste of time for everyone to work at that level.I think machine learningI am going to say something taboo: machine learning.Not that the technology itself is a waste of time, but I believe those who do master it will build abstractions that alleviate the need for most programmers to know the nitty gritty.Kind of like writing drivers and other low-level machinery.Obviously it's crucial, and we need experts to lay the foundation, but at a certain level it is more useful to work with the abstractions and since we only have a limited amount of time on the planet, It's reasonable to say it'd be a waste of time for everyone to work at that level.I think machine learning will be abstracted in much the same way.
