For me this is the best movie of all time.“A hero can be anyone. Even a man doing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a little boy's shoulder to let him know that the world hadn't ended”.Wow, what an end to the best 'trilogy' movie I have ever encountered. I have watched the last 10 minutes of this movie more than 20 times and each time I get goosebumps while watching it. It's really hard to justify the benchmark set by 'The Dark Knight' but oh boy this movie completely justified the entire trilogy and lived up to more than my expectation.“Mankind was born on earth. It was never meant to die here”.I have never seen such a thrilling, thought provoking and visually earth shattering movie like Interstellar. The acting, the plot, Han's Zimmer score were all beyond my imagination. The only regret i have about this movie is that I couldn't witness it in theaters.“Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange”.According to me, Christopher Nolan is the best director in this planet. How dare you even think to make a movie like this. I don't think such a movie can be made again. A dream within a dream within a dream. Yes, if you want to challenge your brain than feel free to watch it. Inception is a sci-fi epic like no other.""Death smiles at us all. All we can do is smile back.""This is the best 'history' epic movie I have watched till date. This movie is a masterpiece in every sense. Flawless storytelling, flawless acting, outstanding score and direction. This movie changed the way I look at life. After watching this movie, I felt the need to achieve and become what truly defines a man.“Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies”.This movie will teach you life’s best lessons about friendships, hardships and hope. Ranked no. 1 on IMDB. I don't have to say anything about this movie anymore because everything that can be said about this movie has already been said.“You got a dream. You gotta protect it. People can't do something themselves, they wanna tell you you can't do it. If you want something, go get it. Period.”I remember this was the first movie which made me emotional like a baby. I still can't believe how the hell did Will Smith not win an Academy award for this movie. I am so so blessed to have seen this movie. It made me cry, it made me laugh and it made me love life.""A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti"".This movie is the reason why I fell in love with thriller genre. After this movie, I have watched and loved uncountable thriller movies but still none have matched its sheer intensity and brilliance. It still remains the best in this genre. Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector. Hats off sir.“This is your life and its ending one moment at a time”.Always been a fan of David Fincher movies. So he had to be there in this list. Se7en, World War Z, Gone Girl, Zodiac etc you name it, all these are a masterpiece. But I had to pick 1 and Fight Club is the one which is a very, very special movie. This movie has to be in everyone's list. You will have to watch atleast 2–3 times to understand the real meaning of this movie. Fight Club is one such movie which gives us a real perspective of the world we live in.“When 400,000 men could not go home, home came for them”I have seen some excellent war movies in recent times but this movie stands out right at the top. This is the best war movie i have watched. I was blessed to witness this movie in theater and believe me the experience was beyond my imagination.

Unless you're very unlucky, thete is likely always to be work in your niche.Now, the caveat: do not be blind to architecture and software engineering practices, including project and people (ie fellow engineers) management. Its in these areas that your experience will grow and be appreciated beyond the confines of your particular technical expertise. Technology does change but your ability to switch improves because you've done it once already in a particular niche. Convincing a new employer that you're worth hiring to tackle a new tech will be enhanced because of your experience in an older tech.So, don't try and master the latest and greatest piece of new tech whenever it appears, but do be aware of it. Instead hone what you do and keep learning how do it better.","47,052 followers",Abhinav Sharma,3.5K,865,7.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-technology-movie

The key ones include;Only a quarter of 2019 is gone, but we already have the opportunity to monitor some of the crucial blockchain trends that will reshape this technology for the remainder of the year.2019 is making a strong case to be regarded as the ‘versus’ year for blockchain technology, and all I can say is that the ‘fight card’ is exciting for sure.In this response, I will outline some of the hot button trends that are dominating conversations around blockchain technology. The key ones include;Proof of Work vs. Proof of StakeOne of the areas in blockchain technology that is characterized by a high level of contention is related to determining the superior consensus algorithm between PoW and PoS. At the center of this debate are two leading blockchains in Bitcoin and Ethereum. While Bitcoin uses PoW, Ethereum is seeking to migrate to PoS.Proponents of PoW are convinced that their algorithm is the only way to secure the network from malicious actions truly. For this reason, energy consumption is the sacrifice that needs to be made to protect this network.In contrast, supporters of PoS are focusing on scaling their blockchain and minimize its energy consumption. As such, they contend that this algorithm offers the best option of achieving these objectives while consolidating the network’s security at the same time.Valued at $12.9 billion, Ethereum is the second largest blockchain in terms of market share behind Bitcoin. Ethereum is looking to shift from its current PoW model to PoS to scale its network and make it capable of handling multiple transactions every second.The first step for developers is to apply the Constantinople fork to facilitate the inclusion of prerequisite modifications for PoS. While the fork was postponed in January 2019 because of an inherent safety issue, it is in line to be conducted again soon.The fundamental question that arises is whether all the blockchains seeking to move from PoW will be successful. My best bet is to remain observant and see where the industry is headed. However, I also believe that the market has room for more than one consensus algorithms that have various benefits and shortcomings. For this reason, there is an excellent chance that we may not see an outright winner.A Single Blockchain to Control Everything Vs. a Collection of Blockchains with Diverse FeaturesThis issue is considered as one of the most divisive talking points when it comes to blockchain technology in 2019. On the one hand, some maximalists are convinced that all transactions, dApps, and more will be executed on a single blockchain in the long run.In contrast, the other camp comprises individuals who hold the view that the existence of various kinds of blockchains that can facilitate the execution of different tasks and for adoption is necessary.While I can't predict the camp that will prevail, the truth of the situation is that there is an extensive collection of projects focused on different blockchains already. My conviction is that competition will always exist, and ultimately, it is beneficial for everyone. My view is informed by the fact that some blockchains are based on absolute decentralization, while others are centered on being public-private hybrids suitable for use in specific sectors.STOs vs ICOsThe conflict between registered securities and unrecognized emissions of tokens may end up without a logical winner, or with both being adopted.Although it is becoming more apparent that securities will be used in blockchain technology to minimize capital expenses and improve access to the money market for SMEs and other economic players, ICOs have the potential to play a big part in the future of blockchain technology because they provide a means to come up with a complete ecosystem around a particular asset or platform.Bakkt and Derivatives for Cryptocurrencies vs. Anti-institutional SentimentFor some purists, institutional investors should not be allowed into the derivatives’ market characterized by products such as ETFs, Bakkt, among others. Their logic is that institutional participation would result in a high level of volatility in the industry to the detriment of retail investors.On the other hand, some stakeholders believe that allowing institutional participation will make it easier for more people to access the market, which will translate to quicker industry growth.The rationale behind both points of view is decent. However, I am convinced that institutional investment is welcome if the industry is to attain maturity and further expansion.Scalability and Speed v DecentralizationIf blockchain technology is to attain real-world adoption, scaling is a core necessity.However, the ideas regarding how this should be done differ among stakeholders. Most critics contend that most projects with high TPS managed to scale to this level at the expense of network decentralization. The outcome of this development was the loss of the vital aim of blockchain in the process.An alternative idea to be applied, and executed upon, is to consolidate a balance between the two with a layer 2 off-chain transaction.Overall, scalability, speed, decentralization, and off-chain transactions represent some of the hot button issues in this industry. Their significance is not limited to a technological perspective, but also how vital they are in the definition of what blockchain technology’s full capabilities entail. Like you, I am keen to see the direction all this takes.Blockchain and IoT AllianceThe number of devices controlled by the Internet of Things is expected to hit 26 billion in 2019.
