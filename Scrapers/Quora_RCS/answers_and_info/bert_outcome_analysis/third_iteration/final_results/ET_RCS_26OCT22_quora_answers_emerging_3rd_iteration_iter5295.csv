So, the answer would be a yes. The decentralized technology is taking over the world gradually which indicates the rising demand and popularity of blockchain. Thus, blockchain-based systems can replace the current financial system. With its lightning-fast transactions, strong security system, low-cost expenses, and smart contracts, blockchain is proving to be far better than traditional financial practices. Most of the sectors today are able to take or give loans with ease and are able to earn quick money with the help of DeFi. And things are just starting now.It’s true that the government oversees the current financial system and takes a certain amount of cut-through taxes, so it might just stand as a barrier for the current financial system from completely being overshadowed. But the rapid momentum of blockchain all across the globe has taken the world by storm. Almost every sector let that be business or app creation or anything as a matter of fact has started developing their own digital currency. So it’s quite obvious that blockchain is unstoppable.The only solution for the current financial system from not going to the verge of extinction is integration. The present financial system can safeguard its future by adopting blockchain models. The future of currency and monetary transactions is going to be totally based upon blockchain, so it would be wise for the traditional financial system to merge with blockchain technology.The public has already realized the importance of blockchain. The more they are gaining knowledge about crypto and bitcoin, the faster they are able to see the benefits that they are going to get from blockchain technology. People always get attracted by trust and convenience, which is something that blockchain promises. Hence, there is not a hint of doubt as to why blockchain won’t replace the current financial system.For more info please visit","31,157 followers",Phillip Remaker,1.7K,11K,78.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Can-Big-Data-Technologies-like-Apache-Kafka-Spark-replace-ETL-batch-processing-tools

Basically, it was a specific type of ice age when not only did the polar caps and glaciers around the world expand, but deserts did too, due to the atmosphere effectively having moisture sucked out of it by the ice.The atmosphere became very dry right across the world, but from our perspective, this affected significant parts of central, eastern and southeastern Africa where, at the time, all known humans lived. It’s estimated that the human population at this time could have dropped down to under 1,000 people.The second near-extinction event was around 70,000 years ago following the eruption of a Sumatran volcano called Toba. Rather, it wasn’t just an eruption but it was a super-eruption, where so much ash and gasses are thrown into the atmosphere that their environmental effects threaten life.It’s estimated that the Toba super-eruption ejected roughly 10,000 times more ash and gas than the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption did and was big enough to significantly dim the sun globally for up to 6 years, resulting in worldwide cooling and a massive dying of vegetation from both cold and poor light. This again brought the human population down, perhaps to somewhere between 1,000 and 5,000 people.This was also the time that early humans began their migration out of Africa and around the world, it’s believed because once the ecosystem had stabilised following the eruption a ‘green corridor’ right the way up the east side of Africa and along the Nile Valley opened up, enabling our ancient ancestors to cross what had formerly been an impassable desert.",UNKNOWN,Ben Y.

I think AI will kill jobs, and over time, AI might kill most “jobs” as we know them. I think that people are somewhat complacent in regard to the economic impact of AI, and will likely be ill-prepared for the changes we have to adapt to in the not-so-distant future.First, let's start with the comparisons to machinery and automation. They did indeed put factory workers out of work. In that respect, I agree AI today is similar in many applications, replacing workers who have less specialized skills, perhaps call center operators, office assistants (in a limited extent), and maybe soon, taxi drivers and truck drivers. But I would argue that AI is fundamentally different from machinery or most of the other analogies commonly made when answering this question, because AI is growing and is unlikely to stop growing. It's growing in breadth (of applications and industries), in geographic and economic scope, and in power (it's capacity to address increasingly complex tasks). A more fitting analogy would be machinery in an automobile plant that not only made the parts one day, but then learned how to assemble them the week after, and then how to design cars a year later.I think that there is little that is out of reach for advanced AI of the future. Let's leave the question of the AI singularity alone for now. Instead, I think that deep learning efforts at Google and elsewhere are making AI systems learn faster and faster, with a growing rate of acceleration. Advanced AI can now address increasingly complex tasks including medical diagnosis, stock market trading, weather prediction and human behavioral modeling. Very soon, it will be able to take the place of certain types of teachers, and find a role in education. It can already deal with complex systems in software and mathematics, and seems to be only limited in applications that require interactions with the physical world (sensors are still imperfect), and with people.So without projecting too far into the future, we can ask the question, what jobs will NOT be killed by AI? Jobs that involve labor are already (or soon to be) replaced. Jobs that require logical reasoning are being replaced, albeit at a slower rate. What are the qualities that humans have that cannot be captured by AI? Perhaps creativity, emotional responses? So perhaps researchers in academia will survive longer than most, and artists (though AI stylistic mimicry is already quite impressive and their results enjoyable), and counselors/psychologists/case workers, and decision makers like CEOs who cannot be predictable or error prone. And hopefully software engineers and algorithm designers who develop AI systems.This leaves a very, very small portion of today's jobs intact. Many say: we just need to train people to fill higher level jobs created by AI, e.g. Programmers, ML researchers. But this is no easy feat. The US educational system is struggling to meet the demands created by advanced technology today. This failure is in part responsible for the economic divide plaguing the country today. The challenge of educating the public for a job market that is both decreasing in scope and increasing in complexity, is nothing we've ever faced before.I am far from original in this opinion. But if I had to guess, I would say that AI will put far more people out of work than we can (re)train in time. That will have significant economic repercussions as corporations seeking to minimize cost will do so at the cost of rising unemployment. There will need to be dramatic changes in social policies in order to avert large scale economic disaster, first dramatic rises in minimum wage, then eventually some type of universal income/welfare. It's the kind of change that requires significant leadership in our government, something that seems woefully absent today.",36 followers,Adam Ambrozy,579,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-will-be-the-technological-innovation-thats-going-to-replace-PCs-and-or-mobile-cell-phones

Nearly all of whom then had to take much lower-paying jobs in the service sector, or have no jobs at all.The incomes of the richest men in America has steadily soared in this period, while that of most everyone else has stagnated or even sagged (in the case of most unskilled laborers, in part due to competition from illegal immigrants).First to go was repetitive manual labor and management of same. Next has been repetitive mental labor, then non-creative computational mental labor.Of course smart people can find other avenues of work. But most people aren’t smart, by nature’s design, so to speak. Excess brainpower can actually be deleterious to productivity in most work people did as hunter/gatherers, and it was true even moreso in early agriculture. A few people with smarts were needed for emergencies, for the rare unexpected danger/challenge. Hence the bell-shaped curve of intelligence, along which each succeeding generation has been born for over 200,000 years, and continues to be born this way:You aren’t going to be retraining people in the fat part of the curve to be computer programmers.There have been workplace revolutions before, of course. The industrial revolution saw zillions move from farms to manufacturing plants in cities. But in previous revolutions the IQ needed for the new job wasn’t any higher than the IQ needed for the old job, and lots of workers were still needed.Today the “demand curve” for employment in advanced nations is that bell-shaped curve…inverted. The labor market still needs dummies to push brooms and knowledge workers to, well, work knowledge. But it doesn’t need all that many skilled manual laborers with just high school diplomas.And watch what happens when truck and cab driving get automated. I live near Google and see robot cars driving around here constantly.Now of course the richest men in America could decide to give their workers 30 hour work weeks, full medical insurance and pensions. If they belonged to a different species maybe. Instead they’ve kept all the productivity gains of workers for themselves.There is still a market for the cream of the non-college crop. Germany has done a great job of private/public partnership apprentice programs with such people.But no matter how you slice it, the “free market” doesn’t need more than 50 million Americans, and within decades won’t need 100 million or more Americans. It will take aggressive government policy to deal with this, but the richest men in America purchased one of our two major political parties and currently owns both the federal government and a majority of state governments. So don’t look for change there.The scary thing isn’t workplace automation but the sophistication of right wing propaganda and campaign finance laws and other laws that make it easy for the richest of the rich to convince all those diplaced worked that libruls and foreigners done it to them. Tyranny no longer has to stand behind lots of guns. Instead it uses a giant bullhorn coupled with the susceptibility of Joe Lunchbox to appeals to his biases and fears.Note that Donald J. Trump has never said one word about computerized workplace automation. I doubt he even knows it exists…So I strongly suspect the future is full of frustrated people of average mentality forced to do work that’s too dumb even for them, but with their resentments continuously misdirected at precisely the people who are trying to save them.So instead of this…we’ll get this…because","90,362 followers",Alisha Talks,728,910,103.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-will-be-the-technological-innovation-thats-going-to-replace-PCs-and-or-mobile-cell-phones

The current rash of “jobs will never go away” people are just as misguided.Jobs today are currently being replaced as fast they are being destroyed for two reasons. The first, and most important, is that society forces everyone to create new jobs for themselves if they want to eat. If you can’t find a normal job, you have to become self-employed and stand on a street corner and beg for money so you can eat. Or you become a criminal and steal for a living. Or you “fall in love” with a rich person and use their money to eat. Work, or die, that’s the society we live in, and that is preventing our work weeks and retirement age from shrinking as automation grows. If we had learned to start sharing the wealth of our automated economy people would be working for less than 40 hours a week and would be retiring sooner. That hasn’t happened because we haven’t learned to share, especially in places like the US and other underdeveloped nations.The second reason that we keep working is that our automation and AI aren’t as smart as humans yet. Our intelligence keeps us useful to the economy, it gives us a monopoly that pays. Even minimum wage workers have adaptive learning skills that surpass the best and most expensive AI systems. We cope with the unexpected far better than any AI current AI system.Currently, AI systems are smarter than any human but only in limited domains, like playing chess or Go, or other specific tasks. They don’t have our general adaptive learning skills yet. But every year, the scope and power of our AI systems expand. AI research has been on a constant growth path for 50 years whereas humans are not smarter today than they were 50 years ago. We are standing still, and AI is growing at lightning speeds compared to human intelligence.But in the next couple of decades, AI systems are on track to reach general human intelligence and then fly right past us. When this happens, the monopoly on intelligence that makes us useful to the economy will vanish. We will become outdated, unemployable workers that can’t compete with the machines for any job any more than we can do math better than a calculator today.It will take more than just the powerful technology for us to lose our jobs. The entire economy has to be retooled to convert from a human-centric workforce to an automated workforce that will take decades. Just as the internet explode in the 1990s once technology passed a cost and power threshold but here we are in 2022, almost 30 years later, still trying to retool our society to convert the entire economy to a network-connected phone app. The conversion from an economy driven by human workers to one driven by machines will take time as well. But in time, humans will no longer work for a living at all. The machines will do all the stuff we call “work” today.But most importantly, we have to stop forcing everyone into wage slavery before we can take advantage of automation. We will still need to use capitalism for the machine economy to optimize itself to maximize the gq2uality and value of goods being delivered. But we won’t have to work to get money to pend. People will get their money as a free handout, just like we don’t have to pay for the right to vote, and won’t have to be wage saves for the right to use a share of the robotic output. Everyone will get free money in the form of a Basic Income from birth to death. This will represent our individual share of the output of the automated economy. We will convert society from one driven by competition and wage slavery, into one where people are truly free to do whatever they want with their lives. We will be very busy working to create the best life we can, but we won’t be slaves to money anymore.We should already be using a Basic Income system today to share the wealth of automation. But because most people can’t understand what is happening, we cling to a backward view of work and purpose that makes everyone wage slaves that can’t even afford to retire anymore while the 1% control trillions of dollars of automation wealth like Bezos, Zuckerberg, etc.Even though people could still work for money in a post automation society, it won’t be a job in the sense it is today. Just as someone might pick up a hobby business for the fun of it in retirement today, people in the future might have hobby jobs as well. We will do some type of work because it’s something we find it fun and enjoyable, and the money we make will not support us, but it will help pay for our hobby. It's easy to have a hobby job when all your basic survival needs are taken care of with a pension — which is what everyone will have staring at birth in the post-automation world. So though some people will choose to charge for their hobby work, it won’t be anything like the “jobs” of today in our work or die world, so I don’t think it’s fair to call them “jobs”. This is why I say 100% of jobs will be lost.","135,542 followers",Hector Quintanilla,3.1K,1.2K,88.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-technology-one-day-in-the-future-replaces-labor-what-will-happen-to-the-human-race-Will-it-be-doomed-to-a-life-of-recreation-and-relaxation

This gave rise to the “Instead of foraging and hunting, most people got involved in other things - like pottery, painting, urban planning, building homes & drainages, administration, mining, jewellery, accounting, medicine…A few thousand years later, another bunch of dudes would start harnessing the power of steam and create “nasty” things like locomotion. Rather than beating our horses to get to the next village, we would get to the other end of the continent reading newspapers. We moved around, explored things. Rather than using little children for many jobs such as chimney sweeping we kept finding better methods. Eventually the horse carriage workers and others moved on to other things.We often confuse general purpose AI with robotics.Let’s assume the worst case and we have a general purpose AI - that can do everything a human can. What would happen?It would be only as bad as agriculture - that destroyed most of what we did everyday. We could be doing things like sports. In most video games, bots are way better than humans. Does it mean we are less likely to play with other humans? In fact, we would play more with other humans just because the bots are better than us.We would do art, psychiatry and so many more human fields that we have not even created. Just like people could not imagine separate professions like art before the invention of agriculture, we have a problem with imagination.And we would spend more time with our children - who often grow alone with their TVs and more time with our parents - who often rot away alone.But, this is assuming there is a general purpose AI. Robotics is not the same as general purpose AI.Oh, what about movies like The Matrix and Terminator. Oh, you guys are now giving us Hollywood? If you believe in those weird movies, do you also believe in other dystopian movies like “I’m a legend”? In the latter movie, a germ gets out and wipes out most of humanity. Does it mean we have to close down the pharma and medicine industry?Hollywood can paint a dystopian picture from anything possible. They have even made something as harmless as vacuum cleaners into dangerous things. Should we stop doing all of them?In fact, anything useful can be made dangerous - think fire, water, air, cars, electricity, trains, medicines, petrol, sugar - any of them can kill you very easily.Anything that cannot kill you, is not of much use to you.Robotics, like any major revolution, can indeed cause chaos in the society. No different from agricultural revolution or industrial revolution. There will be displacement. People said the same for computing too. Could the people who were worried about computers doing spreadsheets in 1970s have thought about the whole new industries created by computing 40 years later?But, there are a whole set of important things that are not effectively today and we need robots there. Let me give you some examples of these:It need not always be life threatening. You walk into most stores now, and it hard to find anyone to assist you. The robots could walk with you, understand your requirements, help you shop and get things on your vehicle. It could play football with your children and take them off TV.I could give you 100s of such examples and that is the future. But, to get there we have to have more simpler robots doing more mundane things. A baby has to go through the toddler stage before becoming an adult.40 years ago, your parents would not have imagined what you do with computers. They could not have thought of the kind of revolutionary applications that we take for granted.A new revolution is beckoning us.

I think an elephant would prefer our bite over a king cobra's any day of the week.We aren't the most durable species. Cockroaches can survive through extreme amounts of radiation.We don't have any interesting built-in biological defenses either. Skunks have their farts, porcupines have their spikes, and peacocks have their feathers.Humans are fragile. The vast majority of animals in this world could kill us effortlessly given the opportunity to do so, yet we still stand as the most dominant species. What do we have that others don't?TheThrough our intellect, we are able to domesticate other species for our own selfish needs such as entertainment and food. We manipulate animals to do as we please by enticing them with their most primal biological need, food. That Shamu at SeaWorld is content with doing flips because it is rewarded with constant treats. The chicken in the slaughterhouse copes with the trauma by being fed until it can't eat anymore.What happens when a new species that outperforms us physically AND intellectually is introduced into the ecosystem? They will domesticate us, exactly how we domesticate other animals.I present to you ladies and gentlemen, AI.Let me explain why AI is superior physically and intellectually.Machines do all of the strenuous physical labor for us, from cranes that carry metal beams to build skyscrapers to car crushers that squash old cars like printer paper. There is no doubt they possess more strength than us, and their limits are endless. Machines are very durable. If a robot's arm is blown off, the robot does not die. We can simply replace the arm with a new arm as if nothing happened. If a human's arm is blown off, he/she will die from blood loss. Who would win in a fight with Connor McGreggor and the villain from Terminator 3? I think the answer is obvious.Machines are starting to get smarter too. A computer can do millions of computations in a matter of seconds, and machine learning allows robots to learn with experience like a baby. Put those two things together and it is possible for a 30 minute old robot to have as much experience as a 100 year old man given the abundance of data on the web. Now put this intellect into an iron, replaceable body and you have the next ruler of the universe.Imagine a scientist who is planning on shutting down a robot because its getting too smart. In a matter of seconds, the robot downloads every single possible human portrayal of body language and facial expression, learns what they mean, analyzes the scientist's behavior, and decides the scientist's intentions are malicious. Then, analyzes every single possible outcome that ensures the its survival and chooses the most optimal one. The scientist is toast because he can't analyze every single outcome. The human brain does not have the capacity to do that, and instead reacts to events in real time. The robot then reverse manipulates the scientist by touching on his biggest insecurities, which defuses the situation. If the robot already had a strong body, the robot would utilize its physical advantage.Of course we aren't at this stage yet. We are still struggling with Alexa commands as it does not play the right song half of the time, but as history has shown, technological innovation always moves forward and never backward. We could warn everyone to stop working on advancing AI, but if someone doesn't do it, someone else will for power and profit. It is ironic how a species so obsessed with maintaining power is working relentlessly on creating another species that will steal that power. We are too blinded by our own ego and selfish desires to see the big picture from an objective point of view.The question is notHopefully not in my lifetime...","246,860 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/If-technology-one-day-in-the-future-replaces-labor-what-will-happen-to-the-human-race-Will-it-be-doomed-to-a-life-of-recreation-and-relaxation
