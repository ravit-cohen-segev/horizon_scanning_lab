Mobile apps like DoorDash, Grubhub, Zomato, and UberEATS provide maximum convenience and transparency to users when it comes to ordering food online. According to TechCrunch, if the demand in online food delivery apps keeps growing, then it will surpass the offline food delivery demand within a few years.MageSpiderClient Reviews |Mobile App Development Costs For 2021Food delivery App DevelopmentEmail :Since UberEats has gained popularity in a shorter time zone, hence, many business minds seem rivalry to build an app like UberEATS, whereas someWell, we also came across this question when we were planning to build a similar food delivery app. So, we created this blog to help you learn about the UberEATS business model, features, and the cost to build a similar app.How UberEATS Works?In August 2014, Uber entered the food delivery business by launching the UberFRESH services in Santa Monica, California. However, it was renamed to UberEATS in 2015, and since then, the number of users on the platform is increasing rapidly – as per a report by Verto. It is now available in more than 200 cities across 20 countries.UberEATS works on a dual business model – it plays the role of both aggregator as well as delivery agent, which means it gives access to restaurants to list their food items via a single online food delivery app, as well as provides delivery services for those restaurants via its own logistics network. UberEATS offers plenty of features to customers, which include tailored restaurant recommendations, customized delivery details, smart search filters, and easy order tracking.Apart from that, there are four essential components of UberEATS, which makes it a successful competitor of other on-demand food delivery apps. Let’s have a closer look at these components:1. Real-time Order Placing for CustomerIt allows customers to select from a list of flexible restaurant menus, timelines, and locations. In this case, UberEATS works similar to other food delivery apps. However, the number of Uber riders available in different areas makes it an advantage for the business.2. Custom Order Placing for CustomerIn custom orders placing, customers can choose their specific food items, delivery time, and location as per their requirements. In short, everything related to the order delivery is decided by the customers.3. Delivery Partners (Uber Riders)Now, this is the unique component of UberEATS. It doesn’t hire delivery guys separately; instead, the delivery of the product is performed by Uber riders who have registered or signed up as a part of the delivery network. The orders are allocated to Uber riders based on the restaurant, the customer, and their current location.4. Restaurant PartnersWith the increasing demand in online food delivery, it has become crucial for restaurants to partner with almost every on-demand delivery mobile app that offers convenience and fast delivery, which makes UberEATS an ideal choice for them.Revenue Model of UberEATSMost food delivery apps earn their revenue by charging delivery fees from customers and commission from restaurants. But, UberEATS also earn from advertising their restaurant partners as top searchers. Below is a clear overview of the UberEATS revenue model.UberEATS charges a nominal commission from restaurants for fulfilling their orders via the app. This commission ranges between 15% -40% depending on geo locations it serves, time zone or the demand of the food items of restaurants.The final price of the food items on UberEATS consists of a base price and the surcharges, which are taken by the app from customers. The surcharges are often high during lunch and dinner hours, as these are the peak hours with limited restaurants and menus.UberEATS charges a marketing fee from the restaurant partners if they want to show themselves in the top search when a customer looks for any food item. And due to the increasing number of vendors, restaurants must gain more visibility on the app.Cost of Building an App like UberEATSVarious components can be included to get a clear estimation of mobile app development costs. Usually, the cost of building a food delivery app like UberEATS depends on the features and functionalities included in it. You can hire experienced mobile app developers to build either a native or hybrid food delivery app like UberEATS.if you hire a mobile app development company like Infoxen, then the estimated cost of developing an app like UberEATS will cost you $20 per hour approximately. This cost will include an end to end mobile app development for both Android and iOS platforms concluding app testing and app launch as well.However, if you hire Infoxen for your mobile app development services, then you will also get continuous support from a team of experts until your app is stable and running successfully in the market.Note:ConclusionThe on-demand food delivery business will be skyrocketing in the upcoming years. So, enterprises who are planning to enter in this market should know about the varied costs of developing a food delivery app. In this article, we talked about the business model of UberEATS and provided an estimated cost of developing a similar food delivery app.",254 followers,Kenny Wyland,873,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-will-the-smartphone-change-in-the-future

I make a non-trivial amount of money from my Android apps but I make more than double that amount on my iOS apps.But to the main point… Android sucks. I know this sounds like a religious argument, but bear with me.To be clear, as an AndroidApple works diligently to make iOS WORK very well AND look good at the same time. Many of the bits of visual candy that Apple includes in iOS actually help with usability, they aren’tHowever, Google focused primarily on just getting the basics of Android working because they valued the idea of individual expression by the developers as opposed to Apple who wanted apps to have a consistent look and feel. (I used to work at Google, so I understand the inside mentality.) The problem is that the vast majority of developers are not trained in usability or graphical design and so their apps looked crude and worked crudely. Around the time of Android 4.x Google realized they had a real problem because no two Android apps worked in the same fashion because every developer came up with a different approach. They started trying to standardize the UI and they got some of their graphics people to try to make the visual elements look nicer. It still wasn’t great.Here is a specific example of the difference in effort from the developer’s perspective. I have a feature in one of my iOS apps and I wanted to make sure that feature was in the Android version as well.The feature involves tapping+holding on an item in a list/table and then dragging it upward or downward to reorder the items in the table (drag and drop). In iOS, this only took me 23 lines of code because essentially everything is already built-in to the underlying iOS system. The UITableView object (the scrolling lists you see everywhere in iOS) already knows how to respond to tap+hold and already knows how to animate moving the row as you drag around your finger… and already applies a nice drop shadow as you’re dragging the row around… and already knows how to animate the other rows of the table to move out of the way as you drag this one row around, etc. It also already has built-in hooks so that the system can ask my code: Should the user be allowed to drag this row? Can the user drop this row in between x and y? and it’ll tell me The User just dragged and dropped this row at this new location, which allows my code to respond to that event.That’s why my iOS code is only 23 lines long. All I have to do is write code that says which rows are draggable and then to respond to them dropping the row so that I can update the underlying data. I implemented this feature in a few minutes on iOS.But Android does NONE of that which is why my Android code is 567 lines long and it took me 3 days to get it all working. Thankfully, in this ONE particular case, I didn’t have to write all of that code myself because SO many other Android developers had complained about missing this incredibly basic feature. In response, Google had posted some “sample code” that showed how to manually create a rudimentary form of the dragging/dropping. Of course, that code was out of date because it was written for Android 4 and didn’t work for Android 5, 6, or 7 (7.x is the current version as of this writing).And their sample code didn’t involve any features for checking if certain rows in the list/table should be allowed to be dragged. It didn’t include any checking if a row should be allowed to dropped in a certain location. It didn’t include the ability to set a callback so that your code could respond to the reordering. I had to take all of their rudimentary, buggy code and try to improve it so that it did more than the kindergarten version of the feature.That meant I spent multiple days to produce a feature that doesn’t even work as well or look as good as the feature that already exists in iOS and took me only a few minutes. I took a screenshot of the code from both and placed them side-by-side so I could use it to explain the difference. (see below. The screenshot includes the comments in the code, but I didn’t count comments in my line counts.)Whenever I have a client that wants their app on both iOS and Android, I tell them the Android version will take 4 times longer to produce and will only be about 80% as good. When I give them the quote, I determine how much the iOS app will take to produce and then I multiply that number by 2.5 to cover the Android version… which doesn’t -truly- pay for all of my time on the Android version, but charging 4 times the amount sounds ludicrous to them because they don’t know what it’s like.","82,153 followers",Quincy Larson,547,358,29.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-will-the-smartphone-change-in-the-future
