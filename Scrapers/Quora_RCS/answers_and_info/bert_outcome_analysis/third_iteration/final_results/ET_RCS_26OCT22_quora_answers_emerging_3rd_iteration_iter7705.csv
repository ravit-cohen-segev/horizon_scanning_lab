3,"It is possible to propose pure fusion powered rockets that would be cleaner and have less environmental impact than current generation chemical rockets which, if used in large numbers, tend to pollute the launch site and the upper atmosphere.Thermonuclear Rockets for Heavy Lift of payloads to space -Fusion has many significant advantages when used in nuclear rocket propulsion -1) Pure Fusion has no critical mass requirement; all that a fusion reaction requires is the right conditions be met (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) to support fusion. As a result, very small low massIt is possible to propose pure fusion powered rockets that would be cleaner and have less environmental impact than current generation chemical rockets which, if used in large numbers, tend to pollute the launch site and the upper atmosphere.Thermonuclear Rockets for Heavy Lift of payloads to space -Fusion has many significant advantages when used in nuclear rocket propulsion -1) Pure Fusion has no critical mass requirement; all that a fusion reaction requires is the right conditions be met (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) to support fusion. As a result, very small low mass efficient fusion rockets can potentially be built.2) Fusion fuels are widely available in space. Hydrogen (and deuterium) is the most abundant elements in the universe. Hydrogen is fully 10^10 times more abundant by atoms in the universe than any combination of fission fuels (U233, U235, Pu239).3) When fusion fails to work, it tends to just flame out, and serious accidents and melt downs and environmental release of fission products as in the case of nuclear fission based rockets do not tend to happen4) Neutrons and gammas produced by fission reactors are hard to shield for nuclear rocket propulsion application. Charged and uncharged particles like protons and neutrons produced from D-D fusion are somewhat easier and more cost effective to shield and require lighter weight shielding. A combination high hydrogen content polypropylene plastic backed by a Hi-z neutron absorber can be used to provide a low mass solution for biological shielding needed to provide excellent operator safety for D-D Inertial Confinement fusion rockets.Pure Fusion Peaceful Nuclear Explosives for Rocketry -Mankind came into possession of a practical way of generating energy from fusion over 50 years ago with the Ivy-Mike nuclear test that produced fusion energy from pure Deuterium via DD fusion. Practical fusion will always be 50+ years ago (not 50 years away). Today, there are smaller pure fusion devices designed to make clean energy (not blast effects) from pure DD fusion of Deuterium separated from sea water. One such design is called mini-Mike, which produces a small predictable controlled energy yield of 250 GJ.The energy needed to ignite an inertially confined thermonuclear fusion reaction in liquid (or solid) deuterium-tritium (DT) is not that large; it is on the order of not more than 20 MJ or about the same amount ofThe problem is that this energy must be compressed in space (focused down to an area less than a 2 mm) and in time (to less than 3 nanoseconds).Heavy Lift Pure Fusion Rockets for MarsA thermonuclear pure fusion rocket can follow the same approach as was suggested for Orion-type nuclear fission explosive rockets through a series of controlled limited yield peaceful fusion explosive bursts. Being pure fusion devices without any nuclear fission component, such Peaceful Fusion Nuclear Explosives (PFNE) powered rockets would produce no radioactive fallout in the earth’s atmosphere. PFNE powered rockets producing a hydrogen plasma jet velocity of 30 km/s could make it possible to reach the orbital speed of 8 km/s using just one fusion rocket stage, instead of several hundred multi-stage chemical rockets, while assembling a large Mars rocket in low earth orbit. At an exhaust velocity of 30 km/s using 1 ton of Deuterium (hydrogen isotope) fusion fuel per second would produce 3000 tons of thrust.(picture of aA pure fusion nuclear rocket powered by the D-D fusion reaction could be designed to use only non-radioactive fusion fuel (Deuterium) and produce only non-radioactive nuclear waste (Helium-4) and some neutrons. If a pure fusion rocket were to blow up on the launch pad it would release principally only non-radioactive Deuterium and non-radioactive Helium-4.ConclusionThe feasibility of the proposed pure fusion propulsion concept would be of great significance for the future of space flight. It does not require a large number of chemical rockets to bring the parts of a Mars craft, for example, into low-earth orbit. Using only chemical rockets would not require multiple multistage chemical rocket launches and a Mars rocket assembly crew working in the weightless vacuum of space. Pure fusion rockets allow environmentally conscientious heavy life launches to space and direct to Mars without requiring difficult assembly of a large Mars rocket in orbit.Launching of large chemical rockets into space is still a fairly risky business.(more info)","29,975 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.7K,249.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-using-nuclear-energy-in-rockets-bad

The small Israeli reactor was spherical in shape and was powered by a solution of Am-242(NO3)3 in water. When a fission reactor is very small in size (<10 cm radius sphere) it requires relatively less combined shielding to fully enclose the reactor with an adequate gamma and neutron shield. Really small fission reactors become much more practical if good light weight and compact shielding approaches are used.The minimal critical mass (water reflected) that can be formed is 6.6 g of Am-242m.Los Alamos has recent experience building quite small nuclear reactors using many off the shelf components to reduce cost. LANL is currently testing their kilowatt power space fission reactor called KRUSTY (KilowattSmall fusion reactors for providing power tend to be discounted because no one has recently produced a fusion reactor that actually generates net power.Fusion has however many significant advantages for truly small nuclear power generation applications -Some advantages of fusion for building truly small reactors.1) Fusion has no critical mass requirement, all that a fusion reaction requires is the right conditions be met (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) to support fusion. As a result, very tiny fusion power plants can potentially be built.2) Fusion fuels are widely available in space.

While p-B11 is expected to produce a few neutrons through side reactors, this style of fusion is a good candidate for safely powering small reactor applications.Inertial Confinement Fusion of p-B11 fuel for small reactor applicationsIt has been calculated that ion temperatures of DT ignited targets reach very high values, exceeding 200 keV. This is the temperature above which proton-boron 11 fusion reactivity arrives to high enough levels to be relevant for energy production (and to obtain high fusion energy gain). In the same DT explosion wave, electron temperatures remain at a lower value, usually below 100 keV, which is a helpful feature to reduce radiation and conduction losses from the plasma. A scheme can be devised to exploit proton-boron 11 fusion by using an Inertial Confinement staged fusion device design initiating a controlled fusion deflagration wave in a p-B11 fusion secondary stage while using a much smaller DT spark primary stage. This maximizes the production of fusion energy from p-B11 while reducing the size and cost of the required ICF fusion driver (laser or particle beam).[1] - Y.

When he was done, he handed our Kathi rolls to us.We left and on our way, I told him,A bit shocked, he said,“Did you not see how he prepared them? Both of our rolls were prepared on the same Tava, in the same oil, the only distinction is that he didn't put chicken in yours!”His reaction to this seemed like as if he's been lied to all his life.The roadside food carts and vendors should be the way to go only if you choose not to consume non-vegetarian by your choice and not because you're trying to respect your particular ritual.",0 followers,Kunwar,6.1K,53,618.2K,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-facts-about-India-that-Indians-are-generally-unaware-of-1

After the defeat of the Sikh Empire in the second Anglo-Sikh war, the British East India Company annexed Punjab, they forced the Treaty of Lahore on the Sikhs, in which, one of the terms was to surrender Kohinoor to Queen Victoria. Duleep Singh was only seven years old back then. This is how KohinoorThat Kohinoor was not the only big diamond that was taken away from India by a foreign power.The Koh-i-noor diamond (Kohinoor means ‘Mountain of Light’)Almost all of us are aware of the fact that before being taken away by the English, the diamond Kohinoor was in the possession of the Sikh Empire. After the defeat of the Sikh Empire in the second Anglo-Sikh war, the British East India Company annexed Punjab, they forced the Treaty of Lahore on the Sikhs, in which, one of the terms was to surrender Kohinoor to Queen Victoria. Duleep Singh was only seven years old back then. This is how Kohinoor ended up being a part of the British crown jewels, as opposed to the imperial propaganda fanned by some apologists that it was a willing gift (how the fuck is a war booty a ‘willing gift’ exactly? Not to forget, a 7 year old can’t make such informed decisions).Anyway, having given a brief account of the departure of Kohinoor, let us get back to the topic: a.k.a about the other diamond. This other diamond is Daria-i-Noor (a.k.a The Sea of Light).Some time ago, I wrote the following answer about the massacre conducted by Iranian ruler Nadir Shah in Delhi:When Nadir Shah attacked the Mughal Empire and defeated that incompetent idiot ruler Muhammad Shah Rangeela, he conducted a horrible massacre in Delhi and also plundered and looted the city.Muhammad Shah Rangeela also surrendered to him the key of the Mughal treasury, which contained valuable jewels and wealth. He took away the Peacock ThroneLater from Nadir Shah, Kohinoor passed to Ahmed Shah Abdali, and then from him to his grandson, Shah Shuja. Shah Shuja, after being overthrown in a coup, fled to Lahore and took refuge under Maharaja Ranjeet Singh. In return, he gave Kohinoor to the Maharaja.Unlike Kohinoor, however, Daria-i-noor stayed in Iran and remained a part of the Iranian crown jewels. It is currently housed at the Iranian Central Bank, Tehran:The Daria-i-noor diamond, currently at The Central Bank of Islamic Republic of IranIt is also believed that Daria-i-noor was originally a part of a much larger pink diamond named the Great Table DiamondThe pink diamond Noor-ul-Ain, currently studded in the tiara of former Iranian Empress Farah Pahlavi.

The home loan interest rate is now 6.99%So where is the problem? Why I am still paying 9.55%, which is almost the same as the personal loan interest rate?I asked this question to the bank authorities. Their answer is simple.It is the responsibility of the customer to apply at the bank to reduce the rate of interest.Presently most of us don't see all the SMS and bank get the advantages of this. Maybe I have received the SMS but for my negligence and also ignorance I was failed to respond to that SMS on time.The result is I have been paying a much higher rate of interest for a long time. What was the duration I don’t know and I also don’t know how much I have already paid?So please go to your bank and appeal for reducing your home loan interest.Subhasis",2 followers,David George,5.5K,134,1.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-facts-about-India-that-Indians-are-generally-unaware-of-1

The library also has a wonderful collection of atlases, and dictionaries of several languages, and books on Indian history. Having begun collecting the books in 1998, the library now houses about 9 lakh books, and its number is growing even now.And it was made using funds initially allotted for a temple!One of the more remarkable features of the library is the fact that it was made from the funds for a temple for the Goddess.

Because, they’re fighting for a Community which was suppressed for many centuries and even after 70 years of Independence if Dalits face this Discrimination and Atrocities, shouldn’t they raise their voices? Definitely, They Should!But there’s more to it than this.The Leader or Founder of thisNow during Dussehra 2018, his Army is demanding that the burning of Ravan’s effigy be banned in the festival and the violators be booked under SC/ST Act. This is exactly where aThese people think that Lord Rama killing Ravana is completely unfair and they don’t agree with the portrayal of Ram as Hero and Ravan as Villain. They think of the Ramayana as some Upper Caste Supremacy in which Kshatriya born Lord Ram killed Ravan who they claim asBut the fact is thatFor argument sake, let’s just assume that Ravan was a Dalit. Then why did Lord Ram make younger brother of Ravan, Vibhishana the King of Lanka? So, it’s all about Dharma V Adharma irrespective of Caste.Some people with half knowledge argue that Abduction of Sita Devi was just a reaction to what Lakshmana did to Shurpanakha. I don’t want to go much into this stuff but remember that Hinduism is much more complex than what it seems.For example, Rama who killed Vali had to die from an arrow of a hunter in his Krishna Avatar, after winning Mahabharata involving Millions.Similarly, There’s much more to Ravan’s story than just revenge for his sister.Also, there are people who think of this as North vs South India. I would like to remind such people that the commander-in-chief of this North Indian Dark Skinned Kshatriya was a South Indian.Finally, I would like to ask just one question to Dalit Brothers and Sisters :Are you Hindus? Yes you are! But do you consider yourselves Hindus?I would also like to ask one important question to so called Upper Castes :Do you consider Dalits as Hindus? Do you think of them as your brothers and sisters? Then stop these atrocities on your fellow Hindus. And for God’s sake, don’t do things like not allowing them to Temples. And don’t shed crocodile tears later, when you do such things and those families convert to some other Religions for all practical purposes.

His groundbreaking research led to wide ranging applications in not just high speed communications, but also medical imaging from OFC networks to endoscopies to laser surgery. Born in 1927 in Moga, Punjab, he graduated from Agra University and went on to his Ph.D at Imperial College, London.There he became the first person in the world to demonstrate that light can travel in bent glass fibres. His research paper entitled “A Flexible Fiberscope, using Static Scanning” appeared in scientific journal Nature in its January 2, 1954 issue and paved the way for instruments such as endoscopes and laser probes. Kapany followed up this first paper with one published inDr. Narinder S. Kapany in lab in 1950sSo when the 2009 Nobel for Physics went to Charles Kao for the discovery of Fibre Optics, the scientific community was stunned at the exclusion of Kapany. True, Kao also had made tremendous strides in the field, but his work was only the successor of the ground breaking research undertaken by Kapany, and built upon it. Once again, due to the blatant refusal to award Indians a Nobel (as has been the case withAs has been in ages before and will be in ages hence, history’s depths throw up a few names, that rise above and shine as beacons of excellence for the wayfaring humanity to take courage and inspiration from. What happens to the many others who helped mankind progress in equal measure? Why are they bogged down to murky depths of oblivion with seeming randomness? Why is it that as a race of beings, we fail to take cognizance of some of the most stellar efforts that make us what we are today? Why is it that cruel life goes on unchanged, not realizing how it has indeed been phenomenally changed by men such as these? Why indeed?

There is a gradual increase of suicides in India among the student population, most between the age of 17 to 25.Students age 14 studying in 9th standards are committing suicides.Why?Academic pressure, the pressure of fulfilling parents' expectations, peer pressure, the urge to be perfect and on top all the time.Recently I saw a small teaser of a new serial on Colours. From the serial, I can chalk out that the storyline is around how children treat their parents wrong and harsh. But the question is that has there been any series on the extremely worst behavior of parents on Indian Cine TV?No.Because that what how society fabricates. It's never the parent's mistake, it's never the parent's problem, every time it's the problem of f*cking child.I have never seen parents take responsibility for their actions nor ever acknowledge it. If they commit a mistake then they try to justify it by giving some hogwash emotional blackmail or by shifting the entire blame on their child.The guy who was a topper with me in the 10th, later he got admission in NIT. What next?My neighbor didn't want to marry, but her mother's constant pressure and emotional blackmailing let her do it. It was a setup of an arranged marriage, within one year due to domestic violence she ran from the marriage. Now she is staying with her parents, but they want her to go back to it to save their families grace.My friend scrambles for a part-time job when I asked her the reason for her desperation. She said that she is counseling with a therapist and she herself is affording her mental health care expenses. I asked her whether her parents about her depression issue, she said she has kept them in shadow. Because even she says it they won't acknowledge it and on top blame her for it too.I know many people who broke with the person they loved because their parents didn't approve of them and led a sad life.The reason I gave NEET was also because of my parents. Because they decided it and I felt that I should make my parents happy by cracking that exam. Not me there were many people who have done the same.Even children try to make their parents happy, most of the decisions children take to appease their parents. Every child wants their parents to be proud of them irrespective of what weight the action makes them do.Always to portray children as evil, bad and rude, sounds so caricaturish. I think it's high time that people stop misusing the tag of “Elder” or “Parents.”Not all children are bad, not all children are cruel. Sometimes they may talk back or retaliate because your decisions may not be well for them, that doesn't mean they don't love or value you.Also demanding emotional, mental, or financial support isn't bad. Parents are the closest source for any child, if a person feels threatened it's obvious for them to call for help.The Gen Z shifting to online or others platforms for entertainment shows that Indian Television is not for all. Especially the way they directly portray people wrong due to old perspectives.A small proverb:“The same boiling water that softens the potato hardens the egg.”Sometimes the decisions you feel that is good for us, can be contagious for us too. Not everyone is wired in the same way, the way in which you perceive the world.Stats of children committing suicide.That Parents can be wrong too. That Elders can be wrong too. There are abusive parents in just the same way as children.It's high to stop putting people on a pedestal just because of their age.“QUE SERA SERA.”","1,196 followers",Mayur Tasre,5.7K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-facts-about-India-that-Indians-are-generally-unaware-of-1

The experience was just amazing!!Edit 1:India is also the proud home of the earliest dockyard, which is truly the landmark of maritime history of the world. The earliest Dockyard is found at the site of Lothal in Gujrat. This dockyard as in the words of great archaeologist DR. SR RAO has features comparable to those of dockyards at Mumbai and Vishakapatnam. Also this dockyard could handle 60 ships and 30 tonnes of cargo which is remarkable.Another site is Dholavira of the Kutch region of Gujrat. This site is unique in several respects but I wish to highlight just one.So India again is the proud home of the world's earliest sign board. The oldest and the most ancient sign board comes from this site. It includes 10 symbols of the undeciphered Indus script. Each symbol is 37 cm(approx) in height and is made of gypsum. This important find was excavated near the northern gateway of Dholavira indicating that it was put up on the gateway so that everyone could read again indicating widespread literacy among the harappans.PS.

Your son, your daughter, your younger brother and sister..The place isKota (Rajasthan) .. they call it the education hub of India. But I Want all of you to know some facts about this place. Please be aware and create awareness.It's not uncommon if some student just starts to cry in in front of you .. such is a life in Kota.WhyJee syllabus _ 1sf year engineering and AIPMT _ 1st year MBBS ..So, hailing from schools that follow only NCERT .. we can't solve the paper on our own.EditI am not saying Kota is wrong, I just tried to show the truth. Again sorry I may not be 100% correct and I have not commented on selection rate of this city because I dont care if one looses creativity and interest in the core subjects and than anyhow get into IIT or Medical and loose all interest to study (not applies to all,forgive me for saying but to many of students it happens)We have NTSE scholars in last batch in Kota because they are already exhausted in solving those deadly questions and have lost the interest they used to previously have. Such a preparation should be avoided which detriotes your health and makes you a robo ! Thats what my point is. (I was myself NTSE scholar, so I know it better than you)Edit2I didn't write this answer to defame this place as mentioned in comments section but tried to bring up the truth with a hope that awareness by people will force coachings to care about students and make some necessary changes.And many voices remained unheard, when the ambitions became heavy on life itself, when a bad score created lack of confidence for whole life, when the sun didn't shine the next day in somebody's life, when the smiles were lost in filling those OMRs, when childhood became the worst time for somebody,when we lost so many great writers, thinkers, scientists, inventors in this rat race, who grow up to become 9 to 5 workers, unsatisfied.When the hunger for knowledge turned into lust for marks, when for some parents their kids became source of fulfilling their own dreams.When India lost Indians..For us depression is just a word & suicide is just a number.Someone mentioned in comments that suicides happen in IITs too but why stress snuffs life ? Why education has to be a burden and not a source of happiness ?What is wrong if I have written about it ? For people to read, discuss and understand.I don't need your certificate to prove I am right, It took sometime to write this answer, It took some daring to go against system to show you all. And what I get for return ?? Nothing. So, why would I do it, if I am wrong or not concerned ?Guys, look at the video Rajesh Maheshwari’s shameful speech to their staff. He is the director of Allen Career Institute. And someone has leaked the video, it has gone viral.He says I am the don of coaching industry. Thsy have a Target to fulfil till 2025, and that is 5 lakh students must be enrolled in Classroom course. He has not said about how to teach or how to handle children. The speech is extremely shameful. I have not written about it but please see that.We are a clowns of circus, these people use us, spit on us and than we don’t say anything. Look at the comment section. It is filled with comments that say change yourself why to change the system. That say its not only Kota and finally trying to prove that all students who have undergone through this phase were weak. Again only one thing for us suicide is just a number, 25 students commit suicide due to study pressure in Kota. We read ignore. They say we were pressure free and trying to disapprove all facts I have written.. We promote their behavoir, there is a thin line been struggle, hardwork and slavery that forces you to beleive your master is your god and whatever he do is correct for you.There is a difference between preparing for an exam or being raised for slaughter. There is a difference between learning or being tortured. There is a difference between life and death. We are humans, we are not the pets. We have thinking capacity and look at this coaching system. What is good in that, tell me a single positive point you can see there.And yes watching so many students break here in this mecca of education, only thought coming to my mind is what these kids might have done if there were no pressure of performance and these high expectations.How can they expect 16–17 year old kids to perform the best, to remain stress free when they shift them to lower batches, the peer pressure immensely increases, in their hostels they feel afraid to face people because only thing asked is what's your batch ? Your rank ? And being walked over if they aren't performing.Edit:So, my dear countrymen. Why you feel shocked when a bridge falls because of a corrupt engineer, when poor people loose their kidneys because of these so called best doctors, hospital scams are so common, why IAS officer asked for dowry in my city, why police is not working?And than only thought coming to our angry minds is where is their humanity ? Sorry to say, but it is destroyed in the road to position, power and money. They are slaves of their lust, dont expect much from them, because that’s what our system teaches them. Very few gentleman are left, and because of them there is safety.The students who felt it was wrong have already left the race, these humans with complete passion have given up and currently facing socital pressure for doing so.before making them engineer and doctor, make them a human, I request you parents and money making minds.Guys, and one more thing. There is a claim by coachings of Kota that it’s the average and below average students who take such steps. But one thing I want to make clear that, in every phase there are around 1600 students, out of which coaching system puts 1400 in “average category”. Dont become a victim of this claim. And it proves that they dont care about lives of average students. Not each life is precious maybe.and my dear, if you are a student going through shit in life, in any such building, I assure you that you will be strong when you come out of here, and dont worry about it. You are not alone, not at all ! See, there are many people going through all this. And if you think you are average, everyone else is in something or other is average.Don’t blame yourself all the time, don’t live with regrets. Everything is waiting for you, there is a whole new life waiting for you buddy, please dont take any fatal step. You are the most precious person. You know what you are, but you dont know what you maybe.We cant judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree.Your friends and relatives cant judge you, by your ability to solve a question in JEE and NEET.

Here is an excerpt from that post:Not regressive, shitty and intolerant enough?Read the entire post here:The outcome of those protests?The fashion show event was cancelled after protestors gathered in big numbers outside the venue. Organizers were left threatened and humiliated while the efforts of numerous participants who had been preparing for days, it all went down the drain.The protestors won despite the faculties intervening and organizers pleading. Nothing worked.Weren't these protestors regressive and intolerant?Or are those terms only reserved for Hindus?I am asking those questions because had the same things happened in BHU, Varanasi, media all across the spectrum would have took on Yogi's Uttar Pradesh (mind it, not UP but Yogi's UP), rising intolerance in the country, the growing saffronization of North India, surging communalism by RSS, BJP and Modi, and what not.Turns out, Swarajya, Indian Express and Scroll were the only ones to cover the story. In fact, Indian Express wrote a very small piece on this, flushed down to such corners of the paper that hardly anyone would have read the news at all.Ravish Kumar who is known to be the champion of student's issues keeps mum now. Not a word to say. His NDTV, Sagarika's Times of India, Shekhar Gupta's The Print, Venu's The Wire, and of course, The Quint, all kept their mouths shut. The supposed boss lady and champion of feminism in India, Barkha Dutt had no time for this story either. Not even for a damned tweet!Nor did any other media house, big and small. No one even wrote a small story about it.My question is, why?Isn't this the media bigot and being biased? Biased against one religion, Hinduism?Not just them but all those liberals, NGOs, known personalities which champion feminism, all of them kept quiet. Swara Bhasker said nothing. No tweets at all. Same was the case with Sonam Kapoor, Mallika Dua and all that band of people.I am a hardcore atheist, but I do detest when people attach filters of religion or political bias, and just condone off ill acts coming from regressive minds of one religion, while overly magnifying the ill acts hailing out of regressive minds from another (Hinduism).I can bet, there exists not a single stand up video on YouTube from any leading Indian comedian, in which any Muslim or Christian is involved in regressive acts.

Wasn't that intolerance?But Kunal Kamra and Dhruv Rathee will surely mock every single wrong coming out from anyone Hindu, especially in Uttar Pradesh, linking it all to saffron, RSS and the juggernaut evil BJP.Why?Because he and all other standup comedians and celebrities and known personalities know that Hindus don't pose a threat to them. Not really. Muslims don't either. But they know which community is more likely to take offence, and to what extent and intensity. And, so they play safe.In this answer, in no way am I asserting that ill acts coming out of regressive factions of Hindus are justified.All I am underscoring is that the regressive acts, coming from any faction, any religion, any gender must be looked at and be shamed the same way. Period.What is a fact about India that Indians are generally unaware of?That there is a lot of wrong that happens in the country and goes absolutely unreported just because it has nothing to do with Hinduism, and also because it has everything to do with the minority religions.Its blatant and ugly propaganda, and majority falls for it everyday. That is the fact.I hope this answer adds some perspective to the extant discourse on this subject.Note:Signing off,Shilanjan",36 followers,Wiseversity,5.3K,71,211.4K,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-facts-about-India-that-Indians-are-generally-unaware-of-1

He isIf we look at the history of the last 5000 years, Indians have for 4700 years been the cradle of technology, architecture, political science, warfare in some way or the other. But now, we have become humble and powerless due to our tolerance, and the Western world is benefitting through it at our cost.Regardless, Shiva has grown to become more popular now, so many may have identified him, with his stature grew as a politician and whatnot, the point remains that he was a prodigy who made the conventional office mail system into working code by himself at the age of 14. According to him, Tomlinson, who is attributed to this achievement had used white supremacy tactics to take the credit for inventing EMAIL, and he was unable to find the required support from the community due to his race at the time. However, now he is again fighting for himself and things have begun to straighten up.Indians are perceived to be humble, and our achievements are downplayed by the western world, this is nothing new. Our architectural marvels, made thousands of years ago are ignored, while Europian churches made after Renaissance, are considered historic. Our contributions are downplayed, and even mocked as pseudoscience when it’s being realized that Science as of now has been unable to explore even a tiny part of the universe we live in. And this has not stopped, our inventors, scientists, and even engineers and doctors are amongst the best, and at the same time, the lowest paid and are considered too simple for being an inspiration.As a nation, India need role models. And we don’t need white role models, at least after 300 years of oppression that they have inflicted over us, and the whole world of course. We know how Africa became so poor, we know who used all our resources, and we still end up idolizing them.I’m not asking to stop respecting Zuckerberg, or Jobs. I’m asking to acknowledge Shiva. EMAIL is as big an idea as Facebook, if not bigger, And a 14-year-old may not have entirely created it, but our nation surely has been a victim, and we continue to let ourselves stay that way by ignoring our intellectuals and thinkers.Note:He has also been in some controversies in recent times, and I don’t support all his ideas.

Oh, and if anybody asks you why you did it, let them know it is a free country and you have the freedom of expression; the freedom to make fun of other people's century-old beliefs.India is such a country where celebrities do not give up to appear woke and be a part of pseudo-movements. On one hand, you will see them becoming ambassadors of PETA and asking everyone to go vegan and on the other hand, they will be feasting on steak for dinner. Just like how Alia Bhatt is wearing a dress that says “Speak up for Animals"". Quite a noble initiative, right? Well, not when you are holding a leather bag yourself! Practice before you preach, madam!Plus, this kind of movement sees the light of the day when Hindu festivals are around the corner. When Durga Puja was approaching, certain groups in West Bengal started a vegan campaign while during this time, people rejoice in the festive spirit and eat to the fullest. Good luck preaching the same theory during Bakri-Eid. If there is a shortage of goats in some locality, they might ring your bell if you dare to say anything against it. So basically, as long as you hurt Hindu sentiments, you are safe.This is not just applicable to the woke-ness where animal rights are concerned.

Joining both hands ensures touching the tips of all the fingers together, which are linked to pressure points in the eyes, ears, and mind. Pressing them together is said to activate these, helping us remember that person for a long time2.Sitting on a floor and eatingThis tradition is not just about sitting on the floor and eating, it is regarding sitting in the ""Sukhasan"" position and then eating. Sukhasan is the position we normally use for Yoga asanas. Sitting in this position while eating helps in improving digestion as the circulatory system can focus solely upon digestion and not on our legs dangling from a chair or supporting us while we are standing.3.Why not to sleep with your head towards North?Myth is that it invites ghost or death but science says that it is because human body has its own magnetic field (Also known as hearts magnetic field, because the flow of blood) and Earth is a giant magnet. When we sleep with head towards north, our body's magnetic field become completely asymmetrical to the Earth's Magnetic field. That cause problems related to blood pressure and our heart needs to work harder in order to overcome this asymmetry of Magnetic fields.4.Surya NamaskarHindus have a tradition of paying regards to Sun God early in the morning by their water offering ritual. It was mainly because looking at Sun rays through water or directly at that time of the day is good for eyes and also by waking up to follow this routine, we become prone to a morning lifestyle and mornings are proven to be the most effective part of the day.5.Touching feet (charan-sparsh)Usually, the person of whose feet you are touching is either old or pious. When they accept your respect which came from your reduced ego (and is called your shraddha) their hearts emit positive thoughts and energy (which is called their karuna) which reaches you through their hands and toes. In essence, the completed circuit enables the flow of energy and increases cosmic energy, switching on a quick connection between two minds and hearts. To an extent, the same is achieved through handshakes and hugs.6.Why do we fast?The underlying principle behind fasting is to be found in Ayurveda. This ancient Indian medical system sees the basic cause of many diseases as the accumulation of toxic materials in the digestive system. Regular cleansing of toxic materials keeps one healthy. By fasting, the digestive organs get rest and all body mechanisms are cleansed and corrected. A complete fast is good for health, and the occasional intake of warm lemon juice during the period of fasting prevents flatulence.Do Upvote if you agree.",4 followers,Priyam Sharma,741,87,526.5K,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-facts-about-India-that-Indians-are-generally-unaware-of-1

Bakshi was born in 1921, in the Gulyana village near Rawalpindi, British India. After graduating from the Rawalpindi’s Gordon College in 1942, Zorawar Chand Bakshi was commissioned into the Baloch Regiment in 1943.He gave a tough time to the Japanese advancing in Burma in his first major mission during the World War II, which also earned him a Mention-in-Despatches (honour received for acts of gallantry and distinguished and meritorious service in operational areas).After India's partition in 1947, he was transferred to the 5th Gorkha Rifles of the Indian Army and was caught in thick of action during the Indo-Pak War of 1947-48.He displayed exceptional bravery and was awarded the Vir Chakra in July 1948.While the border tensions with China were on a high in 1949, Major Bakshi embarked on a secret mission to Lhasa. He disguised himself as a Tibetan monk and traversed a distance of 400 km in 80 days, across the Himalayas, to obtain vital strategic intelligence for India.He was awarded the coveted MacGregor Medal (honour given to Indian Armed Forces personnel for valuable military reconnaissance) for this secret mission in 1949.But his most historic military feat was as a Brigade Commander in the Indo-Pak War in 1965.He remained at the forefront and displayed exemplary leadership. His ability to lead his troops from the front helped the Indian army capture the strategic Haji Pir Pass in the Uri Sector from the Pakistani forces.He was then awarded the Maha Vir Chakra, India's second highest gallantry medal.He was awarded the Param Vishisht Seva Medal for commanding the battle and capturing the Chicken’s Neck (the Siliguri Corridor) during the Indo-Pak War in 1971.Later, in 1975, he went on to command the Premier 2 Corps, the largest single offensive Indian force ever mustered for war.He also played a crucial part of the UN peacekeeping mission in Congo in 1960s. This time,he missed the 1962 Indo-China War. In 1969, he was posted as the Major General in Nagaland where he actively participated in the counter-insurgency operations.He was not just a highly decorated officer, but was known to be a master strategist. Even after his retirement, soldiers sought his strategic advice on Siachen.He was a true military icon and a source of inspiration to the past and present generations of officers in India.Affectionately nicknamed 'Zoru' by his friends and colleagues, he was also a great human being.But, our greatest wartime hero, General Zorawar Chand Bakshi didn't receive a befitting day farewell and he was laid to rest unsung. There was no ceremonial send-off, no ritual last rites at the crematorium, no last post, no rise, and only one wreath was laid. Lt.

So you have to rush to church right now.As it wasn't good to travel in Nagaland at around 12:30 am, soMe: Thank You sir, We appreciate your prompt efforts. But due to certain reasons, I am unable to come right now. Can't we meet by tomorrow morning?VCC: He seemed annoyed and said we villagers are gathered now and if you insist to gather again by tomorrow, you will have to pay the entire expenses as well as their wages.As it was better to accept paying them rather travelling, I nodded in Yes.Next Morning at ChurchCrowd was there at Church, we have taken to the place where that thief has stored stolen items, we have identified it and given in writin.Now the Village Judicial process started, that thief was brought in the centre of church stage and was surrounded by Village Council Members holding heavy iron bound bamboo.VCC: Are you accepting that, you have stolen the items.Thief: No Sir….Boom…Boom… that bumboo started bitting and after couple of second he accepted.Now, it was the time of judgement. So , VCC has issued a letter, where it was written that, the so called thief has been identified and his name will not be considered as a name for new baby from now onwards. He will never been considered for village meeting in any case. It was then spread to all the Church in Nagaland. We were dumbstruck, How a person name can be nullifiedfrom entire State.Don't you think it's the biggest punishment one can get.Hats off to Nagaland Honest people…Now, Its up to you to decide wether you have heard about it earlier or not.Beautiful Mokokchung, where I spent almost Two amazing Years .",1 follower,Anurag Verma,727,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-facts-about-India-that-Indians-are-generally-unaware-of-1

Its rich mythology, vast size, and many cultural peculiarities make it fertile ground for many strange tales and legends. Some of them are clearly fabricated, others just strange enough that they just might be true, and others still are so strange that they could change our entire perception of the world.10 The Village Of TwinsThe distant village of Kodinhi, Kerala has a secret. Not a particularly hidden secret, mind you—it’s actually pretty hard to miss. The village’s claim to fame is the abnormal amount of twins [ http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/5306898/Indian-village-with-250-sets-of-twins.html ] born there. Kodinhi only has around 2,000 families, yet there are 250 sets of twins officially registered there. In fact, there could be many more—experts estimate there could be as many as 350 sets of twins in the area.It gets stranger. It is estimated that the number of twins born in the village is increasing every year, and no one really knows why [ http://news.sky.com/story/692499/india-twin-births-baffle-doctors-in-kerala ]. This is all the more remarkable because twins are especially rare in India—on average, four out of every 1,000 Indian births are twins. In Kodinhi, the number is 45 per 1,000 births. Doctors have absolutely no idea what is causing this strange phenomenon. They assume there must be some unknown hereditary factor at work, or maybe it’s something they eat. Until they find out for sure, the Village of Twins remains one of the strangest curiosities of perhaps the most mysterious country in the world.9 The Jodhpur BoomOn December 18, 2012, a sudden, deafening boom [ http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-12-18/jaipur/35889559_1_sonic-boom-jodhpur-defence-personnel ] startled the people of Jodhpur. It seemed to come out of nowhere, crashing in the sky like the sonic boom caused by an airplane breaking the speed of sound. However, it was more aggressive in nature, sounding a lot like a massive explosion. The citizens were concerned about the sound and asked around about it, but it soon turned out that no planes had been flying over the area and no explosions had taken place. The source of the “Jodhpur boom” was a complete mystery.The weirdest part is that it appears that the entire month was littered with strange, unexplained booms all over the world [ http://www.ufo-blogger.com/2012/12/sonic-boom-heard-in-usa-uk-and-india.html ], from United Kingdom to Texas. These bangs were witnessed over the course of several weeks and sometimes they were accompanied with strange green light. In one of the locations, a geologist even stated that the booms and subsequent tremors were unlike anything he had ever encountered and didn’t fit the official explanation that the Air Force were testing a new plane.Were these strange sounds all over the world connected somehow? Was it some strange new weapon, or an alien attack, or maybe even a mere coincidence? Perhaps one day, we’ll find out.8 The Nine Unknown MenThe Nine Unknown Men are to India what the Illuminati is to the Western world, but even more pervasive and mysterious. According to legend, this powerful secret society [ http://www.indohistory.com/nine_unknown_men.html ] was founded by Emperor Asoka in 273 BC after a bloody battle that took the lives of 100,000 men. The function of the Nine Unknown Men was to preserve and develop the sort of secret information that would be too dangerous in the hands of the uninitiated.Each of the Nine was tasked with holding a special book of knowledge [ http://web.archive.org/web/20020822140454/http://zenzibar.com/news/article.asp?id=2085 ], ranging from propaganda to microbiology. Some of them are even said to hold the secrets of anti-gravity and time travel. Occasionally, some of this precious information leaks out into the world—for instance, it is said that the martial art of Judo was based on “leaks” from the Book of Physiology.The number of the Unknown Men is always nine, and their undisguised contacts with the outside world are few and far between. Much like the Illuminati, there are many rumors about their current and past members. Strangely enough, not all of them are Indian—the Unknown Men are apparently spread all over the world, with some of them allegedly holding very prominent positions. Among suspected members of the Nine Unknown are the influential 10th century Pope Sylvester II and Vikram Sarabhai, the scientist who created India’s budding space program.7 The Great Taj Mahal ConspiracyTaj Mahal is without question the most famous—and possibly the most beautiful—building in India. Considered one of the modern wonders of the world, this ornate white marble building was created by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a mausoleum to his deceased wife. Or was it?According to some theories, Taj Mahal was never the architectural embodiment of eternal love [ http://www.hindunet.org/hindu_history/modern/godbole_taj1.html ] history remembers it as. Instead, some evidence suggests that the building is actually about 300 years older [ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lbrvB3lltw ] than its supposed builder. New Delhi professor P.N. Oak, the man behind this theory, claims that the building was originally not a mausoleum at all. He suggests it is actually an ancient Hindu temple known as Tejo Mahalaya dedicated to the worship of the god Shiva. If true, this turns the entire history of TaJ Mahal on its head: Instead of building one of the world’s most precious constructions, Shah Jahan would merely have taken an existing temple, slapped on some decorations, and dedicated it to his wife.While this may seem far-fetched to those of us who like Taj Mahal as it is, it’s worth noticing that Indian royalty have a history of capturing enemy temples and mansions and repurposing them into tombs for their loved ones. What’s more, the memoirs of travelers in the area during the time of Taj Mahal’s supposed construction make no mention of its building and even note that the “Taj” already existed as an important, established building. Is Taj Mahal as the ultimate display of romance just a giant lie created by shoddy historians and propagandists? Until the Indian government agrees to open the sealed rooms within the building so they can be thoroughly investigated by experts, the mystery remains.6 The Cursed Village Of KuldharaFor over 500 years, the village of Kuldhara was populated by about 1,500 residents. One night, they all disappeared [ http://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/rajasthan-s-cursed-village-near-jaisalmer-kuldhara-18975.html ]. They didn’t die or get abducted or anything—they just left. The reason for their sudden evacuation is lost in time. Some say they fled the taxation of an oppressive rulers, while others weave a tale of young lovers and the girl’s angry father who was a big shot at the village.Whatever the actual cause of desertion, one thing is generally agreed upon—when the villagers left, they cursed the area so that no one may live there ever again. Of course, some people tried to take over the cozy, abandoned village. According to legend, all who tried died a brutal death. Some of the people who have died in there are said to still haunt the village [ http://daily.bhaskar.com/article/BZR-revealed-mystery-behind-the-haunted-village-of-kuldhara-4256276-NOR.html ], according to paranormal investigators who have experienced some very strange events in the place.Whether all of this is true or not, the village has certainly gained a frightening reputation. It remains deserted to this very day, and no one has even considered repopulating it for a long time.5 The Magnetic Hill Of LadakhIn the region of Ladakh near the Himalayas, there is a very strange hill [ http://binscorner.com/pages/m/magnetic-hill-in-ladakh-defies-gravity.html ] that is said to be magnetic. If you park your car on the road that leads to the top of the hill and leave it in neutral, it will roll up the steep road by its own accord, moving at speeds up to 20 kilometers per hour (12.4 mph). This wonderful natural—or, as some travel guides will tell you, supernatural—phenomenon is called a “Himalayan wonder” and is a popular attraction for the travelers of the area.The real truth behind the “Magnetic” Hill of Ladakh is pretty impressive, but sadly, not quite as mysterious. It’s actually just an optical illusion [ http://www.gconnect.in/outdoor/lifestyle/get-ahead/magnetic-hill-leh-ladakh-mystery-explained.html ] created by the peculiar geography of the area. The mountains, road, and hill are aligned in a very specific way that makes the area seem a steep uphill terrain, but the road actually goes slightly downhill. Thus, the car left out of gear in a certain point of the road will appear to roll uphill.4 The Immortal Beings Of The HimalayasIn many mythologies, mountains are natural homes to divine and immortal beings. As such, it’s no surprise that the world’s mightiest mountain range, the Himalayas, is subject to whisperings of mysterious beings [ http://www.akhandjyoti.org/?Akhand-Jyoti/2004/Mar-Apr/ImmortalBeingsHimalayas/ ] hidden away in the valleys of the mountains.One popular legend among the practitioners of various New Age soul-searching methods is Gyanganj.

Self-inflicted whippings, painful ceremonial piercings, and even self-crucifixion are examples of rituals still practiced by religious devotees today. However, one act of extreme devotion may take the cake for the most bizarre.In 1970, Sadhu Amar Bharati, abandoned traditional lifestyle and decided to completely devote himself to his religious beliefs; in particular the Hindu deity Shiva. Everything was going fine until three years later when he decided his devotion wasn’t strong enough. He wanted to show his devotion in a unique way that would also disconnect him from worldly luxuries. Amar decided to raise his right hand to the sky and keep it there, indefinitely. He’s also told journalists that he intends the act to be a protest for world peace, from neighborhood to neighborhood and around the world.As expected, Amar experienced the typical numbness and tingling that we all feel when a limb “falls asleep.” And even when that light tingling turned to extreme pain, Amar endured. After a certain amount of time, he claims the pain subsided and now the arm stands erect, seemingly on its own. The muscles have atrophied and the girth of the right arm has shrunk in relation to his left. Since clipping his nails would have required bringing the arm down, Amar hasn’t trimmed them in decades. His nails now are mangled and curl around his fingers.Perhaps even more strangely, Amar isn’t alone in his one-handed salute to Shiva.

He was born as a prince to the Brahman King of Kanchipuram city who belonged to Pallava Dynasty in Southern India.Bodhidharma was never interested in politics instead he was interested in the teachings of Buddha. So, he chose to study with the famous Buddhist master Prajnatara and became a Buddhist monk. He started living in his monastery and it was here where he was given the name Bodhidharma.After the death of his father, Bodhidharma started spreading the teachings of Buddha throughout India under the guidance of his mentor. Years later, Bodhidharma’s master passed away and he decided to leave for China to spread the real teachings of Buddha in Zhen Dan(Ancient China) in order to fulfill the last request of his master.Picture depicting his journey to Zhen Dhan(Ancient China)In 527 AD, Bodhidharma crossed through the Guangzhou province into China. It is believed that Bodhidharma’s journey to China have taken three years.Once he started spreading Buddhism in China, he had to face skepticism and opposition because of his teachings on real Buddhism. He proposed that Buddhist scriptures were only a guide for achieving Enlightenment and that enlightenment itself can only be attained by practicing Dhyana (Zazen). For teaching the authentic meditation based Buddhism he was ostracized and rejected by the people after which he had to spend many months as a beggar. It was then he decided to move to Shaolin Monastery.Stone scripture of Bodhidharma depicting Zazen(dhyana)A brief history of Shaolin TempleIn 495 AD Ba Tuo, or Buddhabhadra an another Indian monk came to China teaching a form of Buddhism known as Xiao Sheng Buddhism.

The financial, industrial and military assistance of India formed a crucial component of the British campaign against Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.India strategic location at the tip of the Indian Ocean, its large production of armaments, and its huge armed forces played a decisive role in halting the progress of Imperial Japan in the Pacific Theatre.The British Indian Army was one of the largest Allied forces contingents which took part in the North African campaign.Under Axis powersIndian contribution under the axis powers is not as well known as that of Indian participation under Allied powers.Subhas Chandra bose,a well known Indian freedom fighter collaborated with National Socialist Germany and Imperial Japan in order to remove British Raj.Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose meeting with top German officials during visit to Germany.Netaji meeting with German Leader Adolf Hitler.Indian’s under the Banner of Free India Legion or Tiger Legion fought on the side of Germany in various war theaters. Tiger Legion mainly constituted of Indian POW’S captured during the North African Campaign of Afrika Korps.Netaji encouraged Indian soldiers to not contribute towards the British war effort and join the Axis powers.Tiger Legion Soldiers protecting the Atlantic Wall,France 1944.In same wayFlag of Azad Hind Fauj/Free Indian LegionAzad Hind Fauj collaborated most actively with the Imperial Japanese Army in the Burma campaign.INA was instrumental in both Battle of Imphal and Battle of Kohima.Both of these battles are known as the turning point of Arakan Offensive of Japanese army.Battle of Kohima is also known as “Stalingrad of East”.In 2013, the British National army museum voted the Battle of Imphal and Kohima to be ""Britain's Greatest Battle"".Colonel Shaukat Malik of the Indian National Army, (INA) hoisted the Tricolour for the first time on Indian soil on 14 April 1944 in the small town of Moirang in Manipur.INA also formally governed Andaman & Nicobar Islands from 1943–1945.Though the Japanese Intervention in the working of provisional Government is highly controversial.Bengal Famine of 1943Now,apart from Military campaigns from the brave Indian soldiers on both the sides.Another tragic event known asBritish Prime Winston Churchill during that time held quite extreme negative view of India.Churchill’s hostility toward Indians has long been documented. Reportedly, when he first received a telegram from the British colonial authorities in New Delhi about the rising toll of famine deaths in Bengal, his reaction was simply that he regretted that nationalist leader Mahatma Gandhi was not one of the victims.British Government never formally declared state of Famine and deliberately supplied the stockpiles of food arriving from Canada & U.S.A to British Army as reserves and not to the suffering common masses in Bengal.Bengal Famine clearly depicts the British Hypocrisy as on the one hand it accused Axis Powers of Human rights violation and on the other hand killing millions of Bengalis without any apology to the Tragic events of 1943 till today.British conduct in 1943 was one of the few examples of horrors of the British Raj in India.Winston Churchill,who is still considered as a hero in Britain was one of the worst Mass Murderers that ever existed.Churchill was no different than Hitler or Stalin .He himself said,“History will be kind to me, for I intend to write it myself.”Above given images gives a very little Glimpse about the problems and horrible coditions suffered by people during the Bengal Famine during World War-2.Sad part is many of our Fellow Indians do not remember the sacrifices made by our forefathers during the World War.Many of us still don’t know about the atrocities committed on our past generations by British Raj.We fought a war which was never ours.We sacrificed for gains that were never given to us.It is quite well said that,“We even risked our lives to save the land of those who have occupied ours”.Source -",3 followers,Tilak M,584,54,2.4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-facts-about-India-that-Indians-are-generally-unaware-of-1

The Tsunami caused millions of tonnes of Titanium Ore on the beaches .Considering that known global resources of the ore are in the region of 285 million tonnes and titanium is among the most sought-after metals in the world, you could call that a silver lining.What is Titanium ?Titanium is an important metal because of its high strength to weight ratio - it is as strong as steel, but 45 per cent lighter. It's also twice as strong as aluminium, but only 60 per cent heavier. Because of its strength, lightness, extraordinary corrosion resistance, and ability to withstand extreme temperatures, it finds use in the aerospace industry. It is also extensively used for consumer products such as automobiles, computers and mobile phones.Valuation of the Titanium on the beaches of Tamil Nadu:1 Kg of Titanium = $ 3.651 US ton of Titanium = 907.185 * 3.65 = 3311.225Reserves of Titanium (Estimate) = 40 million Tonnes(Official figures are even more, this was just the initial estimate)Income from Only Titanium Reserves (estimate) = 3311.225 * 40 million= $ 132449.01 million =Indian Budget in 2015 was $ 280 billion. Just imagine all that money if we could extract the Titanium and other ores from the beaches of Tamil Nadu.There has been rumors that the reserves exceed 500 million tonnes, in which case we could probably become a Economic Superpower.What’s the Problem ?Its unobtainable until now. Times of India :This was largely because India had little or no capability in placer mining and the ore is essentially available in coastal placer deposits.What the CSIR project is trying to do is to make the mining of the ore commercially feasible.

In the last decade and a half, India's wealth has increased by more than 3 times – from 75 trillion rupees to 224 trillion rupees.

India's wealth distribution is even more skewed as a result.This unprecedented increase in inequality has been accompanied by a fall in human development indicators in India. India’s share in world’s hungry people has gone up from 1/5th in 1991 to 1/4th in 2015. Similarly, India's share in world illiteracy has also increased in this period.India’s children suffer from acute undernutrition – with a large percentage of children suffering from stunting and other problems. Child undernourishment in India is worse than those of countries designated Least Developed Countries (LDC). The per capita income of these LDC is less than half that of India.India has one of the most privatized health care systems in the world. Every year, 40 million Indians are pushed into poverty because of the burden of health-related out of pocket expenditures.If we divide the total wealth of all Indian families equally, the average wealth of an Indian family would be Rs. 9 lakhs in 2015. 90% of Indian families do not have this average wealth. Also, 70% of the families do not even have assets worth Rs. 3.25 lakhs -- an amount which will provide for the most basic kind housing. Just by redistributing only a fraction of the wealth – only about one-third of the 90 trillion rupees that the top 1% have amassed over the last 15 years -- all Indian families could have basic housing.

Though now they are using nudity to sell their goods and attain their capitalistic ends yet they should be praised for the revolution. But what of the inspiring India?Well it's all still taboo in India. Parents don't have the sex talk with their kids going through puberty because its taboo. Kids later find it out from their immature friends and internet which has negative impact because it is imprinted in their mind that it's bad. If just parents talked about sex with their kids and explained them how they should behave maybe boys wouldn't grow up to be sex hungry beasts and the rape cases wouldn't be this high. Because it is not revealing clothes of girls or sexually explicit movies that result in rape but taboo of explaining about sex to your growing kid who may later learn about it but from wrong sources.Kids brought up in naturist family where everyone is casual about nudity, where kids from an early age have been watching their parents naked develop a different perspective towards nudity.

Right to maintenance forms a part of the personal law. Obligation of a husband to maintain his wife arises out of the status of the marriage.

The Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956, provides for this right.4.Only 3% of Indians pay income tax. in a population of 1.2bn. One explanation for this is that agriculture is exempt and two-thirds of Indians live in rural areas. A large chunk of the economy is also informal, unorganised labour, for which it's harder to collect taxes. Many argue that some of the country's financial problems would be solved in one fell swoop, if this massive tax hole could be filled.5.The world's biggest family: The man with 39 wives, 94 children and 33 grandchildren,IndiaHe is head of the world's biggest family – and says he is 'blessed' to have his 39 wives.

These are (a) inertial confinement fusion (ICF) and (b) magnetic confinement fusion (MCF). Beside these we can define the group of miscellaneous concepts which contains electrostatic confinement, and hybrid concepts of MCF and ICF.Besides the distinction in technologies to create fusion there is a coarse distinction in the type of fusion, namely, neutronic and aneutronic fusion. Neutronic fusion means that primarily excess neutrons carry the energy of the fusion reaction and aneutronic fusion means that primarily excess charged particles carry the energy.Inertial confinementA problem with both the Z-machine and the NIF is not being able to have repeated shots, due to the huge power requirements per shot (for both) and the physical limitations of the liners (Z-machine) and the current lasers (NIF). During the coming years NIF is doing a proof-of-concept for nuclear fusion by laser-assisted inertial confinement. Depending on the developments at NIF, HIPER will be constructed in 2028.It provides a different angle for plasma research than controlled fusion which could be used in for instance plasma accelerator development, high energy laser development and tracking technologies.Magnetic confinementThe Tokamak design has been built since the 1950's in various forms and since then the performance numbers have exponentially increased in time with increased size of the reactors and with evolving operating regimes.With project ITER the reactor size is again increased and the expected increase in performance should lead to a net gain in energy over longer confinement times (in the order of minutes). This should take place between 2025-2030. If successful, a follow-up reactor will be built to demonstrate final application as a power plant, between 2045-2055.This is the most costly project so far, but also the one in which the most experience has been built up, systematically and rigourously. The major uncertainty is the quality of the superconducting coils which will only have a cold-test before they are integrated in the final assembly. The established design being worked on today assumes a so-called high-confinement mode (H-mode) as the operating regime. This mode was accidentally discovered in the early eighties during experiments at ASDEX in Germany. However it is accompanied by instabilities at the edge of the plasma (ELM's) which for ITER-sized reactors would lead to destructive heat fluxes going towards the walls, unless the instabilities are continuously mitigated or controlled.In the Tokamak reactor the helical field lines which hold the plasma together are formed by an induced current and toroidal field coils. This current drive is also the cause of many instabilities. In theCategory C, the smaller experimentsAn example of an IEC is the polywell by EMC2. The latest design by EMC2 (the WB8) is still being tested, if successful a 100 MW-design will follow and an aneutronic version o f the WB8 design. A major issue with polywells is their inefficiency to produce fusion reactions due to electron leakage.As an example of FRC, a company called Tri-alpha is developing a magnetic-mirror concept to facilitate aneutronic fusion, it has gathered over $100 million from private investors. The magnetic mirror machine is potentially much simpler and much smaller than the Tokamak-designs. An important advantage is the  fact the fusion products are charged and can thus be used directly to generate electric energy, and since it is charged it can be manipulated using magnetic fields. The charged fusion products can for instance be focussed to create a compact direct power conversion. Important downside is leakage of particles due to the open field line through the center, reducing the efficiency.Focus fusion plasma holds some promise to produce efficient fusion power, however it's reliance on instabilities to generate enough plasma energy/density make it difficult to develop into a continuous and stable energy source, also it is unclear how and if this design can be scaled up to produce net energy.Hybrid concepts: for instance the one by General Fusion, which entails the use of hundreds of cylinders impinging on a single point (equally timed within microseconds) to compress rotating liquid lithium and liquid Lead through shockwaves onto a magnetically confined D-T plasma vortex which is shot into the cavity of the sphere. Here the lithium acts as the Tritium source and energy is transferred through the liquid heating up and expanding. Difficulties are mostly of engineering nature, the problems experienced by magnetic confinement fusion are of less importance here because the confinement time is kept very small. This is called Magnetized Target Fusion (MTF), here a plasmoid of low density is compressed to obtain the require confinement time for fusion.The hybrid concept MagLIF is a combination of a Z-pinch machine and a laser based confinement system. The basic mode of operation is as follows, first a magnetically confined plasma of deuterium and tritium is generated in a Hohlraum using a high-power laser, then the Hohlraum is pinched (i.e. compressed) by a current shot. Again, just as with the Z-machine, and the NIF, repeated shots are very difficult due to excessive heat loads on the liners, which carry the huge currentshots in the order of 50 million amperes.Another concept is a hybrid fusion/fission reactor, where part of the output energy is delivered by a fission reaction which is catalyzed by the high energy neutrons from the fusion reactions. This way fissionable material can be used without producing much (if any) nuclear waste.The major difficulties for sustained energy production, for both inertial and magnetic confinement are; (I) material degradation and activation due to neutron fluency [especially for neutronic fusion], (II) pollution control, (III) maintenance and specifically for magnetic confinement; continuous control of the plasma dynamics and prevention of damaging instabilities (IV).(I) Neutron fluency destabilizes wall materials to produce short-lived radioactive waste, and due to transmutation actually change the element type, Wolfram for instance can change to Lead. A possible solution that is being experimented with now is the use of liquid lithium flowing over the reactor walls.(II) How do we insert fuel without creating too much disturbance and how do we get rid of the fusion products efficiently.(III) As said, especially for neutronic fusion the wall will be radioactive and maintenance of the components inside the reactor will require special robotic tools.(IV) Confinement time is one of the most important performance indicators of any experimental magnetic confinement fusion reactor. It requires control systems which can (predictively) respond accurately within milliseconds and continuous monitoring of all the relevant plasma parameters. The relatively low density of the plasma requires relatively long confinement times for there to be enough collisions. This requirement of long confinement time is the most limiting factor for MCF, regardless of whether the reaction is neutronic or aneutronic.Aneutronic fusion requires much higher temperatures and it is likely less stable in terms of plasma dynamics due to the heavier Boron ions. However, a pure aneutronic fusion reaction will not (radio)activate and degrade the wall, it will open up the possibility for direct power conversion as well as magnetic control over the expelled fusion products since they are charged.Superconducting coilsI mention this separately because technological developments in this area are not only crucial for the viability of magnetic confinement fusion, they are also partly detached from the fusion plasma research in the sense that maximizing the maximum magnetic field that can be generated is a goal in itself.There are two recent developments of interest for this topic:I personally have no doubt that we will harness fusion energy. In terms of technology it is not a matter of possible or impossible but rather of perseverance, boldness and expediency. Expediency, because nuclear fusion is likely to require more time to reach full potential then for instance solar or wind energy which are already being put to market. So there is a risk of the public and politics losing interest and thus of funding being cut away from the big projects like ITER and HIPER. In the mean time a lot of private investment capital is being spent on experimental, say category (c), concepts which hold promise of success but certainly do not give guarantees. This requires boldness now, and especially in the future if these concepts do not immediately live up to expectations. Perseverance because the concept of nuclear fusion is by far superior to wind or solar in terms of the technology gained and the ecological footprint it leaves.Please add/edit.","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-using-nuclear-energy-in-rockets-bad
