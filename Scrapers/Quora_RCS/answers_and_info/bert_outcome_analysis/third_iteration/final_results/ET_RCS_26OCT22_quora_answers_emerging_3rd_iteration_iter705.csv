1,"Apple’s iPhone has never been the #1 smartphone in my opinion. Not only that, but I don’t believe in the concept of a #1 phone, at least not in 2020.The special thing about iPhone is that it (usually) takes what matters and works on making that as good as possible while not driving the price through the roof — or at least, not too far through the roof. That’s the same thing Samsung likes to do with its Galaxy A (budget) and S (flagship) series, but it still sells the Note and Z (ultra-flagship) series. Does Apple have an ultra-flagship? You could argue that’s the Pro Max. Does Apple go all outApple’s iPhone has never been the #1 smartphone in my opinion.

You could argue that’s the Pro Max. Does Apple go all out on the Pro Max? Well, the advantages of the Pro Max over the Pro are not very significant: Larger screen, slightly better cameras, and slightly longer battery life. Okay, and? Same goes for Samsung, by the way. We are approaching a time where consumers expect so much from their phones that the difference between top-tier and lower tier phones is diminishing, which also means its getting more and more difficult to name a particular phone or brand of phone “#1.” And if you do name a phone #1, there will always be someone who will say, “But what about the [insert phone here]? It has [insert “better” feature here].”","3,124 followers",Becca Royal-Gordon,1.1K,4.3K,12M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-that-Apple-are-still-at-the-top-of-smartphone-technology

She looked and sounded content.However, things took a turn for the worse on January 26th when Lam arrived in Los Angeles and checked into the Cecil Hotel.Originally, she was supposed to share a room with a few others, but her roommates complained she was behaving oddly, so she was forced to change rooms.Then, on January 31st, Elisa Lam disappeared.Her posts on Facebook and Tumblr abruptly ceased.Her daily calls to her parents stopped without explanation.To speak in cliché, it seemed Lam had fallen off the face of the earth.Initially, there were no clues, no evidence. Hotel staff reported that Lam had been alone that day, but in good spirits.Other than that, nothing.Her face was on fliers across the city and her parents flew out to help the investigation.Soon however, a strange video surfaced, a creepy piece of elevator footage that appeared to be the last time Lam was seen alive.It is an eerie video. From the start, Lam is behaving strangely and acting erratic.She seems agitated, wary, glancing around her as if she is being followed. When the door doesn’t close, she glances out several times, looks both ways and darts to the elevator walls, cowering out of sight, but eyes still fixed on the hallway.Throughout the four-minute video, Lam hops on and off the elevator several times.She frantically pushes buttons and puts her hands on her ears. She moves her hands in creepy, almost arcane motions and bows back and forth slightly.As the doors close again, Lam walks out.This is the last time she was seen alive.It went viral quickly, people dubbed it as having a horror movie like feel.The video took on an even more sinister quality several weeks later; hotel residents began to complain of low water pressure, and strange-tasting, discolored water.In February, a worker was sent to check out the hotel’s water tanks, which lie suspended 10 feet over a heavily secured area with alarm systems in place.When they were opened, Elisa Lam’s waterlogged corpse was found, three weeks after her disappearance.This was peculiar by itself. Lam would have had to have gruelingly hauled herself up to the tank, undress, and then plunge herself in along with her stuff.It’s inarguably a weird, creepy case, but what is perhaps most horrifying is some of the parallels it draws to bot...",63 followers,Lindsay Elizabeth,25.1K,174,31.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-that-Apple-are-still-at-the-top-of-smartphone-technology

Its people want to be either independent or part of Russia, whose army is heavily present in the territory.Transnistria is known for its large black market, organized criminality and drug smuggling, but the main reason why people are discouraged from visiting is the rampant police corruption. Officers see the very few tourists (10,000 people visited Moldova in 2015 – I can’t even imagine more than one thousand bothering to travel to Transnistria) as easy targets, so they find whatever reason to steal money from them (for example, they could try to fine you if you cross the road outside of a zebra crossing). Also, being a phantom country, your embassy won’t be able to defend you here. Still, walking in the streets is a completely safe and calm experience.Apart from the safety concerns, the average tourist would see no use in visiting this region, as there are virtually no attractions. Tiraspol (the capital) is your average provincial city from the Soviet era, with concrete buildings and large avenues. The rest of the region features two major (and just as uneventful) settlements, Bender and Rîbnița, and a lot of bare countryside. There are almost no places where to eat or stay, anyway.If you really want to visit Transnistria, you can board on the train from Chișinău to Odessa and stop in Tiraspol. There, the local police will issue you a 10-hour visa that will allow you to spend the day visiting this lost and forgotten corner of the Soviet Union.","1,509 followers",Giorgio Taietti,18.1K,86,7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-mystery-technologies-that-have-changed-the-world

Estimated age 16. Her body showed no signs of foul play and, because of this, it was assumed her death was a suicide.Her body was taken to the coroner’s office. The coroner must have thought she was pretty and spent hours crafting a death mask of the girl’s face. Legend has him quoted, saying:Her beauty was breathtaking, and showed few signs of distress at the time of passing. So bewitching that I knew beauty as such must be preserved.(Death mask: A wax or plaster cast of a dead person’s face, most often taken from the corpse. These masks were used as either mementos or for portraits)Now, you should know that death masks were sort of a thing, especially of famous people, and people, in general, were kind of morbid back then (now we’re nice and civilized).So, somehow, people saw the death mask of this unknown drowned lady and they wanted their own death mask of her face. Well, as you can imagine, when you’re a guy who makes molds of dead people’s faces and you suddenly have a face that everyone wants, you sell that shit.The woman’s death mask soon became mass produced and, by 1900, everyone who was anyone in Germany and France owned one.Fast forward nearly 100 years to Norway. It’s 1958 and you’re a toy maker by trade and have just created the world’s first CPR dummy. And you need to put a face on it. What face do you choose? You guessed it, the unknown woman of the Seine.Why, you may ask?Maybe he didn’t know what to make the dummy look like. Maybe, like that coroner back in Paris, he had a thing for dead girls (I didn’t really mean that the way it sounded). Maybe the death mask his great grandfather had purchased from a coroner while visiting France was hanging on the wall in his workshop.Now, nearly 60 years later, this same face graces CPR dummies around the world. And still, nobody knows who the hell she is.Although this woman obviously had a turn of bad luck, after all, it’s not good luck that ends up with you floating in a river, she, postmortem, has become rather popular.Just imagine the number of people who have laid their lips on hers.Thanks for the A2A",0 followers,Molly Carter,9.1K,330,31.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-mystery-technologies-that-have-changed-the-world

We are among the first to live in the digital age. Technology has made significant changes in how and what work is done.1.) The iPhone:-Mobile phones used to do one thing only: make phone calls. But now consumers use their handhelds to access the Web, send and receive e-mails, play games, take pictures and watch video.On June 29, 2007, thousands of people waited in seemingly-endless lines to buy Apple's highly-hyped iPhone - world’s most powerful personal device .It was the most anticipated tech events of the year.In 74 days, Apple sold 1 million of its smart phones.2.) GPS (Global Positioning System):-Originally developed by the Department of Defense to aid the military, the satellite-based system provides location and time data to users.Until May 2, 2000, the United States intentionally degraded GPS signals available to the public for national security reasons.In announcing the discontinuation of the feature that deliberately degraded the signal, Removing that obstacle helped speed the proliferation of GPS-enabled consumer products that live as stand-alone units and, increasingly, as add-on features in cell phones and smart phones.3.) Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency:-At the start of this century, the complete reinvention of the entire economic system wasn’t something many people were talking about. But then the 2007-08 financial crisis happened. As mortgages defaulted, companies collapsed, and governments bailed out the banks to the tune of trillions of dollars, people began to wonder if there might be a better way.Satoshi Nakamoto’s true identity may still be a mystery, but his creation of a new “electronic cash system” called Bitcoin in 2009 could have implications far beyond just currency. The underlying blockchain technology – an immutable and unhackable online ledger – could potentially transform everything from healthcare to real estate.But Bitcoin is yet to take off as a mainstream form of payment or transform the global economy.4.) 3D-Printing:-3D printing is not completely new to the 21st century.In fact, the application of the layering method you see on today’s 3D printers can be traced back to the 19th century and 3D printing officially began in 1980. Yet, cheaper manufacturing methods and open-source software have contributed to a revolution in 3D printing.If you wanted to 3D print something back in the day it was going to set you back thousands of dollars. Now you can buy a 3D printer at and produce everything from lower-cost car parts to bridges and it is even considered for artificial organs.5.) Social Networking/Media:-Status updates, following, friending… unfriending. None of that meant anything to anyone 10 years ago.But thanks to Friendster, Facebook, MySpace, Twitter and the many other social networks in the ever-expanding social media universe, these are words many of us now use daily.When Friendster launched in March 2003 it was pretty much the only game in town. In 2004, Time named it one of the 50 coolest Web sites of the year. But its reign was not to be long-lasting.In 2004, Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg launched Facebook, a social networking site intended for college students. In 2006 Facebook opened its doors to anyone over 13 with a valid e-mail address. Now it boast over 1 Billion active users.People across the globe you Social networking apps and websites including Instagram, Whatsapp, Snapchat, Pinterest, Youtube, Reddit, Tumblr etc.6.) Nintendo Wii :-When Nintendo launched the Wii and Wii Sports in 2006, it changed the way video games were played.Instead of sitting on the couch with a remote control in their hands, players were pulled into the action, using a wireless controller to simulate actions such as playing tennis and boxing.The Wii has been touted as more than a game. The system has been used to teach school children music and help people lose weight.7.)Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk may not necessarily be remembered for his contributions to electric cars innovations, but rather for his contributions to space exploration. Musk's private space exploration company, SpaceX, has developed rockets that can be recovered and reused in other launches – a more efficient and cheaper alternative to the method of using the rockets only once and letting them fall into the ocean.On March 30, 2017, SpaceX became the first to deploy one of these used rockets, the Falcon 9. Blue Origin, a space-transport company founded by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, has launched its own reusable rocket.8.)Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley and a separate team from Harvard and the Broad Institute independently discovered in 2012 that a bacterial immune system known as CRISPR (an acronym for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) could be used as a powerful gene-editing tool to make detailed changes to any organism's DNA. This discovery heralded a new era in biotechnology.The discovery has the potential to eradicate diseases by altering the genes in mice and mosquitoes to combat the spread of Lyme disease and malaria but is also raising ethical questions, especially with regards to human gene editing such as for reproductive purposes.9.) Augmented reality (AR) :-Augmented reality, in which digital graphics are overlaid onto live footage to convey information in real time, has been around for a while. Only recently, however, following the arrival of more powerful computing hardware and the creation of an open source video tracking software library known as ARToolKit that the technology has really taken off.Smartphone apps like the Pokémon Go game and Snapchat filters are just two small popular examples of modern augmented reality applications. The technology is being adopted as a tool in manufacturing, health care, travel, fashion, and education.10.) Smart home and voice assistants :-No vision of the future would be complete without the ability to speak to and control your home. And now it seems like we are finally living in it.Voice Assistant systems developed by Amazon and Google are soaring in popularity.Human being now-a-days are becoming more and more dependent on technology.Some of the important questions are still to be answered like: Is giving over control of your home to internet-enabled devices safe, when those devices can break down or be seized by hackers? Should we be allowing internet giants like Amazon and Google to put microphones in our home?As we enter the new decade, it looks like our homes are set to be defined not by the capabilities the technology in our homes give us – but who we want to have power over them.** Peace Out ** ✌",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-mystery-technologies-that-have-changed-the-world

TheHere are some→Bermuda Triangle/ Devil’s TriangleThe Bermuda Triangle/ The Devil’s triangle is an area that represents the region of the Atlantic Ocean between Bermuda, Puerto Rico, and Miami, Florida.How it was SOLVED?The mystery was solved in 1975 when Larry Kusche, a research librarian at Arizona State University, discovered that some of the claims about the ship wrecks were completely wrong. He found that the region doesn’t have an unusual number of shipwrecks or plane crashes compared to any other area experiencing similar traffic. However, the Gulf Stream current is strong enough to disperse any evidence of fallen ships or planes, which likely added to the folklore of the area.→Antikythera MechanismThe Antikythera was a computing device that was handcrafted by the Greeks. The device was lost in an ancient shipwreck and was discovered in 1900, puzzling researchers about its purpose and how such a complex machine was crafted in that time.How it was SOLVED?Through carbon dating and ship wrecked expeditions, the scientists found out mechanism was over 2,000 years old in the ocean floor, it seemed to be 1,000 years ahead of its time. Analysis revealed the two-sided mechanism used 30 bronze gears to operate three clock-like dials that could calculate the relative positions of the moon, sun, and first six planets for any given date. The device also accounted for irregular and elliptical orbits, and even predicted solar and lunar eclipses.→StonehengeStonehenge is comprised of a circle of stacked stones located in what is now a remote area in Wiltshire, England. Carbon dating suggests that the structure was made between 3000–2000 BCEHow it was SOLVED?Wally Wallington, a carpenter from Michigan, thwarted these claims when he built the exact replica in his backyard by himself, using only technology available to the people at the time. If one man can do it by himself.→The Racetrack Playa in California’s Death Valley is striped with hundreds of carved-out trails from large rocks, even though nobody had pushed them or witnessed the rocks moving.How it was SOLVED?When the temperature drops overnight, the water freezes into thin sheets of ice. The ice is warmed by the sun the next morning, breaking it into small plates. When one of these plates is under a rock, the wind and water flow push the rock very slowly, traveling about 224 meters during the winter season. This motion makes a trail in the mud which later dries to record evidence of the rock’s journey.",5 followers,Ankit Kumar Singh,1.2K,51,4.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-mystery-technologies-that-have-changed-the-world

Careless merchants discarded the forms in their trash. Credit card companies warned merchants of stolen card numbers by printing thick books of stolen numbers that cashiers were supposed to check before processing each transaction (they almost never did this).There was no Caller ID, so it was easier to make prank and fraudulent phone calls, but long distance calls were expensive, charged by the minute. There were telephone credit cards (that were also victim to being stolen and used fraudulently), but using them entailed keying in the entire credit card number into the phone for each call.Checks could be faked, and were one of the most common forms of fraud, but making a good copy of a corporate check took some skill.It would be years before anyone got an unsolicited email from a deposed Nigerian prince who was hoping to move some purloined cash into the United States, and it was considerably more difficult to sell herbal Viagra and other drugs (in part because Viagra hadn’t been invented yet).New technology provides benefits for everyone, including criminals.",15 followers,Aniket Singh,909,158,9.5M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-mystery-technologies-that-have-changed-the-world
13,"Ever notice how the same woman often shows up in stock travel photos? Be careful about this stuff. This is staged. Stock photographers make money by bending reality to market expectations. I’ve seen this woman on the side of tanning parlors in Michigan. It’s consumerism. The pictures aren’t necessarily “false,” but you’ll reduce your travel shock on the ground when you just remember that this stuff is market-oriented and highly polished. The world isn’t a catalog or a brochure.",17 followers,Steve Taylor,3.9K,2.3K,25.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-that-Apple-are-still-at-the-top-of-smartphone-technology
