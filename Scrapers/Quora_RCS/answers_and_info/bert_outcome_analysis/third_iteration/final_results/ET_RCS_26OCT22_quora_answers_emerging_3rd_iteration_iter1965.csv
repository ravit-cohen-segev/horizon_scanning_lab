That would make him a cosmic sadist, an infinite bully.Grand moral issues aside, it's demonstrable that while Islam can make individual people better, modern sharia governments have a horrifying track record compared to other governments on a wide range of metrics: wealth per capita, domestic violence, literacy, books written per capita, movies made per capita, patents per capita, child marriage, scientific illiteracy, voluntary charity, private enterprise, higher education rates, honor killings.  It turns out people do not thrive under any system that makes every decision for them and threatens social ostracization, domestic violence, police violence, fines, jail, torture, exile and death for challenging those decisions.  It turns out people demonstrably thrive better when given a lot more freedom than what any sharia government has ever offered.

Back home in Australia it’s considered polite to get out of your car and walk over to the police officer’s car and hand him your licenseI’m lucky to be alive.If you come from a gun-free country like the UK or Australia you don’t have any natural instinct for gun culture. You don’t realize that police assume that everyone is armed.Things got immediately serious. The police officer’s hand went to his weapon and I responded by dropping to my knees with my hands up. He yelled a bunch of things at me but my memory is vague because my heartbeat was suddenly pulsing in my ears blotting out all sound. I don’t know if he drew his weapon or not. I was staring intently at the ground, shaking and trying to project non-threatening vibes. My next memory is that there were three police cars around me and a bunch of cops who’d been called for backup. They were all keeping their hands close to their guns. After some time passed (a minute? 30 minutes? I have no idea) the tensions de-escalated and they told me to get up. I gave the officer my license and tried to explain why I’d approached him. It was completely incomprehensible to him that there was a place where people don’t fear cops and vice versa at traffic stops. It was as though I was trying to tell him that I came from Narnia and our cops were all talking animals.I’ve spoken to several British people, New Zealanders, and Australians who have shared almost identical stories. They really need to put signs up in all major US airports.Don’t get out of your car if stopped by police. They will assume you are armed and they might shoot you.Edit: have a look at this story about an Australian woman who was shot and killed by an American cop.To me, the chilling part of the story is this passage:“When police arrived, Ruszczyk Damond approached the driver's side of the squad car, and Noor, who was in the passenger's seat, shot her through the open window…”In Australia, we would think it perfectly normal to approach a police car to talk to the police. She probably had no idea that she could be in danger. American police are far too ready to kill. It’s sickening.*It turns out that getting out of your car when police stop you is a generational thing in Australia. When I grew up, in Australia, it was considered polite. I’ve moved back to Australia again and it is no longer the norm. We still don’t worry that cops will shoot us though.",9 followers,Roland Temmerman,1.5K,4.6K,107.4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-will-the-United-States-of-America-survive-if-the-information-technology-market-gets-shattered-in-the-upcoming-future

No, they’re not completely removed, but deaths from famine, plagues and war are nothing compared to what they used to be. More people die from complications of surfeit than from starvation; a first for all of human history.But something is wrong.The problem has to do with our very prosperity. People think jobs are fleeing the US for China. It doesn’t help that politicians feed on this lie. But it’s not true. The US’s industrial output today is double what it was in 1985. The problem is that output is double, but it has happened with 1/3 fewer workers while the population has increased by 42%. That is really a big problem.Double the output | 33% fewer employees | 42% more people.Someone smarter at math than me (see: anybody with >5 grade math skills) can run those numbers for the true disparity. That’s the underlying problem. People with good jobs don’t give a shit about much else. Sure, they pay lip service, but give people good jobs and creature comforts, and they generally don’t give a shit. But remove those creature comforts and like any other people in the past, they look for people to blame and someone to be their hero. (Never mind that the “problem” is much more efficient production models + automation — how would they know? Nobody’s bought hours of air time each night to explain this!)This has ALWAYS been the case. Always. Period. End of discussion.Yes, people are racist, homophobic, selfish, bigoted bastards. That’s true. But people were way more selfish and bigoted in the past 100 years even while we made social progress. (And a lot has been made in 100 years). But now so much social change has happened in the past four decades + treaties that promised prosperity “just around the corner” and that never happened.That’s it. The economy. It’s always been the economy. It isn’t bigotry. It isn’t homophobia. It isn’t sexism. It isn’t dirty MexicansIt’s the economy. Fix the economy and people go back to their daily lives, complacent in how politicians behave. They won’t care so much about China or Mexicans. But remove those creature comforts, take their jobs, take their new car, take their kids’ “right” to a Disney vacation every other year, and the baser “blame everybody not like me” instinct takes over.So while I’m not denying that people are innately dick-holes, more than that, they’re desperate. They want their lives back. They want the good ol’ days where things weren’t so hard, where the factory was still in town and where the schools were decent. A lot of that is gone, and someone needs to be blamed.","45,628 followers",David Seidman,657,3.6K,85.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-will-the-United-States-of-America-survive-if-the-information-technology-market-gets-shattered-in-the-upcoming-future

We believe so strongly in these things as to see them as non-debatable.But they are debatable!I can’t stress this enough.Nazis were humans.Soviets were humans.MS-13 are humans.Must I recount the atrocities these humans have committed?Humans with normal functioning brains can be bred to be absolute angels or sheer devils.This is the power and malleability of the human mind, and it’s whyIt’s a human who may cuddle a child to sleep while reading a bedtime story for the 3rd time in a row, despite having to wake up early for work the following day.And it’s a human who may shoot that child in the back of the head because the child questioned the validity of the bedtime story.The world has come incredibly closeAnd the PRIMARY reason why our better angels prevailed is because of the United States of America.Hitler held out in WW2 for as long as he did, even when his generals said the war was lost, because he hoped German scientists would finally unlock the mystery of the atomic bomb.Just imagine a world where the Nazis got the nuke first!You’re gay?

General purpose AI and singularity would not even come near the “chaos” that agriculture created. Until 12000 years ago, ourThen these random dudes and dudettes come with their mastery of wild seeds. And before long, food production became a much easy thing. A single farmer in a few acres of land could produce more food than dozens of hunters attacking many square miles of forest. This gave rise to the “Instead of foraging and hunting, most people got involved in other things - like pottery, painting, urban planning, building homes & drainages, administration, mining, jewellery, accounting, medicine…A few thousand years later, another bunch of dudes would start harnessing the power of steam and create “nasty” things like locomotion. Rather than beating our horses to get to the next village, we would get to the other end of the continent reading newspapers. We moved around, explored things. Rather than using little children for many jobs such as chimney sweeping we kept finding better methods. Eventually the horse carriage workers and others moved on to other things.We often confuse general purpose AI with robotics.Let’s assume the worst case and we have a general purpose AI - that can do everything a human can. What would happen?It would be only as bad as agriculture - that destroyed most of what we did everyday. We could be doing things like sports. In most video games, bots are way better than humans. Does it mean we are less likely to play with other humans? In fact, we would play more with other humans just because the bots are better than us.We would do art, psychiatry and so many more human fields that we have not even created. Just like people could not imagine separate professions like art before the invention of agriculture, we have a problem with imagination.And we would spend more time with our children - who often grow alone with their TVs and more time with our parents - who often rot away alone.But, this is assuming there is a general purpose AI. Robotics is not the same as general purpose AI.Oh, what about movies like The Matrix and Terminator. Oh, you guys are now giving us Hollywood? If you believe in those weird movies, do you also believe in other dystopian movies like “I’m a legend”? In the latter movie, a germ gets out and wipes out most of humanity. Does it mean we have to close down the pharma and medicine industry?Hollywood can paint a dystopian picture from anything possible. They have even made something as harmless as vacuum cleaners into dangerous things. Should we stop doing all of them?In fact, anything useful can be made dangerous - think fire, water, air, cars, electricity, trains, medicines, petrol, sugar - any of them can kill you very easily.Anything that cannot kill you, is not of much use to you.Robotics, like any major revolution, can indeed cause chaos in the society. No different from agricultural revolution or industrial revolution. There will be displacement. People said the same for computing too. Could the people who were worried about computers doing spreadsheets in 1970s have thought about the whole new industries created by computing 40 years later?But, there are a whole set of important things that are not effectively today and we need robots there. Let me give you some examples of these:It need not always be life threatening. You walk into most stores now, and it hard to find anyone to assist you. The robots could walk with you, understand your requirements, help you shop and get things on your vehicle. It could play football with your children and take them off TV.I could give you 100s of such examples and that is the future. But, to get there we have to have more simpler robots doing more mundane things. A baby has to go through the toddler stage before becoming an adult.40 years ago, your parents would not have imagined what you do with computers. They could not have thought of the kind of revolutionary applications that we take for granted.A new revolution is beckoning us.

22,"Our future is moving toward the state where the principle work we will need to be engaged with is that of building positive human connections. Robots will take care of everything else. In general, our world is gradually reaching the point where we all will shift into a new unified, spiritual consciousness, and robots will remain in the material matter. Afterward, they too will disappear.In principle, our world will gradually manifest itself as a world of energies, spirit and a web of forces, not physical mater. Matter does not really exist, which already becomes apparent in quantum physics.SoOur future is moving toward the state where the principle work we will need to be engaged with is that of building positive human connections.

For a time it looked like automation, in the form ofMy previous job was as a software developer, and that occupation nicely illustrates that the answer to this question is more complex than it sounds. Because it’s computer software that is responsible for a lot of the automation that displaces workers, as you might expect, software development is one of the occupations that has seen the most automation, yet employment in IT has never been stronger. Does this mean that automation does not actually reduce employment in software development? Definitely not!software development has been automated extensively since the 1950s, beginning with Autocoder and Fortran, Yacc and Lex, Make, and many, many developments since. These eliminated a huge amount of work in software development, improving programmer productivity, and the value of what could be delivered with a given number of hours of labor. That means it takes far fewer developers to produce a given piece of software now than it did 20 or 40 or 60 years ago. However, at the same time, this decrease in the cost of software development has massively increased the demand for software, more than making up for the jobs eliminated by automation. The upshot is that automation in the software development industry actually displaces workers isAs to whether the job of the software developer can be automated, I think eventually it will be.Essentially software developers are people that translate human requirements into the arcane languages that formalise and codify those requirements. If that gap between what the average person can understand, and the arcane languages we use to express algorithms, is eventually closed, software developers will become unnecessary. I suspect this will happen slowly but steadily. Already many people are quite comfortable working with spreadsheets, which do exactly this in a quite limited domain. I expect we’ll see other human-friendly tools arise to extend this human-friendliness to broader domains.[Much of this was originally written as a comment to","358,924 followers",Sean Kernan,1.8K,5.6K,726.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-will-the-United-States-of-America-survive-if-the-information-technology-market-gets-shattered-in-the-upcoming-future
