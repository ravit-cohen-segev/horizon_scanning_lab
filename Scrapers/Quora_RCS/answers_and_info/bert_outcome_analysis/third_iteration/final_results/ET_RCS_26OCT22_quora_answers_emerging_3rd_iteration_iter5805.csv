I know a transmission5G will first be used in the same LTE band - no change in frequencies there, it will just blink and blip in a different digital “language.” That’s 600 MHz to 6 GHz - all stuff we already have.

3,"A while ago, when we were exhibiting the Mitra robot at an event, a doctor walked up to me and broached on this subject. He was quite strong in the view that we are killing jobs of receptionists, security personnel and so on.I told him politely that doctors like him have put most shamans, black magic healers and village medical practioners out of business. Is that not wrong? To make it worse, their science has removed many diseases and make it hard for other doctors to get business. Dammit you scientific people - destroyer of jobs!And the mother of all job killers in humanity was agriculture.A while ago, when we were exhibiting the Mitra robot at an event, a doctor walked up to me and broached on this subject.

Dammit you scientific people - destroyer of jobs!And the mother of all job killers in humanity was agriculture. General purpose AI and singularity would not even come near the “chaos” that agriculture created. Until 12000 years ago, ourThen these random dudes and dudettes come with their mastery of wild seeds. And before long, food production became a much easy thing. A single farmer in a few acres of land could produce more food than dozens of hunters attacking many square miles of forest. This gave rise to the “Instead of foraging and hunting, most people got involved in other things - like pottery, painting, urban planning, building homes & drainages, administration, mining, jewellery, accounting, medicine…A few thousand years later, another bunch of dudes would start harnessing the power of steam and create “nasty” things like locomotion. Rather than beating our horses to get to the next village, we would get to the other end of the continent reading newspapers. We moved around, explored things. Rather than using little children for many jobs such as chimney sweeping we kept finding better methods. Eventually the horse carriage workers and others moved on to other things.We often confuse general purpose AI with robotics.Let’s assume the worst case and we have a general purpose AI - that can do everything a human can. What would happen?It would be only as bad as agriculture - that destroyed most of what we did everyday. We could be doing things like sports. In most video games, bots are way better than humans. Does it mean we are less likely to play with other humans? In fact, we would play more with other humans just because the bots are better than us.We would do art, psychiatry and so many more human fields that we have not even created. Just like people could not imagine separate professions like art before the invention of agriculture, we have a problem with imagination.And we would spend more time with our children - who often grow alone with their TVs and more time with our parents - who often rot away alone.But, this is assuming there is a general purpose AI. Robotics is not the same as general purpose AI.Oh, what about movies like The Matrix and Terminator. Oh, you guys are now giving us Hollywood? If you believe in those weird movies, do you also believe in other dystopian movies like “I’m a legend”? In the latter movie, a germ gets out and wipes out most of humanity. Does it mean we have to close down the pharma and medicine industry?Hollywood can paint a dystopian picture from anything possible. They have even made something as harmless as vacuum cleaners into dangerous things. Should we stop doing all of them?In fact, anything useful can be made dangerous - think fire, water, air, cars, electricity, trains, medicines, petrol, sugar - any of them can kill you very easily.Anything that cannot kill you, is not of much use to you.Robotics, like any major revolution, can indeed cause chaos in the society. No different from agricultural revolution or industrial revolution. There will be displacement. People said the same for computing too. Could the people who were worried about computers doing spreadsheets in 1970s have thought about the whole new industries created by computing 40 years later?But, there are a whole set of important things that are not effectively today and we need robots there. Let me give you some examples of these:It need not always be life threatening. You walk into most stores now, and it hard to find anyone to assist you. The robots could walk with you, understand your requirements, help you shop and get things on your vehicle. It could play football with your children and take them off TV.I could give you 100s of such examples and that is the future. But, to get there we have to have more simpler robots doing more mundane things. A baby has to go through the toddler stage before becoming an adult.40 years ago, your parents would not have imagined what you do with computers. They could not have thought of the kind of revolutionary applications that we take for granted.A new revolution is beckoning us.

8,"The most obvious flaw is the measurement problem. This is really explained best by John Bell in his article called “Against Measurement”. It is easy to find online.

It is easy to find online. Weinberg, the Nobel prize winner in particle physics, had a similar objection. Dirac, another Nobel winner, wrote that he admitted the flaw, but said it was too hard to solve at the moment.The problem is that, in doing calculations, we divide up the dynamics into a “unitary” step that applies without measurement, then another step that uses a different method, called a projection. This is a flaw because the measuring apparatus is nothing special: it just uses photons, atoms and electrons, and these should obey the same laws as everything else.Bell wrote an insightful conference paper on this, where he compared quantum mechanics and it’s emphasis on the observer, with Greek cosmology having the earth at the center of the universe. This was overturned by Copernicus, Galileo and Newton. We no longer think that the sun and the stars revolve around the earth.Those old Greek methods in astronomy were refined and improved, with epicycles added to cycles, until they could explain things pretty well. But all those complications and free parameters were ultimately not good science. They failed the test of Occam’s razor, which states that the simplest explanation is the best. It was clearly a flawed theory.Quantum mechanics is like epicycle theory. There are weird assumptions about observers being needed, which is as logical as the sun rotating about the earth. The actual standard model is full of complexity, with particles added to fit experiments, just as epicycles were added in medieval times to fit the observed astronomical data.There are proposals to solve this, but none are widely accepted. It took us many centuries to overturn the previous theory of astronomy. Quantum theory may take even longer! Humans prefer to stick with what we know, and tinker with it. After all, our brains are just adapted for our survival, and it is amazing that we can use them at all to understand the cosmos.Note added: Dirac, Bell, Weinberg and many other prominent critics were all aware that quantum mechanics is our most successful physical theory ever, with amazing accuracy for some predictions. This was once also true of epicycle theory, ether theory and Newtonian mechanics. It doesn’t change the problem that it is a clearly flawed theory.Second note: The Nobel Committee has now recognised Bell, by awarding a Nobel prize to physicists who verified a violation of the Bell inequality. Where does this leave quantum mechanics? Well, it disproves an alternative possibility that Bell constructed: a local causal hidden variable theory. This helps to narrow down what theories are needed to solve the measurement problem. The physicists - Aspect, Clauser, and Zeilinger - may not agree with Bell’s ideas, but these were very important experiments. This confirms the overall significance of such foundational studies in quantum theory.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

Essentially, this equationWhat this equation describes, in the words of Wheeler, is this: Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.But look closely. ThatIt has a hat because it is a quantum-mechanical operator. Because we know that matter consists of quantum fields. So it is described by operator-valued quantities (Dirac called them q-numbers). They are unlike ordinary numbers. For instance, when you multiply them, the order in which they appear matters. That is, when you have two operatorsWhen Einstein wrote down his field equation over 100 years ago, theBut there are no hats on the left-hand side. And because of that, my equation might as well say something like, some apples = some oranges. It makes no sense. The stuff on the left-hand side (which consists of numbers) can never equal the stuff on the right-hand side (which definitely does not consist of numbers.)I can make it work, though. I can replace that operator with its so-called expectation value:RThis is called semiclassical gravity. And it works well, very well indeed. A little too well, as a matter of fact. Gravity is so weak, quantum effects are so irrelevant, this equation accurately describes Nature everywhere we can look. But we still don’t like it, because using that expectation value trick is a cheat, a cop-out.Now you might wonder, why don’t I put hats on top of the things on the left-hand side? I would… if I knew how to quantize spacetime. That is, how to turn the numbers that describe gravity into quantum-mechanical operators.But I do not. And nobody does. The standard methods all fail, leading to equations that make no sense at all.So we are kind of stuck… we don’t know how to quantize gravity, and our observations don’t help us, don’t offer any hints as to how to get beyond semiclassical gravity. Theorists keep trying to come up with new ideas (or recycle old ones) but basically, we’ve been pretty much just spinning our wheels for decades.","7,171 followers",Barak Shoshany,1.1K,1K,7.5M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Which-countries-are-contributing-the-most-to-emerging-technologies-like-5G-AI-AR-and-robotics
