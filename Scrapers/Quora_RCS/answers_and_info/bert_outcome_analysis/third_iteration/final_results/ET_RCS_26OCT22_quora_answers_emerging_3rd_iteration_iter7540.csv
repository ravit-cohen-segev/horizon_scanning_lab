Mining pool is like, you are connecting 100 computer together and all computer are doing same task, so overall performance and performance will increase. So comparing this with home base hardware, competition will be one sided. What you can do is, purchase some bitcoin with any exchange. With the use of those bitcoins purchases a mining app in a mining pool. This will allocate some mining energy to your account equivalent to your bitcoin holding. Now whenever new Bitcoin will be mined, the percentage amount will be distributed to all who have invested. So, you don't need to do anything, just invest some amount.More info on this video:",0 followers,Melissa Aldridge,501,0,0,2022,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-generate-bitcoins-at-home
1,"Bitcoin mining is highly competitive. It is done with ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits). You would need to be in an area where you can get cheap electricity (or perhaps mine in the winter, using the ASICs to heat your house). Otherwise, you would probably be paying more for electricity than you would make mining.For most individuals, Bitcoin mining doesn’t make sense. There may be some altcoins, using proof-of-work (PoW), that could be profitably mined at home, using GPU rigs. However, for most people that would also not be worth it.","1,772 followers",Thomas Y Graham,639,55,4.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-generate-bitcoins-at-home
2,With a regular/standard out the box computer? That would be a no. The amount of processing power that specializes in the hash algorithm used in Bitcoin makes the probability of winning a block with a standard home computer improbable.The average standard computer does less than 30 million hashes per second. That would be competing with 12 Million Trillion Hashes per Second to find the correct hash. Very improbable and unprofitableWith a regular/standard out the box computer? That would be a no.

3,"You need a computer and some powerful graphics cards and you need to install crypto mining software in your pc then you can start mining Bitcoin or any crypto currency. But if you have a low specs pc better to invest in crypto currency, mining with low specs is not profitable, waste of time and money. You can use binance for trading, investing and also mining.",0 followers,Glen Boston,638,71,1.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-generate-bitcoins-at-home
4,"Bitcoin first achieved a dollar denominated value in 2010, when someone offered to sell 20,000 Bitcoin for $50 in a chatroom. There were no takers. In the following decade, Bitcoin has gone from worthless to over a trillion in market capitalization. Where did all that valuation come from? Contrary to skeptics, Bitcoin is not money created out of thin air. There were numerous bubbles in history, but bubbles usually pop and fade away. They do not roar back 20X in value every 4 years. Bitcoin's value lies in replacing old institutions, national sovereignties, and redefining money itself.

In the following decade, Bitcoin has gone from worthless to over a trillion in market capitalization. Where did all that valuation come from? Contrary to skeptics, Bitcoin is not money created out of thin air. There were numerous bubbles in history, but bubbles usually pop and fade away. They do not roar back 20X in value every 4 years. Bitcoin's value lies in replacing old institutions, national sovereignties, and redefining money itself. That trillion dollar are money drained out of declines of banks, stagnating gold price, sovereign currencies, and everyday Americans whose assets are debased through quantitative easing. So in another word, that money came out of you and everything you own.Today, developers approved an upgrade to the Bitcoin network codename 'Taproot'. This is a momentous decision years in the making, an upgrade that is expected to unlock vast swath of value. How so? Here’s the plain English version:Bitcoin has long been plagued by the problem of high transactional cost. Right now it takes about $4 to send Bitcoin. This would be no problem for whales and druggies, but it makes buying a cup of coffee impractical. The reason for this high transactional cost is because right now, the blockchain has to record and validate every single transaction. The Taproot upgrade would allow processing thousands of transactions that happened around the same time. This will reduce the transactional to fractions of a penny, thus drastically expanding Bitcoin's usability in everyday life. A currency’s value is the square root of its usage: when Bitcoin’s circulation increases, its value will shoot up the roof.The second upgrade is anonymity. Right now transactions are pseudo anonymous: everyone can see where and how much money moved around on the blockchain. So while no one knows who owns the address, the transactions are still traceable. But after Taproot, multiple transactions are processed in batch, which makes the transactions truly anonymous.Ultimately, technology is the single biggest disruptor that move societies forward. El Salvador just adopted Bitcoin as national currency. In a generation’s time, Bitcoin will underwrite every single major world currencies, and replace gold as the de facto reserve. I have no doubt Taproot will accelerate this process.",2 followers,Kelly Pearson,1.7K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-generate-bitcoins-at-home
5,"Since Bitcoin is not a company, buying Bitcoins is different than buying a stock or a bond. Plus, cryptocurrencies are not backed or regulated by a central bank or government.

Plus, cryptocurrencies are not backed or regulated by a central bank or government. Therefore, the monetary policies or inflation rates do not directly affect a cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies were developed with a focus on their decentralized nature, meaning the community and Bitcoin holders will decide the price of a Bitcoin.The price of a Bitcoin is not the same as its value. On a fundamental level, traders and their exchanges determine a Bitcoin's price. The continuous interaction between buyers and sellers trading Bitcoins determines its specific price.For example, the amount that buyers are willing to pay shows that they believe Bitcoin's price will exceed in the future compared to what they offer to buy Bitcoins. A number of factors influence this market behavior and hence the price.Major factors that influence Bitcoin’s priceNew bitcoins are created and awarded to miners for verifying new blocks. The rate at which new coins are introduced is designed to get halved approximately every four years, and, eventually, the protocol will stop creating new Bitcoins. This type of artificial inflation mechanism of the halving of block rewards will no longer impact the price once new Bitcoins production is stopped. However, with the current rate of adjustment of block rewards, the last bitcoin is not set to be mined until the year 2140. Once all of the Bitcoins are in circulation, prices depend on whether it is deemed usable, legal, and in demand, determined by other cryptocurrencies’ popularity.Bitcoins mining is considered a complicated and power-consuming process; miners have to solve complicated mathematical operations to verify transactions using their hardware's computation power. Miners have to install specialized GPU hardware and other equipment, which further increases Bitcoins' cost.Bitcoin is considered to be the king of cryptocurrencies; hundreds of tokens are competing for user attention. Even though Bitcoin has the highest market volume, altcoins are gaining traction. Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum(ETH), Ripple(XRP), BitcoinCash(BCH) are the top competitors. Furthermore, new ICOs are frequently conducted to introduce more and more coins in the market. Since Bitcoins has the highest market volume and fame, it has the highest visibility, hence an edge over its competitors. As long as the popularity of Bitcoin is still increasing, the price of Bitcoin will be increasing.",2 followers,Kelly Pearson,1.7K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-generate-bitcoins-at-home
6,"What is hashrate?Hashrate refers to how much computing power is being used by a network (for example, the Bitcoin network) to process transactions. It can help investors gauge the health and security of a cryptocurrency’s network.Why is hashrate important?For crypto investors, hashrate is an important measure of how decentralized a cryptocurrency’s proof of work network may be against hackers. That’s because the higher a hashrate is, the more difficult and costly it is for someone to attack the network. A sudden decrease in hashrate could lead to crypto platforms halting trading or delisting aWhat is hashrate?Hashrate refers to how much computing power is being used by a network (for example, the Bitcoin network) to process transactions. It can help investors gauge the health and security of a cryptocurrency’s network.Why is hashrate important?For crypto investors, hashrate is an important measure of how decentralized a cryptocurrency’s proof of work network may be against hackers. That’s because the higher a hashrate is, the more difficult and costly it is for someone to attack the network. A sudden decrease in hashrate could lead to crypto platforms halting trading or delisting a coin in order to protect their customers.How is hashrate measured?A hashrate is a measure of how many calculations can be performed per second and can be measured in billions, trillions, quadrillions, and quintillions. For example, a hashrate of 1TH/s means one trillion calculations can be performed every second.These calculations that are being measured have to do with mining. Mining is the process of verifying and adding transactions to a blockchain network, such as Bitcoin. People who mine cryptocurrency often use specialized hardware that can perform many trillions of calculations a second. In exchange for verifying and adding transactions, miners are rewarded with crypto.Generally, the more miners participating in a network, the higher that network’s hashrate is because there are more miners competing for the reward. The fewer miners, the lower the hashrate.What causes the hashrate to change?A lot of things can affect the hashrate. Miners can choose which cryptocurrencies they want to mine. Since mining involves costs (energy, hardware, time) miners are incentivized to mine cryptocurrencies with the highest potential return on investment.A high hashrate indicates there’s more competition, but the reward could still be worth it. For example, the Bitcoin hashrate has been as high as 179 exahashes per second (1 exahash = 1 quintillion), but miners were still incentivized to participate because the potential reward was worth the cost.Miners generally decide which coins they want to mine by evaluating the cost to mine a coin versus the reward. Take Bitcoin for example. Every couple weeks, the Bitcoin protocol automatically adjusts how difficult it is to mine new bitcoins based on the current hashrate. When the hashrate is high, the mining difficulty is high. When the hashrate falls, the difficulty falls with it.Depending on that difficulty, miners can calculate if it's worth their effort to mine that particular crypto. It’s a self-regulating system.Now current hashrate for mine one ETH:-As of Wednesday, February 02, 2022, it would take 98.3 days to mine 1 Ethereum at the current Ethereum difficulty level along with the mining hashrate and block reward; a Ethereum mining hashrate ofSourcesigning off.",146 followers,Mark Wigmans,898,153,1.8M,2022,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-generate-bitcoins-at-home
