2,"You don't. It's not your business. They are fortunate to have a friend like you, who cares. But your hands are tied.It is hard to watch someone you care about behave destructively but if they don't ask for your help, there is nothing useful you can do other than let them know you are there for them if they ever need advice.If they've already told you ""no"" then that is their answer. You have to respect that even if you don't agree with it.","38,617 followers",Krishna Suryakanth,59K,2K,76.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-successfully-communicate-an-issue-if-it-is-ignored-intentionally

If so, what would you do during those years?My Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ would be 18 years old and just starting his ministry. So if I could go back and follow him I would take it. To see first hand all that transpired would be so fantastic.(I would write a book and leave it for the generations of my offspring to come later.)So yes under those conditions I would go back.

Many prisoners of wars that the Aztecs caught look to me with relief and respect, believing I am some kind of Aztec god.I teach the Aztecs to build simple projectile weapons such as crossbows, bows and arrows, gunpowders and catapults.Any who attack the Aztecs fall prey to superior technology, and the Aztecs begin praising me as god himself.I lead the Aztec civilization for decades to come, my wisdom of modern humanity and civilization will quickly form houses of government, separating the engineers from the peacekeepers, and the farmers from the scholars.My words will bring about the formation of the English language as a common language to use, and I will personally teach the scholar Aztecs the formation of grammar. Also science, a little bit of architecture and engineering.We build monuments of great wonder, spiraling towers, stone fortresses guarded by the now semi-automatic guns used by the Aztecs made by yours truly.The Aztec empire flourishes. We attack nearby flourishing civilizations with catapults and trebuchets, unwilling to risk our numbers for theirs.Those who do not yield will be flattened by large boulders, and those who do will get their gene pool mixed with ours, if you know what I mean *wink*, to quote Anakin Skywalker “not just the men, but the women, and the children too.” minus the men part.The Aztec empire expands from constant war with very little losses and so many babies made due to the totally consensual pillaging we did in other empires.Hundreds of years later, America and Mexico will never exist, as we will fight back any attempts of European colonization, all the while attempting to colonize their colonies. Our superior technology will win us most battles. While they were learning sword foraging, we just figured out how to make ship-mounted long-range artillery. We attack far from the shores and land when there is no resistance left. We take over Europe, again, mixing their gene pool with ours.Britain ceases to exist, as does most European countries. There is no America, or Mexico, or Europe. There is only the Aztec empire, and blood for the blood god.",0 followers,Peggy McHugh,610,5.3K,2.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-would-you-do-if-you-could-go-back-in-time-to-the-beginning-of-man-be-immortal-and-immune-to-all-harm-and-never-age-until-today-You-can-communicate-with-anyone-no-issue
