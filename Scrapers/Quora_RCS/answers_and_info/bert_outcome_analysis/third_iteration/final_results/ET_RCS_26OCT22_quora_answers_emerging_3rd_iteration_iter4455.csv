It did not work: the ink was so despicably bitter that the children would spit it if not force-fed and beaten. The moral of the story is that there is no easy way to learn something that is inherently complex.Studying is not easy. It does require concentration, perseveration and organisation. Most people don't have any, because they have gotten used to being light-headed, short-tempered and unruly. These skills should have been taught at school, at a young age. If you have not acquired then at the right time, then you must rely on will power.For those who had a proficuous young education, studying is something pleasant. They like to read because it is entertaining. Learning new things is exciting. Finding new information is thought-provoking. These are the people who don't mind reading long books, spending hours at libraries or writing long theses.If you are not one of these people, then you have to master yourself by the sheer power of your will.Remember: in life, all the time, you are required to prove yourself that you are more than what you were born. You are not merely a hairless bipedal primate driven by instincts and reacting to the environment. You don't have to follow your inclinations, succumb to your limitations, obey your intuition or do what others do. You become a full human being when you show you can do more than that. You are not only your genes and your traumas and your upbringing. That's what you were made. Let's make yourself something else.I believe it is a quote from Proust. A teacher once quoted it to me, in a loose Portuguese translation, which I am retranslating into English. If it's not Proust (I haven't found its source), then it doesn't matter whose words it is, the quote is good in itself, even if I am making it up out of murky memories...""What matters more is not what they did to me, but what I am capable of making of myself out of that.""","26,654 followers",Vichitra Zawar,658,716,31M,2015,https://www.quora.com/How-does-technology-make-learning-more-engaging

Our team at Grammarly has compiled a handy list of common grammatical errors to help make your writing accurate, clear, and professional.Ambiguous (“Squinting”) modifiersA squinting modifier is a misplaced modifier that, because of its location in a sentence, could modify either the phrase that precedes it or the one that follows it. In the example sentence, is the subject listening to music slowly or slowly getting a headache? To correct a squinting modifier, move its position in the sentence to clarify to the reader which word you intend to modify.Misuse of lie/layIf you plan to place or put an object somewhere, such as a plate on a table, you should use “lay.” If you intend to stretch out on a bed for a nap, you should use “lie.” The verb “lie” is an intransitive verb, which means it does not need an object. The transitive verb “lay” requires an object.It may take some getting used to this “lay” or “lie” business; after all, misuse of these verbs is common. But if you remember to lay down your fork before you’re full, then you won’t have to lie down later from overeating.Comma splicesHe was very hungry, so he ate a whole pizza.To splice means to connect or join. When a writer joins two independent sentences with a comma instead of separating them with a period or coordinating conjunction, that’s a comma splice.The comma has its jobs to do, but connecting two independent sentences isn’t one of them. Besides, the period gets testy when his sister, the comma, steals his thunder. Periods have their jobs, and so do commas, but never the twain shall meet—unless it’s in the form of a semicolon. Semicolons can also take the place of a coordinating conjunction, such as “and,” “but,” or “so,” among others.Run-on sentencesRun-on sentences, also known as fused sentences, occur when two complete sentences are squashed together without using a coordinating conjunction or proper punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon. Run-on sentences can be short or long. A long sentence isn’t necessarily a run-on sentence.To avoid run-on sentences, see if there is more than one idea communicated by two or more independent clauses. In our examples, there are two complete sentences:Example:Example:Both sentences are complete ideas by themselves; therefore, use a semicolon or a period to indicate that they are separate independent clauses.Using “could of” instead of “could have”“Could have” is always correct; “could of” never is. Writers probably make this grammar gaffe because, when we speak, the contraction “could’ve” sounds an awful lot like “could of.”TautologiesTautologies express the same thing twice with different words. In our example, the word “made” implies that Jack used his own two hands to create the pail. The prepositional phrase “with his own hands” creates a redundancy. Once you know what they are, it’s fun to discover tautologies: dilapidated ruins, close proximity, added bonus, large crowd...The list goes on and on!After reading through this list of common grammatical mistakes, you might be wondering how to remember all these rules as you write.

Developing your Competitive Programming skills requires that you are both fast and are able to think deeply about a problem.Codechef long challenges = Deep thinking AND Codeforces rounds = Fast codingIf you want to be good, you should try to be good in both these areas.But it's fine if you are just good at long challenges (deep thinking) or just good with short contests (fast thinking), both will help you become a better programmer.Step 4You can try Topcoder if you want. Or just let it be.With CP, if your goal is to get offers from Google HQ and likes, you will have to do it regularly. That is, give contests, try to rank higher, and build your rating.Otherwise, you can just do it on the side and focus on building other practical skills.These practical skills combined with your decent competitive programming experience will go a long way in helping you secure those jobs and internships you dreamed about.Step 5Keep doing this it will take Some time but it is the best way to be a Competitive Programmer.Don’t Be Frustrated.I need Your upvote ,Hit up if you’re also think Programming is Best <3images - Google images","20,848 followers",Alan Mellor,507,12.3K,63.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-does-technology-make-learning-more-engaging

Since there are hundreds and hundreds of programming languages, and your question is general, let's assume you've spent 30 minutes to choose the best programming language to learn.So, now we have 11.5 hours. Since, the time is less we can opt for python, which is beginner friendly and equally powerful. It is also one of the most preferred programming languages nowadays.Let's start learning the fundamentals like variables, I/O operations, conditionals and iterations. Which would take around 3.5 hours, I guess. We're now left with 8 more hours. Let's then dive into some intermediate concepts like functions ,lists, tuples and dictionaries. It takes almost 3.5 hours for an average person to understand the concepts mentioned above.We have 4.5 hours more. Now let's dive into classes and objects, and then into some external libraries like math,os,random,requests etc. Which would take the rest of the time.Boom!
