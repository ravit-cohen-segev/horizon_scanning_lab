1,"Cancer is caused by cells which suffer abnormal growth, this is caused when they mess up splitting up when producing another cell.As such its a game of chance, what gives it a higher chance? well many things like radiation exposure, we could argue meat, chemicals and electricity in our world could be causing these abnormalities however i believe its age, put simply if you live longer then you're cells have more of a chance of fucking up.Add onto this and the degradation of cells as we age then its no wonder that cancer rates are increasing because as we live in a advanced technological societyCancer is caused by cells which suffer abnormal growth, this is caused when they mess up splitting up when producing another cell.As such its a game of chance, what gives it a higher chance? well many things like radiation exposure, we could argue meat, chemicals and electricity in our world could be causing these abnormalities however i believe its age, put simply if you live longer then you're cells have more of a chance of fucking up.Add onto this and the degradation of cells as we age then its no wonder that cancer rates are increasing because as we live in a advanced technological society we simply live longer than what our ancestors did.","68,789 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.5M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-the-raise-in-the-percentage-of-cancer-is-increasing-just-because-of-the-shift-towards-advanced-technology-lifestyle
2,"No. I don't think it's the only factor, but I think it is on the increase even when you consider increased longevity, detectability  etc.Modern day lifestyle puts all sorts of things into the body that from an aggregate population perspective hasn't been there historically.It has also shifted the stress profile that the average person experiences from less physical to more emotional. We are only now starting to understand the role of the subconscious mind in how it effects physiological functions and even our genetic make-up.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-the-raise-in-the-percentage-of-cancer-is-increasing-just-because-of-the-shift-towards-advanced-technology-lifestyle
3,"Anecdotally, I remember in the 1990s talking to a colleague at the hospital where I worked (a major cancer treatment centre) about a sharp increase in brain tumours in young patients. Our two front-running possibilities for a cause for this were radiation from holding mobile phones too close to the ear, or a legacy of the glue-sniffing craze about ten years earlier.Personally I considered the glue the more likely cause, but I also have to add that I used to live in between the main BBC and ITV transmitters in London, at a time when the BBC transmitter was seriously over-powered, and my pet ratAnecdotally, I remember in the 1990s talking to a colleague at the hospital where I worked (a major cancer treatment centre) about a sharp increase in brain tumours in young patients.

But the BBC transmitter in the 1980s was putting out signal to a level you’re unlikely to get from a modern transmitter. It was about a mile away and we used to get the BBC1 soundtrack coming out of the TV regardless of what channel the picture was coming from, and even coming out of the record player during the lulls between tracks.",228 followers,Ben MacLaren,723,160,1.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-the-raise-in-the-percentage-of-cancer-is-increasing-just-because-of-the-shift-towards-advanced-technology-lifestyle
4,No.Most people are able to bring Out new technology into the hood and some are even more advanced than the ones the government is using.,"220,598 followers",Franklin Veaux,4K,47.3K,782.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-the-raise-in-the-percentage-of-cancer-is-increasing-just-because-of-the-shift-towards-advanced-technology-lifestyle
5,"No. Quite the reverse. Most technologies today are coming out of Apple, Google, Toyota, Boeing… and Chinese equivalents. Cutting edge physics is found at Cambridge and Berkely.Not much is 'unknown' as companies are answerable to investors and shareholders. A specific product might have an unveiling ( IPhone, etc) but not the broader technology.There is a collective world contribution to technology be it AI, genetic engineering, etc. There are no 'secret' set of scientists publishing research in 'secret' sets of publications.",4 followers,Carl Elliott,14K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-the-raise-in-the-percentage-of-cancer-is-increasing-just-because-of-the-shift-towards-advanced-technology-lifestyle
6,"Governments do have some technologies that are ahead of the general public. Encryption technology is one of them as are things like nuclear weapons, space technology and some basic research technologies. So, such pockets of advanced technology do exist.But, the majority of Government tends to lag behind the state of the art technology that consumers have. This is largely due to the insane procurement policies that exist within Government. This, coupled with risk-averse management, will generally keep Governments behind the latest developments.","68,789 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-the-raise-in-the-percentage-of-cancer-is-increasing-just-because-of-the-shift-towards-advanced-technology-lifestyle

8,It depends on how intelligent the “general public” is.The reality is that “governments” don’t invent anything. Those new technologies come from scientists and engineers who develop things used by the government. So its those people in the “general public” who know about it BEFORE the government.|,"527,818 followers",Adam D'Angelo,1.1K,990,33.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-governments-have-technologies-that-are-way-ahead-of-what-is-available-and-known-to-the-general-public
9,"This is a very interesting question, and after reading your answers, which many I certainly do agree with, my answer will be quite different though.

I had to knowThis is a very interesting question, and after reading your answers, which many I certainly do agree with, my answer will be quite different though. A reason, while in the U.S. Air Force as a radar tech, two consecutive nights we experienced an unidentified flying object on radar. It magically appear and performed feats beyond any conventional aircraft we had in 1957, and even today. I had to know, just how any thing physical could have performed these feats, and spent 25 years in researching how it could performed it. After the research, I concluded this craft was most probable man-made and piloted by a human.If this is true, then your question’s scenario already exists, let me further explainNot to bore you with all the research, 2 German teams did start trying to reverse engineer a UFO almost a century ago. The Nazi regime viewed, as you probably are alluding in your question; it being a way to win their war and rule the world afterwards. Since they did not win the war, it being doubtful they succeeded it developing the technology. However, whatever they were working on, and 1,600 German scientists, engineers, etc. came to the U.S. after the war. One could presume not to play games, but to continue the effort. 12 years after the war, we have this target appearing on our California coast radar just a short hop from Edwards AFB and Area 51.Where would this technology be today, some 62 years laterOne place it landed firmly in, it being the conspiracy world, should one want to hide anything this is the best place to put it. Even 26 years ago we had a very credible whistleblower making some claims:Of course this just adds fuel to the conspiracy world, except for the last paragraph. If one needs proof of these claims, it has to be in the technology, and the alluded ‘ESP-like means’ to reach the stars being the only technology to achieve this travel. This also aligns both with the Germans goal and what we viewed on radar in 1957.T...",UNKNOWN,Daniel Cohort,11.9K,377,1.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-the-raise-in-the-percentage-of-cancer-is-increasing-just-because-of-the-shift-towards-advanced-technology-lifestyle
10,"That the country was lying.Any race capable of travelling between stars would be so far more advanced than we are that such a ship just could not crash on Earth. It would be too advanced. Even if you worked really hard to make a ridiculous scenario to cause such an alien ship to crash, it’s nanotech would prevent it from being captured and examined, while repairing the ship. Further, there would be no way such a ship would not have a larger ship elsewhere off Earth to provide support. Such aliens would be dumb.","68,789 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-the-raise-in-the-percentage-of-cancer-is-increasing-just-because-of-the-shift-towards-advanced-technology-lifestyle
11,"let me put it that way:1901 a device was found in the sea which was later named “Antikythera mechanism”. it took aboud a year to recognize that it is a kind of gear box. many years later - and with the help of top-notch x-ray apparatus and computer technology - it was discovered, that it was a kind of astronomical computer.basic line: it took tremendous affort to show that the thing was just a clockwork (quite sophisticated but nothing more). and even though that it was made by humans 2000 years ago - with inscriptions which were quite old but readable for historicans.ok - now imagine a piecelet me put it that way:1901 a device was found in the sea which was later named “Antikythera mechanism”. it took aboud a year to recognize that it is a kind of gear box. many years later - and with the help of top-notch x-ray apparatus and computer technology - it was discovered, that it was a kind of astronomical computer.basic line: it took tremendous affort to show that the thing was just a clockwork (quite sophisticated but nothing more). and even though that it was made by humans 2000 years ago - with inscriptions which were quite old but readable for historicans.ok - now imagine a piece of high sophisticated alien technology is retrieved. from an intelligent species which did not evolve on the earth but in a different environment. based on a technonoly we possibly haven’t seen yet. with inscriptions we have hard time to recognize as writings but with no hope to decipher (there are writings from ancient humans we have not deciphered yet!).I have to admin: physics and chemistry will work identicaly on a foreign planet. the basic materials and principals will be the same. but if those aliens managed to get to earth they must be very far advanced. with our current technology we couldn’t send a working automated probe to our neares star. and I don’t think that somebody who was able to build a micro chip in 1999 could reverse engineere a micro chip from 2019. he simply doesn’t have the technology for that.but let’s play a thought experiment: somehow a piece of alien technology is found. and some very clever guys achieved to reverse engineere that technology. AND that piece of technology is actually usefull without its environment (imagine you find a gps receiver and reverse engineer it - how much benefit do you have from it without a single gps satellite?).the key point is “its environment”. the Antikythera mechanism was way beyound the common level of technology in the days. some clever guy was able to produce a complex gear box some hundrets if not thousands of years before that technology was commonly available. and that’s the problem: this guy gets famous and rich but that technology dies with him. because this device will ever by a wondrous testament to his ingenuity but there isn’t the technology to mass produce that thing.so you can possible reverse engineer some alien technology. but to produce more of it you not only need to understand the technology of that particular thing. you must also understand and master the technology to *produce* more of that thing.we understand quite good how nuclear fusion works. but we haven’t managed to build a working fusion reactor which actualy produces more energy that it consumes.so back to the original queston (at long last): the implications are, that on some parts of the world some very powerfull “artifacts” pop up. but a no one can mass produce them and they lack their proper environment, so they disappear some years later. the knowledge, that that kind of technology is possible kickstarts a new industry which very slowly starts to progress. some decades or so later some minor versions of these artifacts are available to a broader audience. besides the technology for the proper environment is developed and now commonly available. now these artifacts are actualy usefull.but until then the people have adapted to that new kind of technology. well - the older ones will say that it is the work of the devil. the young ones grew up with that technology and find it as normal as a toothbrush. and life goes on…","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-the-raise-in-the-percentage-of-cancer-is-increasing-just-because-of-the-shift-towards-advanced-technology-lifestyle

The F-35s that the US is getting a big dick over are a rather conventional thing working on principles that we know well since the 1950s - not technologically revolutionary in any meaningful way. There are some advanced know-hows incorporated, of course, probably related to the internal radio wave absorbing honeycomb structure and active ewar countermeasures, but that’s incremental rather than revolutionary tech.Plus, US is notorious for the extreme abundance of traitors and inadequate security.
