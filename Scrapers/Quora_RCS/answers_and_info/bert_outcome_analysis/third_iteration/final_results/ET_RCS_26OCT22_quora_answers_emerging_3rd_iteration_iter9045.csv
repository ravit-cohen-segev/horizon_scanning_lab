1,"Similar to one of the answers for this question, think of a friendship. Except, you have that special bond with that someone. You can have special bonds with friends, but romantic relationships include sex and intimacy. It’s a different kind of closeness. It’s debatable, as many “friends” screw each other and are able to compartmentalize how they feel for their friends and their lust, but this is just my personal opinion.Romantic relationships are just friendships that are taken to the next level.My boyfriend, for example, is also my best friend.

I can do anything and everything with him by my side. He can be running errands and I’d still want to be in the passenger seat of his car because I enjoy his company so much. He is also someone I vent to a lot about my day, and he does the same to me. I am absolutely obsessed with his brain, and how it works. I also am his #1 fan.I enjoy the blend of our relationship so much that it’s quite difficult for me to find anyone else attractive, to be honest.His kisses, the way he sleeps next to me, when he holds my hand. I see him in my future, in the long term, growing old together. I can imagine myself getting a house with him, having dogs, and travelling with him. I can see myself walking down the aisle just to see him waiting at the altar for me. I’m excited for what the future holds for us together.Hope this clears any confusion for you!",362 followers,Tarek Nassar,10.5K,345,1.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-would-be-your-classification-of-communication-issues-in-romantic-relationships

3,"Here's one, tested and approved. Keep a small notebook, well hidden from her, and from time to time, write down a note about something she liked, wanted to buy, a place she wanted to go or something she wanted to do. Keep the dates as well. Then, on a special occasion or when you can afford it (timewise as well as moneywise), get her that little something she wanted to buy or take her out to that restaurant she fancied, etc. The key is NOT to do this immediately after she asks for it, but rather to wait long enough for ""it"" to leave her immediate thoughts.

There is ADHD, and people of all ages who have it.I don’t know if it’s related to ADHD or if it’s a separate issue, but word-retrieval problems. That frustrating tip-of-your-tongue “oh, what’s that word!?” It’s a common enough word. You just used it an hour ago.
