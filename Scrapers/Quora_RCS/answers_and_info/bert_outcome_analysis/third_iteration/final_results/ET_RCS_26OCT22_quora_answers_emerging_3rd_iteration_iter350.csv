10,"In 1995, during my final year at IIT Kanpur, TCS and Infosys gave job offers to more than 60% of my class. Even the guys who really struggled (the ‘5 point someone’ variety) and had no other job options, easily got software jobs. And it did not matter whether you studied civil engineering or chemical engineering. So what was the point of studying computer science?Soon enough, IT majors like TCS and Infosys started hiring lakhs from across all campuses across India, and I became even more convinced that software engineering was now a commodity. It was a ticket to a safe but mediocre career.ButIn 1995, during my final year at IIT Kanpur, TCS and Infosys gave job offers to more than 60% of my class.

So what was the point of studying computer science?Soon enough, IT majors like TCS and Infosys started hiring lakhs from across all campuses across India, and I became even more convinced that software engineering was now a commodity. It was a ticket to a safe but mediocre career.But I was wrongSaying that you are a software engineer is like saying you are a writer. One could be JK Rowling or one could be an author of a blog, which nobody reads. Both are technically ‘writers’ but they are a world apart.So yes, we have an army of software engineers doing low skilled jobs at IT companies, which are surviving on the salary level differences between India and the US. But if that is all that was there to software engineering, why would Google and Facebook employ hordes of super-expensive software engineers in California?India has millions of software engineers, but where is all the innovation coming from? Has any major software language like Python, Ruby, Perl, or C been created by Indians? What about web frameworks like Rails or Django? What about libraries like Numpy or Pandas? I could go on and on.Even the US companies outsourcing work to our IT firms often get the critical work done locally by high-skilled programmers in the US. A lot of what gets outsourced is low-skill grunt work. I am obviously generalizing, but this is true for the most part.The story of software engineering in India is sadly much like our story in most other fields, be it sports, technology or business. At low and mid level skillset, we have an army of people. But at the high end of skillset, we are missing. Our best talent is sucked up by world’s top engineering schools and corporations.Back in India, many of our young graduates starting off as software engineers are only focused on constantly switching jobs to get that ‘30% pay hike’, rather than becoming really good at what they do. I have seen people from other countries make fun of how poor quality the code written by Indian engineers is, which should make us very sad.It is not that Indians are not competent. We have the same DNA as everybody else. My guess is that Indians probably constitute about 20% of the MS/PhD student population at many top US engineering schools. But back home excellence is not our priority - we settle for a low level equilibrium.It may sound harsh. But hiding from reality will not make it go away. It is hurtful, but we need to feel that pain and do something about it.What does the future hold for computer science?To foresee the future, let us look at the past. What has changed our lives the most in last 100 or 500 years? We still paint or draw or cook just as well or badly. For example, one could argue that the nawabs of Awadh ate better food than we do today.What has changed is technology. Everything we do is running on technology - from how we talk to people, how we travel, how we consume entertainment, to how we receive medical care from our doctors. And among all the areas of technology, software is the king.Software runs our lives 24x7, and it will do so more and more. The rockets launched by NASA or ISRO run on a ton of software. Our planes are sophisticated flying computers. When you fall ill, your blood testing is done by some fancy equipment, which is nothing but a computer at its core. Without software, your cars will not get manufactured, hospitals won’t run, and even your next-door restaurant won’t be able to bill you for food.The biggest companies in the world are de-facto software companies - Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Google… The industrial giants of yesterday are not in the same league anymore.The next 100 years will also belong to software. From data science to machine learning, from medicine to biotechnology - software will rule. And to win, you have to be at the cutting edge.The real game is not at the low end. It never was. The world is not very kind to the foot soldiers. Unfortunately, we live in a ‘If you are at the cutting edge of computer science, you will be the envy of the world. But if we keep switching jobs for that 30% salary hike, sooner or later we will get wiped out by someone with greater hunger for learning and passion for excellence. Make no mistake.Note: I have HUGE respect for people who build technology. My goal is not to hurt anybody’s sentiments, but to make us ask hard questions.","18,415 followers",Christopher Reiss,10.7K,3.2K,29M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Netaji-Subhas-Institute-of-Technology-What-all-topics-should-be-prepared-for-intern-ship-interviews-of-top-software-companies

They even have unions, like in civilian life, who fight for the rights of their soldiers. When I trained in the German army, we were told that a Dutch soldier always has a 9 to 5 working day and this was a right protected by their union. This was something totally unbelievable for us as our “working day” often exceeded 16 hours. True or not, when I saw these Dutch guys for the first time, I didn’t look twice.Dutch Korps Commandotroepen (KCT) in trainingThe big surprise came after three days of training. One has to know that the German Commando course is organized almost like a school, where you get grades for everything, and if you don’t get a decent grade, then you simply don’t pass and go home.After our first navigation march, our instructors assembled the class and read the results: it turned out that the Dutch had the best grades! They had somehow flown under our radar, but now I took a closer look at them for the first time. One of them was very thin, looked almost starved and it was hard for me to imagine how he could have finished first in what was a very grueling exercise.After another week we became used to the fact that the 1st place seemed to be reserved for the Dutch LRRPs. In everything we did they would come in first. This changed my mind about the Dutch Army and especially about their special forces. Of course, one can say that this was only a small group and the rest of their unit could still be very crappy, but in reality, this is not possible. German commando training is less physical than it is skill-based and these guys had fantastic infantry and survival skills which they had learned in their home unit.In my opinion, the","91,589 followers",Roland Bartetzko,3.4K,3.4K,314.5M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Netaji-Subhas-Institute-of-Technology-What-all-topics-should-be-prepared-for-intern-ship-interviews-of-top-software-companies

From an economic theory point of view, companies (especially large ones with good HR and Legal departments) will try to find a happy medium where they can payOverall, though, it seems that companies make money by hiring software engineers, so clearly the benefit provided is greater than the cost.

Any signs of a tendency to bully, or show slightly sociopathic behavior that seemed humorous during the interview but might not be so amusing if it’s a valid indicator of things to come? Some companies actually encourage a bullying culture, and as a result they have to pay employees more money to prevent them from quitting. If you look only at how much money the company is offering and nothing else, you might well wind up in the company that has the hardest time holding onto its employees.One other indicator that has helped me spot dysfunctional work environments quickly: How many Dilbert cartoons did you see posted when you did your on-site interview?
