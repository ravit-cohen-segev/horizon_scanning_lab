The labor cost in “train driving” is very small as a piece of the whole.By comparison, the cost of a car driver is enormous. One person can only transport a handful of people or modest quantity of things. The cost of the driver is spread over a very small number of functional units. The cost of the car driver makes up the largest expense!But the train driver can single handedly transport an army.

The cost of the car driver makes up the largest expense!But the train driver can single handedly transport an army. The cost of the train driver is marginal.If you value a car driver at about $15 per hour, and the driver usually carries 2 passengers, that's $7.50 per passenger per hour in driver costs.A train can carry up to 4000 people.If the train driver earns $27 per hour (average in the US), and the train seats only 400 passengers, then the costs of driving labor is $0.0675 per passenger per hour.Eliminate the car driver and you eliminate a huge cost.Eliminate the train driver and, well, at 6.75 cents per person per hour, it's not exactly expensive!In order to make it financially viable, you would have the cost of developing a new system, all to save a negligible amount of cost.In short, it's not happening because the economics say it's not worth doing even though it is a comparatively easy problem to solve.Some comments note that there are driverless trains in some locations. I think that my answer stands as far as reasons why self driving trains have not been developed very quickly.",0 followers,Thomas Kolb,1.3K,575,4.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Will-advanced-technologies-like-driverless-cars-or-super-fast-vacuum-trains-be-the-answer-to-the-environmental-crisis
1,Not ALL of the answer - but it helps.Not ALL of the answer - but it helps.So I’m optimistic that if we can bring in a government that actually wants to fix the problem - then this much could definitely be fixed.That does leave us with a lot of other issues that are much harder to solve:And of course - I’ve been talking largely from a US perspective. China is kindof on a mixed path - they are rolling over to electric cars in large numbers - but they still run a lot of coal power plants. India is entirely unrepentant about climate change and they are building coal power plants at a HUGE rate and buying up all of the coal production that other countries no longer need. This has to stop - but making it happen isn’t easy.,33 followers,Dawson Perry,602,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Will-advanced-technologies-like-driverless-cars-or-super-fast-vacuum-trains-be-the-answer-to-the-environmental-crisis

6,"Thanks for inviting. My answer is“Stronger” can be defined in different ways and aspects. And I believe that in most aspects India is at least stronger than China, if not much stronger.

Recently,In military, I believe that quantity and quality of aircraft carrier battle group can be a key indicator. Obviously India has 3 aircraft carriers while China 1. And the Chinese carrier was a second-handed one bought from Ukraine while India has her own one. SoIn politics,In culture, India has English as official language, which makes her much easier to connect to other countries. And Indian movies, songs are much more popular than Chinese ones. For example, Indian songFrom the aspects above, I believe that we can safely conclude thatP.S.

8,"The main problem with cricket is the duration of a match. People get bored by watching long 5 day test matches and even the 50 over ODI format also takes 7-8 hours to complete.

That’s the reason T20 has became the most popular format of the game nowadays.In the last 10 years:Average score inAverage score inHere, we can clearly see that the balance between bat and ball is getting wider as the game shortens. The main reason behind this is the batsmen are not afraid of taking risks as they know that the game is short and they have other batsman to follow. This also eliminates the fear of getting all out from the minds of the batting teams and they can play more freely. This is the main concern. If a team has 10 wickets in 50 over format how can they still have the same number of wickets in a much shorter format.This is where T20 needs a change. Here is what I thought to tackle this.","68,791 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Will-advanced-technologies-like-driverless-cars-or-super-fast-vacuum-trains-be-the-answer-to-the-environmental-crisis

Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect.

Although he is wearing a helmet, it hits his neck just below the ear. He collapses.Just 3 days before his 26th birthday, he dies. What are the chances!The rest of the matches are abandoned.

Will you ever get the conviction to bowl a bouncer again?What other options do you have? Let the batsman keep smashing your full deliveries out of the park? Bowl slower? Turn into a spinner? Retire?Nah, you can be strong. It is just an unlucky incident. Thousands of bouncers have been bowled. Batsmen have even faced them without helmets in earlier times.You will be fine.You are 26 years old now and haven’t played for your country since then.You need to improve your performance to get into the national side where there is tough competition.You are playing a domestic game. You are bowling to one of the most promising young batsman who is just 20 years old.You bowl fast, a bouncer. The ball hits the batsman’s helmet and he falls down to the ground.What?
