0,Not ALL of the answer - but it helps.Not ALL of the answer - but it helps.So I’m optimistic that if we can bring in a government that actually wants to fix the problem - then this much could definitely be fixed.That does leave us with a lot of other issues that are much harder to solve:And of course - I’ve been talking largely from a US perspective. China is kindof on a mixed path - they are rolling over to electric cars in large numbers - but they still run a lot of coal power plants. India is entirely unrepentant about climate change and they are building coal power plants at a HUGE rate and buying up all of the coal production that other countries no longer need. This has to stop - but making it happen isn’t easy.,18 followers,Asim Qureshi,2.6K,996,156M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Will-advanced-technologies-like-driverless-cars-or-super-fast-vacuum-trains-be-the-answer-to-the-environmental-crisis

Recently,In military, I believe that quantity and quality of aircraft carrier battle group can be a key indicator. Obviously India has 3 aircraft carriers while China 1. And the Chinese carrier was a second-handed one bought from Ukraine while India has her own one. SoIn politics,In culture, India has English as official language, which makes her much easier to connect to other countries. And Indian movies, songs are much more popular than Chinese ones.

9,"The main problem with cricket is the duration of a match. People get bored by watching long 5 day test matches and even the 50 over ODI format also takes 7-8 hours to complete.

That’s the reason T20 has became the most popular format of the game nowadays.In the last 10 years:Average score inAverage score inHere, we can clearly see that the balance between bat and ball is getting wider as the game shortens. The main reason behind this is the batsmen are not afraid of taking risks as they know that the game is short and they have other batsman to follow. This also eliminates the fear of getting all out from the minds of the batting teams and they can play more freely. This is the main concern. If a team has 10 wickets in 50 over format how can they still have the same number of wickets in a much shorter format.This is where T20 needs a change.

In the meantime, cameras record the visual and replay it in slow motion.If the ball is suspected to have hit the bat, the Snicko sound graph is checked for impact - a single, sharp spike on the graph will confirm the ball touching the bat. On the other hand, if it touches the pad or glove, a flatter impact is observed on it. The sound is then correlated by the third umpire with the slow motion replays of the ball passing the bat to make his final decision.This is especially the case when it’s a close call to make, with more than one genuine sound - bat hitting the ground, for example - and timing of each sound to be distinguished to determine the sound coinciding with the ball passing the bat. And, when there’s daylight between bat and ball, the graph stays undisturbed.This is because, while the cost involved is the least – it requires the stump mic and camera only – the evidence obtained can be inconclusive and prone to dubious decision-making, and in recent years, more comprehensive and accurate technologies have taken its place like Ultra Edge and Hawk-eye.TheThe hawk-eye, with the help of 6 cameras – three placed at each end of the ground - records the visuals of every delivery bowled, and the data obtained by the computers linked to the cameras is used to determine the predicted path of the delivery after pitching and impact on the pads.When an appeal for lbw is made by the bowler and the on-field umpire refers it to the TV umpire, the visual representation of this predicted path guides the third umpire in passing his judgement.TheTo cut it all in short Ultra Edge Uses stump mic to determine if the ball has caught an edge or not.I hope this will help.Source:","15,873 followers",Achyut Telang,8.3K,314,17.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Will-advanced-technologies-like-driverless-cars-or-super-fast-vacuum-trains-be-the-answer-to-the-environmental-crisis

You finally make your debut and play for your country. You play 1 ODI and 3 T20Is.It is going pretty well. You are an international cricketer now.Just after that series, you participate in a domestic first class competition. You are in good spirits. You are bowling to a batsman who made his T20I debut along with you.You bowl a bouncer. The batsman attempts a hook shot. But he misses. Although he is wearing a helmet, it hits his neck just below the ear. He collapses.Just 3 days before his 26th birthday, he dies. What are the chances!The rest of the matches are abandoned. Tributes are pouring in for the batsman from all over the world.What about you? A young 22 year old fast bowler who was involved in this unfortunate incident. What you must be going through? Of course it was not your intention to hurt, much less kill the batsman.What do you do? You blame yourself. How are you ever going to bowl fast again? Will you ever get the conviction to bowl a bouncer again?What other options do you have? Let the batsman keep smashing your full deliveries out of the park? Bowl slower? Turn into a spinner? Retire?Nah, you can be strong. It is just an unlucky incident. Thousands of bouncers have been bowled. Batsmen have even faced them without helmets in earlier times.You will be fine.You are 26 years old now and haven’t played for your country since then.You need to improve your performance to get into the national side where there is tough competition.You are playing a domestic game. You are bowling to one of the most promising young batsman who is just 20 years old.You bowl fast, a bouncer. The ball hits the batsman’s helmet and he falls down to the ground.What? Are you kidding me? Not again!The batsman takes several minutes to get up on his feet but retires and is helped off the ground for his treatment.This is the story ofBut what about the players who are on the opposite end of such incidents?
