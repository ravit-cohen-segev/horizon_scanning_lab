It will learn toFor most of us, as “anticipatory activities” of the I-Butler (i.e. thinking about things that matter in your life with the same values and considerations as you would think about them, though of course not via the same thinking process) increase in range and sophistication, I expect some software companies (NOT small app developers, but big AI leaders, which interface massive databases with you via an app) to begin offering this in very limited areas, such as “automatic sorting, answering, and filing of emails”.Even then, to avoid serious mistakes and user outrage, I expect these initial offerings to come with significant caveats and very strong encouragement that the user monitor every such decision by the AI for an extended “training period”.Still, some won’t do that, or will do it in a cavalier fashion, which will lead to well-publicized (often hilarious, and sometimes tragic) mistakes.I-Butlers will book appointments for us, placing them on calendars and reminding us of what we need to do to prepare for those appointments. They will help us prepare for meetings, looking at the topic and helping to prepare agendas. They will keep track of the people with whom we interact, reminding us of particular considerations such as their styles of communication and personal issues.Over time, and not as much time as one might think, it will gain the ability to converse with people in your voice. (The voice synthesis, including inflections, is already possible. The intelligence of response is what awaits further development.)By the late 2020s, fewer and fewer people will be able to tell whether they’re talking to you on the “phone”, or to your I-Butler. I expect this development to emerge amidst controversy, and would not be at all surprised to see a law passed requiring the AI to announce: “You are conversing with Jonathan’s I-Butler.” ItsEventually, these will talk toAs ever increasing parts of our lives andWe’re entering fascinating times.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,22.7K,996,156M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-big-shift-in-the-Smartphone-market

These are improvements, not leaps forward.So what do I think will be the next leap forward in smart phones?Since the start of computer technology, the real and virtual always have been devided. You were busy in one or the other. And I believe the next leap forward will break this boundry and combine the virtual world with the real one.You heard that right.

They have patents in many countries and announced on the ASX in May 2019 that they will have a prototype in 12–18 months. Since then they have issued another market announcement on the ASX detailing their nanoscale substrata for the chip, with photos, so they are progressing faster than expected.In their first market announcement about the quantum chip they set out a “to do” list for de-risking of their patents. Following completion of the prototypes the prototypes will undergo testing and then, if all goes according to plan, they will be mass-produced.These quantum processor chips will be able to be integrated into all consumer electronics devices alongside existing components.Needless to say, this will revolutionise computing as quantum computers will be able to provide us with, for practical purposes, virtually unlimited computing power.In my previous article I have provided links to articles and resources among which are recent developments that will enable quantum computers to be used more universally and for improving A.I. With such developments I think that quantum computers will enable us to do many things with our devices that we cannot do now, better A.I. and new and more powerful apps for a start, and with almost undreamed of processing power perhaps we shall see artificial general intelligence (AGI), followed soon thereafter by artificial superintelligent A.I., and so bringing about the technological singularity in the mid 2020’s?The factor that will make most difference to whether we shall see AGI soon, in my opinion, and therefore the technological singularity, will be (A) breakthroughs in A.I. programming and (B) increases in processing power (as predicted by Ray Kurzweil).I think both of these are going to be revolutionised in the early to mid 2020’s resulting in a singularity in the mid 2020’sThe recent new approach to teaching A.I.’s is to teach A.I.’s to learn like children from both virtual and real environments, not laboriously writing code for every little thing that they have to learn. This approach goes hand in hand with the development of the study of learning in children in developmental psychology which is now at a point where the natural mechanisms by which human infants learn and develop as intelligent beings are able to be isolated and turned into algorithms: These algorithms could simulate human infants in artificial intelligence. Combine these two very recent developments and you have the means to create artificial general intelligence in my opinion.And who knows where we will head in this regard in the next few years as A.I. is developing so fast now, and now there are efforts to directly create AGI, such as Open AI, which just received a billion dollars in funding from Microsoft; and Mindfire, which is a global open-source project to crack the consciousness code where programmers own their code through blockchain, not to mention Suzanne Gildert, who is also consciously working towards creating conscious AGI. AGI has become a real-world funded goal all of a sudden, not just a dream of some possibly distant future time that could perhaps emerge from A.I. research: It has now become a clearly identified scientific, technical and engineering problem to be solved in the near to medium term future - and it is snowballing.Secondly, the means to create super-intelligent AGI requires processing power that Ray Kurzweill predicted would be available in 2046.
