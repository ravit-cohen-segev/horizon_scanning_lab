A positive and a negative energy .How many times have you been doing your Physics homework and you come up with a negative answer? Most of the time we throw it away and just use the positive solutions.Well Mr. Dirac being a genius thought a little differently. He said, ‘Well there might be a whole set of particles out there that we haven’t seen.’Most of his colleagues thought he was crazy but only 3 years later Carl Anderson at CalTech discovered a particle with the same mass as an electron but the exact opposite behaviour.Yes it was antimatter.In 1933 he won a Nobel Prize for this discovery.Anti matter particles have an interesting property. When anti matter combines with matter it gets converted intoTo give you perspective an M&M sized piece of anti matter would have the same energy as an 80 KTON of nuclear weapon or alternatively 10,000,000 litres of liquid nitrogen gas.The basic concept behind using anti matter for spacecraft is to take a clump anti matter in your space craft, annihilate it in the rocket engine nozzle and then direct that energy flow in one direction.Now there are a few technicalThe next problem is that our squishy bodies can handle only a 1G acceleration i.e. 9.8 m/s/s. Even so 1G is a pretty high acceleration.So if we now decide to go toPretty good right!Lets now take things a little forward. If we now decide to go toAssuming that we travel at about 85% the light’s speed, it would take us about 5 years to get there. But as we start getting closer to the speed of light we experience a phenomenon called time dilation which basically means that 5 years time in the space craft equals 9 years on Earth.A little freaky but still feasible.Things get really freaky when we decide to go toKepler 452BUnfortunately due to time dilation 1500 years would have passed on Earth.Lets now have a look at the ultimate application of this. Exploring toAt 1G we could make it there well inside a human lifetime, just 30 years. That’s great except once again due to time dilation 13.5 billion years would have passed on Earth.Which means that by the time we get there the sun would have already been a Red Giant, completely engulfed(destroyed) the Earth and further turned into a planetary nebula.So yes interstellar travel is possible. If not now then it will be in a few decades. We need to think that with a transformative technology like this do we really want to explore out of our solar system. Because if we plan on conducting intergalactic space travel then we will have to say goodbye to Earth.The idea that you might go out to space for a few years and by the time you come back the home you left might not be there anymore is definitely frightening.But we must look back at people like Columbus and Vasco Da Gama who once had the same uncertainties in front of them but they went ahead anyway and triumphed.To think big is what pushed mankind to explore as far as it has. While the motivations always change, the goal is clear: we still have it in us, we want to see alien worlds with our own eyes and I believe one day we will.How long will life survive on planet Earth?Interstellar Travel Is Hard, Why Bother?The story of antimatterBreakthrough in Antimatter Physics Has Some Dreaming of StarshipsAntimatter rocket - Wikipedia<",0 followers,Aryan Sehrawat,698,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Will-interstellar-travel-ever-be-possible

The Dorothy Jemison Foundation fronted by astronaut Dr Mae Jemison won the leads 100 Year Starship but there is also[Full disclosureAll of the organizations I named either were empowered by or created after 2011’s 100 Year Starship Study Public Symposium. There is more credible work and real effort being generated to “advance the goal of interstellar accomplishment” than ever before.In other words, the original stated goal of the founders of the 100 Year Starship Project–Pete Worden, Peter Schwartz, Stuart Brand–Now if you think that’s exciting, you should. But that’s not all. It gets better.Before I elaborate let’s be on the same page.Interstellar travel means from one solar system to another. It implies from ours to another. Our solar system is called Sol, named after our system’s own star.The nearest star system to the Sol system is Alpha Centauri B (α Cen B). It is a K-type (orange dwaf) star nearly as large as Sol itself but only about half as bright. One of the most interesting things about the α Cen B system is scientists have recently identified a planet in the habitable zone of the system which may be what is called a “super earth”. This is good for us. In addition to habitability, there is the potential for other life.So yes it’s good for us that the nearest star system to our own may have an earth-type planet in that star’s habitable zone, and if so there is also the potential for life.One catch, and it’s a doozie. The α Cen B system is 4.37 light years away from our system.A light year I will remind you is the distance light travels in one year. Light, for the record, travels at 186,000+ milesAt the speed of light it would take us approximately two quick blinks of the eye to travel from the surface of the earth to the surface of the moon.At the speed of light it would take us just over three minutes to get from earth to Mars. (PresentlyAt the speed of light it would takes us 43 minutes or so to get from earth to Jupiter. The Juno probe just did that journey–To put a fine point on it, even with an astounding breakthrough in propulsion engineering, it is unlikely we are going to able to(One notable exception isSo, aside from something like Very Large Energy Beam propelling Very Small Object to Very Far Away Place, the question remains:How would we get to another star system?Like I said, it gets better.You saw Interstellar. You know about the Alcubierre warp drive. It’s a way to travel from one place to another in a way that transcends moving across vast distances.The general expression of this form of travel is FTL aka faster than light. Which as a way of moving is absolutely impossible. It is absolutely impossible toHowever,There is no strict limitation (energy demands, costs, and and engineering withstanding) in the physical universe that forbids us from doing that.Ever seen the old tv show I Dream of Jeanie where Jeannie blink’s her eyes and moves from one place to another? Warp field mechanics is exactly like that except with actual physics. Essentially, a warping field is generated around a spaceship/transport/something with an absolutely impossible amount of energy which makes space around the spaceship/transport/something get all wibbly wobbley timey-wimey (for lack of a better term). And then it ceases and the spaceship/transport/something has not moved but everything around it has.There are plenty of analogies on the internet as to how this takes place–In fact, the findings have been good enough that the internet has gone through several spates of ZOMG! NASA DID IT WE GOT WARP DRIVES newscycles but NASA hasn’t and we don’t. Yet.However, what we do have is some interesting science findings which are encouraging.Don’t get carried away (As it happens, I was there in the auditorium that day and, let me tell you, the feeling was electric. SEDS, which stands forThe movement to move earth’s humankind across a very tiny section of the universe.The movement to Build A Starship.Build A Starship is more than a turn of phrase. It is an open source grassroots campaign slogan initiated and spread by Icarus Interstellar and others inside and outside the interstellar community. The slogan encapsulates the idea, the plan, and the goal of the DARPA’s 100 Year Starship Project and runs with it into the future. AnIn fact, campaigning is precisely the stage where are we now in the process of building a starship. We have beginning physics and a slogan. Without mincing words, that is where we are. We are at the very, very beginning.That said, imagine if you will how it was to start the building the Great Pyramid of Giza, one of the greatest achievements of humankind and a process that took 100,000 people working 12-hour days non-stop for approximately 20 years to finish sometime in 2500 B.C. Such a feat of technology, engineering, and organization seems incomprehensible to us today.Building the Great PyramidWhen we imagine how it was to build the Great Pyramid we completely ignore or fail to recognize the campaigning, the planning, and the movement that must have been implemented in order to facilitate such a monumental conquest. No one individual person woke up and thought “Let’s build a pyramid today!” and then everyone just did it. The actual accomplishing of the building first demanded conveyance of the idea, creating a workable concept, building layers of support (among aristocrats, common people, even all the people who were enslaved and used for labor), fostering understanding and comprehension, and subsequently an extraordinary amount of conversation and dialog.All of this had to have taken place even before the first step towards the first stone to be first moved was first made.In other words, the beginning of building the Great Pyramid of Giza most certainly requiredThe good news is the interstellar movement is underway. All the organizations listed above and their collective members and memberships are part of this movement. It is even more exciting to realize that once we human beings set our collective eyes on a prize–no matter how seemingly unattainable or audacious–history shows us, again and again and over and over,We built the Great Pyramid 4000 years ago. And just 100 years ago cars, planes, radio, electrical lighting or tools, antibiotics, x-rays, and were all brand new inventions. Television had not even been invented yet. Yet look where we are today. Each of us literally has the entire repository of the Library of Alexandria in our pockets. And it talks. Today we have robots on Mars. Only 50 years ago we didn’t even have luggage with wheels! To say we are on a roll is to put it lightly.In closing, consider this. Once upon at time, there were two kinds of people. Those who said we couldn’t fly and those who pursued flight. Then, once upon another time, there were another two kinds of people. Those who said we would never go to the moon and those who pursued a moonshot.So today there are twoAt the end of the day the question is not will we–Or are you on the side that says yes, the side having fun doing the work and experiments of math and science, the side whose members look up beyond the sky and past the atmosphere and who in discovering an absurdly large universe absolutely chockfull of stars can only think one irresistible thought:You decide.","10,574 followers",Andrej Karpathy,573,53,1.5M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Will-interstellar-travel-ever-be-possible

Some call it overly optimistic. Whatever. Just my thought.Should our species remain extant for the next thousand years —meaning we don’t kill ourselves with bio-engineered plagues, or Yellowstone doesn’t erupt and kill us all, or a KT-like impact doesn’t happen— we will eventually cease being “human” in a few centuries.Centuries?

Not millions of years?Yes. Provided that we continue (a) existing and (b) advancing in technology, by the middle of this century, we will have access to our entire genome, nano-technology (or at the very least, micro-robotics) and AI. Those technologies, if we try really hard to extrapolate their logical course, mean that at some point in the next few centuries, there will be no more homo sapiens. Perhaps a few “museum humans” will choose to remain in their old form, but those beings will live on Earth or space stations, too frail and ephemeral; too needy to package into dense vessels for interstellar travel.If our descendants survive, they will adjust their genome. Maybe it won’t become prosaic until 2125, but at some point very soon, the temptation to remove all “negative” traits will be overwhelming. The temptation to enhance with some genetic coding from other beasts will become overwhelming. The temptation to enhance with artificial bits —that connect us to instant information, right to the brain— will be overwhelming. The temptation to create new biological features un-imagined by “Mother Nature” wholly invented by us and our super-advanced computer technology (maybe a new cell wall, completely re-engineered mitochondria, or a cell part that we cannot imagine today) will become overwhelming.At some point, after sufficient changes, we won’t be human any longer. We certainly won’t be homo sapiens. We’ll be something else … IF “we” survive that long and continue advancing technologically. A global disaster could destroy our civilization but leave a few hundred thousand of us thrown back the equivalent of five millennia. But if we survive and continue advancing, then homo sapiens is done in a few centuries at the longest; a century at the shortest.At some point in time, the advancing technology will unlock self-assembling, self-making robotics that leverage exponential growth that will either be our end or our elevation to the pinnacle of abilities in this cosmos. With lives extended to the many millennia, with intelligences in VR and AI’s meandering about the solar system, “time” won’t have the same cachet as it does today. A journey at .01c, taking 1,000–1,500 years to cross the gulf between stars will be meaningless in the lives of those beings — beings that are effectively immortal who see time as a non-obstacle.Those beings, if they end up coming into existence, will achieve interstellar travel.

Regardless if you arrived at the destination or not, the fact would still remain that all the people you left on Earth would never see you again.Interstellar travel with current technology would be a one way trip, that would demand everything from its crew, and any failure to a critical system would mean the death of everyone on board.",0 followers,Ashok Bishnoi,12.8K,314,7.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Will-interstellar-travel-ever-be-possible
6,"The laws of physics and the distances involved make interstellar travel extremely difficult.Distance: The closest star to the earth is 4.3 light years away, the galaxy is 100,000 ly across, the next big galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud, is like 200,000 ly away. Travelling at 0.2 c it will take a million years to get to the next galaxy. Any takers? Then there’s the return trip!Acceleration: Of course you can’t get to your cruise speed instantly, it takes time. Humans are optimised for an acceleration of 1 g, ie 10 m/s/s. At this acceleration it takes a year to get close to the speed of light.The laws of physics and the distances involved make interstellar travel extremely difficult.Distance: The closest star to the earth is 4.3 light years away, the galaxy is 100,000 ly across, the next big galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud, is like 200,000 ly away.

Then there’s the return trip!Acceleration: Of course you can’t get to your cruise speed instantly, it takes time. Humans are optimised for an acceleration of 1 g, ie 10 m/s/s. At this acceleration it takes a year to get close to the speed of light. This adds to the travel time but is not too serious compared to other problems.Speed kills: Travel near the speed of light is fraught. Hitting a regular photon would be like hitting a high energy gamma ray. A lot of shielding is going to be required for any human occupants. Hitting a space pebble could catastrophically terminate the mission. From the safety aspect is is likely that speeds like 0.2 c are the maximum. At this speed relativistic effects like time dilation are minor.Energy: To reach a near light speed the entire mass of a self propelling spaceship would be required for fuel. This would involve converting the ship’s mass to light and using this for propulsion. This requires technology we don’t yet have but is possible in theory. Obviously if you are aiming for 0.2c the fuel requirement is less.Survival in transit: Obviously you’d need a self sustaining system. There is not even solar energy in deep space. You can’t nick down to the local DIY for a replacement gamma ray shield if yours fails or fall off.Stopping: It’s all very well to reach a distant star but you presumably want to stop and have a look around when you get there rather than just shooting past. This requires deceleration, or acceleration in the opposite direction. Again, this requires more fuel and time. You might spend a year slowing down.Colonisation equipment: Not sure what the exact plan would be but I expect you would need to take sufficient equipment with you to start mining an asteroid to get things going at the far end. More baggage. It would be embarrassing if you had chosen a star that was unsuitable for colonisation for some reason.Economics: I think you could find some people who were willing to undertake the journey but it might be a lot more difficult to get someone to pay for it. Governments find it difficult to pay for anything substantial these days - except wars - and it’s a bit hard to see why a private organisation would pay for it, cost: humungous, expected return: zero.One way trip: This would be a spreading of our influence not a commute system. There would be no point in returning.What about wormholes, exceeding the speed of light, blah, blah, blah? These are fantasies in physics words, not real demonstrated physics. I’m talking about known physics not imaginary musings. Science and technology are going to advance but there is no good reason to believe that fundamentals like the speed of light will be broken, ever.=-=-=-=Of course, this discussion assumes that humans will be around more-or-less as they have been indefinitely. This is surely wrong. We are on the cusp of both remodelling of our biology at will and the creation of truly intelligent machines. It would be much easier to send a small intelligent machine to a distant star. Travel time is basically irrelevant if you can simply switch off for thousand years, and the requirements for the ship change drastically. If you really wanted humans at the other end, you could send the DNA code on a memory chip. It would be much more efficient for robotics systems to generate some humans in test tubes at the far end that to actually carry them as a payload, but “humans” like us will be history by then anyway.This is how I imagine stellar colonisation will occur. You won’t get the “One small step…” video voiced by a human. However, there’s still a big question. Would our post-human descendants be interested in travel to other stars? We really have no way of knowing what they would want.",2 followers,Richard Muller,7.3K,2.3K,202.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Will-interstellar-travel-ever-be-possible

Anyone who believes we are making technological progress here is just deluding themselves. All we have learned how to do is blow our selves up less often, fundamentally it is still the same process that powered the V2 rocket in WW2. Ion propulsion isnt a new idea either. First proposed over 100 years ago and experimented with over 60 years ago, it isnt a game changer as you cannot get into orbit with it.We cant easily get into space, anything heavier or larger than a school bus becomes very problematic. The shear enormity of this very basic fundamental problem, completely lays waste to questions about “do we currently have the technology” to do something. Clearly we do not, and saying things like “assuming we could get it up there” is just an exercise in fantasy. The ISS took 15 years and over 100 launches to get 925,000 pounds in orbit at a cost of over $100,000 per pound. This single massive obstacle... ground to earth orbit, will hold us to the earth more than any other fact. Until the cost of this process is dropped by a factor of several thousand, interstellar travel will remain a fantasy. Building a ship the size and weight of an aircraft carrier, something you would reasonably expect for such a long mission, would cost more than twenty trillion dollars. That just isnt going to happen... not anytime... not ever.The primary reason beyond the cost to orbit is one without a solution and that the problem itself is unavoidable and completely intractable. Just like the proposition of going faster than light, this problems arising here give you the same answer, it isn't possible. The issue everyone seems to pass over is thermal efficiency.Thermodynamics is well understood and the nature of energy and systems is well understood. The energies required to gain even a very small fraction of the speed of light are astronomical. Even if we found a way to get that much energy out of some sort of engine propulsion technology, the mission would be over before we ever got up to speed. Nothing we do works at anything near 100% efficiency. Systems that approach 40% are typically maxed out. Even chemical rockets would fall victim to the laws of thermodynamics if they kept firing for much longer than they currently do. The energy lost in efficiency would rapidly raise the temperature on the rocket motor until it failed if the burn time was increased significantly. This is the reason why interstellar travel will forever remain a fantasy.Any interstellar craft would have to have gigawatts of output energy it converts to momentum. I did the calcs once on what it would take to accelerate a spaceship weighing 300,000 pounds to 1,000,000 mph. It would take 8 gigawatts of power for over a year. Even if it was possible to get that kind of energy out of such a small object, there would be no way to handle the excess heat. Even if by some miracle we came up with a process that was 90% efficient you would still be dealing with nearly a gigawatt of excess heat with no good way to get rid of that heat in space except by adding massive radiators which would then require even more power to get to the same speed…. and I mean massive radiators, many times the size of the original space craft. Without this, the spacecraft would be reduced to molten metal in a matter of minutes.Interstellar travel that gets you to destinations in only a few lifetimes, all run into this problem. It is very difficult to get rid of waste heat in space. Space itself is actually an insulator. Once hot it takes a long time to cool down. We take this for granted on the earth surface. We dissipate waste heat into the atmosphere and into water and think nothing of it. In space you have no benefit of atmosphere or oceans. This is a real problem that you will not find an answer on any of the designs that are thrown out in conjecture. Just like in Star Trek, when faced with the laws of physics lined up against their technology they just make something up to compensate for this. There are no inertial dampeners in reality. There is no answer in physics for this either.I challenge anyone to do the math and come back with comments... it is really quite clear...

Even if we came up with some “magic cryosleep” that could preserve an astronaut for centuries, and worked out some way to make the trip in a mere 1,000 years, by the time the astronaut arrived, the Earth would be a totally different planet.Think of the difference a century has made.My grandparents actually lived in a time where the main mode of transportation was horses.Now we’re talking about interstellar travel, and that, if we spent all of humanity’s treasure on it, we might be able to do it in a lifetime.A hundred years ago today (October 30, 2018) the Ottoman Empire was signing an armistice treaty to end World War 1, on the(The HMS Agamemnon, with her wooden deck.)Since then we have built air travel, plastics, computers, television, the internet, rockets, satellites, and deep space probes. We all carry around devices that someone even 25 years ago would have called total science fiction. Now we have rockets that can land and be re-used again. In the next 5 years, we will see satellite internet that will let you be connected to a world-wide information and computer grid 24/7 from literally any place on the surface of the Earth. We will see rockets that are 100% reusable, and capable of reducing cost to space down to the $1000 per kilo range or far less (way less if you believe Elon.)Over the next decade or two, there are real efforts afoot to colonize the Moon and Mars. Even Venus is in the mix for human colonization. Mining of asteroids for raw goods to build orbital shipyards isn’t just a writer’s fantasy, it’s a business plan.Now, extend that rate of change out another five decades or so.Basically, if someone can crack the EM Drive, or the Alcubiere theory in the next few decades, then interstellar travel becomes possible.If not… well, there are tens of thousands of moonlets, asteroids, and dwarf planets left to explore, colonize, and exploit in the solar system alone. Even if we never physically leave the solar system, we could create a system-spanning civilization of unimaginable technology over the next two to three centuries.And, eventually, even if we never found a way to beat the speed of light, someone will make the journey to the nearest stars. It might take 100 years to cross a light year, on a ship the built out of an asteroid, where generations will live and die in the vast void of interstellar space, but humanity would eventually reach those nearest stars.And then move to the next and the next, because that’s what humanity does. It’s what we’ve always done.But not today… not quite yet.We’re gazing out into the ocean, but so far all we’ve ever built isn’t even a rowboat, it’s a surf board.Wait until we know how to build ocean liners.",33 followers,Matthew Lee,1.5K,548,11.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Will-interstellar-travel-ever-be-possible

He has also created a fund that has donated billions of dollars to various causes around the world.Jeff Bezos built the first online market place turning it into a high-tech platform that has changed forever the way people shop. His business model has been emulated by many including Russia’s Wildberries and Ozon.Unsatisfied with his achievements, Bezos has funded a private space company and and became the second person to reach suborbital space aboard his all-civilian rocket ship.The first person was another oligarch Sir Richard Branson who had followed on the footsteps of his English predecessors to fund a scientific project for the benefit of the mankind.Roman Abramovich is the ‘best’ oligarch Russia has produced in 30 years. He unlike the rest of the Russian oligarchs, at least donates his money to various causes. Roman is our Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates rolled into one.Roman didn’t build any high-tech company. He didn’t send any rocket to space. He bought for pennies assets of the Soviet oil industry and then through cunning schemes enriched himself beyond any measure and kept his riches by becoming Putin’s agent of influence in London.Roman recently bought his 6th super-yacht for half a billion dollars. It is a marvel of German engineering and Italian design. Not a single part was manufactured in Russia.Now try not to laugh. According to Roman, his greatest achievement in life has been….Football Club Chelsea he purchased in 2004!Yes, the pinnacle of Russia’s most prominent oligarch’s life achievements was to have eleven grownup men wearing shorts run around a lawn with a leather ball. 🙉This is another half a billion super-yacht of another good for nothing Russian oligarch Mordashov who had leached off Soviet extraction industry and ‘forgot’ to share with his compatriots. No, the super-yacht was not built in Russia either. It couldn’t have.And look at the city of Cherepovets, the source of his wealth.Mordashov hasn’t invested a penny into it. He does not care to bring his Soviet steel mills to modern ecological standards that look like a set from a dystopian movie.Mordashov doesn’t dabble in science. He didn’t creat any space company. He enjoys his luxurious lifestyle like his predecessors and to hell with the serfs who live hand to mouth.According to Noam Chomsky, “Education is learning to spot signs of history repeating itself”. As such, Russians are not an educated people.They must have been put on Earth to give a valuable lesson how NOT to live one’s life.Be thankful that there is Russia, the idiot of the world.","43,459 followers",Misha Firer,1K,1.3K,133.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Will-interstellar-travel-ever-be-possible

In “Schisms,” Riker took over and assisted a helmsman when she was having trouble navigating a globular cluster, so there is definite awareness when help is needed. There are many episodes when we see Picard standing behind a crewmember watching them at their station. I would assume this is comparable to being proctored/monitored by a senior officer, or at the very least having command engaged in what the crew is doing. How else is Riker or Troi going to do performance reviews if they can’t visually-assess the crew?I would also say given the advanced simulations used in Trek, that just as you can simulate a Kobayashi Maru scenario, you can litmus test and certify potential officers to see how they work under stress or whether they’re qualified for duty, similar to Dr. Crusher and Troi having to pass an exam in order to be bridge officer-qualified for Command.There is also a simpler answer: Crew rotation. Data and Worf both rotated as Captain during Night Watch duties - and I can see Data doing it often as he did not require sleep. Ensign Kim also took night watch duties as Captain (with what looked like Chakotay doing his performance reviews given his Q&A on taking command).

These guys will rotate to other duty stations periodically throughout a 4-hour watch.The conning officer is typically a junior officer, an ensign or J.G., whose job it is to pilot the ship, keep it on track while avoiding hitting anything, and telling the helmsman when to turn and how far or long). He will also give orders to the leehelmsman to signal the engine room to change speed. On a high-tech vessel though, the helm and leehelm are combined and often automated, such that for general cruising no operator (helmsman) is needed and the conning officer just punches in the course and speed.The OOD is the Exec's proxy. His job is to make sure everybody else is doing theirs (especially the conning officer), and that the schedule is followed, and standing orders obeyed... and to alert the Captain and/or Exec when certain situations arise. The OOD is typically an LT or LtCmdr.At the same time, there is CIC (essentially “OPS"" for Star Trek), a separate compartment in which a dozen or more scope jockeys man all sensors and plot all possible threats, hazards, and friendlies, and handle communications with HQ and naval intelligence. The whole operation is overseen by a CICWO, the next step up for a JO after qualifying as Conning Officer. He just keeps apprised of what the scope jockeys are tracking and the incoming message traffic, and when something comes up he notifies the CO, OOD, or Conning Officer as he thinks necessary. In a war zone or potential war zone, CIC also has a more senior officer, the TAO (Tactical Action Officer), typically a department head, with weapon’s release authority for situations where there’s no time to get the okay from the Captain — The TAO generally stands a 4 or 6 hour watch with absolutely nothing to do except play war-game simulations in his head based on the potential hostiles in striking range.The Captain, if he is on the bridge at all during standard cruising, is sitting on his throne by the starboard bridge wing … snoozing.If something is awry, the Captain will signal the Exec, the Exec will come down hard on the OOD, the OOD will then take appropriate action, possibly including humiliating the conning officer, though typically in a very professional and sardonic manner.So what's odd about the Star Trek franchise is that the COs and Execs are a bunch of prima donna control freaks who don't know how to delegate, and waste their precious time doing jobs rightly belonging to squids, computers, and wet-behind-the-ears junior officers.","46,131 followers",Steven Haddock,975,25.6K,343.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Will-interstellar-travel-ever-be-possible
