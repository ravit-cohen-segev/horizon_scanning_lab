I liked a girl so much I kept showing up at her house at 6 in the morning just to say “hi” to her when she left for the day.But she didn’t like me so much so I was always afraid she was cheating on me. I would call at 5am just to see if she would wake up and answer the phone.I’d want to spend every moment with her. I would pace the streets near her house to see if I could bump into her. I’d try to get her to stay over my house every night but she didn’t really want to and then I’d get afraid she was cheating on me again.Of course, eventually she did cheat on me.

But then she begged forgiveness and I let her back into my life. I thought I loved her.Finally, the craziness just wore me out. I lost maybe 40lbs. I lost a lot of money pursuing her. I lost track of a book I was writing. I got fired from a job.Everything went down the drain in my life. It was one of the worst experiences of my life. It was a year of my life from beginning to end.There’s two things to understand:Biologically, we have these neurochemicals:The longer we are with someone, the more our brain receptors require that particular hit to activate those neurochemicals.The area of our brain that lights up with romantic rejection is the same area that lights up when we have physical pain.How long does it take before we can train our brain to respond to something else? I don’t know. Some say 21 days, some say six weeks. It’s unclear.We then try to rationalize it: “this was the perfect person for me”.WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT?But it doesn’t matter that you know the above. An addict still goes through withdrawal, even if they know the cause of withdrawal.One friend of mine is so dependent on alcohol that he has to wake up in the middle of the night to drink. Else he can end up in the emergency room by morning. He’s been an alcoholic for almost 40 straight years.Loveaholics can be the same way.But here’s what you can try to do. Two things:A) Do something for someone else:You can do these things to speed up the process of rewiring your happy neurochemicals.B) And finally, whenever this happens to me, I try to look for someone new.I look forSomeone who is in the top 25% for: Sweet, Pretty, Intelligent, Creative, Emotionally Mature.Here’s the math on finding someone who has all five of those: 25% is one out of four. To have all five categories is 1/4 * 1/4 * 1/4 * 1/4 * 1/4 or one out of 1024 people will be in the top 25% of all of those categories.That seems like a small number. But there are four billion people of the opposite sex (or same sex, depending on your preferences) on the planet.One out of 1024 of those is 4,000,000 people.Let’s say about 1/4 of those are in the right age range.That means over a million people are probably better for you than the person who rejected you.Will you marry me?Related Post:",404 followers,Jeel Modh,4.5K,85,943.6K,2017,https://www.quora.com/Love-Im-deeply-in-love-and-I-cant-stop-thinking-about-him-all-day-This-drives-me-crazy-How-can-I-stop-thinking-about-him-knowing-that-he-most-likely-doesnt-like-me-back-and-only-sees-me-as-a-friend-sister

But the problem is that we often mix up a pressure of temporary gush of energy to release in a direction that seems most easy to us and that is making a typical holly wood style romance with a person who attracts us in a mysterious way.Loving someone and keep thinking about them is common phenomenon. There are no secrets about this and one just has to love them and telling that in action is far better than telling in words.Actually showing or expressing your feelings of love are more like an art than a science. Some like to hear words, others like to see loving behaviour and some respond best to gesture.However, your love if it is really a passionate feeling (and not a fakery), can not remain hidden from its object for a long time as Sun can not remain clouded for more than some hours or days and ultimately its shine dazzles its object with its full intensity. However, here are some tips that will make you successful:I) Don’t have a fear of rejection. Love is love and if someone temporarily feels embarrassed, it doesn’t mean that it is a rejection.ii) Always be nice to them and never be confused if they show a fake ignorance. Every one loves to be loved and knowing that someone loves them makes them feel ecstatic but sometimes they show that they don’t care.iii) Try to know their interest and then act accordingly. For instance if they love a particular personality or activity, do as they like. If they like boating you also start boating and in this way seek a chance to come closer to them. If they like coffee, learn to make wonderful coffee. etc.iv) Never be possessive and always give them freedom and space to make them feel easy and not nagging. Simply do the things that tickle their heart.v) Take interest in their problems and give them full attention and make feel them that they are special.vi)viiIf you look like serious and dry person it will be difficult for you to catch the attention of others.",326 followers,Anubhav Jain,4K,4.4K,123.7M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Love-Im-deeply-in-love-and-I-cant-stop-thinking-about-him-all-day-This-drives-me-crazy-How-can-I-stop-thinking-about-him-knowing-that-he-most-likely-doesnt-like-me-back-and-only-sees-me-as-a-friend-sister

They could not produce 20,000 planes when they making outdated simple aircraft from early in the war. By diverting resources to make Jet engine aircraft they only further hampered their production failures.Moreover, Germany was out of oil- and I mean in the worst way.

For one example, the Germans had - after much effort - managed to just about get the high-speed Type XXI submarines on an operational deployment by war’s end; but the British had already converted high-speed test targets, developed tactics, sensors and weapons, and were prepared to contain the threat the Type XXI posed.This didn’t get publicised at the time, because the Soviets were using the Type XXI concepts to produce theThere was also a great deal of “paper projects” which were lauded for the specifications they were intended to achieve, but were never completed or tested. Allied projects tended to either be dismissed or ignored if they weren’t fielded, or in some cases (such as the Consolidated-Vultee XP-81) fell short of projections: the XP-81 was specified to achieve a top speed of over 500mph, but in practice proved unable to achieve even 400mph. However, German projects that were never even built, are often held up with their paper specifications as if it was certain they’d achieve them, leading to a certain overestimation of their capabilities.Many of these paper projects were fairly fantastical, driven by design teams desperately justifying their existence in nice warm offices at home rather than holding rifles on the Eastern Front; the Allies were more ruthless in pruning unsuccessful or unnecessary developments. Surface-to-air missiles were a low priority in 1944, for instance, since there was no Luftwaffe to engage them with; but with the advent of the Kamikaze threat in the Pacific, the US had Project Gorgon in prototype phase and the British had Spaniel and Artemis in development and the Fairey Stooge prototyped - but despite achieving more progress and success than German equivalents, those are consigned to obscure archives (try finding a copy of Twigge’s “The Early Development of Guided Weapons in the United Kingdom, 1940-1960” for love or money) , while the “Secret Weapons of Nazi Germany” industry has been a long-running moneymaker.

Nothing they were doing was that much of a game changer.The ME262 was a limited value jet. If there were more and had they been made earlier, they would have made a difference. The US and UK was getting very good at churning out lots of good airplanes.The Tiger tanks were another overkill item. They were too big. They consumed too many resources to produce as a line tank. The Germans did not have the fuel or production to take them into battle. The roads and trains could not be used to take them where they could fight.The V2 was effective and very expensive to produce. Germany could not make enough of them to turn the tide of war. If they had concentrated on military targets it might have made a difference.There were ideas they mothballed. There was a plan for a plane-to-plane proximity missile that might have been very effective against bombers. It was never put into production.The challenge in the middle of a war is to pick and choose your technology.There was one other huge problem, they had “used up” all the war aged men. The home guard was made up of pensioners from WWI and young teenagers. Everyone in between was already fighting or dead.Meanwhile, US war production was PHENOMENAL and was stacking up planes, tanks, rifles, and logistics for ALL the Allies. Russia was fed by the US. An enemy you cannot attack is very hard to beat.Best of luck.Edit 10/30/2020There is one more item that is a factor. Germany had a self inflicted brain drain occurring. They killed or ran off all the Jews. Other technically or scientifically trained people were given a rifle and sent to a front. They sent technically trained people to fight, with a rifle.

In fact, there had been huge improvements in ASW, even ignoring aircraft, radar, HF/DF, Fido, etc.Warship design and naval historian DK Brown gives figures to show how much Allied ASW improved during the war. In the first six months of the war, a depth charge attack from a British warship had a 1 in 120 chance of sinking a U Boat. By the last two years of the war, the success rate of a depth charge attack alone had increased to 1 in 16 due to improvements in technique, depth charges and ASDIC (sonar). A single attack with Hedgehog had a bit better than 1 in 4 success rate, with Single Squid similar. A single attack with Double Squid controlled by Type 147 ASDIC had a 40% success rate.While the Type XXI could elude many escorts and would have been more likely to get away from a Squid or Hedgehog attack, it’s still going to be struggling to survive very long when the enemy has that sort of success rate.Many people who talk about the XXI seem to utterly ignore this sort of improvement in Allied technology and the fact that they were getting to the stage of having abundant resources which could, for instance, have led to many British destroyers being quickly modified into Squid-carrying high-speed escorts as they were after the war.","4,707 followers",Carl Richard Archie,1.7K,1.7K,26.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Love-Im-deeply-in-love-and-I-cant-stop-thinking-about-him-all-day-This-drives-me-crazy-How-can-I-stop-thinking-about-him-knowing-that-he-most-likely-doesnt-like-me-back-and-only-sees-me-as-a-friend-sister

Oil was almost non-existent, German industry were pounded 24/7 by fleets of Allied bombers. However, there was potential there on paper that the war could perhaps have been prolonged.September 1944As you can see, by later 1944 the Germans had utterly failed to stop D-Day, which opened a third front and effectively hemmed in Germany from three sides. It facilitated the ability of the allies to threaten the reich itself.More importantly, in the east Operation Bagration employed the doctrine of “deep warfare” against the Nazis to what can only be described as devastating effect.Operation Bagration, broke the back of the German army. Army group Center was effectively destroyed, army group north isolated & Army group south forced into Romania and Hungary, where both nations switched (or in Hungary’s case attempted to) sides. The nature of deep battle doctrine meant that German lines were NEVER able to recover on the eastern front. In German memoirs you will find the situation described as a “general retreat” but in many places it was quite literally a rout.After Bagration there was no clear “front” on the eastern front. Soviets were everywhere and Germans could only take temporary positions to stop them.The Allied advance in the west simply meant that Germany could not even move the forces stationed there to hold back the Soviets, they were hemmed in and doomed to fail.The loss of the Romanian oil fields also meant that the oil situation was hopeless as well, no matter what Germany was able to produce, it would be useless without fuel.Why not ?For Nazi germany to have held out any longer than it did would have required some major changes in the sequence of events.

Metals were another shortage- everything from lead for bullets, alloying elements for high strength steel for gearboxes, cutting tools and the like, tungsten for better armour piercing ammo. And of course, uranium, for the technological advantage that actually worked.Poor leadership and planning:Hitler ordered the cancellation of lots of long term development programmes in the expectation of a quick war. One notable casualty was proximity fuses, that would have made AA fire against bombers much more effective.However, Germany still ended up with lots of spending on research and development, without the resources to exploit the results. The V weapons are a prime example- a V2 cost as much as a fighter aircraft, and dropped one warhead somewhere near the target if it was lucky. If you’re already short of everything, they’re a waste of effort. But they’re a good way of stopping the researchers being sent to the Eastern Front.German jets ate their engines, due to a lack of high temperature alloys due to metal shortages. The British one wasn’t deployed to the front line until very late, but both a longer design process and fewer shortages meant their engines lasted much longerAllied piston engines got a huge performance boost from the use of very high octane petrol- which only the US had the catalytic refineries to produce in quantity.The Atom bomb.

Consider the V-weapons. The V-1 was a significant achievement in terms of propulsion, but barely more than a nuisance. The V-2 was even more remarkable, and could do serious damage, but again could not tip the scales of war.Imagine against all reality that these weapons had been available when they would have been most useful: during the Battle of Britain. The V-weapons were unguided; useful for terror strikes but not for instance for precision strikes on airfields or radar stations, which would have been their best use in support of the Luftwaffe.The reality is that Germany did not have the resources to exploit its best ideas, and not all of their ideas were good ones. (The Maus tank, for instance.) Let’s say the V-weapons could be made into guided missiles with more work - the cost of their development and then their production on a large enough scale would have been a crippling drain on an economy already pushed to the limit and falling behind every year of the conflict. Never mind that German technology was almost always finicky at the start of a production run, and quality control, availability of spare parts, etc., was continuously falling. All the “wonder weapons” were cost-inefficient. The battlefield impact of these “advanced” designs did not outweigh their cost relative to the effectiveness of the same resources spent on “conventional” designs.The real German advantage lay not in advanced design but in the careful tactical use of its technology through “force multipliers”. Virtually the moment the invasion of Russia began, the Germans were stunned to encounter tanks that were in design terms far better than their own. The early model T-34; the massive KV-1 and -2 whose armor the German tank guns simply couldn’t penetrate. How did the Germans do so well against them? Certainly the Germans developed better tanks, upgunning their PZ III and PZ IV models. But the PZ VI (Tiger) was never available in quantity, and the PZ V (Panther), the best single German design, was plagued with development delays and production problems. Meanwhile, the Russians churned out T-34’s by the tens of thousands, including a model armed with an 85mm gun; the late war JS series of heavy tanks were better than anything in the German arsenal. Still, the Germans had the edge in tank-to-tank battle all the way up to 1945. Why? Every German tank from the start of the war had a radio. No super secret technology required! They could coordinate and cooperate with each other to a degree the Russians, whose tank platoons often had to maneuver in rigid formations like fleets of sailing ships, simply could not. But even with such advantages, the Germans eventually lost the production game to the inexhaustible Russians.About the only German weapon tech that could have made a real difference was its jet fighters. Again, they could not reasonably be built in the quantities necessary. Furthermore, they would have needed to be available much earlier, before the German air force had been bled dry of its experienced pilots and overwhelmed by sheer numbers. But they could have altered the balance of the air war, giving the Germans a solid chance at maintaining their early air superiority.

In the meantime, the advances in RADAR and SONAR meant that U-Boat losses in 1944 alone reached 77 (from all causes) with the loss of just 25 merchant vessels.The Miles M.52 was a British project started in 1943 to produce a 1000mph aircraft, features of which actually contributed to the design and eventual success of the Bell X1 and was itself only cancelled after the war with Germany had ended.1936: Alan Turing presents the notion of a universal machine, later called the Turing machine, capable of computing anything that is computable.

As a result, some of the mechanism had to go beside the guns. This made their turrets unusually wide.They could not make the loading mechanism more compact because, while other navies put their propellant in silk bags, Germany insisted otherwise. The Bismarck’s guns used a ‘fore charge’ in a bag, and a ‘main charge’ in a brass casing. This made the loading mechanism unnecessarily large and complex.For smaller guns like the 11″ on the Scharnhorsts, they were able to make three-gun turrets, but even those were unsually wide. For the 15″ on the Bismarcks, it was, quite frankly, impossible for the Germans to design a three-gun turret that was not unreasonably wide.Just look at how much space was wasted in the Bismarck’s turret design, compared to Hood’s and Yamato’s.EDIT: Addition from the comments section.Jiro B Yamamoto:Answer:In comparison, other navies used interrupted screw breech blocks, which you can imagine as a big hunk of metal that fit into the breech of the gun, and was ingeniously designed to only take one-fifth of a turn to seal.

The British centimetric radar, H2S used the newly invented cavity magnetron to operate at 10 cm (3 GHz). Once H2S was salvaged from crashed aircraft, the Germans set about developing their own centimetric radar.The slow development of German radar was not due to technical ability but, as so often with the Nazi regime, to a lack of sensible prioritisation.","91,620 followers",Roland Bartetzko,12.8K,3.5K,314.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Love-Im-deeply-in-love-and-I-cant-stop-thinking-about-him-all-day-This-drives-me-crazy-How-can-I-stop-thinking-about-him-knowing-that-he-most-likely-doesnt-like-me-back-and-only-sees-me-as-a-friend-sister
37,"I will try to answer your question in simpler terms. The Swordfish crew who infamously jammed the rudder of the Bismarck were flying so low that the AA-gunners on the ship weren’t able to depress their guns enough.The Swordfish pilots came in through heavy anti-aircraft fire, choppy waves and heavy seas to get to their target.

The first one provides mainly infantry transport, ammunition carriers, command vehicles, scout vehicles, self-propelled 105 mm artillery and light tanks (although there might be vehicles of all types absed on the design). The second provides self-propelled anti-tank guns and 155 mm artillery guns, anti-air armored vehicles and about half of all tanks. The heavy vehicle provides the Universal Tank, broadly similar to the Panther, or T-34 with the major issues resolved.I also dispense with the vast number of calibers Germany used and use as few calibers as I can.This isn’t enough to allow Germany to win the war, but it greatly reduces one of their major issues, supplying their Scrapheap Challenge army with spare parts. Granted, the reason why Germany had a Scrapheap Challenge tank corps was understandable and it’s doubtful my plan can fully work. But that’s the most effective change that could be done.",0 followers,Kenneth Kasper,1.1K,2.9K,1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Love-Im-deeply-in-love-and-I-cant-stop-thinking-about-him-all-day-This-drives-me-crazy-How-can-I-stop-thinking-about-him-knowing-that-he-most-likely-doesnt-like-me-back-and-only-sees-me-as-a-friend-sister
