0,"The very hot stuff inside would stop fusion immediately. As such all the heat it has would be the heat stored in its mass. Since the mass of the hot plasma is relatively small compared to the mass of the housing and other components, all of the heat energy will be expended on slagging only a certain portion of the contaimnent. And one the heat energy is expended melting and slightly heating a portion of the containment, it stops.The same way a white hot nail if dropped into a swimming pool filled with cold water would have little overall effect on the average temp of the pool water.","220,634 followers",Franklin Veaux,677,47.3K,783.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-worst-case-scenario-in-a-meltdown-of-a-nuclear-fusion-reactor-knowing-that-its-temperature-can-be-up-to-70-million-degrees-centigrade-which-is-over-5-times-hotter-than-the-Sun
1,"There are no acknowledged nuclear fusion reactors. There are nuclear fission reactors.U235 is the only naturally occurring fissionable material. It consists of only 0.72% of all naturally occurring Uranium. U238 is a fertile material that can be made into fissionable Pu239 by causing it to absorb a neutron in a U235 reactor.

U238 is a fertile material that can be made into fissionable Pu239 by causing it to absorb a neutron in a U235 reactor. Th232 is a fertile material than can be made into fissionable U233 again through neutron absorption in a breeder type reactor. Thorium is more abundant than Uranium, and therefore more easily obtained. Nobelist Carlos Rubbia proposed a subcritical energy amplifier that consisted of a Thorium Core reactor that used a particle accelerator as a neutron source to create a safe reliable reactor.Hydrogen bombs use a compounding of Lithium-6 isotope, about 7.5% of natural Lithium, and Deuterium istope about 0.03% of natural hydrogen. Put these together and bombard them with neutrons and you get 270.15 Trillion Joules per kg of the stuff, which is far more than 82 TJ/kg of other materials. The other thing about this is you don’t have long lived actinide series products.Lithium-6 with a neutron source like Polonium or Pu238 source of alpha particles illuminating Beryllium foil, or a particle accelerator that makes neutrons on demand, yield 77.2 TJ/kg on demand in a subcritical reactor. This is relatively clean process producing helium and tritium. The tritium yields 1.061 kW/kg of radioisotpe output over a 12.32 year half life. The tritium emits an electron and turns into Helium-3 which is another fusion source.Since there is not a large amount of fusion fuel inside current fusion reactor designs, there is no way for fusion reactors to melt down. In fact, in a properly designed fission reactors, there is no way for them to melt down either.For example, in the ROVER and NERVA nuclear rocket reactor, the engine contained a subcritical amount of fissile material that was covered with a neutron reflecting blanket. That blanket was built like louvers in a window that varied the number of neutrons that could be reflected. When the louvers are closed the neutron flux was very high. When louvers are open, neutron flux is below break even. In a run away event, the louvers automatically open, stopping the reaction. Should that break down, the journal bearing holding the louvers in place melt first causing them to fall off, leaving the subcritical mass naked, and it quickly cools down.Subcritical Energy Amplifiers work the same way by introducing a neutron flux to a reactive energy multiplying element.Inertial confinement fusion reactors detonate small pellets of fusion fuel to pro...","2,796 followers",Frank Popa,946,9.2K,4.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-worst-case-scenario-in-a-meltdown-of-a-nuclear-fusion-reactor-knowing-that-its-temperature-can-be-up-to-70-million-degrees-centigrade-which-is-over-5-times-hotter-than-the-Sun

Most fission reactors use ordinary, light water. That includes probably all U.S. reactors and the infamous Fukushima Daichii which others have talked about. These reactors rely on enriched uranium, usually to four or five percent U-235, which can be made to reach criticality more easily than natural uranium.Heavy (deuterium) water reactors, such as the Canadian designed CANDU reactor, use natural uranium with only 0.7 percent U-235 content. They rely on heavy water to better moderate the reactions, allowing neutrons released in the chain reactions to slow down enough that they will be captured by the small proportion of U-235 atoms. I'm no expert, but my understanding is that any fission reactions would quickly dissipate if regular water were used inside such a reactor. There would be no criticality, no chain reaction, and the uranium rods would just sit there mostly inert.In short, the answer is that ordinary water could not be substituted for heavy water in heavy water reactors. Nothing much would happen and not much heat, and therefore electricity, would be generated.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

It can sieve particles smaller than an atom. Acquiring the ability to separate particles smaller than an atom using a membrane at room temperature was unthinkable even to me not long ago. Such graphene filters could enable low cost production of Deuterium for a fusion ship.Graphene was discovered by Nobel laureates and professors Andre Geim and Kostya Novoselov at Manchester University in 2004 and has astonished the world of materials science with its range of unusual characteristics, such as its atomic-scale thinness, extreme strength and high electrical conductivity.A novel property of graphene is its ability to filter the different atomic isotopes of hydrogen, namely tritium and deuterium, from ordinary hydrogen[1].The rare form of hydrogen, deuterium, is only present in nature in very small amounts. For every 6,420 hydrogen atoms, there is just one atom of deuterium, and increasing the concentration of deuterium to produce Deuterium by conventional methods is somewhat intensive and expensive.The Manchester researchers showed that graphene can act as a simple filter by slowing down the movement of deuterium through a membrane made of graphene and its sister material, boron nitride. Ordinary hydrogen atoms passed straight through the sieve, but deuterium is effectively blocked.Mankind currently possesses impure practical Inertial Confinement Fission-Fusion (ICF) technology which could be directly employed to build fusion powered ships.DD fusion of pure Deuterium is not a practical fusion reaction for Magnetic Confinement Fusion reactors trying to reach and exceed break-even energy but is a practical fusion reaction for producing useful fusion energy with energy gain in ICF fusion reactors which operate with fusion plasma that is literally 10^11 times more dense than the plasma used in tokamak experiments like ITER.(more information)[1] -","29,973 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.7K,249.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-worst-case-scenario-in-a-meltdown-of-a-nuclear-fusion-reactor-knowing-that-its-temperature-can-be-up-to-70-million-degrees-centigrade-which-is-over-5-times-hotter-than-the-Sun

From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that thereI used to work on fusion simulation codes (particle in cell) with the US National Labs when I was at NVIDIA, and I was very interested in seeing if we could solve the problems with fusion and picked the scientist and engineers' brains endlessly. My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-worst-case-scenario-in-a-meltdown-of-a-nuclear-fusion-reactor-knowing-that-its-temperature-can-be-up-to-70-million-degrees-centigrade-which-is-over-5-times-hotter-than-the-Sun

You see fissile material undergoes reactions proportional to the radius cubed (the volume), but it loses neutrons proportional to the square (the surface area).

As you make the chunk larger, the amount that react goes up faster than the amount that leave, so when you get to a certain size, around 7 kilograms for plutonium, 50kg for U235, the reaction can run on its own.   Those are the minimum amounts of fissile material you can get to react by themselves.  You can cut this amount down by a factor of eight or so by special tricks, like compressing the heck out of the material and surrounding it with lots of reflexive material, but that's impractical for anything other than a bomb.So a small nuclear reactor, not possible.   The smallest one I know of is the one that was put in an airplane, and that one was still like 20 tons, and it only had minimal shielding, on the side towards the cockpit.   On all the other sides, it was emitting 30,000 rads per second, fatal to anything within a mile or two.   The radiation was so high, that just the forward scattering into the air in front of the cockpit required a windshield that was 10 inches thick.The smallest bomb we know of was the ""Davy Crockett"" backpack munition, about 25 kilos.  Again, not practical for powering anything.Well there is another possibility, you can take nuclear waste and refine out some short-lived isotopes which have fantastic amounts of radioactivity, so they naturally get like orange-hot-- you can use the heat to heat up some thermocouples and that will generate SMALL amounts of electricity.  That's the power source for like interstellar probes like Voyager.    But those are not very practical, the radioactivity is just insane.

Submarines, aircraft carriers, and some Russian icebreakers, are powered this way.Small modular reactors for terrestrial use are in development and several are going to be built within the next 5 years. How well these perform will will have to be determined.","46,129 followers",Steven Haddock,1.1K,25.6K,343.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Would-the-heavy-deuterium-water-to-keep-a-nuclear-fusion-power-plant-running-need-to-be-purified-or-could-the-plant-be-fed-raw-ocean-water
14,"Micro nuclear reactor: No. There are already answers describing why it is impossible.Thermonuclear battery (mostly using self-heating alpha-emitting material) or Beta-battery (another answer explains how it works): Yes. Principally. The thermonuclear battery generates small amount of electricity by having self-heating plates of, e.g. plutonium, and isolating plates, and thermal-pair wires similar to those in your digital thermometers. We can imagine, that in some future we may have thermonuclear batteries, nowadays used in space crafts, to be also used down here for powering small loads in farMicro nuclear reactor: No. There are already answers describing why it is impossible.Thermonuclear battery (mostly using self-heating alpha-emitting material) or Beta-battery (another answer explains how it works): Yes.

We can imagine, that in some future we may have thermonuclear batteries, nowadays used in space crafts, to be also used down here for powering small loads in faraway places - e.g. autonomous weather stations. I can’t imagine them running a significant load, like a vehicle, I don’t think it will be economic considering the need for a shielding and physical protection against impact in case of vehicle accident. And definitely not for small hand-held devices, again because of the shielding weight and the risk of contamination if the small device is lost or smashed.",0 followers,Richard Meakin,3K,751,11.4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Would-the-heavy-deuterium-water-to-keep-a-nuclear-fusion-power-plant-running-need-to-be-purified-or-could-the-plant-be-fed-raw-ocean-water
15,"Energy Return on (energy) Investment (EROI) is a fundamental thermodynamic metric applied to power generation, measuring relative inputs and outputs.Life-cycle analysis, focused on energy, is useful for comparing net energy yields from different methods of electricity generation.Nuclear power shows up very well as a net provider of energy, and only hydro electricity is nearly comparable.Source:Energy Return on (energy) Investment (EROI) is a fundamental thermodynamic metric applied to power generation, measuring relative inputs and outputs.Life-cycle analysis, focused on energy, is useful for comparing net energy yields from different methods of electricity generation.Nuclear power shows up very well as a net provider of energy, and only hydro electricity is nearly comparable.Source:",0 followers,Jan Meyer,683,20.3K,14.8M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Would-the-heavy-deuterium-water-to-keep-a-nuclear-fusion-power-plant-running-need-to-be-purified-or-could-the-plant-be-fed-raw-ocean-water
