Even if not, this is still a major step forward towards generating organs to order, without fear of rejection. Even if the heart is rejected and the donor dies, what we learn from the process will enable us to succeed the next time. I reckon this will become the mainstream way we get spare parts by the end of the decade in an optimistic scenario, by the end of the next decade in the pessimistic one.Either way, the moment is as groundbreaking as December 3rd, 1967, when the first human heart ever was transplanted, ushering the era of organ transplants of today.

The population size and swquestration of so much of the available resources is a singular event in the history of life.If humans went extinct, the necessary environmental catastrophe (whether self-inflicted or not) would be a major extinction event. There is no way to predict whether rats, cockroaches or dolphins would be around, or anything except prokaryotes perhaps.The evolution of humans had some specific steps that combined to form the behaviourally flexible tool-using social species we are. These steps had to occur in a certain sequence out of many possible. Only one such species has persisted to now.The evolution of sociality and the arboreal primate form was crucial. That gave the advantages of cooperative activity and feet with claws modified into nails, elongated fingers/toes and opposable thumbs adapted for climbing. This enabled bipedality under a selective pressure to become more terrestrial.Some bipedal forms returned to quadrupedality (chimpanzee lineage) and a semi-arboreal lifestyle. Some became fully bipedal, fully freeing the hands from locomotion. The terrestrial lifestyle meant increased reliance on hunting. This made cooperation a selective advantage. Cooperation depended on good communication. And from communication came language.From the use of hands came tool-using. Fine motor skills became a selective advantage.Tool-using, cooperative hunting, communication, fine motor skills and higher energy food supply drove increased brain size and increased intelligence.It would require a similar set of traits and a similar genetic starting point, a similar sequence of enironmental change and a similar operation of chance to produce a similar species to humans. Not impossible, but not likely.And perhaps not necessary.
