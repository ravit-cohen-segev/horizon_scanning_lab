But since the demand is so clear, there has been tremendous effort on this front as well. The technological advancement in my opinion, hasn't been that great. To see this, one only need to compare Moore's law and current battery status.The current ""state-of-the-art"" commercial battery is Lithium-ion batteries. Which has been around since 1970s, both the most common materials for anode and cathode (LiCoO2 and graphite) have been around late 70s also. It is quite amazing howThere are a lot of competing ""next-generation"" battery technologies, which one is the best depends on who do you ask. Li-S and Li-Air you  mentioned are of course among them. This is a few comparison images I found on Google image, it is funny to note that different sources show different best types:This one showing Li-S and Li-polymer to be the best:This one showing Li-S the best, and highlighting current Li-S status:This one saying Li-metal the best (which is the technology my company is working on):Bottom line:Bottom line:It's the same story in multiple industries, we simply do not know the future:",UNKNOWN,DurgaPrasad (దుర్గా ప్రసాద్),546,183,3.5M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Who-is-leading-the-way-with-the-latest-and-most-advanced-technology-for-mobile-phone-batteries

These built-in batteries do not require a back panel, meaning that less space is needed inside the gadget and smartphones can be made much thinner.● Smartphones look more stylish and modern, and are very lightweight.● The in-built battery also made it possible to make a waterproof phone.● Also, in-built batteries are better for your protection. Suppose someone stole your phone. With the battery removed from the inside and without that removable back panel, it is difficult to obtain, making it difficult for the thief to deactivate the tracking features.

4,"Fast forward to June 2016. Phones are now gigantic and still can’t last a day. I am looking forward to a day when there is an SUV equivalent of a mobile phone. I think the reason why the bigger battery approach doesn’t sell well is because they don’t go far enough. Offering 20–30% more battery life as a key selling point is weak. How about offering 3X the battery life. That would sell. Battery size is the #1 spec I look for, and battery life is usually the main reason I even look to upgrade my phone.

If you buttoned up that package with 100% charge, and it was destined to sit in a crate, in a warehouse, on a shelf, etc. for several months or more, there would be small bits of low-level damage to that battery, particularly if the warehouse was hot.Li-ion cells also have a self-discharge rate of about 2–3% per month, perhaps more depending on how “off” the phone actually is when off. So you’re not going to see the charge level that box buttoned up with, you’re seeing the result of a few months of transit and perhaps storage.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Who-is-leading-the-way-with-the-latest-and-most-advanced-technology-for-mobile-phone-batteries

One form consists of a circular pipe enclosing a helix and inclined at an angle of about 45 degrees to the horizontal with its lower end dipped in the water; rotation of the device causes the water to rise in the pipe. Other forms consist of a helix revolving in a fixed cylinder or a helical tube wound around a shaft.The Archimedes Screw is still used today in some limited applications (usually electrically-powered), and can range in size from a quarter of an inch to nearly 4 meters (12 feet) in diameter. A large screw or banks of screws may be used to pump rainstorm runoff or to lift water or wastewater, for example.2.THE BATTERY-The Baghdad Battery, sometimes referred to as the Parthian Battery, is a clay pot which encapsulates a copper cylinder. Suspended in the centre of this cylinder but not touching it is an iron rod. Both the copper cylinder and the iron rod are held in place with an asphalt plug. These artifacts (more than one was found) were discovered during the 1936 excavations of the old village Khujut Rabu, near Baghdad. The village is considered to be about 2000 years old, and was built during the Parthian period (250BC to 224 AD). Although it is not known exactly what the use of such a device would have been, the name ‘Baghdad Battery’, comes from one of the prevailing theories established in 1938 when Wilhelm Konig, the German archaeologist who performed the excavations, examined the battery and concluded that this device was an ancient electric battery. After the Second World War, Willard Gray, an American working at the General Electric High Voltage Laboratory in Pittsfield, built replicas and, filling them with an electrolyte, found that the devices could produce 2 volts of electricity. The question remains, if it really was a battery, what was it used to power?3. THE CALENDAR-Research carried out last year on an ancient site excavated by the National Trust for Scotland in 2004 revealed that it contained a sophisticated calendar system that is approximately 10,000 years old, making it the oldest calendar ever discovered in the world. The site at Warren Field, Crathes, Aberdeenshire – contains a 50 metre long row of twelve pits which were created by Stone Age Britons and which were in use from around 8000 BC (the early Mesolithic period) to around 4,000 BC (the early Neolithic). The pits represent the months of the year as well as the lunar phases of the moon. They were formed in a complex arc design in which each lunar month was divided into three roughly ten day weeks representing the waxing moon, the full moon and the waning moon. It also allowed the observation of the mid-winter sunrise so that the lunar calendar could be recalibrated each year to bring it back in line with the solar year. The entire arc represents a whole year and may also reflect the movements of the moon across the sky.4.STEAM ENGINE-Heron Alexandrinus, otherwise known as the Hero of Alexandria, was a 1st century Greek mathematician and engineer who is known as the first inventor of the steam engine. His steam powered device was called the aeolipile, named after Aiolos, God of the winds. The aeolipile consisted of a sphere positioned in such a way that it could rotate around its axis. Nozzles opposite each other would expel steam and both of the nozzles would generate a combined thrust resulting in torque, causing the sphere to spin around its axis. The rotation force sped up the sphere up to the point where the resistance from traction and air brought it to a stable rotation speed. The steam was created by boiling water under the sphere – the boiler was connected to the rotating sphere through a pair of pipes that at the same time served as pivots for the sphere.Some old steam engines are still used in certain areas of the world and in antique locomotives. However, steam power is still heavily used around the world in various applications. Many modern electrical plants use steam generated by burning coal to produce electricity.5.Earthquake Detector 132 A D -Earthquake Detector 132 A D According to court records of the later Han Dynasty, a seismograph was created by the brilliant inventor Zhang Heng (78-140 AD) in 132 AD. Its function is to determine the direction of an earthquake. In 138 AD, this instrument indicated an earthquake occurring in Longxi a thousand kilometers away. It was the first time that mankind to detect an earthquake. Modern seismographs only began development in 1848 in Europe.6.Paper Money 9th century A.D.-Paper money were first developed by the ancient Chinese, who started using folding money at the end of the 8th or beginning of the 9th century AD. Paper bills were originally used as privately issued bills of credit or exchange notes. A merchant could deposit his cash in the capital, receiving a paper “exchange certificate” which he could exchange for metal coins in other cities.Thanks for scrolling,Sandip bhatnagar.",719 followers,Sandip Bhatnagar,629,321,1.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Who-is-leading-the-way-with-the-latest-and-most-advanced-technology-for-mobile-phone-batteries

In two perspectives, the first one internal.Now for the aesthetic changes or what I call cosmetic changes.Now where does this all lead to, if the answer isn't obvious from the points mentioned above, then read them again. The smartphone of today has slowly started replacing individual items of technology which we used on daily basis. It has slowly taken over multiple devices and started to merge them into a single identity. The first industry to take a hot from this was the portable music player market, the market is currently extinct with almost no one using a specialized device for listening to music. Smartphones engulfed this market and emerged on top of it. Take the tablet market for example, this market is currently on the brink of extinction. This is due to the sole fact the smartphones have replaced them completely. The next market is declining rapidly is of the consumer camera market. The point and shoot digital cameras are slowly phasing out of existence. The next thing to phase out would be the entry level DSLR'S. Followed by the laptop industry. I personally don't remember the last time I used a flash drive. Well this is the case for most Androids. The huge internal storage serves as flash drive. Media consumption has never been higher than what it is now on the smartphone. Basic instruments which needed to be individually carried around are now integrated into the phone.So where is the smartphone industry heading, I don't know exactly but I can make huge speculation based on the trend that we see today. It's going towards a singularity. A singular device for all your needs. Be it work, gaming, photography, music, videos or any other thing that encompasses the general requirements. So I can safely say, in the not so distant future, everyone will have one device for all their tasks.",21 followers,Jeff Nelson,1K,1.6K,23M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-types-of-advanced-technology-are-used-in-map-marking-today

When it becomes reasonably safe, people will absolutely elect to use it to improve their children. Yes, we may make mistakes. We may create too many blond blue-eyed children.

The “beautiful people” will be able to have all beautiful children. Right now, there is just a slight increase in those odds. Working class people may work hard their whole lives to pay to make their offspring have superior advantages. That’s all basic human nature. Eventually, there will be laws that limit the types of things you can do for your babies. In my current novel project, all men are exactly 6′ 4″ because that is the maximum allowed by law. But women are sometimes less than the maximum 6′ because people have figured out that smaller women look younger.","68,778 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Who-is-leading-the-way-with-the-latest-and-most-advanced-technology-for-mobile-phone-batteries
24,"Designer babies are bad science fiction.We have around 20,000 genes in our genomes. Altering one or may be two is difficult to achieve in a safe way using the latest editing technology. Assuming you want to modify traits, then it’s a case of not simply ablating a gene but changing specific amino acids in several genes. That can be done though not particularly efficiently and not without risk. Most human traits are comprised of many genes that interact in ways that are very poorly understood. Tweaking one or two isn’t likely to make much difference and is more likely than not to cause deleterioDesigner babies are bad science fiction.We have around 20,000 genes in our genomes.

Tweaking one or two isn’t likely to make much difference and is more likely than not to cause deleterious effects.What is much more likely is correction of known single gene defects that have a dominant, negative effect such as in genes for CFTR or dystrophin which cause cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy, respectively. Such gene corrections could be life saving though it is also worth noting that longevity of people with the most severe CFTR mutations has increased dramatically and may soon approach normal life span - due to advances in therapeutics and early diagnosis (though there are still life modifying effects).Hence, genetic modification of the germ-line (e.g. pre-implantation embryos) is possible for one or possibly two genes but ethically and practically is a bad idea. Not to mention that designer mentalities harbour on eugenic madness.As an aside, truly great to see the 2020 Nobel Prize in chemistry going to Drs.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Who-is-leading-the-way-with-the-latest-and-most-advanced-technology-for-mobile-phone-batteries

She turned to me and said, “Do you have washing machines in Scotland?” Obviously, I was forced to admit, that no we didn’t. Instead we just went down to the river and bashed our clothes off rocks to clean them.2) Transport - I spent two weeks in the lovely town of Columbia. Missouri. There I amazed the locals with my insistence on using a strange outmoded form of transport known as “walking”. Locals would slow down as they passed in their modern cars, pointing and laughing. To them, it must have been like watching a live action version of the Flintstones.3) Voting – would you believe it, but in the UK we still vote by drawing a little X next to the candidate we want to vote for. No sign of the advanced electronic voting they have over in the states. Indeed, we are so old fashioned that we haven’t even outsourced our voting to the Russians yet!4) Guns – It may be hard for an American to believe but almost nobody in the UK owns their own guns. This means that if we have to rise up and overthrow our own government (currently seems like a good plan) then we will be armed with nothing more than some particularly well sharpened sarcasm.Still, perhaps one day we can hope to be as advanced as the US. And there is some hope, as we now have our very own version of Donald Trump as PM!4K","1,418 followers",Shubhojit Chattopadhyay,7.2K,119,1.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Who-is-leading-the-way-with-the-latest-and-most-advanced-technology-for-mobile-phone-batteries
