Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party. Because radiation from nuclear accidents is apparently scarier than way more people dying of regular pollution constantly and the total annihilation of all life on Earth as the oceans boil away.","4,701 followers",Anton Taiki,1.6K,4.4K,30.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-country-is-the-most-advanced-technologi-use-in-farming-food

Usually, in any culture, the more nationalistic and naïve a person is, the more overconfident they tend to be when it comes to the capabilities of their armed forces.I don’t doubt that a fair number of Russians think their military could defeat that of the United States. Perhaps they don’t know enough about the U.S. armed forces, or about warfare.First, it would be just about impossible for either country to invade the other and get even a foothold. People fighting in their own country to defend it from invasion are more motivated, know the places they’re fighting better, and have much shorter supply lines and simpler logistics, especially when they’re thousands of miles apart.This is the point where someone starts talking about NATO being a sinister cabal created to conquer Russia. Well, that’s wrong, for multiple reasons - the two best are, first, that an offensive war against Russia would be a violation of NATO’s organizing charter and most NATO members would refuse to support it. Second, even if the U.S. was foolish enough to send most of our Army, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy to attack Russia, thereby making them unavailable to do anything else, it would be impossible to keep them supplied once the shooting started. That’s a long way for a high-volume sustained logistical system.Second, I don’t think most of the population in either country would want to fight such a war. In the U.S. that would be enough to shut the idea down right there. Russia’s government is a lot less responsive to pressure from the population, but they aren’t immune either.But for the sake of the hypothetical, let’s posit that the armed forces of the two nations collide and end up fighting in some other place that’s equally challenging for them both to get to. In this case, to Russians who thought their military could defeat the U.S. in anything except insurgent mode, I’d ask them to look at the American military’s ridiculously huge budget, the superior training and equipment, the strong leadership by NCOs and officers, the greater population base to draw on, the cultural factors that make it easier to blend Americans from different places in a single unit (just having a common language is a good start), the vast reservoir of combat experience American ground and air combat elements have gained over the last two-plus decades, the U.S. having an existing network of bases in much of the world,To anyone in either country who thought the other would be easy to overrun, I’d point out some basic military math: for an attacker to overcome even a hastily prepared defense, the attacker needs to outnumber the defender by 3–1 or more - that requirement goes up if you’re going to fight in cities, mountains, forests, swamps, or other places where the environment favors the defense.So for either Russia or the U.S. to try to conquer the other would be a fool’s errand.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,12.7K,996,155.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-country-is-the-most-advanced-technologi-use-in-farming-food
