The pain of compile time on these builds is so great that Google has invented build tools that separate the dependency analysis and compiling, just to gain a few per cent in build time using conventional languages. Go is designed for quick compilation without the need for dependency checking, so it addresses the build pain.Google’s other problem is string processing. Google reads and analyzes a lot of web pages, which are text files. They do a lot of string manipulation, so it pays for this to be really efficient. Google built a rich library of string functions into Go, Garbage collecting makes strings in Go simple to think about, and efficient in ways some other string libraries are not (I’m talking toEverybody thinks they’re a language designer. Microsoft and Apple had their own languages, (Apple has two these days). Google decided they needed their own, I guess. Then Facebook joined the proprietary language party, leaving only poor homely Amazon alone at the language dance. As a language design, Go is not unreasonable. It does what it says on the tin. It’s not in any way innovative, but certainly well designed for a very specific use.Go has good concurrency support, which is essential for a language designed after 2002, and for companies who have a million servers waiting to be spun up. But it’s not breaking new ground in concurrency.Go = C + strings + garbage collection + concurrency. If you want to build really big programs to analyze the whole freakin’ internet, Go would be a pretty good choice for you.Thanks for all the upvotes.","44,293 followers",Kurt Guntheroth,10.3K,13.7K,167.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-kind-of-training-do-Google-or-other-top-technology-companies-give-to-make-sure-their-employees-say-things-in-the-way-that-are-not-going-to-make-other-people-feel-unsafe-or-unwelcome

My hair is falling out.”I was 23 years old and six months into a demanding sales job at General Electric, and I was failing hard.To get this job, I had to convince an executive to pull me off of a leadership program twelve months early.I wanted to live in Chicago where my friends were and a position opened up. The only problem was that I was about to move to Atlanta for my third rotation. Impatient and ready to move up in my career, I made my play.I went to the executive responsible for the Chicago territory and made my impassioned case. He had an open position, I was ready now and if he waited until I went to Atlanta, some other executive would get me and all of the great results I would deliver.He agreed to make a case to pull me off the program and into a direct territory but did so with a warning.“You will be treated like any other sales rep. If you can’t generate business, you will be replaced like anyone else. Are you sure you are ready?”“Of course. Let’s go!”I wasn’t ready.It was a battle not to piss my pants while he was giving me that warning. I had no idea how to sell, had no customers to start with and only a rudimentary understanding of the technology I was selling.But, I got what I wanted. I was the new sales rep in Chicago.Determined to prove my manager smart for giving me the opportunity, I put in ridiculous hours.I made lists of targets for hours. I wrote out cold call scripts. I practiced my elevator pitch. I read scores of sales books and like a college kid, wrote a book summary on every one.I prepared all night and then called customers from 8AM to 5PM, just hoping to get someone live. I quickly learned that cold voice messages were a waste of time.Then I learned that live people weren’t much better. I stuttered my way through calls, sounding like the inexperienced kid I was.The nice ones said no and hung up. The rest chewed me out to make sure I didn’t ever call again.I grew to like the angry people more. At least they weren’t patronizing and I actually kept them on the phone longer.I wasn’t sleeping at all. I laid in bed thinking about getting fired. I thought about telling my parents that I got fired from the job they were so proud of me for getting in the first place.I thought about how I would pay the rent. Even a shitty garden apartment in someone’s basement is expensive in Chicago and I wouldn’t make it four weeks without a paycheck. I thought about moving back home to live with mom and dad.Mainly, I just thought about being a failure.Every week, I jumped on a conference call hosted by my manager. I always went last because I was the rookie.This meant that I had the pleasure of listening to 20 other sales reps talk about the deals they were chasing. Big deals, exciting deals, strategy. I listened to my manager’s voice get louder and more excited when a rep talked about a new opportunity to chase.I wondered what it would be like to chase a big deal and close it. The call had camaraderie, with reps congratulating each other on big successes. They would give each other advice or mention they would call each other after the call to talk strategy.What were they talking about? Were there secrets I didn’t know?Then my manager would call out my name.“Ian, what are you chasing this week?”I would take my phone off mute and say the same thing every week.“Uh, hey Bob. Nothing new to report this week.”“OK. Keep hustling buddy.”“You bet.”I would hit mute and imagine what all the other sales reps were saying about me.Did they feel bad for me because I sucked? Were they gloating that Bob should have hired a more experienced rep? Were the guys in Detroit making bets on how much longer I would last? What were my odds to make it until Christmas?I responded by working longer hours but I was calling less customers all the time. I was paralyzed by the size of the challenge.Every week, I thought about calling my boss and giving him my resignation along with an apology for letting him down. He was a great boss and patient, but I never wanted to let him know how I was feeling, especially after how confidently I pitched myself for the job.This led to my hair starting to fall out in clumps. I was 23 and my hair was falling out because of stress. What the hell?After one particularly embarrassing conference call where Bob asked me a few probing questions about prospects and got nothing as usual, I was despondent. I got off the phone and thought about how I would get fired. Would he call me or make me fly to his office in St. Louis?My phone rang. It wasn’t my boss.It was Don, our top sales rep in Kansas City.I met Don when I was on the training program and spent two days traveling with him to visit customers. Don was 65 years old and one of the most genuine dudes I ever met.He was polite, thoughtful, soft spoken and completely void of ego. He was the opposite of the stereotype of a typical sales person.He didn’t need to work but just loved the job. As a sales rep, he was money in the bank. He led the company every year and hustled like he was at the bottom. He was worried about me.“Hey Ian, are you OK?”I didn’t attempt to lie.“No, Don. I don’t think I can do this.”“Why?”“I look at everything you have going and I am so far away. I can’t even get one order and I need hundreds.”“Well, do you think I started with hundreds of orders?”“No.”“It started with one customer saying yes. Actually, it started with hundreds of customers saying no. I wouldn’t be here if I had a plan to get to hundreds of customers. My plan was to get one.”“OK. How do I get one?”““Think small?”“Yes, you are overwhelmed with the size of the challenge but you can’t do it all tomorrow.I am still grateful for that phone call. It meant everything to me that someone at the top took time to reach out and help.Kindness knocked me out of my funk and my resilience strengthened. I took his advice seriously.I focused on having one great day at a time. Five great days turned into two great weeks and my first great month. I started to land more appointments after two months of this approach.Then, my first customer said yes. I had my first order!Who did I call first?My mom, of course.But, then I called Don. I still remember how proud he was on the other end of that phone. I thanked him for his greatest sale, giving me confidence.That order led to more confidence and I could tell other prospects about my customer. That social proof and confidence led to more sales and I kept focusing on one good day at a time.Two years later, I was pushing Don for top sales though he never gave up that title. More importantly, I was sleeping and my hair stopped falling out.If you are struggling with resilience, focus on the smallest step you can take. Even a small step takes you closer to your goal.If you want to lose weight, start with one great day. Do you want to quit smoking? Make it through one day. Do you need to pay off debt? Tighten up your spending tomorrow first. If you want to have a great year at work, start with one great day.If that doesn’t work, find a Don. You need someone who has been there, can see if you are on the right path and give you the confidence that the road you are on leads somewhere worth following.My stress and lack of resilience was never about the work. It was about my misunderstanding that the work would never lead to a result.If you see some struggling in your office, take a minute and offer your help.Be good to each other.Be a Don.",173 followers,Ryan Gilpatric,7K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-kind-of-training-do-Google-or-other-top-technology-companies-give-to-make-sure-their-employees-say-things-in-the-way-that-are-not-going-to-make-other-people-feel-unsafe-or-unwelcome

Two containers in particular have a very impressive flush when the smaller is pushed into the larger. I was in fact so impressed by this that I took said containers to work the following day to show my colleagues this particular example of fine plastic manufacturing.But they just weren't that interested, I think it's because they have kids.

It was dreadful. They were using data that was years out of date, they didn't have job categories which were essential to us, and they were just grossly inept.I was racing to hire rare and valuable network engineers, and hitting this giant brick wall of ""what's a network engineer"" and ""oh, that's like an IT network admin"" - with pay scale at about 1/3rd of market.There was eventually a meeting, to discuss why we were so far behind on our hiring plan, attended by me, the local HR team, and some brass from Houston. Someone made the fateful mistake of asking me how well the HR team was supporting me.My response was classic:It was 100% accurate, and did get me the process changes I needed, which basically amounted to me saying ""make an offer at $x plus relocation"" and HR saying ""before or after lunch today?""Anyway, I digress.There's far too much emphasis on cost management and litigation abatement. Thus, every Node.js programmer with a four year degree and five to seven years of experience ""bins out"" as a Senior Developer 2 with an average base salary of $106k plus regional variance of X%. If the guy you're trying to hire comes from an organization where he's making say 50% more than that, and you need him to relocate to a more expensive location so that his ""felt disposable income"" remains on par, you're boned.

There's a good reason for those sorts of things, and yes, I deeply believe in equal pay for equal work, and for hiring for maximum diversity, and frankly hiring people that others pass on because they don't fit some pre-conceived ""mold"" but exhibit superior talent and ability.In my experience, employees at any stage of company life are critical. You need the best people you can get, and you need to compensate them based onThat said, as a founder, and turn-around CEO, you have to watch the bottom line as well, so it turns into this interesting optimization game: what's theThen you get back to the whole ""fairness"" thing. If I've got a high-demand skilled professional with regular job offers from others, what I need to pay him is a bigger number than it would be for another guy who looks like to the untrained eye like ""the same guy doing the same job"" but whoBecause people aren't plug compatible. They're unique, individual, having unique strengths and weaknesses, skills and deficits. But ""process"" doesn't account for that. ""Process"" has to assume uniformity, because otherwise, it breaks down.I get the need to drive for uniform process. It completely shields you from any potential liability from any one you didn't hire, or anyone who discovers that they're making less than a peer who is the same ""on paper"", or any number of other HR foibles.But it just doesn't work. Not for real people, in the real world.Experienced leaders know that, and don't tolerate it. When I see it, I know exactly what's going on in that organization.

I went with her and sat in their main office while the work was done.I remember looking around there and watching them work, thinking how much I would love to work somewhere like that. I really felt it was somewhere I could fit in. As I left, I told one of the partners this, and he told me to pass my exams and he would give me a job. Sure enough, three years later I was working at the company.About six months in, I was starting to really struggle to handle the workload. My productivity in the office wasn't as high as my colleagues. I contacted my Disability Employment Advisor, who arranged to come and meet with my two bosses Peter and Chris. Peter was out of the office when she arrived, and Chris was always looking for a way to make extra money. She told him about a scheme, which meant that the Employment Service would pay a percentage of my wages to cover the shortfall of productivity. Chris jumped at the chance. He was all ready to set it up, when Peter arrived back in the office.My Disability Employment Advisor filled Peter in. He replied, “it's ok, we don't need the money, I'm more than happy to pay Zoe's wages.” I think at that point, Chris nearly fell over! He tried to get Peter to change his mind, but Peter just kept reiterating that he was more than happy with this way things were.this was about 20 years ago, I've had two jobs since then, and since 2004 been unable to work.

I can't remember the exact system used but each personality type had a color associated with it and in the process of learning about your own type you learned about the other personality types and traits for how the take in information, relate it back to the world, etc. The goal is to make you aware that not everyone thinks like you and to be able to effectively work with others (not even lead) you should build an ability to spot key differences between yourself and those around you and how you may have to adapt to work effectively with them.The breakdown is the formal course teaches you about your personality type, other personality types, how to modulate to work best with others, understanding yourself and group dynamics for stressful situations, and getting to know other people in your company who are on a similar path.It's worth spelling out that the topics they cover are the tactics for leadership but not the overall strategy of what it means to provide leadership. Most of the best learning that happens around that is through mentorship by people wiser than yourself and years of trying and failing at different facets of it.
