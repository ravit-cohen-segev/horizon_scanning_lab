1,"There is a finite limit of wealth, ergo land, factories, products, stuff in general. If you developed or invented the most fabulous thing ever created, it in itself can only be valued to the limits of what people are willing to pay. Nothing can be so valuable enough to attract all the value of the world. You still have to eat everyday. Inflation is caused by debasing the value of money. Remember pictures of people using wheelbarrows of money to buy bread. That happens when governments print more money then the market can receive so the value eg purchasing power goes down.

Furthermore, modern biochemistry hasn't even the dumbest clue how hard it is for life to get started or how hard it is for it to survive once it has. So if we assume that it is astronomically unlikely for life to begin or to survive, this balances out the astronomically large number of opportunities for it to have.We may be the only ones here.Aliens exist but tend to not be very advancedThere is the notion of thePerhaps it's very rare to evolve beyond unicellular life or to develop much intelligence or to survive the invention of nuclear weapons. If getting beyond these stages was not hard enough, there are many existential threats that could wipe life out at any stage of development: geothermal cataclysms, celestial impact, green house effects, star death, gamma ray bursts, nuclear or biological warfare.Aliens exist but have not found usSpace is very large, so maybe the aliens that exist have not had enough time to see us. Our radio waves have traversed a couple hundred light years. It will be another 120,000 years before they have reached all of the milky way -- nevermind other galaxies. So unless aliens are either very near to us or using telescopes so powerful that they can see early hominids in detail, they will have no way to know of our existence.Aliens exist, have found us but can't quickly reach usPerhaps they are very near to us and have seen evidence of our existence, but have found faster-than-light travel to be an intractable problem. If this is the case, it would still take them hundreds of years to get to us depending on how far they are and how long their embarkation was after our first broadcast. If they are very near to us in technological advancement, they may not even have the means of getting here.Aliens exist, know of us, can get to us but do not care toThere are many reasons why this might be the case. Their culture, politics or preoccupations may inform this decision, but it's likely that they are so far beyond us technologically as to leave little incentive for them to bother with us as we have nothing to offer them. People frequently underestimate how high the technological ceiling sits. SeeAliens are all around usAnts are no strangers to our kitchen counters; they may know the layout and nuances better than we do. However, they probably don't attribute the stoneware to the design of higher agents such as ourselves. Like the eclipses we cast and our smelly earthquakes, they may not be able to distinguish the workings of man from nature itself.So mayn't we be similarly blind? Who's to say that we could recognize alien intelligence and technology if we saw it? At the very least, their probes may have drifted unnoticed under our noses. At the very most, their workings may be infused into our very reality -- if they are especially advanced.",1 follower,Kirk Scott,1.3K,13.4K,68.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-we-suppose-we-haven-t-been-visited-by-aliens-when-it-is-possible-that-possibly-being-millions-of-years-more-advanced-technologically-they-have-figured-out-a-way-to-overcome-the-barrier-of-the-speed-of-light

All hypotheses that ‘we’ present to explain your evidence in naturalistic ways could be refuted by claiming the aliens have the power to control nature. So there is no rational way to answer your question.Let me provide some anecdotes here.The History Channel offers a TV programs called ‘Ancient Aliens’. Other channels offer TV programs in ‘mainstream’ archeology and biology. I love the ‘mainstream programs’. I sometimes watch ‘Anceint Aliens’.The ‘Ancient Aliens’ program often shows archeological artifacts that can ‘only be explained’ by extraterrestrial aliens. They claim there is no way using the human technology of that time to reproduce those artifacts. The ‘mainstream’ archeology programs frequently show the archeologist reproducing those artifacts by the human technology he claims of that time.Sometimes, these programs air at the same time on different channels.I recall in particular some TV program on Ancient Aliens claiming that the Mayan pyramids and Inca cities could not have been made by Mayan or Incan technology. However, there was a Smithsonian program playing simultaneously where the archaeologists presented a plausible hypothesis on how Mayan and Incan technology could have built these artifacts.Similarly, the host of Ancient Aliens explained how the flat surfaces on Egyptian obelisks could not have made by human technology 3 Ky ago.He only show obelisks that have been ‘finished’. The archeologist examines a Egyptian obelisk that was UNFINISHED. It showed signs of thermal fracturing. So he had his students replicate this flat surface by using just fire and water applied carefully. The expansion and contraction split the rock, making the flat finish.Actually, mainstream scientists have simulated in several ways the manufacture of ‘alien artifacts’ that are never mentioned on Ancient Aliens. These alternate hypotheses are never mentioned on Ancient Aliens. Whereas, the Ancient Aleins hypothesis is often presented in the mainstream science programs. They say it as a joke, but they do say it.I also heard the host of Ancient Aliens refute the ‘theory’ of evolution based on genomic sequencing, while I read refereed articles by mainstream biologists examining the same genomic sequence. The mainstream biologists were interpreting the genomic sequence using the hypothesis that the ‘theory’ of evolution is true.I know a little biology, including evolution and gentics. It was very clear that the host of Ancient Aliens didn’t know a thing about these subjects. However, he presented his wonky hypothesis as the claim of mainstream scientists.The hosts of Ancient Aliens are not educated enough to evaluate known physics, known chemistry, known biology and ancient technology. They intentionally ignore alternate hypotheses presented by mainstream scientists.So how do Ancient Alien theorist suppose that the human technology of ancient times COULD NOT have produced the archeological artifacts that are presented as evidence of ETs?The Ancient Alien theorists have to do a great deal of ‘supposing’ on their own. They just don’t show the ‘supposing’ of other people.",3 followers,Mark Bradford,12.8K,579,2.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-we-suppose-we-haven-t-been-visited-by-aliens-when-it-is-possible-that-possibly-being-millions-of-years-more-advanced-technologically-they-have-figured-out-a-way-to-overcome-the-barrier-of-the-speed-of-light
