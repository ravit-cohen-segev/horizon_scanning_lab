Two major things. Running water. Which is just weird since they actually had contact with the roman empire. This coyld have mostly elimanated the black plague frim starting. Refrigeration. This would have prevented food poisoning and the rats and pests that thrived off the unsecure food supply.Africa… had refrigerators. Nah not electric. Just a way to keep food chilled.

Essentially. as told in the 2018 Black Panther movie, which just came out three days ago in the US, Vibranium first fell to Earth (by way of Meteor) back before mankind existed on the planet. It’s radioactive (deus-ex-machina magic) properties influenced the vegetation and wildlife around the crash site, producing a very lush landscape full of vibrant flora and fauna. Eventually mankind came about, and the five tribes that settled down onto the site of the meteor determined that it was best to protect the secret of the world’s strongest metal. Now I am going to get a bit less Marvel historian (nerdy) here. Essentially, the people of Wakanda were given a leg up in the race when they settled upon the Earth’s largest depository of the strongest metal in existence. There’s probably some proper theory name but I’m calling it the Prometheus theory named after the Greek mythological titan who kick started the human race in terms of technology by stealing fire from Olympus and giving its secrets to humanity, allowing us the ability to create metals and fires and mine the elements of the Earth to get to where we are today. Pkay enough greek geeking, back to Wakanda. Essentially Vibranium is the biggest flame of the fire and Wakanda had it all to themselves. Thus they were able to advance at a much quicker rate. Think gemmers in Clash Of Clans vs. non gemmers (is that too old of a reference now?) Anyway, we do a fast forward from the tribes who have the world’s strongest metal in large quantities in the ground and we advance to the modern day, where some people outside of Wakanda wear rare and expensive suits made of Kevlar, which are susceptible to knives, while every fiber of clothing in Wakanda is able to withstand tank fire due to the kinetic absorbent properties of Vibranium which is weaved into it. They use it to make their vehicles, their armor, their trains, their mines. How does that even work? How does one mine the strongest element on Earth? Oh well IDK. Anyway that’s why.

To keep him from using this ultimate power, T’Challa destroys all the processed Vibranium in the entire world, rendering it inert, basically turning it into another form of metal that has no special properties.So what will become of Wakanda? Reed Richards worries that T’Challa has destroyed Wakanda’s economy, Victor Von Doom says he’s destroyed Wakanda’s people.Shuri, in the right panel, believes he’s saved Wakanda instead. Why? T’Challa chose to destroy the Vibranium in part because he believed that Wakanda had grown too dependent on it, but that Wakanda can be more than Vibranium.What other resources does Wakanda have? For one thing, its people, a culture and civilization that have thrived and advanced in isolation for centuries, without the devastation wrought by outside invaders and colonizers. In the 20th century, generations of Wakandans have visited the outside world and brought back knowledge and technology as well. T’Challa and the Wakandan throne are financial powerhouses with investments around the globe, numerous patents, etc—many of these patents might depend on Vibranium, of course, but the minds of the inventors and business people and artists of Wakanda do not have to.

There are very, very few people who know how to make a barrel left in the world and fewer every year, yet barrel making was an advanced technology that changed the entire world for literally thousands of years.Incidentally. the most prolific barrel in the world today is the ASB or American Standard Barrel that hold 53 gallons because America makes more barrels than anyone else in the world.

It was the Wheelwright.Making a wheel from wood with an axle that attaches to a cart and doesn’t fall apart within a mile or two is one of the most “advanced technologies” of all time. Without it, most civilizations would have failed or failed to spread. Cart wheels are complex and the forces must play against each other continuously to hold the wheel together as it rolls. A Cartwright made as much then as a jet airline pilot back does today. In the 1880s when the average wage was $1.50 a day, the Wheelwright was making 90 dollars a week.
