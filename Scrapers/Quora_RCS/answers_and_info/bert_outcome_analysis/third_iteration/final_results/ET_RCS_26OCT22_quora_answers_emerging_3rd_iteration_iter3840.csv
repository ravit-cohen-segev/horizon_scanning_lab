Yes the bible for almost all of its entirety is taken from multiple sources for any and all of its books and even stories told.Then after you weed through and sort out all the adages that was made by the bible version and not in the original sources you can try to work from there. But you still will not find much of anything as these people of whatever times were basically uneducated animal herders of the bronze age.One thing you will find is that much of what is biblical old testament accounts was written far layer in history than when these religions and religious believers and apologists ever will admit to.For an example in the Abrahamic story it tells of Abraham seeing Camels for the first time. However it is well recorded in historicity when Camels was introduced to that region. We have many texts from various civilizations and people who recorded it. Then we have all the archeological and anthropological evidences to varify and back up the verification and validity of this time period well recorded. Camels were introduced somewhere near or about 700 BCE . All evidences back this up. So why does the Abrahamic writing account say something different?? Well because despite what apologists and biblical believers say, think,believe and or claim to having any validity of older age of being written, we know for a fact the Abrahamic writings were created and written somewhere around 450 to 500 BCE. Certainly not before.So there was however an older text that is attributed to be of the Abraham story but it never gives a name and it never has anything to identify and tie to this Abraham. And it speaks of a pack animal able to carry a great and heavy burden. There is really no description of the animal. So the writer who took this piece of writing and assumes and attributes it to Abraham…with no evidences at all.. looks around and sees Camels and just assumed that Camels must be what was seen and adds it in instead of the basic description that was given. These people had no idea that Camels did not exist in those regions dome few hundred years prior..they were uneducated and had just about zero knowledge of historicity or any sciences. They were just ignorant peasant common herders who some hapoen to learn to read and wrote just enough in their native languages or tongue. Their education was rudimentary at best.With this example, you can easily apply it to just about anything written biblically. Almost all of it fits in the same narrative. Do not put much into anything you read in it other than a conglomeration of fantasies and folklore and fictitious writings. Most of which is derived by some means from other already existing texts that when looked at are not accepted as real or contain truth by any means or beliefs.","7,750 followers",John Bartram,512,11.2K,22.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-hypothesis-that-certain-events-described-in-scriptures-which-talk-of-advance-technology-actually-belong-to-a-lost-civilization-which-existed-many-millenniums-before-the-known-archaeological-evidences

We believe so strongly in these things as to see them as non-debatable.But they are debatable!I can’t stress this enough.Nazis were humans.Soviets were humans.MS-13 are humans.Must I recount the atrocities these humans have committed?Humans with normal functioning brains can be bred to be absolute angels or sheer devils.This is the power and malleability of the human mind, and it’s whyIt’s a human who may cuddle a child to sleep while reading a bedtime story for the 3rd time in a row, despite having to wake up early for work the following day.And it’s a human who may shoot that child in the back of the head because the child questioned the validity of the bedtime story.The world has come incredibly closeAnd the PRIMARY reason why our better angels prevailed is because of the United States of America.Hitler held out in WW2 for as long as he did, even when his generals said the war was lost, because he hoped German scientists would finally unlock the mystery of the atomic bomb.Just imagine a world where the Nazis got the nuke first!You’re gay?

No one would have had the capability to halt the U.S. military-industrial complex with its doomsday weapon.But instead of enslaving the world, as every previous empire sought to do, the United States lent and gave money to numerous nations so that they could rebuild, and not fall to the tyranny of communism.Eventually, communism was defeated, too, and with the rise of democracy and capitalism, the world has never seen such a high standard of living!But the world isn’t as great as it is just because the U.S. helpedMany things you enjoy in your life, no matter where you live, was invented by an American or an American immigrant.In the end, I’m not looking for a red carpet to be rolled out to me simply because I’m an American.The United States, much like humans, is self-interested and often short-sighted, but may we occasionally take a break from pointing out her flaws to celebrate her blessings.May we put her past into context by not just focusing on what she hasn’t done for a particular ethnicity, or even for you as an individual, but on what she has done for humanity as a whole.And may we see that regardless of where we are from, we all have a little America in us.",1 follower,Dahyun Kim,20.8K,218,8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-can-t-the-advanced-technology-developed-in-black-projects-be-used-to-help-propel-civilization-into-the-Star-Trek-era

China will never surpass the United States in the next few decades or even a hundred years. Yes, this is what I said, a Chinese, who is regarded by many as an evil Communist Party.I say this not only to Americans but also to China. Don't always think naively that China can challenge and confront the US. That is to beat stone with eggs.I. How powerful is the US?From the political, economic, scientific and technological, military, cultural, diplomatic, and other aspects. China can't compete with the United States in any aspect.A. The US political powerThe US election is the most concerned political event in the world. Any American president who takes office will influence the direction of the world.For example, Trump, an “incredible“man who could not be found for hundreds of years, became the president of the United States. If he is in other fields, it may not have any influence. But he is now the president of the United States. His words can greatly affect people all over the world. For example, he said that COVID-19 pneumonia can disappear on its own, that children can avoid COVID-19 pneumonia, and that the United States controls it well. Even many important figures in the Republican Party did not support Trump's re-election. Because the disaster he brought to the world may be worse than COVID-19 pneumonia.But it is not that he is terrible, but that the global leadership of the United States is terrible!If he is the leader of a very underdeveloped country, I don't think most newspapers will even report it.B. The strength of the US economyThe strength of the US economy can be seen all over the world. The United States has not only influence but control over the global economy! The dollar, which is smaller than the mobile phone, is the most powerful weapon of the United States, not the US aircraft carrier or the US Marine Corps.C. The US science and technologyThe US stands at the forefront of science and technology in the world. Most of the high technology in the world is in the hands of Americans or American laboratories. For example, today's China is developing its aerospace industry, which is an achievement that attracts worldwide attention. However, we all know that compared with the United States, we are inferior to the United States and the former Soviet Union at the beginning of the Cold War.But I think Leonard's genius is that a nerd can have a girlfriend like Penny.D. The US militaryThe US military ranks first in the world, and I believe no one will refute me. The U.S. government has made deep research and practice on maintaining the combat effectiveness of the military, leading military science and technology, military theory, and military treatment.The largest conventional aircraft carrier in the world is the Kitty Hawk of the US Navy. This aircraft carrier has participated in many foreign operations of the US military. Regardless of her glorious history, technically speaking, which country can produce it now? This is an aircraft carrier produced by the United States in 1960.The United States Marine Corps, the firm executor of the national will of the United States, can basically defeat other countries with only one US Marine Corps. The US Marine Corps is not just a bunch of crayon-eating psychopaths. They have the most systematic, scientific, and arduous training, the most efficient and advanced military theory, and the most advanced weapons and equipment.I don't think any country in the world would be stupid enough to challenge the United States militarily.5 steps to reshape the US military: Glean, Engage, Focus, Incentivize, and Share.The Kitty Hawk of the US NavyE. The US cultureAmerican culture is an important manifestation of American soft power. Almost everyone on earth knows Hollywood, and even some people may not know where the capital of the United States is, but they must have heard of Titanic and Rambo, an American hero who can beat hundreds of people by himself. Most written works in the world are written and recorded in English. American music is basically the trend. The American brand is basically the guarantee of quality. It can be said that where there are people, there will be American cultural influence, except for newborns in hospitals.TitanicRamboII. What are the advantages of China?China's greatest advantage is the people. This may be something that Americans can't surpass for years.From the military point of view, the PLA under the leadership of the Communist Party of China has no advantage in weapons and equipment. But the People's Liberation Army has accomplished every military operation task brilliantly. Because Chairman Mao said: ""The decisive factor in war is people, not weapons and equipment."" Is it true that China respects the US military because the US military has the most powerful weapons and equipment? No, it is because the extraordinary courage displayed by the US military on the battlefield deserves China's respect.Let me show you a couple of the examples that the power of people:A. What has the Communist Party of China done in the history of being regarded as a communist devil by the West?The first National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held secretly in this boat, Shanghai on July 23, 1921. The meeting was attended by only 12 people, announcing the founding of the Communist Party of China. Today, China has 90 million Party members.Under the military attack of the Kuomintang, the army led by the Communist Party was forced to move. The journey is more than 20,000 miles, also known as the 25,000-mile Long March. During the journey, it has traveled 25,000 miles through 11 provinces, 18 mountains, 24 rivers, deserted grassland, and rolling snow-capped mountains.After the Long March, there were only 30,000 Communist troops.In 1932, he was commissioned by the CPC Central Committee to organize the Anti-Japanese Coalition Forces in Northeast China and served as the commander and political commissar of the Anti-Japanese Coalition Forces. He led the soldiers and civilians to fight bloody battles with the Japanese aggressors in the northeast. In the extremely cold environment, under the emergency of running out of ammunition, he finally fought alone with a large number of Japanese aggressors for a few days and nights and died heroically. When the Japanese army caught him, they cut open his stomach and found that there were only bark and cotton in his stomach. He kept fighting by eating these. At that time, the Japanese army stood up and saluted, because Yang Jingyu was a very respectable fighting hero of Communist Party members.The Liberation War was a war waged by the Chinese People's Liberation Army under the leadership of the Communist Party of China from June 1946 to September 1949 to overthrow the Kuomintang rule and liberate the whole of China. It is a decisive battle concerning China's future and destiny. On October 1, 1949, the People's Republic of China was proclaimed in Beijing on the way of PLA marching to the whole country. In 1951, the PLA completed the task of liberating the mainland and offshore islands and the Communist Party of China unified the Chinese mainland.The Communist Party of China has done a lot of things. She made China independent, and at the same time, she led the Chinese people to work hard to build the motherland. These examples are to say that a political party that is extremely poor can lead the people to today. It doesn't matter whether she is evil or not. We trust this party, even she is evil.Many overseas Chinese are constantly discrediting the Communist Party. It doesn't matter. More than one billion Chinese people now support the Communist Party of China. Is this party good or bad? If the Communist Party is really an extremely evil party, how can it monitor and control 1.4 billion Chinese people?Is it because China is really sinful that it keeps smearing China? Or something else?B. What are the strange characteristics of the Chinese people?Chinese people's character comes from Chinese culture. It is not deep to get in touch with the Chinese without understanding the Chinese character.1. Attach great importance to educationChina's college entrance examination is the exam with the largest number of participants in the world. The history of examinations in China has exceeded 1400 years. The examination is an important way for Chinese emperors to select officials from civilians. Today's Chinese college entrance examination is an exam that determines the fate of students. No matter you are rich or poor, you must pass the college entrance examination before you can enter the university. In China, every family and every Chinese regard education as a way to change their own destiny. Therefore, every Chinese family will spend a lot of money on their children's education.Every year in the college entrance examination in June, all cars in China will not whistle, so it is necessary to create a quiet environment for the candidatesParents waiting anxiously outside the examination roomExamination in ancient China. In the highest examinations in ancient China, the invigilator was the emperor. At the same time, any candidate who tries to cheat will be decapitated immediately once he is found.2. Chinese people especially like farmingChina's geographical environment determines that the people here will make a living by farming. Until today, as long as Chinese people see a good piece of land, they will not plant flowers, but grow vegetables.The picture above shows Chinese people growing vegetables in the Antarctic scientific research stations, deserts, university campuses, and space.3. Chinese people love saving money and grainWhen Americans were suffering from pneumonia in COVID-19, many people took to the streets. In fact, it is not necessarily opposed to wearing masks, but Americans do not have the habit of saving money. If the United States does not resume its economic activities, the American people will be unable to live because they have no jobs. But at the request of the Communist Party of China, 1.4 billion people stayed at home. Chinese people can stay at home for two months without going to the str...",0 followers,Naman Chakraborty,3.6K,342,36.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-can-t-the-advanced-technology-developed-in-black-projects-be-used-to-help-propel-civilization-into-the-Star-Trek-era

Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party. Because radiation from nuclear accidents is apparently scarier than way more people dying of regular pollution constantly and the total annihilation of all life on Earth as the oceans boil away.","68,777 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-hypothesis-that-certain-events-described-in-scriptures-which-talk-of-advance-technology-actually-belong-to-a-lost-civilization-which-existed-many-millenniums-before-the-known-archaeological-evidences

Before the business world was run by big corporations, rock solid patents, marketing required big budgets and suit's and ties were essential to be taken seriously in the business world.It's not like those things are gone. Nope. They're still here. But, business, in a way has gotten more personal. Companies are promoting their best people rather than logo's or handing out business cards.You could say, the world is much more open-source.Take online, there are communities that cover any topic you can think of. If you want to get into 3-D printing, car repairs, programming, building log cabins there are hundreds of thousands of people online willing to help you out.For free.Information is another thing that used to be only available at a price. You needed to buy books, VHS, DVD's or tapes for self-education. Now, you can switch on YouTube and follow a 10 part series that teaches you how to knit or learn the guitar or even simple things like how to count your money.Basically, we live on a level playing field. Some old media companies have fewer followers than one guy on YouTube playing computer games. Companies that thrived on secrecy now get forgotten as they have nothing to of value to offer the world.Yes, there are established businesses that these rules don't apply to. But, if you're still looking to grow your business. It's about time to embrace these changes.I often say that the old rules of copywriting or marketing still reign supreme. As in researching the hell out of the product/service and customer and create a highly potent sales message to send them. Most of the rules are still valid.But, the media, like mentioned above has changed.If you are stubborn about the fact. You'd still be creating print ads, which do still work, provided that you audience still reads newspapers or magazines. Otherwise, it's time to adapt to these changes.It's really about striking a balance. Certain rules in certain industries will stand the test of time. Some others need to be modified along the way. The main reason marketing will never fall to automation or be replaced by robots is because it deals with people.While robots make logical decisions, people do not. So it will always take a person to communicate a companies value. In fact, many service style businesses are safe from being replaced. Anything, where one group or people helps another group, is pretty safe.But, nothing is for sure. The banking business is being challenged by online payment processors like Stripe, Paypal. Even cash and money itself is being challenged with open source currency such as Bitcoins. Where it goes in the future, is another matter.But, big businesses no longer hold the public attention. We have no forced media pushed on us every day. We choose our own media.So how do you win?Easy. Become transparent. Give more than you take. Provide value...Find a problem and solve it with your product or service.If you can create a story for people to follow the process of creating this solution. You create a stronger audience.Again, this doesn't apply to all businesses.But there's something of value there for anyone trying to move forward in our open source economy.What do you think?","246,827 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/China-and-America-are-two-of-the-leading-countries-which-have-advanced-technological-products-through-Sciences-These-two-different-and-isolated-countries-have-different-cultures-languages-and-perspectives-Do-they

Much of what I said about setting up a shop still applies so I will leave it below.One canSome materials and methods will not be easily accessible. To use cutting edge stuff like Vanta Black, any nano tech, Liquidmetal, and so on you would need to a relationship with the developers which may or may not be possible depending on where they are at in their development cycle.There is a much cheaper alternative which gives you virtual access to anything you want which is to use a program like Solidworks, Inventor, or OnShape to model your concepts in the computer. They can even do a fair amount of testing that is difficult and expensive to do with physical prototypes such as air flow analysis, heat dissipation characteristics, structural stresses under load, etc. While you will still need physical prototypes before you can go into production, having the virtually tested computer models can save a lot of time and trouble and failed prototypes. With the computer models you can also get your designs prototyped by facilities that know a lot more about the fabrication processes than you will ever have time to learn. Paying for these will be a lot less expensive than setting up the shop to make them yourself.. . .On Setting up Shop:The only limits are your budget, your space, and some legal constraints on what you can obtain. Some cool things you could buy:….and on and on.Things you most likely can't get or won't want anyway are:The limitation is your budget (since more space can be bought or built). You could easily spend a few hundred thousand (US$) setting up and equipping your shop.Of course once it's set up you need to know how to use the equipment and have the design skills needed to develop your inventions. These are things people spend years to learn and lifetimes to master.Actually you really need the expertise in using the equipmentYou might do better to join a place like the Tech Shop which gives you access to all the cool stuff for a membership fee and the cost of the basic training/safety check on each machine. Not only will this cost a fraction of building your own shop (or even just maintaining it once built) it also puts you in contact with other people who will be experts in all the machines you aren't experienced on and who also know a lot about making stuff.Remember that it's the","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,631,1.5K,2.9M,2016,https://www.quora.com/China-and-America-are-two-of-the-leading-countries-which-have-advanced-technological-products-through-Sciences-These-two-different-and-isolated-countries-have-different-cultures-languages-and-perspectives-Do-they
