0,"No hammer, no gimmicks, 100%, Thor God of Thunder (and Lightning)Ok I have an idea where this question is coming from.When Thor was first introduced, he along with Asgardians were portrayed as advanced extra terrestrials. There was a lot of pseudo scientific jibber jabber but the word God was omitted.I believe that this was done for two reasons. First Marvel was testing the waters to see what direction they wanted to take Thor in as they were trying to capture the mainstream market and marketing Thor as a God could put more conservative viewers off.

First Marvel was testing the waters to see what direction they wanted to take Thor in as they were trying to capture the mainstream market and marketing Thor as a God could put more conservative viewers off. Secondly as their main market for the MCU was originally the US they were probably trying to minimise any kick back from the bible belt.However, over the release of the next two movies and especially in Ragnarok we see the acceptance of Asgardians and Thor as Gods.As Odin said in Ragnarok,This is a clear statement that they are Gods and it is Thors inate power to summon the lightning.

3,"They put a brand-new totally realistic hand on an amputation stump (that was cauterized, no less--all Luke's nerves and blood vessels were burned shut.)  And that's a rebel force without direct access to the best resources.  They are able to fix severe frostbite and hypothermia, including of open wounds, with a bacta tank, in a matter of hours with no apparent tissue loss or infection.  Grievous is essentially some organs and his central nervous system kept alive in a cyborg body.  And the prognosis of someone with the burn injuries Vader has in Episode III in the REAL world?  Dead.  Even withThey put a brand-new totally realistic hand on an amputation stump (that was cauterized, no less--all Luke's nerves and blood vessels were burned shut.)

Those are non-survivable burns no  matter what caused them, even if you're at the most advanced burn unit in the real world.  Those are just three examples of people who in the real world at minimum are maimed for life (Luke) or just dead (Vader and Grievous.)

4,"I am going to go out on a limb and assume you are referring to Luke Skywalker having a metal robot claw. If you consider the amount of tech involved in joining machines to biological signals to make a hand responsive enough to keep being a Jedi, that is amazing.  Add to that he was ""repaired"" in a hidden field hospital of sorts that must acquire its resources subversively to keep of the Empire's radar, and it is amazing he still has a hand at all.

Considering the area below his wrist was completely sealed off and cauterized, there should not even have been a way to reconnect his hand to his nervous system at all.A lot of my fellow veterans would love to have access to that ""poor"" tech. Having a hand that actually acts like a hand as opposed to an iron hook that opens and closes with shoulder movements would be a godsend. Or a leg that actually moves like a leg as opposed to something hanging off what is left of their leg that has to be dragged and flipped around with hip movements that lead to long term back issues later.Luke's hand ain't pretty, but it works great.Then you have to biological equivalent to a full rebuild from the chassis up that was Darth Vader. Three missing limbs. Burns over eighty percent of what was left of his body.  Breathing replacement for lungs that were all but destroyed from smoke inhalation.How is all this not amazing tech?One final note. I think Luke left his hand that way on purpose to remind himself what he could become if he didn't watch himself.  Remember, Anak in started out really good with the best of intentions. But his emotions went out of control, and we know the rest.",0 followers,Ben Choucroun,504,1.2K,40.7M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Are-Thors-powers-real-superpowers-or-just-advanced-technology-How-can-he-summon-lightning
5,I think it's for the same reason that there's no variant of email in the Star Wars universe.Most people - including Lucas - image the future technology as an extension of the one that exists in their own time.There were air planes in the 1970s so to image a spaceship (= air planes in space) is a logical progression of the technology that was in the 1970s. However there was no email in the 1970s and no one - not even Lucas - could've imagined such a thing. The result? There's no such thing as an advanced version of email in that galaxy.Medical technology is just variation of that same principleI think it's for the same reason that there's no variant of email in the Star Wars universe.Most people - including Lucas - image the future technology as an extension of the one that exists in their own time.There were air planes in the 1970s so to image a spaceship (= air planes in space) is a logical progression of the technology that was in the 1970s.

There were probably some super primitive prosthetics in the 1970s so to imagine a cybernetic hand (=much better prosthetic) is not a stretch but a logical progression. But since there was no way to e.g. grow organs in the 1970s the result is that there're no biological replacement organs.,"1,808 followers",Mark Fergerson,996,4.2K,5.8M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Are-Thors-powers-real-superpowers-or-just-advanced-technology-How-can-he-summon-lightning
6,"The amazing thing about science fiction is how often certain areas of technology seem positively magical, and yet other bits seem remarkably primitive.Take Star Trek (any version) for instance.

Send down a thousand drones with cameras and sensors.  A tricorder on the surface is apparently better than the orbital sensors, but there is little reason to beam down the human attached to it, isn't there?Star Wars is just as ridiculous.

This question was intended primarily for Fantasy and Science Fiction Worldbuilding.After giving it some thought and reading the other answers, I’ve got a few decent explanations for why your characters use swords to fight on their steampunk dirigibles.1: Guns just weren’t invented yet.Somebody who answered mentioned medieval China as an example, and that’s a good comparison. China and late medieval Europe had gunpowder for centuries before anyone developed widely useful hand-held weapons.Fun fact: the term “bulletproof” comes from medieval Europe.

China and late medieval Europe had gunpowder for centuries before anyone developed widely useful hand-held weapons.Fun fact: the term “bulletproof” comes from medieval Europe. Really good armor would be shot with a gun before being sold, and the dent left by the slug was called the bullet-proof.And gunpowder isn’t really necessary for inventing industrial technology; machines are. It’s entirely conceivable that the people of your world developed electric and petroleum power without ever noticing that weird stuff happens when you mix a powder of sulfur, charcoal and saltpeter and then set it on fire, because why would you even do that when you have gasoline to burn?2: The raw materials needed aren’t there.It’s possible that the people know about the concept of a gun, but they can’t make explosives because they just can’t find enough of the raw ores needed to make them. Maybe the materials were all spent up during the apocalypse. Maybe there’s not enough good steel in the world to make barrels and mechanisms that can survive the blasts. Or maybe dragons eat up all the flammable minerals.3: They do exist, but warriors don’t like them.It could be that for various reasons, the guns in your world are just not appropriate for the kind of adventures your characters go on. Adventurers go into dungeons to get rich, not deaf. Submariners need to defend their boats with weapons that won’t cause collateral damage to the sensitive machinery, which could doom the whole crew. Psions rely on their extrasensory powers, which are more widely useful and potentially deadlier than physical weapons, which are expensive and can be stolen by the enemy.Monster Hunter","20,087 followers",Ben Kolber,11.1K,324,21.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Are-Thors-powers-real-superpowers-or-just-advanced-technology-How-can-he-summon-lightning
