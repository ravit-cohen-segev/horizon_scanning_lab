Well it isNB: For the purposes of this answer I am proposing the Spartans as the real-life analogue of the Klingons, being similarly fixated on combat, warrior virtues and war.So as hinted at in the question, I think it unlikely that the Klingons devoted any more effort to innovations in agriculture/architecture/insert non-war technology here than the Spartans were known to. Hint: Sparta not remembered for the delicate beauty of its architecture.Spartan weaponry [2] was truly novel for the era as opposed to their tactics, which were mostly borrowed or 'inherited'[3] (their successes came from the fact that theyOn a tangent, I would also point to their system of government [4] as an example of innovation, with its careful checks and balances. I lack the knowledge to say whether it wasSo now to the 'deployed' bit. Here we are on much firmer ground. AsSimilarly we have already touched on the Spartans' use of pre-existing tactics. They also used triremes [6]; a common, Greece-wide form of warship by the time of the Peleponnesian War [7]. They are thought to have made use of Greek Fire [8] as well although it should be noted there are many differing unproven theories as to what Greek Fire actuallyWe also see an example of the tendencies of Klingons to 'borrow' (read: kidnap and rob) from other cultures in theMy point here is that not even the most stoic or mono-cultured society, (whether in 430 B.C. or the 23rd century A.D.) exists as an island.So in summary, both races innovated in their shared area of interest (killing things) and I contend in at least one or two other commonly overlooked areas* but in the main borrowed from their neighbours where ever possible.*Can you imagine the film[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta",17 followers,Rom Lokken,918,0,0,2012,https://www.quora.com/How-plausible-is-it-that-a-warrior-race-such-as-the-Klingons-would-also-develop-technology-reasonably-equal-to-that-of-other-Star-Trek-major-powers
4,"It’s not plausible. The Klingons as we see them in later shows that depict them as a warrior race took cues from cultures in real life that did not value innovation.

10,"India will never be a developed country because of the following reasons.India will never be a developed country because of the following reasons.A broken window pane of Tejas Express between Chennai and Madurai barely a month after it was launchedPaan stains in Kashi on the ghats of the GangaA familiar sight in every part of India7. Declining participation of women in the workforce : Increased sexual violence against women and children and a declining sex ratio in favor of men adversely impact the economic contribution of women in the economy and hence, development.8. Blind worship of celebrities, be it sportspersons, movie actors, politicians9. Living in the past : Most Indians still dream about the glory days of yore when our country was called “the golden bird”. Blame all our societal evils on the invaders and colonizers. We were independent kingdoms fighting with each other in ancient times. Our individual armies were weak which enabled outsiders to invade us. That is the painful lesson from history we have still not learnt.10. Living in denial : Save for a tiny few, most Indians actually believe that without correcting the deep rooted problems in our mindset and society, we are well on our way to becoming a developed country. India’s per capita GDP is lesser than Bangladesh now and we have fallen down 7 places in the Global Hunger Index. This should show a mirror to where we stand. But these reports are trashed and rubbished as “Western conspiracy” to defame India.Edit : Appreciate the upvotes. I wanted to add a few more points.11. Rejection of capitalism : Impoverished India in 1947 rejected wealth building capitalism for socialism and has paid a heavy price. We hate wealthy people labelling them as “evil” by default. Without the private sector, would India have achieved even a fraction of anything since 1991? Everyone envies China now, without realizing the massive role capitalism induced manufacturing did to their economy in 30 years.12. Security concerns : Despite the presence of the Naxal Corridor and surrounded by countries that hate our very existence, only threadbare measures have been undertaken to address these issues from the bottom up. We aren’t lucky to have a neighborhood like Scandinavian countries or Switzerland/ Luxembourg that are largely neutral/peaceful.13. A glaring example of state neglect, Tamilnadu has been facing a torrential downpour for a few days now. In my hometown Chennai, there is intense flooding everywhere. This could have been avoided if the second oldest municipality corporation in the world, GCC(Greater Chennai Corporation) had desilted lakes and removed encroachments in the city’s waterbodies especially after the 2015 floods.There is an old saying., “Yatha praja, thatha raja”, as in a nation gets a leader just like its people.Rings true for our country.",533 followers,Kushal Sharma,11.8K,100,665.2K,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-should-we-adapt-to-make-India-a-developed-country

From snow clad to dry desert, forests, tropical , mountains, rivers, seas on all sides, etc. A small country like Israel which is surrounded by hostile countries, has its own methods on conservation of essentials like water, irrigation etc. We should be fortunate to have such a god’s gift.Coming to the point, there are ample opportunities for entrepreneurship in the field of improving technologies in agriculture by introducing modernised silos to store grains, cooperative movements for production and storage of food and grain. We largely depend on monsoon and if it fails all hue and cry raised. Why not go for water conservation techniques on a larger scale other than house rain water harvesting by building underground tanks of huge capacity? Even for seasonal harvesting of vegetables why not think dehydrating techniques for perishables like Potatoes, onions, tomatoes or for that reason for every type of vegetables on a large scale, so that in times of drought periods these can be used by all of us. If cooperative movement is successful in milk production, it will also be successful in other areas, if intention is there.Even computer technology has great scopes benefitting every day lives. Computerisation can be done for even domestic security apparatus, day to day functions etc. etc. Regarding our depleting fossil fuels why not think of alternatives like solar reserves, alternate type of fuels or additives, electricity or even nuclear on a large scale?. In civil engineering providing cheaper but foolproof technology for housing , infrastructure, prefabricated bridges and towers etc.People should be discouraged from overcrowding in big cities. Try to have build smaller towns in every state with its own infrastructure, tourist attractions, hotel industry, housing, transport, facilities. This is extensively practiced in all developed countries.India has a number of skilled artisans who could be better utilised for exporting our products to countries who need novelties. It could be on sculptures, handicrafts, handloom fabrics, clothing.Tourism has a great potential. Kerala can become a pioneer with its vast inland water routes by building several tourist spots, encasing our diverse heritage structures of temples, mosques or churches .
