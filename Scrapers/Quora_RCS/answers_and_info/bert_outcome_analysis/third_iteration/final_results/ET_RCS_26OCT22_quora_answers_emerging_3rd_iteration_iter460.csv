0,"Personal ranking:Justification:Berkeley has the most balanced CS program overall, I think. I also give it points for not being as elitist as the other schools. Berkeley is just strong no-bullshit academics.CMU is probably just as good academically, maybe slightly better in some ways, but it loses points for being in Pittsburgh rather than the SF Bay Area. All the big companies will come to CMU to recruit, but smaller companies and hot start-ups may not make it out there. Berkeley is closer to the action of Silicon Valley.Stanford undergrPersonal ranking:Justification:Berkeley has the most balanced CS program overall, I think.

Berkeley is closer to the action of Silicon Valley.Stanford undergrads are lazier than Berkeley undergrads (and the other schools you mentioned). Most will even admit it. They have a much higher sense of entitlement. Therefore, they don’t learn as much, and the material gets dumbed down for them slightly. The grad students at Stanford are the opposite — very hard working — but most who TA classes will readily admit they have to make it easy so the entitled undergrads don’t complain.MIT has the opposite problem of Stanford. Their students work really hard, but most of the effort is wasted because MIT’s CS curriculum is not as good as Berkeley, CMU or Stanford. MIT students also have to spend their time taking a lot of hard classes that have nothing to do with computer science. MIT is good if you want to learn general principles of engineering that are independent of CS.Princeton, Harvard and CalTech all fall below, because they are strong in certain areas of CS but not universally strong in all areas, and their CS programs are not as widely recognized. Still very good programs, but they are followers rather than leaders in CS. I ranked Princeton higher than Harvard and CalTech, because Princeton is actually very strong in one particular area — theoretical computer science — and it’s so strong in that area, that if we were ranking that area alone, it would likely be at the very top. Princeton is considerably weaker in systems though. Neither Harvard or Caltech are particularly notable in CS. Harvard gets a slight bump in notoriety for having two famous drop-outs.","21,936 followers",Vidhi Khandel,20K,182,11.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-good-is-Toyota-Technological-Institute-at-Chicago-TTIC-for-graduate-studies-in-computer-science-compared-to-the-top-ranked-universities

Most of the top students study like this. I wish I knew this before, I would have been an officer myself. Well it is never too late. Anyway, what he did wasWhenever he picked up any new bookSo, revise, revise, revise, write, write, write is his mantra.His hard work, smartness and discipline paid off beautifully.I have started to study in the same way and I am shocked at how quickly and easily I am able to learn.","17,408 followers",Loring Chien,2.6K,54.9K,129M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-good-is-Toyota-Technological-Institute-at-Chicago-TTIC-for-graduate-studies-in-computer-science-compared-to-the-top-ranked-universities
