To the stranger looking from the outside, you’d think she’s the strongest person in the world.She works in retail, she works with people. Last year, she sold almost a million dollars worth of clothing. The company loves her. Her clients love her. When people come to the store, they ask for her by name. There is a sea of 500 associates with the ability to help someone find a shirt, but if they’ve been helped by my mom, they will wait in line to be helped by her instead.She’s a product of abuse. Constant abuse that she confused for love at the hands of her own mother. 20 years of it, in fact. Then, forced into a marriage that most people would consider a sales pitch for a product. My dad, her ex-husband, acquired about 20 more years of abuse.She survived. Beatings, verbal confirmations on how stupid she was. Brainwashing. Stockholm syndrome. Panic attacks. Loss of blood.Her mom never telling her she was good enough.She never showed that side of her. The dark side that’s too ashamed of the things people say about her.She gets dressed, she puts on her make-up, she tries her hardest to be an amazing mother to my sister and me. She checks off all the boxes of a great mom.If I have any kindness, I like to think I got it from her. In the smallest sense, I hope that I at least learned it from her.All those things definitely get to her. When she finally divorced my father and we left him behind, when the beatings stopped, when her mother was put in her place and the Stockholm syndrome was dealt with, she broke down.She was strong because she had to be. She was strong because there was no other way to live. She was forced into three abortions between myself and my sister because my dad didn’t know how to spend a few dollars on a condom.There was no luxury to choose emotional strength.In my mom’s case, it was life or death.I stand next to her, and sometimes I feel the weight of everything on my shoulders.

Loot is valuable and can often be sold for crypto. You don’t want to miss out on the Group’s progress and earning some extra money.The meta-what? Sounds confusing? Perhaps, but this is the world we live in and it is how billions of people interact in a reality that is part physical, part digital.Welcome to The Metaverse… A reality that is all around us. Like The Matrix. And you better prepare yourself AND your business to adapt fast and adapt deep. Failing to do so will make you miss out on the New Economy, where trillions of dollars will shape what companies succeed and which companies will rule.Read on and we will help you prepare to focus on the only thing that matters in technological revolutions: how to grasp the motivation of your users and customers in the Metaverse.The Metaverse as:“a collective virtual shared space, created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual space,including the sum of all virtual worlds, augmented reality, and the Internet.”Er…what? Let’s rephrase that.The metaverse is basically a collection of physical and digital experiences that seamlessly overlap and integrate. Think of Marshmellow doing a virtual concert in the game Fortnite:The metaverse world is an always expanding matrix. In time people will be able to enter the metaverse, completely virtually (with VR headsets) or interact with parts of it in their physical space with the help of Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality.As the example of Fortnite shows, the Metaverse opens up a whole new world for businesses to make money and reach customers. In the old days there was Second Life of course and already then people sold virtual villas and shops to other people. And some of these properties were valued at millions of dollars. But the current Metaverse takes all of this one step further.The coming of age of the Metaverse creates huge opportunities for businesses.This Metaverse is going to be far more pervasive and powerful than anything else. If one central company gains control of this, they will become more powerful than any government and be a god on Earth.Already there are signs of a massive opportunity unfolding. Look at the artist called “Beeple” (Mike Winkelmann for friends) who started selling unique digital art pieces online. All you buy is an image with a proof of ownership blockchain token (non fungible token). During 3 days in December, Beeple sold US$ 3.5 million worth of digital art work. Recently, the buying frenzy topped when the owner of his own art work metaverse bought Beeple’s ultimate US$ 69 million art work.Beeple was in no way the first to dip into the nexus of art, digital and blockchain of course. Already in 2017 a company called Axiom Zen released digital trading cards portraying cute little cats.These cryptokitties breed with each other so you can combine two of them to create new kitties. Cute but useless you say? Perhaps, but $30 million market transactions tell you they did something right.Many big businesses are getting involved in the Metaverse space. Microsoft already bought Minecraft developer Mojang in 2014 for US$ 2.5 billion. Gaming universe builder Roblox is now worth US$ 30 billion. Trillions more dollars are being created as we speak and businesses can no longer afford to not be in the know or even part ofMaking the metaverse work for your own companyWhy is this of interest to you?Who cares how the game in Ready Player One has been designed? Well, the Oasis is the ultimate form of the metaverse. It’s the exact direction that least some of the newly emerging metaverses are taking. It may be an environment that you as a business may want to interact with. In that case you need to make sure that your design optimizes fully for human motivation. The time has gone that companies can just rely on your value proposition of their products to win people over and to get them to buy products and services.The already short attention span of users in the digital space is shortened even more by the amount of distraction that goes on in the metaverse (or metaverses). The design of your product or service needs to be so good that there is almost no reason the user would not want to interact with your product in the first place. On top of that you need to ensure that users feel truly empowered and engaged when they first start to interact with your product or service. And not long after that your design needs to optimize for long term and deep user engagement.You then need to think of a design that empowers veteran users to become your internal and external brand ambassadors. These leaders will show everybody in the experience how to behave and will tell everybody outside the metaverse to join the metaverse (and by proxy your brand influence circle).Now, crafting such an engaging user journey around your business offering is not easy. It requires a thorough understanding of human motivation; knowledge of Behavioral Science and human biases and heuristics. It necessitates having the ability and empathy to crawl in the skin of the users. Only then will you be able to create the right human touch just like successful games have done.You need to master gameful design in combination with Behavioral Science. and that is exactly The Octalysis Group is known for.","135,529 followers",Hector Quintanilla,15.2K,1.2K,88.6M,2022,https://www.quora.com/How-should-we-prepare-ourselves-ahead-of-time-to-make-money-from-upcoming-metaverse-technologies

Wondering if it’s too late to quit having already wasted a year studying med.20yo-23yo: same as above, not doing well at prescribed subjects most of which I deemed unworthy of my brain anyway. But as each year went by, felt like it’s more and more time wasted if I quit at that point. Decided to focus on surgical studies - the least “bullshit” of all medical specialties.24yo: first year as an intern doctor. Making some money for the first time, albeit mostly by exchanging lots of my (over)time for an hourly based pay - will not do that again in retrospect - youth is worth a lot, and the hourly pay as an intern is terrible, not at all worth it considering money will come later as you get more senior.25yo-26yo: focused on surgical specialty work. Got onto the surgical training program to specialise. Got bored once understood the “true nature” of surgery - longs hours of cutting, burning, stitching. Suffered a quarter life crisis. Quit full time work.27yo-29yo: worked casual as a emergency department senior doctor in a rural hospital for triple the pay I was on when full time. Found a role model in the department director’s style of medical practice - the way he approached each patient, the way he solved each issue, the confidence and style, etc. Decided to model my practice based on a similar attitude. Bought every possible “toy” my heart desired (within reason), but also suffered intermittent bouts of depression due to feelings of being “left behind” when compared to my peers in medicine who were training towards becoming a specialist, and compared to my high school friends who had found very measurable success in the corporate world. Took many many months off work to go travel, F-around, and “find myself”/philosophise. Got first taste of anaesthesia practice during this time when on a few occasions I had to heavily sedate patients in order to “zap” the heart in an emergency.30yo: decided to accept a 70% pay-cut in order to re-enter full time “proper” public hospital work so as to have a shot at applying to the highly competitive anaesthesia training program. Extremely lucky to get on the program within just 6 months of re-entering “the system” - owing to the very good references I got from my 3 years of ED work, and a LOT of luck.31–36yo: felt like anaesthesia is a speciality made for me, and I made for it. Extremely competent and confident at work and studying for the specialty exams felt more natural. Endured two prolonged and highly stressful periods of almost-full time self-directed studying (6 months each) in addition to full time work, in order to prepare for two lots of major specialty exams, which resulted in relationship breakdown each time (among other reasons).37yo til now: practice as a private specialist anaesthetist. Very good at what I do; very happy with my specialty choice, which then finally justifies the original decision to do med when I was 18yo - some 19 years later.The point is, whether you regret something changes as time goes by. If you quit early, and changed to something else and found success there, you will forever be celebrating your quitting as a good decision. If you didn’t quit, and stuck with it, and eventually find success like me, you will be celebrating not quitting as a good decision.Either way, you just need to be competent and persistent and eventually succeed - this would validate all your earlier decisions.Before you can succeed, you naturally consider yourself a “failure” or “work in progress”, so feelings of regret and doubt are natural. It’s more important to focus on achieving success, than lamenting earlier decisions.","19,932 followers",Lacy Windham,2.6K,516,25.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-should-we-prepare-ourselves-ahead-of-time-to-make-money-from-upcoming-metaverse-technologies

Not greed of money, but greed of our personal time. Most of the high performing students were interested in getting the best grade for the least amount of effort. Yes, it does not sound flattering, but it actually is a positive attribute. You see, when you are intent on learning the most in the least amount of time, you really focus on the big picture first. You know that if you understand the big picture, you can fill in the details more easily right before a test.For example, if you are studying the cardiovascular system, the best students would always understand the big picture first, how cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, blood pressure, blood flow, and venous return are related and affect each other. At least, if we really understood this, we would probably pass. Just add in a bunch of less relevant details, and you could ace the section.Students that struggled often reversed the process. They would try to memorize a bunch of details, but did not have the big picture as a framework to hold those details. So many times, I would be studying with someone right before the test, and after explaining a “big picture” concept to them, they would have the epiphany. But having the epiphany early gives you a framework that helps to hold the details.So my advice to you, as an aspiring physician, is to be greedy with your time. The first few days of any new subject, be relentless in asking questions until you understand the big picture. Once you have done that, you will not fail. And if you want to ace the subject, just use the rest of your time filling in all the minutia that will earn you a top grade. And realize that the big picture is what makes you a good physician, because that is probably the only thing you will remember. The details are for your personal goals, to get the grades that will allow you to pursue whatever you wish.Best of luck to you all.","28,017 followers",Dr Eashan Aneja,1K,745,18.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-should-we-prepare-ourselves-ahead-of-time-to-make-money-from-upcoming-metaverse-technologies

They could not explain most basic concepts to a 14 year old. How do you expect them to teach the nuances of information theory to college kids?A vast majority of our engineering graduates come from the zillion private colleges, which have mushroomed over the last decade or more. We have truly democratized technical education - we are all engineers, even if we don’t know how to multiply two numbers.Does it shock you? It should.Obviously there are some real exceptions like VIT, which are supposed to be quite good, but I am talking about the vast majority of small private colleges. To be candid, even IITs struggle to get good faculty, especially the newer ones. How the hell will these private colleges get faculty?And what salaries do they pay the lecturers? A police sub-inspector (or maybe even a clerk) gets paid a higher salary. Many lecturers dream of becoming government clerk. What can you expect them to teach?And this is not the only problem:So what is the end result? This is the result:And how did we get here? By doing things the way we do everything in India. Please don’t be offended when you read further. I love the country and mean no offence, but facts are facts (unfortunately).As a society, we love shortcuts and being lazy. Before the private college explosion the B.Tech degree meant something. It was hard to get into an engineering college, but it was respected and only good students could get in.Then one day, some genius(es) decided that if B.Tech is so good, why don’t we make everyone a B.Tech? We totally forgot that B.Tech was valued because we screened and selected good students, and also gave them a somewhat decent education (we could debate that, though).So now everything became an engineering college. Random empty buildings and vocational training centers also became engineering colleges. Politicians looking for respectability, and businessmen looking to park their money became Engineering College owners! Most of these pioneers of technical education themselves never got any decent education. And we created this monster called ‘management quota’, which meant pay money and get a piece of paper which says ‘B.Tech’.In the process, we destroyed the B.Tech brand. We further showed the world that our engineering colleges are absolute crap. And you can’t trust us as a country. Our degrees are meaningless, and take it seriously only at your own peril.We also did injustice to these hapless students. Many of them are not interested in anything, but there are a few gems hidden in this crowd. We put them through the most depressing intellectual environment, and most come out of it with their confidence gone.The AICTE colluded in this destruction and people made money. They must have retired happily and built nice houses, and conducted lavish marriages for their children in high society.So what should we do now?Stop.Convert them into centers for vocational training or teaching computer programming or whatever skills industry is looking for. Let the B.Tech degree mean something again. Create minimum cut-offs for entrance into engineering programs. If the colleges are empty, let them shut down.

Deploying more troops won’t magically solve a conflict, we’ve learned that with the ‘surge’ in the Obama era. Warfare will still be common, civilians will still be caught in the crossfire, and people will still die. Stability will never be guaranteed in a war zone, extra deployment does not seem like an ample, permanent solution.The Taliban can always just run away into the mountains and come back later, they can lose tens of thousands of men over the course of the war and replace them with strong headed locals, they can be constantly on the move. Coalition troops however, can’t stay in Afghanistan forever, and the newly formed government is hard to work with, and untrained.This was just one of the many reasons that the Taliban are so hard to defeat in a conventional war, there are many other points of blame, such as the Taliban routinely fleeing to Pakistan, the natural terrain of Afghanistan itself, the immense opium trade that the Taliban specialize in, I could go on and on.In truth, we’ve found ourselves in a bit of a tight situation here, just as countless empires and movements have before, That’s why we’re failing in Afghanistan…","2,470 followers",Robert L Hill,1.2K,4.9K,8.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-should-we-prepare-ourselves-ahead-of-time-to-make-money-from-upcoming-metaverse-technologies

When it stopped producing milk, they had no intention of fighting and dying for the Afghan government.The US government spent billions in Afghanistan, but most of that money was likely siphoned off to private bank accounts, and did not make its way to ordinary Afghans. I am sure that there will be more than a few pro-American Afghans who will retire to very nice homes in Qatar with their families after the fall of Kabul.The long war in Afghanistan was just a scam which made lots of US military contractors rich, and some Afghans rich too. That is what happens when US voters believe that making business people their political leaders is good because they believe that government should be run like a for-profit business. The Afghan war was a 20-year business project with a lot of contractors, and American voters are the suckers because they got stuck with the bill. It’s that simple.This was exactly the same reason the US lost Cambodia and South Vietnam. I wish I could explain to you why the US media and most Americans have trouble understanding this simple fact, but I can’t.The Taliban were not fighting for money, but for their country.
