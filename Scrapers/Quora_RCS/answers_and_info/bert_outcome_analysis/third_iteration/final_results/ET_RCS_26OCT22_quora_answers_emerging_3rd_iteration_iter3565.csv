1,"It can lead to a depression, the last depression led to a world war, so who knows.The Spanish Flue was worse than the Covid-19 pandemic and had no major economical consequences, so in 1 year all may be back to normal. In America the rich use the pandemic to loot the treasury, which has worse consequences than the pandemic itself.

6,"In 2003 I was working for Cisco Systems and at the time we learned that the US Department of Defense had worked with Intel and other chip manufacturers to install in their hardware the ability to remotely disable any device using their technology with a certain radio frequency. Supposedly, this technology was used to help cripple the Iraqi air defense system when the US invaded.This was important to Cisco because we were working in security and cryptography and the NSA was forever trying to get us to corrupt our products so they could un-encrypt foreign transmissions on the fly.

Supposedly, this technology was used to help cripple the Iraqi air defense system when the US invaded.This was important to Cisco because we were working in security and cryptography and the NSA was forever trying to get us to corrupt our products so they could un-encrypt foreign transmissions on the fly. One time we were required to corrupt product that had been shipped to China and it started a major debate about our fiduciary responsibility to the country or to the customer. The issue was that if you sell a security product that you know is corrupted, you are knowingly committing fraud and are liable. As the Product Manager at the time I asked the NSA if they would stand behind us (and me as I might be personally liable) in court if we were discovered. Of course the answer from the NSA was “Hell no.”We were on our own. We then entered into a long debate about how to detect Easter eggs and other corruption introduced into security products unknowingly through another vendor’s corrupted hardware. The issue was never resolved but it should be known that our security source code HAD to be provided to the NSA in order to get FIPS certification and they made certain changes to it.So to answer your question, USA military technology is advanced far beyond anyone’s knowledge to describe the extent.On the other hand, the Chinese probably know more about our technology than we do since they perpetrated the greatest security breach in history by compromising the RSA key technology used by almost everyone in the world. We only learned of it through the vigilance of Lockheed-Martin who discovered the breach accidentally. But for months the Chinese had the key to almost every computer in the world.","115,125 followers",Daveed Phoenix,891,9.9K,160.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Could-the-Covid-19-pandemic-lead-to-a-new-dark-age-similar-the-that-of-the-Ancient-Greeks-Maybe-not-to-the-extent-that-we-lose-language-but-rather-the-advanced-technology-we-have-today

9,"We are already in the middle of a magnetic pole shift now. The Earth’s magnetic field is weakening, and the decrease of field strength is accelerating. The North Magnetic Pole is also moving from the Canadian Arctic towards Russia at a rate of about 40 miles per year, and that movement has also been accelerating. There are several research papers linking magnetic pole shifts to mass extinction events, but I think the real problem is that the magnetic pole shift is merely a precursor to a crustal displacement - a geophysical pole shift catastrophe in which the surface of the Earth moves suddenlWe are already in the middle of a magnetic pole shift now.

There are several research papers linking magnetic pole shifts to mass extinction events, but I think the real problem is that the magnetic pole shift is merely a precursor to a crustal displacement - a geophysical pole shift catastrophe in which the surface of the Earth moves suddenly into a new position over the core.I’ve written much more about the evidence in other Quora answers and in books and magazine articles about pole shift evidence. I’ve also written about cover-ups attempting to hide and dismiss the evidence so that most people keep working and don’t panic.Consider the North American ice cap - the Laurentide Ice Cap - that covered North America up until roughly 12,000 years ago. Mainstream science tells us there was an Ice Age then, and that is why glaciers came down to about 38 degrees North Latitude in the middle of the United States. But why was Siberia ice free at 70 degrees North, if global conditions were colder? The truth is, the North Pole was in Hudson Bay at the time. North America had an “Ice Age” because it was at the pole. Antarctica has an “Ice Age” now. (But there may be evidence from a previous civilization under the ice.) Even Africa and India have evidence of previous ice ages… but if the whole world had frozen to the equator, almost all life forms would have gone extinct. “Ice ages” affect regions which are near a pole at the time.We are lied to on this topic, and are told pole shifts are merely magnetic and that one hasn’t happened in something like 780,000 years. The truth is they are catastrophic, and they happen much more often, and they are the reason our recorded history doesn’t go back very far. But that information would be socially disruptive, so it is twisted and subverted.At the CURRENT speed of movement, the North Magnetic Pole will be deep inside Russia by the late 21st century. If it accelerates as it has been, the new magnetic poles could be established within decades. The evidence supports a cataclysmic pole shift will also happen this century.","135,533 followers",Hector Quintanilla,3.1K,1.2K,88.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-the-coming-pole-shift-is-going-to-eliminate-3-4-of-the-population-why-are-the-elite-still-trying-to-eliminate-us-with-their-advanced-technology
10,"No. ‘Planet’ is a term with a size value (that’s why Pluto was downgraded to a planetoid, or dwarf planet, with a diameter of only 2376.6 km, it isn’t big enough).
