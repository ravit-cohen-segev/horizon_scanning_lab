0,"A most excellent question. It’s not the same, in the school holidays me and my mates would be out on our skates from early morning to late at night when all the mums were calling us in for dinner (I used to get in to trouble for trying to sit at the dinner table with my skates on cause as soon as dinner was over I was the fuck outta there). I had a BMX and went over those handle bars so many times from burning another kid up that I may actually have a little bit of damage.

They spent pretty much all of their time in their rooms playing what ever the fuck it is they played, one got really fat and one got hooked on unnatural substances.Before we all moved to London I lived in the country - Towcester, Northampton - we used to play hide and seek in the woods behind my nan’s house, I used to get chucked in the river (character building) and locked in the damp, dark cellar (again - character building) and then have to get back to pick peas for dinner.We dared each other to eat worms, we made mud pies and we buried our pets in the back garden (they were dead obvs).I would not swap my child hood for all the internet and technology in the world.","87,307 followers",Shefali Naidu,9.4K,822,49.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Do-kids-play-outside-less-due-to-Internet-and-technology-compared-to-30-years-ago-or-is-it-about-the-same

""Technology"" spelled out in all its longer glory is still required in academic writing and formal communications—unless ""tech"" is part of a proper name or accepted as the usage for a particular purpose.For example, Texas Tech University's ""tech"" does not stand for ""technology."" It stems from its original name, Texas Technological College. If I were writing a formal paper, I would refer to it by its current and full proper name, Texas Tech University. After a first such reference, it would be acceptable to refer to it as ""Texas Tech"" or ""TTU"" in most cases.Some schools that have ""Tech"" in their names often have it as the short version of ""technical,"" whether as a formal name or as a nickname. Therefore, one can't always assume that ""tech"" represents the word ""technology."" It is an acceptable, less formal alternative for associated words.Thank you for the A2A.",1 follower,Dawn Amber,4.7K,141,8.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Do-kids-play-outside-less-due-to-Internet-and-technology-compared-to-30-years-ago-or-is-it-about-the-same
