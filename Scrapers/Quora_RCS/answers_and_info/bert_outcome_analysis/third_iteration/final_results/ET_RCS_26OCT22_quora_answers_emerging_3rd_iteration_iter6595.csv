0,"One way Homo sapiens have evolved is resistance to some nasty diseases, like the black plague. If a nasty disease develops anywhere it gets spread everywhere, except a few isolationist indigenes tribes.","21,773 followers",Glyn Williams,10.1K,9.1K,53.3M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Have-Homosapiens-evolved-significantly-since-their-earliest-counterparts-biologically-rather-than-technologically-adapting-to-their-environment
1,"Humans were dominant by 2 million years ago, long before our species of human (300,000 years ago). Still, we were meat sacks to predators anyway:“Humans were eaten by giant hyenas, cave bears, cave lions, eagles, snakes, other primates, wolves, saber-toothed cats, false saber-toothed cats, and maybe even—bless their hearts—Humans were dominant by 2 million years ago, long before our species of human (300,000 years ago). Still, we were meat sacks to predators anyway:“Humans were eaten by giant hyenas, cave bears, cave lions, eagles, snakes, other primates, wolves, saber-toothed cats, false saber-toothed cats, and maybe even—bless their hearts—In those few places where large predators are still common, primates, especially cute baby ones, are eaten with great frequency and alacrity. When our species evolved, human children were special only in as much as their hairlessness made them slightly easier to digest. Even today, where humans live alongside predators, both children and adults get eaten. Harry Greene, a herpetologist at Cornell University and one of a handful of my colleagues more likely to be eaten by a wild animal than to die of old age, and Thomas Headland, an anthropologist, recently conducted a study of Agta hunter-gatherers in the Philippines. Harry was excited to find that the Agta lived among a high density of pythons. The Agta tend to be not quite so excited; Greene and Headland found that one in four Agta men had been attacked by a”A study this year found that childrenI.e. we evolved traits due to being prey.",366 followers,Brett Alder,1.1K,0,0,2022,https://www.quora.com/Have-Homosapiens-evolved-significantly-since-their-earliest-counterparts-biologically-rather-than-technologically-adapting-to-their-environment
2,"There’s no such thing as a “homosapien”. The binomial for modern humans is Homo sapiens. Two words, the first capitalized, and the second not capitalized.Modern humans have evolved, but what you think as “significantly” is anyone’s guess. Evolution, even considerable evolutionary change can happen without much outward morphological change. Remember, evolution is not progression. It’s not improvement, or transitioning toward some goal. Evolution is genetic change in populations over generations. Genetic changes are not always changes in body shape, or size.Certain populations of humans have shoThere’s no such thing as a “homosapien”. The binomial for modern humans is Homo sapiens.

Evolution is genetic change in populations over generations. Genetic changes are not always changes in body shape, or size.Certain populations of humans have shown some physical adaptations to their environment. Probably one of the more visible changes is in skin color. People who live in areas near the Equator tend to have darker skin pigmentation than those who live closer to the poles. The is probably due to both protection against UV rays, and the need for Vitamin D synthesis from sunlight. Populations that live in the Arctic tend to be more stocky, with shorter limbs.Lactose tolerance in adulthood is another area where significant evolution has taken place in relatively recent times. Some populations are still largely lactose intolerant, but some groups have a higher incidence of lactose digestion.","246,865 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.5M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Have-Homosapiens-evolved-significantly-since-their-earliest-counterparts-biologically-rather-than-technologically-adapting-to-their-environment
3,"What is controlled evolution? Is that even possible?It’s another phrase for selective breeding, basically what we have been doing with our livestock and our crop plants for the last 10,000 years. So it’s not only possible, it’s absolutely common.",366 followers,Brett Alder,1.1K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Have-Homosapiens-evolved-significantly-since-their-earliest-counterparts-biologically-rather-than-technologically-adapting-to-their-environment
4,"That is the so called technological singularity: a point where technology Advances faster by itself than with human input.What we then get we don’t know, it can range from „all our problems are solved“ to „SkyNet“, the point is we will lose a bit of our freedom to the machines we created and if this is good or bad depends probably on us.",366 followers,Brett Alder,1.1K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Have-Homosapiens-evolved-significantly-since-their-earliest-counterparts-biologically-rather-than-technologically-adapting-to-their-environment
