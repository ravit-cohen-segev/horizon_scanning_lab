And If you think you can make the needle in your home.Now let me explainMechanical engineering is the discipline that includes/ involves/ combines/ overlapsmore than 30 disciplines.Future of Mechanical engineeringElectric VehiclesReplacement of the traditional internal combustion engine with cleaner, battery-powered systems brings new challenges regarding torque and energy loss, and the design of mechatronics to support new electrical system.Furthermore, as vehicle manufacturing becomes more automated, mechanical engineers will be front and centre in the design of robotics andNanoengineeringNanotechnology refers to the manipulation of materials at the smallest level. This rapidly growing field is one that offers abundant opportunities for mechanical engineers.In the years ahead, mechanical engineers are expected to be integral in using nanotechnology to:BiomechatronicsThe role of mechanical engineers in robotics is taken a step even further with the rapid growth of biomechatronics. This field, which seeks to merge body and machine, involves the design and testing of complex and intricate device architectures that mimic the body’s musculoskeletal design.Mechanical engineers will be primarily involved in the design of mechanical sensors, controllers, and actuators for biomedical devicesManufacturingManufacturing is an ever-evolving field. Mounting pressures to increase production efficiency while minimizing operating costs have fueled demand for new and innovative technologies.Automation and roboticsNon-of the engineering is dead end...Edit:1.0For people in the comment section asking the reason for high unemployment for Mechanical Engineers. To answer the questionThe Problem of unemployment is not only with Mechanical Engineers, but with the whole Industrial Sector.A lot of Electrical Engineers and Electronics Engineers are working in IT Services like TCS, Infosys, Wipro, CTS, IBM etc.Many Civil and Mechanical Engineers are either working in Banking Services or pursuing Teaching in Coaching Classes.Some are selling Credit CardsFortunate Ones are going to US, Germany, Netherland to pursue M.S.The reason for this is, after Independence Indian economy has shifted gradually from Agriculture Sector to Service Sector (be it formal or Informal) leavingAccordingly the Share of Workforce in the Industrial Sector also remained Stagnant.However, Total no of Engineering graduates each year has risen drastically leaving many graduates unemployed.As per National Employability report engineers annual report 2019, Approximately 80 percent of Indian engineering graduates are not employable in the current knowledge-driven economy. This signify the pathetic condition of engineering education in India. Some major initiative in the direction of quality of education, is the need of the hour.What are Future Prospects of Industrial SectorIt has already been perceived our Government that Industrial & Manufacturing growth is the best route for overall economic development.Make In India, Skill Development, Start-up India, Stand-up India, Entrepreneurship Skill Development Program are some of the examples.Under Make in India thrust sectors have been identified to provide a push to manufacturing and Start-up India to strengthen the start-up ecosystem.The Ease of Doing Business initiative aims to create a conducive environment by streamlining existing regulations and processes and eliminating unnecessary requirements and procedures.Foreign Direct Investment policy and procedures have been simplified and liberalised progressively.Hope Future Industrial Sector is Bright, Everyone will be Employed !.Thank you Ayana Vini for pointing this out..Edit-2.0For people contending that the rate of innovation in Computer Science and Electronics is much higher and there is very less innovation in Mechanical engineering.I agree that the rate of innovation in computer science and electronics is far than the mechanical engineering.I totally agree.However, There is a world beyond the computer too. We can not eat data, we can not wear motherboard and we can not brush our teeth with a transistor & we can not drive a mouse.What i mean to say that for the innovations in computer science and electronics to use practically we always have to have a base. Where will we use those innovations ?? We will use these innovation in electronics over a car, or robot, or drone or rocket or spaceship or aeroplane , helicopter, fighter plane or any other equipment which must have a chance of using Mechanical engineering and we can witness the innovations in these technologies, can’t we?The rate of innovations in computer science and electronics is higher because these are new for the humanity. Both came into existence in the later 20th century and innovation has just picked up in the last decade. Hence, everything is new for us and we are able to perceive the little changes in it. Like after every 6 months we see a new smart phone with some new technology. There are millions of Applications releasing everyday. It looks quite fascinating to us, isn’t it ?However, we have been unable to see the innovations in materials. We don’t know about carbon fiber. We have ignored these innovations in Biomechanics.AWe have no idea about innovation in the field of Fluid dynamics because we can not feel it.There are innovations in mechanical Engineering too.The world is dreaming about a flying car, an smart robot, smart machines, and smart materials.There are huge innovation in nanotechnology, robotics, biomechanics going on.And i hope that in the NEXT EPIDEMIC like CORONA virus our worriers will be smart robots equipped with artificial intelligence ( off course credit goes to computer science), who will be carrying the infected to the hospitals and operating them.And in the coming time biotechnology is going to take over both Computer Science and Electronics Engineering as world has started witnessing biological warfare.Where as Mechanical Engineering will keep growing with the slow pace like a tortoise!Regards,ReferenceImage Source -phone gallery & GoogleMechanical engineering - Wikipedia4 Things to Expect for the Future of Mechanical Engineeringhttps://www.gedcouncil.org/sites/default/files/Engineering+Education+in+India+Dec1608-1.pdfDATA STORY | 80% of Indian engineering graduates not employable, says surveyIndia struggles but Bangladesh's GDP rides high on manufacturing, export boomKey Initiatives for Industrial Development Post GST and Demonetisation",46 followers,Chandrasekar Sankar,9.3K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-are-the-emerging-product-based-software-startups-in-India-Where-are-these-entrepreneurs-and-what-exciting-technologies-are-they-working-on

Do not be afraid of the complex differential equations.Trying to visualise any situation involving these equations will make life easier for you.Do not solely depend on mathematical knowledge,visualise it's application to the real world.Do you know how many differential equations come into play when a footballer kicks the ball?Solid mechanics,fluid mechanics,theory of elasticity ….all of these will be jumbled up.If you look up any research paper,this simple thing like kicking a football will blow your mind.Thus,Try not to complicate simpler things.4.Be it mechanical or any other engineering,Team management is very important.Be a leader.Be it in your lab groups or project groups,be the one to take everyone forward.If you want to venture into corporate life,this sense of leadership can take you to places.5.Be updated.About almost everything we learn in our course text books are technologies which are way to old for the modern world.So when you step out of college into real life,you are clueless..Watch Discovery Science,National Geographic…stay updated with the technologies incorporated in building the modern marvels,be it the Airbus A380,or the Underground Metro..6.Welcome change.Mechanical engineering does not mean simply sticking to machines and cars.In this current scenario ,biomimetics,geophysics ,material research and many more areas require knowledge of mechanical engineering.so don't be afraid if machines are your nightmare.Genetic engineering may come to your rescue.So always welcome the interdisciplinary approach to engineering,because every major project requires all types of minds and need a leader to work them through.I hope this was satisfactory.Do Upvote and share if you liked it.All the best.","8,709 followers",Mukunda Madhava Nath,689,543,3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-are-the-emerging-product-based-software-startups-in-India-Where-are-these-entrepreneurs-and-what-exciting-technologies-are-they-working-on
