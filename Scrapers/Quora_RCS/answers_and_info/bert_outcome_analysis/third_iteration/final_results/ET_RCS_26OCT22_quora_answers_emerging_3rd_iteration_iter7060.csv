0,"In the early 80’s (~35 years ago), I was a graduate student in an US university. There was a scholarship offered to qualified students that would cover all expenses. There was a condition attached to it. One had to be a US citizen to get it.

There was a scholarship offered to qualified students that would cover all expenses. There was a condition attached to it. One had to be a US citizen to get it. The scholarship went unclaimed as the graduate student population consisted of mostly Indians, some Chinese and some from other nations, all on student visas. I don’t think the situation is any different now in terms of make up of nationalities in advanced education in USA. Now I work for a top semi-conductor company and when I hire or recommend someone, I look for prospective employees with at least a Master’s degree. Guess which nationality I end up hiring or recommending?My kids have gone through their schooling here and they are on their way to pursuing advanced degrees. During their schooling I have watched with sadness many students drop out of school. Some are likely to have had some type of hardship to pursue education. What about the rest? If they don’t pursue education, what are they expecting to do when they become adults? The business of the future (or even today) will require advanced technical knowledge to be successful. Who will fill the knowledge gap if the American kids don’t gear up?Though I see anguish at the political and senior management level about the lack of qualified workers in US and some talk about or even experiment with improving the situation, in my opinion there is something more fundamental at play. When I was coaching a Robotics team in my kid’s middle school a number of years ago, the class teacher lamented that most students either don’t show up or when they do they are distracted by other things. I still remember the comment I made to him. I think it still applies today.The primary factor I saw then and still see today is lack of parental participation in their children’s education. Road to a better future starts at home. If parents think the future they see is good enough, their kids are not encouraged to do anything better.The secondary factor is Community. When we as a community don’t celebrate academic excellence, but waste no time in celebrating sport events, achievements in arts (TV, Hollywood, etc.), the kids do get the message that academics are not a priority.",51 followers,Charles Knouse,1.3K,3K,1.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-technology-companies-in-the-U-S-mostly-hire-Indian-technologists-engineers-and-developers

They will go to any extreme to just get up and aboveMost of the H1B’s are people from middle to lower middle class and they feel that they have done something big as soon as they are in US.Why does this happen - As a child any average kid is exposed to such a harsh upbringing where he is always compared to others and this comparison leads him to desperately look for an opportunity where he/she can prove it to his friends, family, parents and above all himself a sense of achievement.They will come to US at sub optimal salaries, will stay in pigeon holes. Will happily face discrimination at work( Don’t you guys give me gyaan here). Will not take leaves, will work 80 hours for 40 hours pay and cry like a baby if asked to go back. In a nut shell the continuity to stay in US will make them do anything in life.In reality they are only ruining their career in most of the cases. They could have done bigger and better stuff at home.Hence when you have such a high venerable population available companies hire them.Americans are too proud and are aware of the laws of work. They treat companies as employers and work without FEAR.I hate to write the below ending but“the psychology of Indian’s is no different from the AF who worked in plantations during 1700’s”Talent level and industries have changed the psychology hasn’t evolved yet.Sorry India - you need to up your game to make your population feel proud to contribute at home. You need a new Ghandhi who can help you achieve independence from the clutches of everything foreign.","45,637 followers",David Seidman,1.5K,3.6K,85.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-technology-companies-in-the-U-S-mostly-hire-Indian-technologists-engineers-and-developers

5,"I was fired from a position at Apple that I had had for nearly nine years.About a month before hand, I was put on an ""Improvement Plan"" whereby my manager assigned me to some small, ""busywork"" project. I had to check in weekly on progress on the project, however it is clear in hindsight that my manager had already made up his mind and was just going through the required motions to cover his (and Apple's) ass.The month passed, and I had met all of the criteria that he had laid out for the project. So I believed that I was out of the woods. The next week, I had my normal 1-on-1 with him, and absI was fired from a position at Apple that I had had for nearly nine years.About a month before hand, I was put on an ""Improvement Plan"" whereby my manager assigned me to some small, ""busywork"" project. I had to check in weekly on progress on the project, however it is clear in hindsight that my manager had already made up his mind and was just going through the required motions to cover his (and Apple's) ass.The month passed, and I had met all of the criteria that he had laid out for the project. So I believed that I was out of the woods. The next week, I had my normal 1-on-1 with him, and absolutely nothing was mentioned about the Improvement Plan.The following week (i.e. two weeks after the ""Improvement Plan"" was over), at the time of my normal 1-on-1 with him, he came to my office with *his* manager. They came in, closed the door behind them and handed me a letter, saying, ""read this.""The letter stated that I was being let go, and that I *hadn't* met his requirements. Nothing said *which* requirement I hadn't met. I told him that this was a surprise, and that up until that moment, I thought I was doing well. I asked him what requirement I had failed to meet and he literally said nothing; just stood there blank-faced.I spend the next few hours, deleting Apple data from my personal laptop (VPN software, source code, etc.) as well as wiping the work-provided machines. I then had to turn in my iPhones, iPads and badge and clear my personal stuff from my office (good thing I took the SUV to work that morning; an office tends to accumulate a lot of junk over nine years :) ). I was not allowed to interact with anyone else for this time; I couldn't even say good bye. As far as anyone else was concerned, I had simply vanished.In many ways, I should have seen it coming; my manager had become increasingly rude and hostile; leveling overly harsh criticisms that no other manager had ever had for me, but I had given him the benefit of the doubt (we were all under a lot of pressure leading up to the release of two big products; I naïvely assumed that it would pass once the pressure let up). I interpreted his hostility as a misguided attempt to motivate me (this was his first job as a manager). When eating lunch with the team, or during meetings, he always behaved as if he was our friend; he was careful to only be insulting or hostile when we were alone (going as far as saying that ""nobody respects you anymore"").Having never been fired from a job before, I don't have any experience to compare this to, so I can't say if it's any different from the way firings are handled at smaller companies. Ultimately, it was a blessing in disguise; I treated the following two and a half months of unemployment as a vacation; I had plenty of savings, I went to Mexico for a week with my wife, and I spent a bunch of time at home with my children. After the end of that period, I had a job at another well-known tech company, making nearly $20K/year more.The lessons I took away from this:Update: I am actually back at Apple, in a different department. Being let go from Apple can actually be a blessing in disguise:Getting fired in Silicon Valley is not the end of the world, and provided you haven’t burned any bridges, the demand for your skills is more than enough to allow you to bounce back.
