1,"The first fireworks were firecrackers, small tubes filled with gunpowder that exploded with a bang.Then - or maybe at the same time - there were rockets, simple tubes packed with gunpowder that flew into the air. These were enhanced by adding coarse charcoal or powdered iron to the mix, to leave a visible trail of sparks. Rockets were in turn advanced by adding “headers”, essentially a firecracker on a rocket that exploded in the air. Instead of a simple gunpowder filling, the headers contained pressed pellets of powder and charcoal or iron, the first stars, leaving trails of sparks in the skyThe first fireworks were firecrackers, small tubes filled with gunpowder that exploded with a bang.Then - or maybe at the same time - there were rockets, simple tubes packed with gunpowder that flew into the air.

Rockets were in turn advanced by adding “headers”, essentially a firecracker on a rocket that exploded in the air. Instead of a simple gunpowder filling, the headers contained pressed pellets of powder and charcoal or iron, the first stars, leaving trails of sparks in the sky.Mortars came next, essentially guns that shot the headers into the air without the aid of a rocket. Here’s an old woodcut of a firework display at Nurnberg, Germany in 1650. The artist has shown the shells with a curly rising tail, since they would have been spinning, and the rockets with a straight tail. The headers are all the same. This is typical of illustrations from the period. (Photo taken from Brock -Apart from rockets and shells there were also fountains, some huge and elaborate, and often fired from a “castle” or set piece. There wouldn’t have been much variation in the appearance of these fireworks - just orange or yellow sparks but no color. The oxidizer used was potassium nitrate and it didn’t burn hot enough to produce colors from metal salts. Some work with color was revealed by Claude-Fortune Ruggieri in his bookIn the late 18th Century, potassium chlorate was discovered. At first it was used in military applications, looking for a gunpowder substitute, but was so fiercely reactive that a number of people were killed in experiments and others were afraid to touch it. The first mention of its use in fireworks was in an article by James Cutbush in thePotassium chlorate has a well deserved bad reputation. Mixed with sulfur or sulfide salts, it is extremely sensitive to shock and friction and if the mixture is allowed to rest damp, it can self ignite. Numerous spectacular accidents and deaths resulted, and in 1875 the British government took the step of banning completely any firework compositions that had both chlorate and sulfur, and imposing safety rules that kept the two well apart. Other countries took note and while they may not have made it illegal, firework factories everywhere have two completely separate production lines, one for gunpowder type mixtures containing sulfur, and one for color compositions containing chlorate.With the later development of potassiumThe last and most recent development in firework chemistry was the introduction of aluminum and titanium. Aluminum only became cheap enough around 1900. Magnesium had been used, and occasionally still is, but it reacts with nitrates so it has to be carefully handled. Aluminum on the other hand is quite safe and burns with almost the same intensity. Titanium has been available since the start of the space program. It burns with an intense white flame and is mainly used as a coarse powder, leaving a trail of intense white sparks behind a star.That’s by no means a complete account, and research still goes on into new effects. I haven’t even touched on thermite, which is the core of the dandelion head bursts that seem to be in all Chinese fireworks recently. But it covers the main points.","66,693 followers",Dima Vorobiev,8.2K,4.2K,139M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Has-clothing-technology-evolved-at-what-extent
2,The Chernobyl reactor was poorly designed such that it became unstable in certain conditions of its operation. This was known at the time. So the answer is to design reactors so they cannot become unstable like that.

6,"Computer technology and programming languages are different things.New programming languages, frameworks, libraries pop up all the time.

Web developers build software that runs on a web server and is controlled via the browser.Web developers in 2017 still build software that runs on the same technology that was around 22 years agoEven if we account for different stacks such as Node.js which can run independently (although commonly paired with nginx), the programming paradigms are still similar to traditional software development. An experienced developer will become productive 10x faster than a beginner in programming that’s just starting out.Software engineering is about solving business problems through technology. New programming languages or frameworks introduce some learning curve which is negligible for an experienced programmer.The actual art of programming revolves around understanding computer architectures and operating systems, writing algorithms managing different data structures, optimizing for performance and stability. As long as you’ve spent enough time building production code, in at least a couple different programming languages, switching to a new one isn’t that much of a challenge.",602 followers,Joe Seabreeze,560,576,2.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-has-the-technology-behind-fireworks-evolved-over-time
7,"First, yes, computers evolve rapidly, but I think the effects of it are less dramatic now than in the 1980s or 1990s for example.Also, software development in general doesn’t evolve that quickly. Software is basically constructed the same way today as it was 10 or even 20 or 30(!) years ago.Sure, companies of extreme scale, like Google and Facebook, have been forced to solve software - and hardware - problems which no one had solved before because they were the first to reach such scale.But in general, few companies are “revolutionary” and therefore don’t need super revolutionary software.So,First, yes, computers evolve rapidly, but I think the effects of it are less dramatic now than in the 1980s or 1990s for example.Also, software development in general doesn’t evolve that quickly.
