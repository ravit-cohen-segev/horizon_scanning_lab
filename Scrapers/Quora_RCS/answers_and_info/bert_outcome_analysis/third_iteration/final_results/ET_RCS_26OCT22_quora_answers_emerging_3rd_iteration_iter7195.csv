This verification process is completed by the computers connected to the network, each of which independently checks to ensure that the trade is legitimate.Once verified, each transaction is added to a block that gets hashed. “Blocks” are basically groups of transaction records, and each one is unique. Each block also carries a code known as a hash value (or hash digest),The hash also ensures the integrity of the data to show that it hasn’t been modified since it was recorded in the block.Once complete, the block is added to the end of the blockchain. This brings us to the end of the blockchain creation and verification process.

If someone creates a new currency called the X dollar, how can we trust that they won't give themselves a million X dollars, or steal your X dollars for themselves?Bitcoin was designed to solve this problem by using a specific type of database called a blockchain.

Blockchain is different because nobody is in charge; it’s run by the people who use it.

Then read the bitcoin whitepaper and learn why is it different from the normal paxos algorithm. That should equip you with enough foundational knowledge to evaluate blockchain technologies, and find ways to implement them in real world scenarios.Make sure you are comfortable with programming, internet protocols, basic cryptographic algorithms, consensus algorithms, and basic distributed computing principles.

The reason is that sinceBlockchain and Data Science are emerging as among the most popular technology trends. It is an undeniable fact that every company needs to have secure records of financial transaction data. Simultaneously, the need to expand the services and products of a company by targeted advertisement is fulfilled by the application of Data Science.Let us learn more about these vital technological applications and compare them:Blockchain vs Data ScienceThough Blockchain is considered to be a recent technological application, it could be described as the missing piece of the puzzle. The reason is that since Blockchain entered the digital world, its direct impact is seen in the transaction systems across all the domains. Blockchain is a concept used in many other fields as well. The reason that makes the area unique is that it works on the principle of Consensus Problem.Coming to Data Science, this field deals with analytics. It means the discovery, interpretation, and communication of meaningful patterns in data. Finding solutions to a problem by analysing a large amount of data to bring out efficient production and services to clients. Problem-solving abilities have always existed, but with the help of computational power, there has been a significant boost to evaluate solutions for Marketing, Finance, Human Resources, Health Care, Government Policies and every possible industry where data gets generatedScope Of BlockchainThe use of Blockchain does not restrict only to financial services. Since the idea of Blockchain is to maintain a series of time-stamped recorded data, it can be used in other services such as the medical sector. In the pharmaceutical industry, it can be used to make medical records of patients that are organised with accurate data and sorted according to patient history.Furthermore, in the property sector, land records that can be dealt with Blockchain as the ownership of a piece of land can change multiple times. To have a time-stamped series of data helps in data sorting and verifying the ownership in property-related matters. Moreover, Blockchain Developers can easily earn around INR 10 LPA and above.Other fields of Blockchain application include:Scope Of Data ScienceIn the simplest of terms, Data Science is a concept based on the union of three multidisciplinary fields, namely:Data Science uses various aspects of these three disciplines and evolves into a profession which requires one to work closely with data. Mining of data, analysing it, drawing patterns and interpreting them are expected from a Data Scientist. The theme “Data Science for prediction and Blockchain for Data Integrity” makes things clear. Undeniably, Data Science has a lot of applications but therein lies the limitations as well. Data Science can be used only as long as the input data is genuine. The sorting and processing of data while applying algorithms and statistical inputs is a massive computational task. But the exciting catch here is that Blockchain, too, to an extent, works on data with more straightforward computational efforts.Requirements Of Data ScienceAlthough every field under Computer Science has its application, there are some fields which require extra efforts and thorough knowledge of many languages and concepts. You need to know your way around Spark, Hadoop, Hive, Pig, SQL, Neo4J, MySQL, Python, R, Scala, Tensorflow, A/B Testing, NLP. Because of these high criteria, many Data Scientists are not delighted with their jobs as the expectations do not meet reality. It is estimated that many ML specialists and Data Scientists were looking for new job opportunities.Requirements Of BlockchainBlockchain has relatively less complicated concepts to deal with. Majorly, it involves concepts related to distributed databases and cryptography. Furthermore, Blockchain requires basic languages taught at the graduation level, such as Java, Golang, Rust, Scala, Haskell, Erlang, Python, C, C++, C#. The critical point to note is that anyone can gain these skills in 3 months and start working on professional development level in maybe 10–12 months.How To Learn?Although Blockchain plays such a vital role in many domains, it is not taught as a distinct subject in Universities and Colleges.There are many online educational sources such as upGrad where there are high-quality tutorials and blogs to make the concept easier to learn. Since these decisions impact your future, it is critical to choose a domain which you are passionate about and can reach a dynamic career growth.","31,159 followers",Phillip Remaker,1.7K,11K,78.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/I-want-to-learn-more-and-be-a-blockchain-programmer-where-should-I-start

Free free to ask questions about our choices in the comments.Our games:Focused on iOS for now. 70% of mobile revenue comes through apple, while apple holds only 30% of the install base over all smartphones globally. That means android has a lot of users, but most of them are not willing to spend money.3D is expensive, so we went with a 2D engine. There are more artists we can collaborate with that do high quality 2D than there are for good 3D.Cocos2D gave us the best touch control API. We felt like we could do more with cocos2D than Unity.Objective-C is a bit easier to program in than C++, so we choose Objective-C. This locked us into the apple platform. However looking back, we should have used C++. It will take some time to port our in-house tools to C++ so we can expand to Android.TexturePacker, great tool by Code'n Web. Just drop your 2D sprites in and it will compact, compress, and compile them for you to use in Cocos2D.Particle Designer, great tool by 71Squared. Makes it super ease to build particle systems and to overlay them over each other to have a quick view of what they might look like in-game.In other to make our lives easier, we made an engine on top of cocos2D. It does quite a few things for us. Sorry, these are propriety. Hopefully it gives you a sense of how a game studio needs to invent their own tools to be productive.TouchOrganizer, a library that collects and algorithmically sorts multi-touch into individual touch point objects. This allows us to track multi-tap, single-double-multiple repeats, drag-drop-hold over 11 touch points (iOS hardware max).Cutscenes Scripting Engine, a library that allows us to script cutscenes animation sequences. Works by keyframes and simplifies the programming process so that non-programmers can participate on the content pipeline.Data manager, a globally accessible datastructure that allows us to quickly toggle and change values to control game flow.GUI manager, a push-pop dialog management library. Makes development much easier and faster. Allows us to prototype dialogs and gui in a few minutes.Distributed CDN engine, we can leverage multiple CDNs at the same time. Effectivilitly purchasing their lowest (usually free) pricing teir and create a stable and highly available CDN download for update files.C++ based backend server for data management and transfer. Used to be a server guy, so we built a highly scalable client management system we're trying out in our next game. Excited :)A lot of others: CSV file reader, encryption, state machines, TcpIp stuff, parsers, pathing A* libraries, etc...Operationally we use the following services because they are stable, powerful, and inexpensive.Google apps for email and domain.Dropbox for shared filesMediaFire for more shared filesGoogle Drive for more shared files!!We also use DropBox for prototyping, we load screenshots on the Dropbox app and tap on it as if it were implemented.Unfuddle for SVN source code control.Google analyticsTrello for to do tasks as a teamFor everyday tasks, everyone at the studio uses TaskCat.
