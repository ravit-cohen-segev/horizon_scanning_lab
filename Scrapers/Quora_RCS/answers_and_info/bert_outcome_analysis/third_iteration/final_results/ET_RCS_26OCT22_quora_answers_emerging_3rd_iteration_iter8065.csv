1,"Hi!It is incorrect to say that BARC is not successful. Our nuclear programme, which includes the development and maintenance of nuclear reactors for power generation as well as for powering the INS Arihant submarine, were developed by BARC scientists. Till date, we have not had even one major accident in any of our nuclear power plants, which is a testament to the success of our nuclear programme. Given the strategic nature of our nuclear assets, the activities of BARC are shrouded in secrecy, which is why their successes are rarely publicized, unlike ISRO.",714 followers,Deepraj Chandra,1.5K,516,1.7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-BARC-not-as-successful-as-ISRO

We would publish the best ads for each company in the “category” part of a special section we ran, and then we’d have a “best overall ad” in each category.Let me explain newspaper ads for a second. Every ad a newspaper runs has an ad number on it. We use this for things like billing and in case the company wants to run the ad again, so if (say) Burger Haven does a Memorial Day ad that talks about their special summer hours and they run it every year, all we’ve got to do is feed the ad number into our system and it pops right up. We’ve got ads we’ve run for twenty years that we handle that way. Somewhere on the ad there’ll be the number.Well…we got one entry that was REALLY well done, way too well done for a student to have pulled off. It had an ad number on it, so we typed that number into the system and the exact same ad came up. The kid cut an ad out of the newspaper, stuck it on his entry form, ran the form through a copier so you couldn’t see he’d done what he did and turned it in. Yes, we called the school.

However, I had heard my fair share of freshman who unfortunately and stupidly questioned his legitimacy as a professor because of this.The courses were extremely challenging and you had to be quite passionate about and talented in 3D Modeling to get through. This is one reason I am still so flabbergasted that someone tried to get away with what they did.For an end of the quarter final assignment, which we were supposed to spend the majority of the quarter working on, we were meant to turn in a 3D model of a scene of nature. One guy brought in a beautiful scene of a spider and its web in a jungle.The guy went up to turn the paper in to B and as soon as B laid his eyes on it he declared to the student that it was plagiarism. The student assumed that the issue was that through all of what the student had presented that quarter, he doesn’t believe he made this piece. The student argued, expressing that he worked very hard on this and for many hours. He was proud of his work and he was hurt that B would question it. He asked why B would think this project wasn’t his.Then B said he knew the project was plagiarized becauseThe student had downloaded the image from a 3D animation collection in a forum online, cut off the artist’s username, and tried turning it in as his own. No changes, no edits, not even a project file. Little did he know that this username, which consisted of something along the lines of PunkBitch, was that of his very own Professor B who shared his work online.It would have been bad luck if a professor merely found the source of your plagiarism.

We had quite a few incidents of cheating, but here were two of the worst.1.Every year, the major project was to implement the RSA algorithm.

He waited until after the new class would be assigned this project and then posted hisWhat the little genius hadn't planned on was that professor didn't assign the project this year. He only assigned one tiny piece of it—about five lines of code, instead of hundreds.We expected some students to copy the relevant lines of code from Jackson’s project. Whatever—it was only a few lines of code, and homework was only worth 10% of your grade. Plus, we wouldn't be able to even detect cheating here. The assignment was so short even identical code could be a coincidence.Know what can't be a coincidence? SubmittingThat's right. When all the other students were walking up to the class to turn in a single sheet of paper with a few lines of code, “Chris” submitted 10 pages of code, copied verbatim from the class forum, where the only change was his name. It was an astounding lack of common sense—only beaten by the second story.2.“Jason”, the Head TA that year, controlled the grade books. This was known to the students.Just before he's about to submit them to the professor, Jason gets an email from “Paul”, another TA:Dear Jason,Please change Gary Smith’s quiz and exam scores as follows: Quiz 1: …; Quiz 3: …; Quiz 5: …; Quiz 6: …; Quiz 7: …; Quiz: …; Exam 1: …PaulNo explanation given for why Paul was requesting a change to over half of the quizzes and exams.Hmm. Hmm. Hmmmmmmm.Okay, so there were a few problems here:Jason hit reply to Paul’s email (I imagine it said something like “hahahahaha”), Jason’s phone rang a few minutes later, and all hell broke loose.An investigation of Gary ensued.> It wasn't me! Someone's been sending me emails with racial slurs. See? Racial slurs! It was probably them, trying to frame me by improving my grades because they hate Asians.Cool, let's take a look at your computer to make sure the email didn't originate from there.> uh, it's in storage for the summer. I'll have to retrieve it when I get back.[Investigators finally get the computer] We see here that the email, as well as those racist ones, originated from your computer.> Someone hacked into my computer!We just pulled the logs for your dorm and see that you had entered your building 20 minutes earlier.> Maybe I was in my friend’s room and someone broke into my room to send the email.Your computer is password protected.Did you check for a key logger?Yes, we do see that a key logger was installed.> See? FRAMED.We also see the install date on the key logger. It was installed well after the email was sent.> Maybe they changed the date on the computer before install?Okay so someone got access to your computer somehow, changed the date, then installed a key logger, then changed the date back. Then later, while you were in the building but in a different room, got on your computer to send you racist emails, and also sent one to these TAs. They also apparently knew the class well enough to know the email formatting and list of exams.>Please leave our university.Common sense, folks…","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,20.5K,6.8K,91.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-worst-example-of-plagiarism-youve-seen-as-a-teacher

They also state that ‘[another long verbatim quote, also cited properly]’.” Yes, you’ve cited your quotes, so it’s not plagiarism. However, it fails to show that you actually understood a damn thing.But the worst was a student whose paper was about a research topic that I myself have professionally researched and written on. . . and as I read it, something sounded extremely familiar. The paper began citing references that I knew the student could not possibly have used, because they were (a) not available online at the time, (b) not available anywhere in the US outside a few major research libraries, and (c) not in English.

They were all precisely the same, including this phantom “L”.All except for one student - the best student in the class.

Students gave me glowing answers of how they had worked together so hard and found “L” through considerable effort.I played along.I praised their dedication. I extolled the virtues of their morality in making sure they each did their own work. They were practically patting themselves on the back.Then I put the PowerPoint back up.I said “Hmmm, that’s odd…I wonder how you all gotThe room got very quiet. I tried to talk to them. I tried to extol the virtues of honesty and integrity. I tried to tell them they were only cheating themselves.But I just couldn’t say anything.That class was never the same again.After that I stopped assigning homework altogether. I tried various other strategies - oral defense, all classwork, participation stamping. You name it. But kids always seemed to find ways to cheat, and always seemed to do so with impunity. When I finally found a way to essentially prevent cheating (a combination of oral defense and random call-back / question selection), students just stopped doing homework altogether. Their grades plummeted, and I got in trouble for failing too many students.Sigh.So now I occasionally assign homework. I collect it and grade it if it’s done or not. But it isn’t worth much, and it rarely determines a student’s grade. I write Python programs that create unique versions of tests for each student so that they cannot cheat. I’m working on that for homework, too, but it’s a lot of work.I’m sad just thinking back on this incident - it was the day my innocence as a teacher died. I knew kids cheated before this, but until this day I had never watched a whole classroom lie right to my face like that. Losing homework as a tool weakened me as a teacher, and weakened our school as a place of learning. Most other teachers in my building have since come to the same conclusion, or else they just don’t care to look that closely.Today, 10 years after this event, my students are chronically tardy and absent, often refuse to do even the most trivial work, and experience a diluted and simplified version of what I once taught. If I write something on the board, when I turn around a dozen phones have materialized and are actively being typed on. When I try to do fun things like labs and projects, the students complain and mope as if I was walking them to prison. They lament (out loud) how awful it is that they just can’t look up the answers like all the other classes. Mr. C. actually makes usIt makes me wonder how many diamonds in the rough I’ve missed. It makes me wonder how many students I’ve cheated by not having the heart (or the ability) to continue on as I did, pushing them all hard to find the few who are truly masterful.

Still, one paper didn’t sit right with me. It was an analysis of the Ku Klux Klan in Saskatchewan, but seemed a bit far above the reaches of first year students.I had a friend who had written his Master’s thesis on precisely that topic, so I took the paper to him and asked for his comments. He was enthusiastic about the writing, the research and the conclusions, and explained this was because it was a chapter in his thesis lifted intact and in total.When I met with the two students to discuss the paper, I suggested the paper was interesting, however I would have expected a few more acknowledgements of source documents. They began to explain all the research they had personally undertaken, both of the literature and interviews of people their parents knew. I quietly interrupted this explanation by taking a copy of my friend’s thesis from my shelf and setting it on the table in front of them. It stopped the flow of conversation.My next question was what they thought I should do about this clear example of plagiarism. They looked at each other sheepishly, and finally asked for an opportunity to rewrite the paper. I had discussed this with my professor and we had agreed the solution should be something which didn’t damage their careers, but which made sure they recognized the implications of what they had done. I was thus able to agree with their proposal with certain conditions; obviously it had to be their own work, returned within a short time line and they had to each turn in a paper.

Instead, there were understandings, such as if you are late you will always be punished for it, the room will be cleaned and the desks aligned every day during homeroom, and when I’m talking, you’re not. In general, though, the whole class was built on common sense expectations. By the time they reach Middle School, kids know what good behavior looks like.For those who failed, I have what I call themes. Themes are short essays over a narrow topic. These topics in particular are pulled from the Marine Corps leadership traits, which were developed, as I say, to help young Marines make smart decision when there are no senior Marines around to help them. They are Judgement, Justice, Dependability, Initiative, Decisiveness, Tact, Integrity, Enthusiasm, Bearing, Unselfishness, Courage, Knowledge, Loyalty, and Endurance. When a kid messes up in my class, I assign them the appropriate theme. A kid might call another student stupid, “Jacob. You owe me a Loyalty.” Another might go to sleep in class - Initiative. Forgets their homework or to bring their supplies to class - Dependability. I have no rules, but I can give you a theme for just about anything. Immediately, their name goes on my board next to the theme.Of course, it isn’t as easy as just writing a simple paper. The paper is three paragraphs; the first tells me what that trait means, the second tells me how they failed to show it, and the third explains how they will show it in the future to never get in trouble. Then the real work starts. They write the paper, then I proofread it, give it back, and they have to rewrite it. This cycle keeps repeating until they turn in a paper free of errors. It’s more about getting them to think, and then repeat it to themselves over and over. I believe Pavlov would approve. After finally getting it right, which can take days, they get to take their name off my board and posted it to a clipboard I had hanging up called the “Lessons Learned Board”. Marines will appreciate that last part. You’d be shocked at how well this process has improved both my classroom management and my literacy test scores.That said, this answer is about cheaters.Well, once there were two girls named London and Rayanna. London earned a theme at one point for doing something wrong. She finished it and turned it in. A while later, Rayanna did something similar and was “awarded” the same theme. As I was reading Rayanna’s, my good teacher spidey sense started acting up. Déjà vu? Then it hit me… what if children are sometimes sneaky?!I started looking through the Lessons Learned and remembered London pulling hers out for reasons that I didn’t think about at the time. She was nosey and into things. What I did I care? Then I started comparing.Line by line, the exact same theme. Mr. Davis wasn’t happy. After the next class that I had them both, I pulled them over.“Well, girls, you’ll be happy to know that I finished Rayanna’s theme. It was really well written. What do you think of that?”They shyly smiled, not sure what to say, nor why I pulled them in just to tell them about this.“Rayanna, you did such a good job on it. Would you like to tell me how you did that?”“Ummm… I don’t know.” she said, looking down at her feet.“Oh, I see. I’m just such a really good teacher. Is that it?”“Yes, Sir.”“Right… and there is nothing else you girls want to tell me?”“No, Sir.”I paused and gave them time to make that their final answer.“I see.

I then said that plagiarism was an instant F for the assignment, and with his low grade average and poor class attendance, this would mean failure for the course.

I also use Safe Assign.Students also can use sites that can alter a plagiarized paper into something more palatable so a busy teacher can miss these things. However, I find plagiarism always gets caught—if not by me, it will get caught by someone else. I had another student who probably plagiarized papers, but I missed it. The instructor who had her after me did not, and showed me her work. She wondered how I missed it. Sometimes it happens.
