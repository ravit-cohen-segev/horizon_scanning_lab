Under rent-seeking governments like those, little investment was made in research and development or higher education.By contrast, the Jews were chased out their homeland about 1900 years ago. They were not sovereign. They had no rent-seeking rulers. They were considered outsiders, always small minorities in the lands where they lived. Their only recourse was to build on their tradition as a people of the book, serious students. They encouraged each other to study hard and to pursue careers in science, engineering, and math.When they finally were able to return to their ancient homeland and rule themselves, their culture of research came with them. They decided as a nation to invest heavily in higher education, research, and development. Israel, a nation of just 8 million people, has 8 excellent universities including some that rank among the finest in the world. Israelis file a disproportionate number of patents and start a disproportionate number of businesses. Israelis also win a disproportionate number of Nobel Prizes.The primary reason why Israel is more advanced technologically than its neighbors is its form of government. The second reason is a culture that values research and study very highly. If the Arab nations would choose different forms of government and would invest in different things, they, too, could be technologically advanced.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Israel-so-advanced-technologically-in-comparison-with-its-neighbours

A square meter of lunar surface processed to a depth of one meter at the atomic level produces 208.6 grams of nitrogen and a superabundance of all other materials.Now a cubic meter of air at sea level contains 956 grams of nitrogen. So digging below the surface one meter fills a chamber above that area with air thats 218.3 mm tall.So to cover the entire surface of the moon with a quarts chamber thats 5 meters tall requires utility fog to extract all the nitrogen from the soil to a depth of 22.8 meters. In the process all other materials are produced in abundance.Now at 1.35 g/cc this is 30.92 metric tons of dirt and rock. It takes 463.8 GJ to process that rock. Solar power arrives at a rate of 1362 W/m2 and the sphere of the moon is 4x the area of a disc the size of the moon so it will take 43.16 years to cover the entire lunar surface with 5 meter tall domes on average at this pressure and composition.Spreading a thin solar collector across the entire surface and feeding materials to collection points can build massive cities across 2% of the surface rather quickly.

The universe is too big -- and we haven't even ruled out other life in ourIf creating life were ""easy"" enough to happen once by random chance, then, in all likelihood, it is probable enough to happen many, many times. Because the universe is just that big.What would life on other planets look like?Remember that, even here on earth, life takes on many forms. We have life that is totally underwater. Life that flies. Life that is intelligent. Life that isn't. Life that lives on top of mountains. Life that lives with virtually no water.A planet might well need a star to support life, but it does not need to look quite like earth. Its lifeforms, therefore, may look quite a bit different.There are likely lifeforms a great deal more advanced than us and a great deal less advanced. Remember that the universe has been around for 13.8 billion years, the earth for 4.6 billion years, and life on earth for 3.6 billion years. Humans have been around for 200,000 years, but it was only 10,000 years ago that agriculture -- arguably the start of ""modern civilization"" -- began. 10,000 years isWith all that said, we might never discover those other lifeforms. Yes, there is almost certainly other life out there. But close enough to reach? We don't know. Look at that picture and remember that traveling at the speed of light (something humans can't do) for hundreds of years would only allow us to explore a tiny, tiny portion of our galaxy -- and that might not be enough to find life.Frankly, if you ask me, we're probably best off not encountering other intelligent life. The benefits are intellectual, maybe some science advancement, and other ""neat"" things. But the risks if the life we find is more advanced than us? Massive -- just ask any civilization on earth that encountered more advanced cultures. Would any say that they're the better for it?Of course, we have little choice in the matter. It's the more advanced cultures that tend to discover the less advanced cultures, since it's advancement that offers the ability for exploration. If we encounter other lifeforms that are more advanced, they likely found us. Let's just hope it goes well.[1] The equation of the area of a circle is pi * r^2. The(And, yes, our galaxy is closer to a disk-shape than a sphere.)[2] The radius of the blue dot is 100 light years and the radius of the Milky Way is 50,000.

13,"There are quite a few reasons why technology today advances as fast as it does. The industrial revolution, the lightbulb, computers, the microprocessor, and the Internet are all major factors.The first thing to look at are machines and factories that were made during the industrial revolution, though that's the 19th century.

The industrial revolution, the lightbulb, computers, the microprocessor, and the Internet are all major factors.The first thing to look at are machines and factories that were made during the industrial revolution, though that's the 19th century. Prior to the industrial revolution, 80-90% of the population were uneducated people living and working on farms for food.As the industrial revolution went on, tractors and other farming machinery dropped that number significantly. It no longer took 80-90% of the population to make food, maybe only 60%, or 50%. This number dropped as time went on, to less than 1% today.With less people forced to work in agriculture just to feed the population, there were more people free to do other work. This was mainly factory work, but it also allowed more people to get an education in schools and try new things. More minds working in technology helps it to advance faster.Another major point, though again this was in the late 19th century, was the use of electricity and the lightbulb. Prior to that, people could only work during daylight hours. It was too expensive to use candles or oil lamps for hours every day. It was extremely rare for people to lack sleep because there was usually no reason to stay awake when no work could get done.That made a huge difference, especially for winter. It depends on how far from the equator you go, but during the summer there's only 14-16 hours of daylight, and only 8-10 hours of daylight during the winter. Pretty far from the modern times when people struggle to get 8 hours of sleep a night.Next is the computer, and microprocessor. Before microprocessors and transistors, computers were huge, expensive machines, but as the technology improved, we got generalized computers. These computers took up a lot of mental tasks that people found annoying or difficult, like totalling up numbers on a spreadsheet or budget. Computers made far less mistakes than people.Microprocessor technology improved so quickly because we learned how to make transistors on them smaller and smaller using more precise machines. This advancement followed Moore's Law. Keeping it super short, Moore's Law is when every few years, the computing power doubles for a lower price. That meant more processing power everywhere. Many smartphones today have processors more powerful than the PS2.And the most recent, major advancement to the rise of technology is the Internet itself. The first few major network subsystems that make up the Internet today were made around the 1950s-1960s. As the fiber optic technology spread, more countries started building these systems.It seems shocking to me how recent this is, but the Internet only became a tool for everyone in 1995, but the Internet has probably been the biggest factor in how fast we advance today. Remember, before the Internet, the fastest ways to communicate were by phone or fax. So you could only talk or send papers to other people.With the Internet, people can communicate and send information across the world in under a second. Every problem in the field of science, technology, medicine, art, or whatever, can have millions of people working on solutions. Once even one finds a solution, it can be spread around the world in a matter of minutes, not months, and people can work on the next problem. The new information is also spread to educational institutions, so the next generation can work on it.Of course, life isn't quite that ideal just yet, because many technilogical advancements today remain in the hands of whatever company or country came up with it, but the tech still spreads much faster than it used to. So more people, faster computers, and faster communication through the Internet have all contributed to our super-fast technological advancement.",7 followers,James Palmer,657,364,1.5M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Israel-so-advanced-technologically-in-comparison-with-its-neighbours

The principles for a ramjet were outlined in 1908 and though not feasible at the time engineers have later figured out how to make ramjets and gas turbines work.Realizing air was not a single substance but rather a mixture of different gasses quickly led to gas street lighting, balloons and zeppelins.Liquid fueled rockets, Laval nozzles and all that were being pioneered in the years after WW1.In a large part I would say the bulk of the 20th century and 21st century has been spend building on those theoretic breakthroughs. Its the work of engineers who have to realize what has already been conceived. Conceptually a bugatti veyron (four pneumatic rubber tyes and an internal combustion engines) is not that different from a Ford Model T in all but some of the details. Handheld firearms have mostly been stagnant since the 1890s and even modern high explosives are manufactured mostly by just nitrating some other substances, a technique pioneered in the 19th century. With the help of the periodic table we’ve created some fancy new alloys and thanks to our ability to make polymers we have a range of plastics.On the other hand I think we’ve had all the low hanging fruit.I don’t foresee us inventing an entirely new combustion engine anytime soon. Maybe we’ll be able to use some designs previously uneconomical or hard to produce from a engineering/material point of view but I wouldn’t expect it to be earth shattering. We seem also to know most there is to know about the electromagnetic spectrum. Maybe some iterative changes to chemical batteries and electric motors will make electric cars more user friendly but again, no breakthroughs.DNA perhaps stands out among one of the more fundamental recent discoveries or breakthroughs which can help us but we’re not discovering new principles.But hey, who knows. Maybe in 200 or 300 years people will look at the discovery of gravitational waves, dark matter, quasars, pulsars and Higgs boson particle as the start of a new human era.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Israel-so-advanced-technologically-in-comparison-with-its-neighbours
