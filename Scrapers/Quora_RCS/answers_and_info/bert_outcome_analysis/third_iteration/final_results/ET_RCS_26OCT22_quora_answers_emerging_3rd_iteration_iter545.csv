And neither do I see myself writing any code in the future.It has been many years since I left coding.

Their drinking water system is unfiltered. Their waste systems rely on shipping millions of tons of garbage anywhere from Pennsylvania to China, after they were told to stop merely dumping it in the ocean as they had long been doing.A technically advanced city takes into account all human needs including transportation, communications, utilities, waste management and so forth and emphasizes energy efficiency and sustainability. To have an entire city meet these standards, the entire city would ideally be entirely new, and the West isn’t in the habit of creating whole new cities.The most advanced cities taking these needs into consideration are currently under construction in China as the antidote for old-world cities like Beijing that are drowning in their own waste and fast running out of drinking water. The US is way behind on this front and should start at least planning some new cities as they will surely be needed, since Miami, New Orleans and a number of other cities can be expected to be completely uninhabitable within the next few decades.Can hundreds of new ""ecocities"" solve China's environmental problems?New Orleans: Living under water isn’t a viable plan for the future",0 followers,MK Subba,4.1K,2.9K,11.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Who-are-the-top-active-VCs-in-the-Grocery-Technology-space
