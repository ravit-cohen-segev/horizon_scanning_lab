Here are five practical ways to use artificial intelligence to boost your small business and stay ahead of the competition:1. Automate back office tasks.In a recent Bank of America study, small business owners reported that administrative tasks to maintain their businesses were the greatest barrier to work-life balance. AI can handle these repetitive, slow and routine administrative tasks, allowing you to devote your time to more strategic and professional tasks. This can range from the automation of simple customer service problems to the activation of AI for accounting purposes. In fact, you can already use artificial intelligence in your business: Intuit offers 30 products and services based on machine learning and interchangeable services, including an expense management system integrated in Quick-books Self-workers.2. Make smarter business decisions.Entrepreneurs have to make many difficult decisions. AI can be your impartial advisory and methodically classify the data piles generated by your company to obtain more detailed information. It can also accelerate important business decisions, such as the decision to enter a new market or adopt a new tool or technology. For example, the DeNovo PwC tool, available for small businesses, assesses the potential for disruption of a particular financial technology and determines whether a company can benefit from it and how.3. Offer highly personalized customer experiences.Machine learning, an advanced form of artificial intelligence, uses algorithms to gather hidden information from data without explicitly programming it. By taking advantage of past experiences, you can create more relevant and personal experiences for your customers (you can learn to thank them automatically for all the useful content recommendations of Netflix and Amazon). Customized product experiences are very important for small businesses because they are known for their personal contact with customers, but machine learning requires a lot of data that is often lacking in small businesses. Fortunately, small businesses can now adopt machine learning technology easily and cheaply using external tools and open source software. Acquisition, for example, is a marketing tool based on artificial intelligence, designed specifically for small businesses, with which they can optimize the online acquisition process for customers.4. Obtain information from the client for better decision making.AI not only uses the data to determine the client's behavior; uses the data to draw conclusions about the best way to serve customers. If you want to remain competitive, you can use this information to identify models and make better decisions about how to evolve a product or service over time to meet the needs of your customers. The IBM Watson Analytics program, available as a mobile or web application, helps organizations of all sizes predict the future use of all current data types, including marketing, sales and human resources information, finance, etc. .5. Use a virtual personal assistant.Personal assistants using AI can arrange everything for you, from planning to reminding, to planning meetings. If you use Apple Siri in your daily life, you know the basics, but you are not the only one. A tool called Meeting Scheduling Software offers a personal assistant for busy professionals who simply work by sending a message with artificial intelligence called ""Amy"" in their emails. These tools are especially useful for solo proprietors or small business owners who do not have sufficient resources and are not yet ready to recruit, but who nevertheless need to optimize their time.As the practical benefits of AI increase, more and more professionals become familiar with the concept. Forester recently discovered that more than half of the industry and technology professionals surveyed are considering implementing AI. Entrepreneurs and owners of small businesses cannot be an exception. AI has the power to enrich the experience of small businesses and to help your company maintain its competitive advantage over large and small businesses.When considering an AI for your small business, consider some practical tips: start collecting data now to build a healthy foundation. Consider the processes that would benefit most from artificial intelligence to help you find the right tools or tools. Determine the expected return on investment of an artificial intelligence system at reasonable costs and critically develop an implementation plan that defines your specific artificial intelligence needs and strategic approach. Finally (and perhaps more importantly) continue to differentiate your company by offering your customers specialized products and services. In an increasingly automated world, people will thirst for that unique personal approach that has always made small businesses so special.","358,773 followers",Sean Kernan,10.6K,5.6K,726M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-my-chances-of-getting-into-Stanford-after-graduating-from-a-mediocre-college-with-average-grades-and-working-in-a-top-technology-company-for-a-year-with-outstanding-performance

My internships previous to Google were at decent companies but I didn't actually do a lot of coding and was more of a project management intern than anything else prior to getting hired at Google.So even though Google optimizes their interview process to minimize false positives, I was definitely one of those rare false positives. My interviews were for the most part easier than I expected, so I accepted the offer with much enthusiasm expecting a gentle introduction to the workflow.Week 1 I'm assigned to a team that really didn't make that much sense given my background, and my manager gives me an assignment that I had no clue as to how to even get started working on. At this stage of my career I was still one of those coders who has to Google pretty much everything, so that I did. My coworkers were helpful at first but quickly became annoyed by my relative lack of programming experience. Fast forward a couple days and my manager asks why I haven't checked any code… I still cringe when I think of the facepalm in his eyes as he looked over my code that was mostly copied and modified from stackoverflow. Eventually I was reassigned because of my slow progress.My next group & project was much easier but i was still clearly a noob compared to my colleagues, and did bad on performance reviews. My poor social skills certainly didn't help either. I bounced around a couple projects until Google finally fired me in early 2013 for what could be nicely described as general incompetence.I'll admit that the perks & atmosphere at Google were pretty distracting and harmful to my overall productivity, but I was also too lazy to be a good employee and not passionate enough about what I was doing.Nowadays I no longer work as a software engineer and run a small business.

It’s just anecdotal evidence, but I was surprised at how much higher-quality my fellow software engineers seemed at Google compared to those at Microsoft. A few reasons come to mind:Google’s engineering interviews were more difficult but also more consistent across the company. Software engineering interviews are the same for any software engineer hire at Google. Once you’re in Google, everyone knows you passed the same hiring bar. At Microsoft, hiring is chaotic, disorganized, and random. Every team has its own hiring practices; there are no company-wide guidelines of any significance. There are pros and cons of this choice; different teams have different needs, and I liked being interviewed at Microsoft for things relevant to the team I would join (and it was nice interviewing with the people I would work with). At Google I never saw my interviewers again, and some of the questions were pretty random. But that consistent bar made me confident that everyone else in the company was at at least a minimum quality of engineer skill. At Microsoft, everyone is at random different skill level, even people with the same job level.An aside: this lack of a hiring standard made it really hard to transfer internally at Microsoft: to join any new team you have to RE-INTERVIEW as if you’re an outside candidate, since other teams have to assume you know nothing. I literally got sent DRIVING DIRECTIONS and instructions on HOW TO PICK UP A VISITOR BADGE from HR when I applied for an internal transfer and set up an internal interview once I had been working at Microsoft for a few years. This left a really bad impression on me. Internal transfers are extremely hard at Microsoft, so when my team got disbanded and I was asked to find another team to transfer to, I left the company. And to answer the original question, I assume that due to this lots of people like me decide to leave Microsoft when things change… it’s too hard to re-interview over and over with internal teams just to maintain employment. Those of us who are able to join higher-paying companies were likely to leave.That brings me to the other point: Microsoft gave an extremely low-ball offer to join when I first applied there. It took a lot of negotiating to get them to offer something comparable to Google, and even then the problem was that after the initial 4 year stock grant ran out, I would suddenly be getting paid less than Google again. The yearly stock “refresher” amounts were very small compared to those at Google; so much so that I was really taken aback after my first annual review and stock refresh; it looked like a mistake. I got a huge performance stock bonus in addition to the regular one, and combined these were still less than I would have received at Google in an equivalent or even lower position.Overall, Microsoft pays its median software engineering employee much less than Google does. A typical middle-of-the-road “L4” software engineer at Google might be making between $200–300k annual in total compensation, while a similar middle-of-the road level 61–62 engineer at Microsoft is probably < $200k annually. Even “Senior” software engineers at Microsoft still make less than $300k, whereas $300k is more like a lower bound for a “senior” engineer at Google. At Microsoft the salaries go up “exponentially” (or at least that general sort of shape) as levels progress from the lowest level (59 — don’t ask) up to 70. In other words, the curve is more “elbow” shaped, with the big compensation growth happening at very high levels (the highest level of “Principal”, 67, and through the Partner levels (68+). Very very few people at Microsoft ever get to level; many max out at 64 (a senior level, again sub-$300k). At Google it’s more typical to max out at the senior level L5, in the $300k+ range. And L6 (staff) folks might get $400–600k. At Microsoft you don’t hit that $500k area until you’re at least level 67. In my case, I was level 65 at Microsoft (early principal level, around $320k annually) and decided to quit and join another tech company (non-Google) and managed to get about $500k annual comp.The point is that it seems that Microsoft salaries for typical engineers max out at a significantly lower level than do those at Google. Compensation drives a lot of decisions about where people work, and we can assume that a lot of people take the job that will maximize salary. Thus when Microsoft’s practical salary limit maxes out at a lower level, the only people following this criterion who stay there long term are those that can’t get a higher-paying job elsewhere. The rest of us eventually leave for places like Google (or a host of other tech companies that pay more).My impression was that as a result Microsoft hires more people than Google and forms larger teams, whereas Google has smaller teams of more-competent people. There seemed to be a lot more churn at Microsoft as new employees join out of school, and then leave when they find something better.","45,616 followers",David Seidman,878,3.6K,85M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-technologies-that-build-a-strong-career-in-the-IT-field

And of course, as there weren’t a lot of those guys, we wound up also discussing “minus 1” programmers - the guys who if you had on your team was like being a man down.Eventually, Dave, the 10x guy, happened along and on hearing us talk a bit said that we had overlooked a case.The “minus two” programmer. This guy is so bad that he offsets two decent programmers on your team - one of them has to correct the colossal fuckups that he makes, and one has to do enough work to keep you from moving backwards on your deliverable timeline.That’s what you don’t want to be, the “minus two” guy.Of course, some programmers are so bad that their number is a lot worse than “minus two”.Bad developers nearly universally suffer from not understanding how much they don’t know, and everyone suffers for it.They’re usually well on the upward slope of the “how much I think I know” curve, and in reality near absolute zero on what they do know.There are a bunch of answers running around Quora, reddit, StackOverflow about the most outrageous comments found in source code, and in every such thread there are always a pile of comments along the lines of “don’t fuck with this section. no matter how much you think you know, it’s not possible for you to understand what’s actually going on in here, so go away. oh, and if you did fuck with it and break everything, increment this counter”The reason that’s a meme is that it’s actually what happens, nearly 100% of the time. The bad programmer - believing they’re the hottest hot shit that’s ever been shit - has absolute certainty that they can fix anything, make everything better, faster. And they’re inevitably wrong.Moreover, they suck the oxygen out of the room. Your best staff, who are always keen to help develop a fellow developer’s skills, spend a huge amount of time trying to “educate” them. If you’re really, really lucky, some of it takes. If you’re not…Maybe that should have been “minus five”.","22,444 followers",Edmond Lau,3.6K,278,7.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Do-software-engineers-in-Google-or-other-top-technology-companies-sit-in-one-office-all-or-most-of-the-time-How-often-do-they-need-to-change-their-seats-Are-there-scientific-reasons-behind-that-arrangement

During my two years there — from 2006 to 2008 — I learned many things about how to become the best software engineer I could be.I didn't learn the level of empowerment and ownership that's possible at a smaller company — where the decisions you make and conversations you have as an engineer can shape the growth and direction of the business.I didn't learn how to reason about user growth and engagement as a system to be optimized — a perspective that I've picked up from Quora and Quip and that provides a valuable lens on how to reason about impact.I didn't learn how to ask for and give direct feedback to accelerate my own growth and the growth of my team.

And it depends upon the person.In Kirkland there were a few people who worked very hard indeed. And lots of people who put in their time each day and went home.
