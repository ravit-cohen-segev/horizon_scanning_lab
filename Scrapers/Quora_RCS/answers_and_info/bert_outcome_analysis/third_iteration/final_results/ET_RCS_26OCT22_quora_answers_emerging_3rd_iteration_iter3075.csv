Because technology is so integral to our society now, if it ever were to go away, our society would collapse. If, for instance, a terrorist were to use and EMP bomb and take out most or all of the electronic infrastructure in the US, many people would not survive.

They’d have no influence and be quite unable to communicate even basic ideas, let alone the sophisticated ones necessary for technological change. But let’s put that aside and consider the ideas such a person might bring with them.Given the vast gaps between theory and practice, I think the average person doesn’t understand technology as well as they think they do, and that’s doubly the case for the long chains of dependent technologies that make our world run. The average person may know that steam engines use the power of expanding steam to drive pistons, but, if provided with pen and paper to design a functional steam engine, would be unable to do so. They may know that light bulbs work by running current through a metal filament, but not be able to adequately explain how to remove the air from that glass bulb or replace it with a noble gas, how to generate electricity (something to do with magnets? OK, how do you get or produce decent magnets and what do you do with them?), or even how to make adequately clear glass and blow a bulb with it. Even relatively simple ideas often have supporting technologies lurking behind them. Moveable type and the printing press seem simple, but does the average person know that it requires oil-based ink to work well, and if so how to make that ink? Stirrups seem trivial and obvious, but they weren’t invented for thousands of years because they actually hurt the horse unless they’re attached to a saddle with a saddle tree, a solid frame rather than the kind of glorified blanket usually used on horses up through late antiquity. The best an average person is likely to do is communicate a few science facts but have little to back them up with.That said, there are one or two things which a well-educated-but-not-exceptional person might provide. Better math is the obvious candidate, since it translates well between languages and doesn’t require a vast web of supporting technologies. One person who remembers high school algebra and trigonometry could do a pretty good job of upgrading an ancient civilization’s mathematical knowledge.

For quite a while after that, we were still just spending time surviving. Language is evolving, we’re doing the hunter gatherer thing. Our days were mostly consumed with subsistence and learning how to express abstraction. There was no such thing as abstraction before we came along. We had to invent how to talk about the future, plan, and communicate with other tribes without killing each other. There were lots of things to work out with this new hardware upstairs.Finally, we learned how to control plants on a wide scale, i.e. agriculture begins. That was about 10,000 years ago. At this point, we have an abundance of food and we don’t have to chase animals around the land all year. So, we’ve really only had 10,000 years to develop anything resembling technology. Before we had an abundance of calories, we were too busy surviving and figuring out what to Do with a brain like this before that.If you think what has happened in 10,000 years, it is almost mind blowing. Everything in history, everything that has ever been invented, written, or built was effectively done in the last 10,000 years. Wow, incredible!Last thing, it was really industrialization that led to the acceleration of technological development. You have to have machines to build new machines. “Machine shops”, where they build parts for other machines, took off. From the early part of last century on, we built a ridiculous number of machines and figured out how to use electricity as a power source. Remember, that’s only about 100 years ago. Another wow. So, in 100 years, we went from a light bulb to a computer doing billions of calculations a second (that’s on almost everybody’s desk top). We built a huge machine, stuck a few computers, and some bottled up fire in it, and flew some humans to our moon. In about 100 years. Again, mind blowing.I’m almost scared what is going to happen in the 100 years, let alone 1000. We’re almost too smart for our own good.

After receiving his Ph.D. in 1997 he went to work for the prestigious Bell Labs, working on new types of semiconductors. His work revolved around replacing conventional semiconducting materials, like silicon, and replacing them with crystalline organic materials. Now, this is a well-known concept, it is present in field-effect transistors, especially (obviously) organic field-effect transistors and these have gainedHowever, what Schön was claiming was….revolutionary. Now, “Then, in 2001It could have changedI mean that literally, I could have meant the end of silicon's dominance in the field of electrical engineering and a move towards organic substrates. It could have allowed Moore’s law to be extended far beyond its projected limits (we are encountering this right now). It could have changed so much. Our world would not be the same place.There was only one issue, due to visa issues, Schön was back in Germany at the lab facilities of the University of Konstanz and there was no specific special equipment there, yet physicists elsewhere struggled to replicate the Aluminum-oxide insulating layers that allowed the transistors to function. The sputtering machine that Schön used was at the University of Konstanz, and again, there was nothing special about it. But no one else could replicate the insulating layers. They couldn’t get the process to work.And so the suspicions began.The figures were off, other physicists at Bell Labs and those outside of it started to bring attention to the figures. Several graphs were suspiciously similar. Almost…identical. Same with the overall numbers, they were too close, too similar. Then it was noticed that the data was too precise, some of it even contradicted the laws of physics, or at least how physics was then understood.Then Dr. Lydia Sohn, then at Princeton University and now at the University of California, Berkeley, when reading the papers noticed that two experiments that were carried out at two drastically different temperatures produced the same results. The same figures.Doctors Sohn and McEuen began to collaborate and they discovered “the smoking gun” as the linked article fromDr. Beasley’s commission found 16 verified cases of scientific misconduct. They were detailed in a 127-page report released in 2002“I have to admit I made various mistakes in my scientific work which I deeply regret. However, I would like to state that all the scientific publications that I prepared were based on experimental observations.”Bell Labs was not convinced and promptly fired Jan Hendrik Schön.This was the first known case of fraud in the history of Bell Labs, and over 15 papers were retracted due to the misconduct. In 2004 the University of Konstanz revoked Schön’s Ph.D., citing “dishonorable conduct”, and the department of physics spokesman Wolfgang Dieterich called the entire scandal, “the biggest fraud in physics of the last 50 years.” And went on to say that “the credibility of science has been brought into dispute.”Schön went on to lose the appeal challenging the stripping of his doctorate. and has since faded from view. His current status is unknown today.This was big because of the hopes it raised, then dashed. It was big because it caused a remarkable waste of money in labs around the world that tried to replicate his results.Unfortunately, the biggest impact was the potential damage done to the way science is perceived by the general public. When the public sees this kind of institutional fraud, fraud that took a couple of years to catch and act against, it brings the organized proactive of science into question for a lot of people.And this type of thinking continues today, as we see an increasing anti-science bias among many people. Legitimate results are questioned, and vaccine nonsense by Wakefield is taken as gospel. How hundreds of scientists can dispute the world of people like Wakefield and that work is dismissed because “well, there has been other fraud before”.Science is, at the end of the day, a pursuit of truth. Whether those truths are uncomfortable or not, it seeks to know more about the world we live in. As such, it must be dictated by facts and repeatable experimentation. People like Schön weaken the entire system, the faith in the process.And they make us jaded, we look upon any development with substantial skepticism. This isn’t a bad thing, but it can create inertia to fight against.There is a positive side to his fraud though; that the scientific community much more aggressively vets data, much more aggressively conducts peer review, and slashes those who don’t make the standard when it comes to data transparency. Schön made us more careful researchers, but perhaps, that made us better.Sometimes the hardest lessons are the best.",9 followers,Richard Matthews,4.3K,1K,8.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-see-a-scenario-where-humanity-no-longer-will-have-advanced-technology-and-we-will-go-back-to-pre-technological-times

The researchers discovered that the glass was impregnated with particles of silver and gold.The metal particles measure about 50–70 nanometers diameter, smaller than the wavelengths of visible light, but through colloids with other particles are able to absorb various wavelengths.The effect of the exactly dosed mixture is that it not only creates a two-color effect, but also lights up in different colors depending on the fluid it was filled with.At least that’s the theory, because testing this on a priceless artefact is out of the question. Instead a similar mixture was created in an experiment.The scientists imprinted billions of tiny wells onto a plastic plate about the size of a postage stamp and sprayed the wells with gold or silver nano-particles, essentially creating an array with billions of ultra-miniature Lycurgus Cups. When water, oil, or sugar and salt solutions were poured into the wells, they displayed a range of easy-to-distinguish colors—light green for water and red for oil, for example. The proto­type was 100 times more sensitive to altered levels of salt in solution than current commercial sensors using similar techniques.The Lycurgus Cup - Ancient Roman Glass that Magically Changes ColorsWould it have detected poison in the drink in the cup? Or was it just an amusing gadget for the wealthy?How the unknown makers discovered to make such astounding works of art is a question that will probably remain unanswered.Thank you for asking, Aidan.","4,004 followers",Paul Barends,6.4K,1.4K,11M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-see-a-scenario-where-humanity-no-longer-will-have-advanced-technology-and-we-will-go-back-to-pre-technological-times

19,"No, we are so far ahead that it is hard to compare.Look, we have managed to build a space station revolving around the earth where people live for months. We have sent people to play golf on the moon. We have landed a machine on Mars which stayed there for years sending us pictures. We have managed to eject an object outside the solar system.And all that is in the field of space travel alone.We are manipulating individual atoms, designing viruses to inject DNA into cells, generating antimatter in the lab, building kilometre-tall buildings…Take any field of science, mathematics or engineering yNo, we are so far ahead that it is hard to compare.Look, we have managed to build a space station revolving around the earth where people live for months.

We are so far ahead of the ancients that we might as well be living in an alternative fantasy world. That is what centuries and millennia of continued scientific progress do to civilisation.People who think that ancient India was more advanced than today confuse mythology and literature with science. So they keep asking questions like this:But there is absolutely no evidence for any of this. Anything that the ancients could do, we can too — and way better. We have stood on the shoulders of giants and seen much further than they could.PS","105,664 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.5K,6.8K,91.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-see-a-scenario-where-humanity-no-longer-will-have-advanced-technology-and-we-will-go-back-to-pre-technological-times

23,"The planck length is simply a measure derived from constants.  It's 137 times the stoney length, for example.  It's just a theoretical measure, in much the same way that the Bohr atom serves as a prototye measure for atoms.Likewise the scale m=GM/c² gives a length which various gravity theories measure black holes.  The radius varies from 2m to m/5.  The curvature of space says that the circumference of a circle around a mass M is 8m larger than the euclidean circle.","5,390 followers",Valdis Klētnieks,1K,14.7K,17.6M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-see-a-scenario-where-humanity-no-longer-will-have-advanced-technology-and-we-will-go-back-to-pre-technological-times
