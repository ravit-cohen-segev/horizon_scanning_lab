Virtual self-sufficiency in the technology sector is expected to be a major goal of theBut it’s easier said than done. Boosting the semiconductor industry requires more than just production expertise; it requires people skilled in the complex art of chip design, which meansStill, a fully independent Chinese tech ecosystem is a matter of “when,” not “if.” The shift will have a huge impact on the rest of the world.2African tech start-ups cash in2020 brought big-ticket mergers and acquisitions in African tech and its comparatively small start-up market. It’s a sign to bet big on tech for Africans, built by Africans.In August, WorldRemit made the largest investment ever in an African technology start-up: The London-based companyNearly two months later, U.S. payment giant Stripe paidExperts say it’s no coincidence that there have been a glut of deals focusing on African fintech. You can’t shop online without paying, so local payment platforms will only become more important as e-commerce grows across the continent. It’s made tech insiders optimistic that 2021 could be the year for more acquisitions in Africa.3Deep tech goes globalFor decades, technology research has been led by the U.S., Western Europe, and Japan, but innovation is starting to happen elsewhere. It could impact not only how the next generation of technology is built, but how it will be governed.“Deep tech” — the fundamental innovations that provide the foundation for future generations of technology — gravitates towards the U.S. and Western Europe, where public-funded institutions and large companies invest in academic research. While these countries are still at the forefront of deep tech, the gap between them and the rest of the world has narrowed.China is leading the trend. Backed by huge government programs, Chinese companies like Megvii and Sensetime have become world leaders in specific applications ofBeyond China, the globalization of academic research and venture capital is driving progress. Southeast Asia’s financial and tech hub, Singapore, has developed centers of excellence inAltogether, it has the potential to profoundly reshape the dynamics of our global economy, and to remedy historic inequities in how technology is designed and implemented.4Black Diaspora innovates across bordersSalvador, in the Brazilian state of Bahia, is posed to become a global tech hub for Black start-ups. It could become a model for international Black tech innovation.The African diaspora is as vast as the diverse cultures it comprises, but there are some commonalities. Many —But an emerging tech scene in Salvador, a city of nearly three million people in the Brazilian state of Bahia, is poised to change that. The size of Brazil’s Black population is second only to Nigeria’s. In Salvador, more than 80% of residents identify as Black — so it’s not surprising that the cityFollowing a $2 million investment round for Black start-ups from IT companyPolitics of accessAs TikTok’s troubles have demonstrated, what an app does doesn’t matter as much as where it’s from.5The 5G war accelerates5G could be the backbone of futuristic gadgets like self-driving cars, but before that can happen, the world must decide who will control it.Despite what your mobile carrier mayChinese tech giant Huawei is currently theBut it won’t be all about the U.S. and China; Switzerland and South Korea already have6Political app bans are on the riseCertain governments have long relied on internet censorship to maintain power. But this year, some began blocking apps and websites during international disputes rather than domestic ones.After conflict erupted along the border between India and China, the Indian government censored hundreds of apps made by Chinese developers. Among them was TikTok, anFor private companies caught in the crossfire, options are limited, though the7Access as soft powerRoads, railways, ports, and bridges have long been at the center of geopolitical competition. In the coming years, expressions of soft power in strategically important regions are turning digital.In October, Japan, Australia, and the U.S. agreed to finance a combined $30 million to build a spur from a trans-Pacific fiber-optic cable to the tiny island nation of Palau. The project, which would increase data speeds in the country, had an unstated but obvious objective: to counter the growing influence of China in the South Pacific.Physical infrastructure has often been at the center of geopolitical competition — the “developing world” is replete with roads, railways and ports that bear the name of their donors. China’s Belt and Road initiative, which aims to build transport links from China to Southeast Asia and Central Europe, is remarkable for its scale, but the concept isn’t new.In the coming years, the focus is likely to shift from concrete to cables. Providing the technological backbone for Asian and African countries’ digital economies will give national champion companies access to huge new markets and would-be hegemons influence over strategically important regions.It could, as in Palau, give underserved regions access to vital tech; but it could also crystallize the ideological differences between global superpowers, creating new inequalities in human rights, free expression, and access to information.After the pandemicCovid-19 changed the world. Here’s what happens next.8An uncontrolled “infodemic”As the coronavirus pandemic has spread, so has an overwhelming amount of misinformation about the virus, creating a parallel “infodemic.”Social media platforms and governments have struggled to curb Covid-19 misinformation. Some leaders and lawmakers have used the chaos as an excuse to pass far-reaching social media andAccording to theEven before the pandemic, some governments,9E-commerce builds on lockdown-fueled growthWhen people couldn’t leave their homes during Covid-19 lockdowns, they turned to e-commerce platforms in droves. Even after a return to relative normalcy, a whole new class of consumers has adopted online shopping.Online shopping has been growing steadily for a while now, but the pandemic is supercharging that trend. In just a few months, the industry has grown at a pace thatChinese shopping platform MeituanIs this e-commerce boom a bubble that will burst after the pandemic? It’s not likely.China, where Covid-19 restrictions have relaxed as rates of infection have fallen, offers a glimpse of the post-pandemic e-commerce market. In the second quarter of 2020, Meituan10Contact tracing apps set an uneasy precedentNever before have we seen governments collect personal information from citizens en masse at such a rapid speed. While some built contact-tracing apps on their own, others partnered with tech companies. The infrastructure will remain post-pandemic.Within the first two weeks of its being introduced, India’s contact-tracing app,Most contact-tracing apps use Bluetooth beacons, which use the proximity of people’s phones to generate anonymous alerts. China’s Alipay Health Code alsoIn some countries, private companies developed the core of the official contact-tracing apps. More than a dozen organizations took part inHow these countries will ramp down information collection in the post-pandemic future remains to be seen. In a perfect world, they would kindly surrender their newfound insights into the private lives of their citizens once the need to contact-trace recedes. That happens often, right?11Edtech is here to stayThe education-technology industry was already on the rise, but Covid-19 lockdowns has accelerated its adoption. Even after the pandemic recedes and the logistical necessity of remote education fades, edtech is here to stay.As the world hunkered down in various stages of Covid-19 lockdown this spring, the scramble to arrange distance learning for children began. For families that could afford reliable internet and mobile devices, a propped-up tablet and Zoom became the go-to solution for teachers attempting to bridge the gap between a physical classroom and a fully online education. For the majority of children, though, it meant low-tech solutions: WhatsApp classrooms and radio lectures.Edtech companies reading the room saw the pandemic as the perfect opportunity to scale. The market was already valued atBut even after the pandemic has faded, and with it the necessity of remote education, edtech will be here to stay. Consumers have dipped their toe in a burgeoning technology; one Indian firm hiredAnd as more students and families feel comfortable with remote learning, more demand for teachers will arise. This could create a new class of gig workers: teachers. Imagine a world where booking a tutor for your kid is much like hailing an Uber or hiring an Instacart shopper. Whether that means better working conditions for teachers — and a better education for students — remains to be seen.Future of techThree sectors to watch in 2021 that are being driven by technology born outside the U.S.12Gaming’s epicenter moves eastIn gaming’s13Surveillance creeps into more and more of the digital worldNothing digital is private: Social platforms are collecting, marketing, and selling our data.
