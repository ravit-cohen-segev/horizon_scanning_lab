Software engineering is as hard as it is these days because people write bad code, write good code on top of bad code, and then rewrite the entire thing in a new technology. From this analysis, you can see that the problem is WRITING CODE. Avoid as much code-writing as possible. Going with the existing stack ll grant you that. Even if you are starting from scratch, research to make sure there’s no open source code available. Make whatever stack you choose be such as requires little new code written as possible!#2.#1.

Even if you are starting from scratch, research to make sure there’s no open source code available. Make whatever stack you choose be such as requires little new code written as possible!#2. CONSIDER FUTURE MAINTENANCE. Its all good to write your application in C++, but how expensive will it be to find a developer to help you maintain it? C++ engineers are rare, proud, and expensive. The sort of C++ engineers who can write good web apps in C++ are even rarer, prouder, and far more expensive. This also applies to JAVA and C#. Its easier to find a PHP developer and delegate tasks to them than to find a JAVA/C# web developer. Rule out these elitist languages except its absolutely necessary.#3. CONSIDER THE SKILL YOU HAVE ON YOUR TEAM: if you have 3 developers and all three know nodejs but one knows php and nodejs, please go with nodejs. A day will come when that php guy will fall sick. You wouldnt want your project to pause because of that. Technical problems are far easier to resolve than human problems.#4. CONSIDER THE AMOUNT OF PERFORMANCE NEEDED: everybody these days love to think their app is as important as google or facebook. 99% of the time; its not. A streaming app requires a lot of optimization even from the get go. A regular crud app which will be used by < 500 people for the next one year doesn't require performance as much as it requires speed of project delivery. Good php/ python should always be chosen in such circumstances , after considering the points above.","56,375 followers",Charlie Cheever,5.9K,1.5K,9.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-choose-a-technology-stack-for-web-development

Now a new revolution is set to change healthcare for ever – one driven by mobile technology, artificial intelligence (AI) and other emerging technologies.“Virtual” visits from doctors, delivered via portable video devices, can save lives, says Kelly White, London general manager of WWT Asynchrony Labs. His company’s connected kits come with sensitive two-way cameras for patients to talk to medical staff, along with health monitors for blood pressure and blood oxygenation.“For those older people who live alone,” Mr White says, “having a doctor regularly checking in helps to avoid the tragic instances of people suffering strokes, heart attacks or falls, and lying unnoticed at home.”Within hospitals too, outcomes are changing. With everything from hospital beds to scanners now connected using technologies such as Bluetooth tags, hospitals can track patients and treatments in a way that was impossible beforeProfessor Stone is using VR headsets in Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth hospital to help patients recover after complex limb injuries – letting them pedal their way around a virtual version of the south coast, for example.He adds: “We’re also combining virtual reality with augmented reality at the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine. We recreate the interior of a Chinook in VR, which used to take a very large and expensive wooden box, and let trainees practice there. We use a low-cost, off-the-shelf VR headset which is very cheap.”Senior executives’ time would be better spent trying to influence rather than prohibit, notes Andrew Rogoyski, VP of cyber security Services at IT analyst CGI. “One of the biggest challenges [for businesses] is the sheer pace of development and change. Technology creates opportunities that have to be pursued within days or weeks. Often security is short-circuited out of the adoption of new technologies.","46,129 followers",Steven Haddock,1.3K,25.6K,343.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-is-in-development-to-improve-the-healthcare-industry
3,"Before rideshare applications became popular, getting from point A to point B was time-consuming and expensive.

Hailing a taxi involved flagging down a cab on a busy city street, watching the meter rack up charges, then digging for pocket change to pay the fare.Now, we have Uber, Lyft, and more. These apps offer a convenient, inexpensive way to get a ride using a digital platform that activates the value of underutilized cars and drivers. Similarly, Airbnb satisfies our short-term housing needs by offering a cheaper way to stay in someone’s spare bedroom and home.All of these companies have one thing in common: they use technology to activate the untapped potential of existing resources.Of course, this idea isn’t revolutionary. Even Craigslist, which launched in 1995, connected the dots between unmet demands and underutilized supply. It was a crude system, but it worked.The real game-changers, however, are companies that leverage a connected ecosystem of customers, vendors, and partners to do three things: reduce cost, make transactions more efficient, and deliver predictable results. They’re able to do this by applying rules and constraints, creating formal process, managing oversight and quality controls, and adding features like certifications, reviews and transparency.Today, technology is helping peer support achieve the same goal.Peer support was initially limited by a lack of accessibility, then by too much.There were three main models for peer mentor support, each with their own advantages + disadvantages.1.In-person.2. Telephonic groups.Still, this format was problematic because it happened at a fixed time, and offered a limited amount of one-on-one time for a patient to share and get support on their unique condition.3. Internet-enabled.This dramatically opened up the lines of communication between people. But, like Craigslist, they were still crude functioning. And the prevalence of unvetted, unprofessional advice-givers and text-heavy communication makes this choice less than ideal.Still today, all three of these modalities exists together -- available to varying degrees based on the clinical condition and the setting.Tremendous promise of peer support, un-realized.Earlier this year, at the Society for Behavioral Medicine, I had the privilege of hearing Susannah Fox, the former CTO of HHS, speak about “Building the evidence base for peer health advice.”Her first slide captured the promise of peer support:Multiple randomized clinical trials have demonstrated how peer support increases self-efficacy, self-management skills, and medication adherence. Peer support helps with social isolation, too.Yet, this promise is largely unrealized.The trials and studies demonstrating these results are not ad hoc patient forums though.They are typically structured interventions, delivered through trained and trusted peer mentors, with solid oversight and management. Then — they deliver results.Peer support, as it is delivered today, is broken — a land of unfilled promises.Technology can change this.We can change the expectations from just ‘support’ to actual improvement of measurable clinical outcomes through structured 1-on-1 mentoring.We can reduce transaction costs, increase the efficiency of interactions transactions, and deliver improvement in outcomes, predictably.7 core areas where we’ve built technology to change how a peer mentoring program is developed and delivered:By adopting technology, peer mentoring programs increase accessibility and provide exceptional patient experience while maintaining a human connection.Today, peer support technology is working to bolster relationships and engagement in peer mentoring with impactful results. As technology improves, these programs will only continue to show the vast potential they have to drive significant improvement in clinical outcomes and patient success rates.Still, one of the most common questions I get asked is, “Will AI ever replace mentors entirely?”The simple answer is, “no.”The value of a human connection will never go away. Technologies will always exist to help serve, scale, improve, and enhance that vital relationship, but it can never replace it entirely.But technology itself is not the focus here—it's simply a means to an end. The ultimate goal of our team and many others in the peer mentoring space is to leverage technology to improve patient quality-of-life and achieve better clinical outcomes.Technology is a driver of—not a replacement for—human connection with patients.","246,866 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-is-in-development-to-improve-the-healthcare-industry

Learn those. Stuff like MVC and object-oriented programming.Databases are all over the place at the minute. You could go either way, but I'd advise SQL for starters (PostgreSQL) and Redis if you want to explore a simple NoSQL persistence layer that can complement your existing relational database.Yes, everything has a place, but you won't do yourself any favours by jumping from language to language. Focus on becoming proficient in a clearly defined stack first, and use that to learn the fundamentals - things which transcend the language(s) you're using.This is my current stack:- HTML w/ HAML/SlimWhat I'd advise is you weigh up the kind of technology you want to work with and dive in. Define a stack, then learn it from the top down (frontend to backend). Once you understand how all this glues together, and can understand where any particular language or technology falls, then you will be in a better position to experiment.When you do eventually move onto multiple languages in the same domain (like Ruby -> Python), you will quickly recognize the common features and principles.There is a mountain of information to consume, and it is common for somebody to specialize in one of those areas above - frontend, backend, database, system, network. That's why you have:Frontend EngineersIf you want to be all that rolled into one, then accept that your knowledge is going to be more general than specialized, though I'd highly suggest you specialize in one. Myself, I specialize in backend, and my knowledge is less specialized in the other areas.Along with that, learn core parts of each area like security and optimization in the capacity of your stack.Once you've made your choice on a stack, do NOT sidetrack yourself by signing up to tonnes of tech blogs and following every other hot topic. This will not lead to competence; your head will be spinning and you'll spread yourself too thin.While you build stuff you'll want to focus on two key tools: an IDE/Editor (Vim, Sublime Text, Eclipse) and a version control system (I suggest Git).",107 followers,Carlos Esteban Lopez Jaramillo,554,128,318.7K,2014,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-choose-a-technology-stack-for-web-development
