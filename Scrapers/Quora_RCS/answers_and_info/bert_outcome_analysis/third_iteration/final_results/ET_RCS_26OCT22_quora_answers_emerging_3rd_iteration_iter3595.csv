There is nothing clever about it at all - it’s very broadly worded. It was sold to a network of patent trolls who don’t make blood tests - who have no employees and an office about the size of a broom closet. Their office (such as it is) is situated in the one notable city in Texas which makes virtually all of it’s income from servicing patent troll “offices” and has courts who almost always favor the patent troll.How bad is that? Well, now they are suing the companies who are struggling to get COVID-19 blood tests manufactured.If you can think of something MORE evil, MORE corrupt than that…please don’t tell me about it, my stomach is already churning.","5,074 followers",Jeff Ronne,4.5K,3.8K,7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Would-more-government-regulations-or-less-give-innovators-like-Steve-Jobs-or-Bill-Gates-more-incentive-to-create-newer-and-more-advanced-technology

3,"There is no amount of regulation that would incentivize Steve Jobs to create anything. While Bill Gates is still capable of leading a charge to create newer technology there are likewise no incentives that are going to make him stop doing what he’s already doing in philanthropy (because he has all the money he’ll ever need).Innovators like Steve Jobs (dead) or Bill Gates (many 10s of Billions of dollars) are not influence by regulation.Both Steve Jobs and Bill Gates entered into a marketplace with essentially no industry regulation and greenfield development.

Greenfield development is harder in some ways (because you have to do everything yourself) and easier in some ways (there is no minefield of pre existing patents).To recreate the scenario in which Jobs and Gates were able to take advantage of a greenfield technology the government would need to invest in science and churn out the scientific understandings and engineering efforts that happened at Bell Labs (the precursor work for the semiconductor from William Shockley) or Xerox Parc (Douglas Engelbart, father of the GUI).","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Would-more-government-regulations-or-less-give-innovators-like-Steve-Jobs-or-Bill-Gates-more-incentive-to-create-newer-and-more-advanced-technology

This is a testimony to enormous economic value he created. Microsoft is principally the reason for the commoditization and realization of the computing age.Gates is the number one humanitarian on the planet. He not only has donated his wealth to the planet but has used his personal integrity and intellect to convince others such as Warren Buffet (the 2nd richest person in the world) to do the same. The fact that others are willing to trust Gates with their vast wealth and life's legacy demonstrates that Gates is uniquely skilled and talented. Gates has social intellect to change the world and the course of history. Gates did the same with Microsoft, he designed and created the mechanism.Do people forget how Gates bailed out and saved Apple 15 or so years ago? Gates is not petty or vindictive. He helped a competitor and associate Jobs because he understands the value of building relationships.Gates has grown and transformed his entire being with purpose and intent for decades. Yes the Bill Gates of the early '80s was not a patron saint but he was smart enough to grow and change.Gates is a very, very smart person. I have taken courses from a few Nobel prize winners and the common observation about brilliant people is that they do not flout their intelligence. It is immaterial to them that they are the smartest in the room. Intelligence is a tool, a means to a greater end, not a grand prize for superiority. Gates in fact would be deserving of the Nobel peace prize.Gates is not interested per se in keeping score. Motivation based solely on competition only goes so far. In the end making a lasting difference in the world is all that matters. Everything else is transient.Yes Gates is underrated. He does not really care as long it does not interfere with his attempt to change the course of history. Yes as capitalism has created an enormous imbalance of wealth, Gates is designing a permanent mechanism to remedy this structural flaw by willingly redistributing wealth. Nothing like the richest person in the world leading by humble example.The philanthropic efforts led by Bill Gates have saved over 5.8 million human lives",22 followers,Nishchal Arora,9.5K,131,3.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Would-more-government-regulations-or-less-give-innovators-like-Steve-Jobs-or-Bill-Gates-more-incentive-to-create-newer-and-more-advanced-technology
