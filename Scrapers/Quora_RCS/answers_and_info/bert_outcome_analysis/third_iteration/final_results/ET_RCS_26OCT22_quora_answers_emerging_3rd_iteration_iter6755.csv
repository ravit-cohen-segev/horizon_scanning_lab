0,"That depends a great deal on their origin. Evolution has repeatedly created species that are nearly identical to extinct species. So there is a great probability that were the climate to return to the conditions which produced us, we would evolve again in some fashion. Thus we would have enough similarity to eventually figure our artifacts out.Other life forms are unlikely to have evolved even remotely like us.

There is actually a high probability we share the same point in space and time with other sentient species but are utterly oblivious to each other due to the fact we live in such different worlds/dimensions. Glimpses of these other sentient species are very likely the source for legends and fairy tails. Life that is not carbon based will also struggle to understand our technology and culture. We live in a very unique part of space. Free from so many hazards that affect much of the galaxy. We have an environment rich in oxygen which gave us the ability to create and use fire. Thus we can smelt metals, burn materials for energy, warmth and construction purposes. Now imagine life without fire. How technology would evolve. Say on a water world or a world where oxygen was a rare resource. Or imagine a world without water. It is a universal solvent for materials on Earth. That alone makes it tremendously invaluable. As a form of transportation again invaluable to the development of civilization. Our entire ecosystem depends upon water as does all existing life on the planet to a lesser or greater extent. That water is liquid, solid and gas inside our temp ranges again makes it incredibly important to our development. So much so that the arrogant and blind believe that life cannot exist without liquid water. It can, it will just be life that uses technologies we cannot conceive of yet because we have water and water works for us. Thus no real inquiry into alternates too water.Life has a knack for conquering challenges. Even on Earth we find examples that thrive in environments we consider too extreme for life. Out there in the uncountable stars and the numerous planets that revolve around those uncountable stars there are so many ways that life has developed using all sorts of bases and technologies that much of it has developed in ways that an alien could stand in front of us in full view and we’d not recognize it as a life form or sentient life form nor they us. Our artifacts may also indeed be invisible to them and as indecipherable to them as life that evolved from liquid methane is too us.We also have a rather limited idea of sentience and for us curiosity is inexorably linked to intelligence. This may not be the case with other life forms. They may have zero interest in our existence. Nor would our demise be anything but academic generally. Our problems would be unique too our species. It is highly unlikely that they would suffer a similar problem.",UNKNOWN,Ian,4.5K,13.2K,17.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-humans-went-extinct-and-another-intelligent-life-evolved-on-Earth-could-they-use-our-technology-translate-our-languages-or-figure-the-extinction-cause
1,"Oh course it is technically possible, though unlikely. First off, the intelligent life would have to evolve to the point where it could understand our language. We don’t know for sure how other species could process language. The species decoding our language is essential for the other two. If they are capable of understanding our language, then they would need to find a way to translate individual words. Preferably this would be by pictographs. Preferably something like this.Eventually, it is possible to get a basic grasp on our language.

Preferably this would be by pictographs. Preferably something like this.Eventually, it is possible to get a basic grasp on our language. Then they can use context clues to learn more complex terms.After that we can get to technology. You see, the time it takes for something to evolve to this point, all of our technology at this point will be either completely degraded, just rusted iron tools, or something made of stone. At that point, they are more than capable of learning it themselves. If they want something more complicated, then they will have to be able to read schematics, so therefore they need to read. Preferably they would be able to read our Arabic numerals and understand the concept of zero, due to most diagrams not listing numeric values by name, instead just using the numerals.As for the apocalypse, it depends on how sudden it is. If it happens immediately, then there would be some geological evidence left behind. In that case, they can make a good guess. Think of it like our theories on how the dinosaurs died out. If it was a more gradual decline. Then we would probably leave some written evidence chronicling our journey towards our eventual demise. To read that epic, this hypothetical species would have to be able to again, read our language.",2 followers,Richard Muller,3.2K,2.3K,202.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-humans-went-extinct-and-another-intelligent-life-evolved-on-Earth-could-they-use-our-technology-translate-our-languages-or-figure-the-extinction-cause

4,"If the last human died, then Mother Earth would blink her eyes, 100,000 years would pass, and there would be very little evidence that humans were ever here. The planet would still be teeming with life of endless variety, just as it was before humans came along. You could detonate every nuclear weapon on the planet and, at the time scales the planet likes to use, it would bounce right back.When humans use the phrase “Save the Earth!” they actually mean “Save the resources of the Earth that humans like to use!” The Earth will be fine, with or without us.","26,672 followers",Donna Fernstrom,2K,9.3K,64.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-humans-went-extinct-and-another-intelligent-life-evolved-on-Earth-could-they-use-our-technology-translate-our-languages-or-figure-the-extinction-cause
5,"Most likely, they were over-hunted, over-fished, or died as a result of humans’ expansion into the wilderness.People often don’t realize that when one species dies, it causes changes in other dependent species. Kill all the wolves and the area is overrun with what were the wolves’ prey. The term “invasive species” didn’t exist before Man began thinking he was in charge of his environment.And now, we don’t have to hunt the animals into extinction. All we need to do is sit back and watch what we’ve done to our environment as the sea ice and glaciers melt and the polar bears lose their habitat.",253 followers,Hadmat Singh Rajput,2.4K,277,897.4K,2022,https://www.quora.com/If-humans-went-extinct-and-another-intelligent-life-evolved-on-Earth-could-they-use-our-technology-translate-our-languages-or-figure-the-extinction-cause
6,"Yes it’s possible. Unlikely that they would look passable as a human, but possible.It may be that our general form is best suited to the development of higher intelligence. After all, we have been shaped through evolution; forms that did not maximize survival gradually died off.A symmetrical body plan, with four limbs, seemed to out-compete most other body plans. It was the winner of the great Cambrian Explosion, where scores of body plans were trialed.Bipedal locomotion freed up our arms and hands to grip tools, allowing us to develop technology.

It was the winner of the great Cambrian Explosion, where scores of body plans were trialed.Bipedal locomotion freed up our arms and hands to grip tools, allowing us to develop technology. Certainly, having all limbs tied up with locomotion is very limiting towards developing higher intelligence.Our faces are well suited to their function as well. We have binocular vision, allowing us to perceive the world at a distance. Like most animals, our noses are connected closely to our brains, and situated prominently at the front of our face; with them we complement our vision by being able to detect and process gases.It may even be that warm-blooded primates are the best forms suited to technology-using intelligences. So yes, there is a good chance that intelligent extra-terrestrial life could resemble us. Of course, there are a great many other alternative forms that might do just as well, especially on substantially different planets. Our own existence is mostly due to happy coincidences; our ancestors just happened to survive the various catastrophes in their lives long enough to pass their genes on. If intelligence is indeed a fundamental property of the universe that always emerges given time, then their forms will be heavily influenced by their own histories.",35 followers,Ian Johnston,634,440,2.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-humans-went-extinct-and-another-intelligent-life-evolved-on-Earth-could-they-use-our-technology-translate-our-languages-or-figure-the-extinction-cause

10,"Define an intelligent or advanced species, Give three examples. It is a old joke. But it points out something. Our sort of intelligence is incredibly rare. We have no idea why or what the most important rare parameters are. Because we only have one example.While apes and elephants and orcas and ravens and wolves others exhibit some aspects of what we do, none are really very close in terms of the way we use and manipulate symbols and language.

If there were many environments where our sort of intelligence was useful, then we would see it evolving over and over in unrelated lineages. This is what happens with flight and gliding near flight. Insects, birds, pterodons and bats evolved to fly. They are not very related. This is an example of convergent evolution.Our type of culture making, language using, symbol manipulating intelligence happened only once. It is hard to know why. But it is rare. Perhaps some intelligent animals are to us like flying squirrels( gliding-near flight) are to bats. But we don’t know that. With only one example it is very hard to know what is needed or what is missing in other animals.Thus, we cannot know the answer to your question.",366 followers,Brett Alder,1.1K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/If-humans-went-extinct-and-another-intelligent-life-evolved-on-Earth-could-they-use-our-technology-translate-our-languages-or-figure-the-extinction-cause
