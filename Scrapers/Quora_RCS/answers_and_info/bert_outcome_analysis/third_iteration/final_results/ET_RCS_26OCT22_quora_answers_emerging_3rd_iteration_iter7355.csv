This makes it a safer play, but with room to make small profits if a bull market is on the corner for 2019. However, if you want something to maximize your profits, we think Ripple cryptocurrency is the best cryptocurrency to invest in.Investing is a natural way of making money and making your dreams reality. Investing in cryptocurrency is still the most profitable way of making more in a short period of time especially when investing on big cryptocurrency investment platform like MULTICOINHODLER (Google Multicoinhodler Investment Platform) as it is relatively on for a while now (launched at mid-summer 2017) but has become the largest Cryptocurrency Investment Platform right now where you get at least 25% up to 100% return on investment after 10 days. It supports variety of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin and other Altcoins. I find that it has a really nice UI and support. Try them and make more money easily. Thank me later.Ripple has established itself as one of the most stable cryptocurrencies in the industry. Other than Bitcoin, Ripple has enjoyed among the most predictable price movements. Additionally, because Ripple experiences more than $800 million in daily trading volume, it is among the most liquid cryptocurrencies available. The company behind Ripple is building a massive international network, with hundreds of members. Those are banks, payment processors and liquidity providers.Ripple has developed a technology that can revolutionize the way payments are done. The Ripple blockchain remains the closest and the most likely to achieve that to any real degree.Ripple can become an alternative for the SWIFT system currently used for international money transfers that have been used for 45 years and every major bank in the world uses.Ripple is working hard to get more companies using their technology which ultimately should result in the XRP price going up significantly.With a growth of around 36,000%, Ripple was the best cryptocurrency to invest in for 2017. It grew from just a couple of cents at the beginning of 2017 and reach $2.4 by the end of 2017.See the chart below:Since we’re in a bear market, like all the other cryptocurrencies, Ripple price has decreased in the previous year and at the moment of writing this article is trading around $0.30.Ripple is currently the second-best cryptocurrency after Bitcoin with a total market cap of around $12.6 billion.It might be a good time to buy Ripple, which is down almost 70% from its all-time high of $3.4 reached in January 2018. As of 2019, the market cap for Ripple has exceeded $12 billion. Purchasing one individual coin is surprisingly affordable. During the course of 2019, Ripple has mostly floated between $0.28 and $0.38 per coin. As the company behind Ripple continues to build valuable connections in the business world, Ripple may be on the verge of breaking out of its current price channel.","1,717 followers",Wilfred Edmund,567,65,881.3K,2020,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-best-cryptocurrency-to-invest-in-long-term-Why
1,"You should invest in $APT, the native token of APTOS for long term.My reason is that Aptos is aiming to build a more scalable blockchain with faster transactions and lower fees, as well as more reliable and predictable for large clients to be interested in embracing the blockchain. With what they aim to achieve I believe investing in $APT on MEXC for the long term would be a wise decision.",0 followers,Gerhard Walter,924,54,915.7K,2021,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-best-cryptocurrency-to-invest-in-long-term-Why
2,"Dash (DASH)After more than five years of its inception, Dash is firmly standing tall with diehard traders from as far back as 2014. Hodlers of Dash have made it through some of the harshest market trends to get to this pointDash (DASH)After more than five years of its inception, Dash is firmly standing tall with diehard traders from as far back as 2014. Hodlers of Dash have made it through some of the harshest market trends to get to this pointBitcoin (BTC):New cryptocurrency traders and investors may have been introduced to BTC in 2018, undoubtedly one of BTC’s toughest year. However, long term traders have remained on their toes seeing the massive investment rate from institutional investors. Although the big bull is currently struggling at a trading price of $3600, traders are still betting big on it. Even top cryptocurrency founders like Charlie Lee of Litecoin had previously advised traders to own at least 1 BTC before purchasing any other “shitcoin”, Litecoin inclusive.Monero (XMR)From $2.47 on the day it went live, XMR fell back to $0.7 mark for almost a year before climbing back up to $1 in May 2016. With a slow and steady price movement that has now landed it on $45, it is no wonder that XMR is a top choice for altcoin traders.Bitcoin SV (BSV)The result of the 2018 BCH November hard fork BSV has been trading rather impressively since it went live just a month ago. BSV began with a trading price of $84.41 and hit an all-time high of $134.59 shortly after. Unlike most tokens that usually begin with impressive trading price and significantly goes down the drain, BSV has managed to defy the odds showing strong resistance throughout the bearish trends and despite the slight decline in trading volume, BSV is impressively maintaining a trading price on the $70 mark as of this writing.","69,843 followers",Marius Kramer,1.3K,2K,193M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-best-cryptocurrency-to-invest-in-long-term-Why

The market is damn volatile and when you allow suggestions, everybody is marketing their own cryptocurrency everywhere, so you end up getting what many people use but not what might truly survive in the long term. So make your own decision by knowing what makes a cryptocurrency survive for long.But how?It’s simple. Certain tenets define the long-term survival of a cryptocurrency.The Purposes of the CryptocurrencyThe Market CapitalizationThe robustness of the developer communitySo let’s distill them one by one.The purpose of the cryptocurrency.This is probably the most important factor to look at when deciding whether a cryptocurrency will survive into the future or not. Some cryptocurrencies, apart from acting as coins and trading assets, also provide platforms, serve as the fastest means to move money across the globe, try to solve a certain problem in society or in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and do a lot more.so the advice I will give is that any cryptocurrency that is not just there to serve as a coins or a trading asset but provides more services is bound to survive and you can invest in it in the long term. Such cryptocurrencies are springing up everywhere.Want examples? Let’s look at these ones:Market CapitalizationThe Market Capitalization of a cryptocurrency also, in a way, determines its long-term survival.When you multiply a cryptocurrency’s current supply by its current price, you get the market cap of that cryptocurrency. So in general, the supply also has significant impact on the market cap. These two go hand in hand to determine the amount of cryptocurrencies left to be released and how that will translate into prices.Check this article:The Developer CommunityOne factor I’ve seen to be the cause of a fall or rise of a cryptocurrency is the developer community. They can fork it, they can maintain it, they can decide to update regularly, or decide to sit on the fence.No investor wants to put their money into a cyber currency that doesn’t have a good developer community to keep things modern and new. This reduces investor confidence and thus threatens a cryptocurrency’s long-term existence.So there is another factor - which has to do with The Trust of the investors or how much people are willing to buy it amid the hypes - just like bitcoin.But with all that, if these three points I’ve mentioned above are not met, no investor will have confidence in a cryptocurrency as to invest in it.There are a lot of Other Factors.Go out there and search and you will find more.But the above are paramount and will help you make a decision concerning your long-term cryptocurrency portfolio.The 4-Point Checklist Every Long-term Cryptocurrency Investor Should Know.","135,555 followers",Hector Quintanilla,10.6K,1.2K,88.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-best-cryptocurrency-to-invest-in-long-term-Why
4,"For long-term investments, many customers choose to stick to the top coins by market capitalization, such as BTC, XRP and ETH and others as shown on the cryptocurrency prices table. This will give you a good idea of what the community generally thinks is most valuable and is an excellent way to dip your feet into the world of blockchain technology.For long-term investments, many customers choose to stick to the top coins by market capitalization, such as BTC, XRP and ETH and others as shown on the cryptocurrency prices table. This will give you a good idea of what the community generally thinks is most valuable and is an excellent way to dip your feet into the world of blockchain technology.Please Note: This is me just telling you about my personal experience so far so good about investing on the only legit cryptocurrency investment platform i have seen online, I am in no way trying to advertise or give you a financial advise on how to spend your money. You can make your research and if you find the platform deem fit then you can go ahead just like i did.Some new projects will enter the top rankings just as fast as they leave, and this testing by the market can be useful in determining what’s garbage and what’s precious. It can be tempting to invest large amounts into high-risk assets, but this can be crippling, especially for long-term investors.Consistent growth over time shows how much an asset means to the market. It’s a fast-paced industry, but it can be worthwhile to keep up.How do I know if a cryptocurrency is worth investing in?Investing in anything begs analysis. For long-term ventures, investors use three main methods to gauge the upside and risk of a particular asset. Fundamental analysis evaluates a token or project’s intrinsic value in the context of the current market and its outlook.Most projects publish a whitepaper before a token sale, and studying this document can present more profound insight into what the asset offers. Make sure to review economic factors and other industry-specific events like Bitcoin’s supply halving every four years.What other forms of analysis can I use?Another popular method of evaluation is through technical analysis. This involves analyzing historical price chart data to discover patterns in the market’s behavior. This can help understand trader behavior, and metrics like daily trading volume, prominent support and resistance levels, and certain technical indicators can paint a broader picture of its prospective potential.Though technical analysis is mostly reserved for short-term projections, it’s possible to learn a lot about how it reacts to external events by outlining patterns in the asset’s price chart. This can be particularly beneficial in the long-term and, combined with fundamental analysis, can provide a well-rounded idea of a project’s value.Through quantitative analysis, investors can gauge how well an asset is likely to perform based on historical data. While past performance is never exclusively indicative of future appreciation, it’s crucial to learn more about not just the token, but the market that’s investing in it.",0 followers,Gerhard Walter,1.1K,54,915.7K,2021,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-best-cryptocurrency-to-invest-in-long-term-Why

In my opinion, these are the most interesting coins to hold for the long term:DIVIDIVI had one of the best performances in 2021 when it went from 0.03 cents to an all-time high of 0.19 cents and in September 2022 it already experienced a rise of +100%, going from 0.010 cents to 0.029 cents, so experienced analysts project that it can reach a value of +$2 at the end of 2022 and up to +$5 by the end of summer 2023, and from there to the moon! Divi also just updated its roadmap, undoubtedly it's one of the most promising altcoins out there today.Also, DiviWallet 2.0 has made a big impact due to the multiple functions it has. In addition, DIVI offers participation and is a leader in innovation with its 5 levels of masternodes that allow people of different income levels to have one, not only producing large amounts but valuable rewards that have a high ROR. It also has various use cases plus gift cards and its FinTech, which produce the demand for the coin and this is what will help the coin gain value. With its low transaction fees, this coin is great for everyday payments, so this bear market is the perfect opportunity to get your hands on some new coins. Divi in ​​2022 made two associations, one with #LaLiga and the other with TPT Global Tech means that we can expect a lot of growth and adoption very soon.It is undoubtedly one of the most promising altcoins out there today and has a very educationalCARDANOBITCOINPOLKADOTThese next few years will be key for cryptocurrencies to convince and position themselves as indispensable currencies, we will see what happens in the end.

Fortunately, these days I’ve just figured out a potential one called METASHIBA.
