It’s seven stories high, built of concrete and steel, and it will mass around 400,000 tonnes.Even assuming that this thing works as a fusion reactor - which is a claim I think one should remainI suppose that you could break it down into small enough pieces with sledghammers or jack hammers and then throw the pieces at your enemies. But rocks can be had from the nearest quarries and people know how to make all kinds of weapons far more easily.Here’s a photo of the very first thermonuclear fusion bomb ever to be tested, in the Ivy Mike shot. It used liquid deuterium fuel. This is a close up shot of the device. You can see that it is contained in a large building. You can see the scale by looking at the man sitting there, and the other man standing at a work table on the far right of the frame.The horizontal tubes heading to the right are instrumentation devices. The giant vertical can contains the bomb. This device yielded 10.5 megaton TNT. Here’s a picture of the mushroom cloud from the explosion, taken from an observation aircraft from many, many miles away.You can see that it was a very successful explosion.But this was by no means a deliverable weapon. Your enemies are simply not going to let you spend months to a year, building, in one of their cities, a very large structure with associated control circuitry, and then allow you to fill it up with liquid deuterium, and then just detonate it. They are going to, inevitably, ask some pointed questions of you first …So a lot of research was left for the US bomb developers to turn this into a weapon. This was done and the designs were tested in the Castle series of nuclear weapons tests, one of which, Castle Bravo, turned out - completely unexpectedly - to be the largest yield test ever done in the US weapons testing program. Here’s a picture of that device, which was called SHRIMP. Instead of liquid deuterium, it used solid lithium deuteride as the source of fusion fuel and had a considerably more compact design using lighter metals and better explosives.It was much smaller and lighter than the device in Ivy Mike but still, at 10.5 tonnes, and 4.5 m long by 1 m in diameter, it was considered too heavy and too large to be practically deliverable by bomber. The Air Force insisted on smaller designs, and eventually these were made. For ICBMs, when they were finally built, still smaller and lighter warheads were required.The first H-bomb that was, practically, deliverable by air, may have been the RDS-37, designed mostly by Andrei Sakharov, and reportedly yielding about 3 MT. It was dropped from a Tupolev bomber in November 1955 in the initial test at Semipalatinsk. By all reports it operated on similar principles to the Teller-Ulam design that was tested in the Ivy Mike shot and it was also a lithium deuteride based weapon like the Castle Bravo device.Now, here is a mockup cutaway drawing of the ITER tokamak, the device that will, hopefully, sustain aIt has very strong magnets that confine and heat a rather dilute tritium/deuterium plasma. The key purpose of the design here is to confine that plasma for as long as possible and to heat the plasma as much as possible, so that the fusion rate, and so the generated power, will be high enough to balance or exceed the power that has to be put in to achieve the heating and confinement.But such a reactor is simply not designed to explode, and it cannot explode in a thermonuclear explosion.There is a lot of energy stored in the magnetic field of such a fusion reactor, and if the superconductors making that field were suddenly quenched, it could likely create a big mechanical explosion, destroying maybe even the whole complex as a result. So this is certainly an engineering contingency that has to be planned for by the designers. But the hot dilute plasma would instantly leak away in that case. There would be no uncontrolled runaway fusion explosion. There could not be.So there is no practical sense in which such a test fusion reactor can ever be made into a weapon, none that I can see.It is already well-known to people who are expert on it, how to make thermonuclear weapons, fusion based weapons. A fusion reactor is a completely different kind of animal.Oh, and as for using fast neutrons from deuterium/tritium fusion reactions to produce plutonium from natural uranium, or uranium-233 from thorium-232, that is theoretically possible, but it still doesn’t make even a working fusion reactor into a weapon. Anyways breeding fissile isotopes for use in fission bombs is by now very easily done using conventional, quite standard nuclear fission reactors, followed by chemical processing. This is also very far from being easy to do, due to the radiation dangers, but it can certainly be accomplished given a sufficiently talented and well-trained team, and the right equipment. It would be far easier to get neutrons for this purpose from other, much easier and cheaper to build sources, but still very intense sources, than to get neutrons from a prototype fusion reactor.If you want to design a weapon, then you set out to design a weapon, not a fusion reactor.And the quickest way to do that design is to buy or obtain help from a government that has done it already, and which for its own reasons, is willing to offer help.It turns out that designing fusion reactors is actually far more difficult than designing fusion weapons.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

1,"As others explained, making nuclear fusion happen is relatively easy.But that kind of misses the point. What we want to do is making sustained nuclear fusion.Worse yet, we want to achieve a power density that exceeds the interior of the Sun by something like a factor of a million or so, but without the benefit of the one mechanism that the Sun relies on, gravitational confinement.To wit: Nuclear fusion happens in the deep interior of the Sun because the Sun is colossally massive (more than 300,000 times more massive than the Earth), so its self gravity compresses its interior to the temperaturAs others explained, making nuclear fusion happen is relatively easy.But that kind of misses the point. What we want to do is making sustained nuclear fusion.Worse yet, we want to achieve a power density that exceeds the interior of the Sun by something like a factor of a million or so, but without the benefit of the one mechanism that the Sun relies on, gravitational confinement.To wit: Nuclear fusion happens in the deep interior of the Sun because the Sun is colossally massive (more than 300,000 times more massive than the Earth), so its self gravity compresses its interior to the temperatures and pressures that are needed for fusion to take place.But very, very slowly and inefficiently. How slowly? It produces less than 300 watts of heat per cubic meter. That’s comparable to… a well-maintained compost pile. Its less than the power density of our human metabolism.That’s all. That’s what you get when you lump enough mass to make more than 300,000 Earths.We obviously do not have 300,000 spare Earths to play with, and it would not be very practical either. So we cannot use gravitational confinement. We are trying to use other means to confine the fusion fuel for sustained fusion.And we aren’t simply trying to mimic the Sun. We want to do better. After all, for a practical fusion power generating station, we want to be able to produce a lot more power, perhaps up to a few hundred megawatts of raw thermal power per cubic meter inside the reactor. So we are trying to best the Sun by a factor of a million, give or take.That is hard. That is, if I may use somewhat unprofessional language, damn hard. Insanely hard.Which is why, nearly 70 years after the first uncontrolled fusion explosion (aka. hydrogen bomb) here on the Earth, we still do not have working fusion power stations.I thank my generous supporters on",457 followers,Jason Heinisch,1K,1.2K,2.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Would-it-be-possible-to-turn-a-hydrogen-fusion-reactor-into-a-weapon
2,"No, probably not.So, the main stopping block to nuclear fusion is the lack of homogeneity in the plasma, which is only made worse with a smaller reactor, not better. Let me explain. Most attempts at fusion use a toroid design (a big donut shape) with the ionized gas being accelerated by large electromagnets around the outside.While this process does turn some of that gas to plasma, meaning a dissoNo, probably not.So, the main stopping block to nuclear fusion is the lack of homogeneity in the plasma, which is only made worse with a smaller reactor, not better. Let me explain. Most attempts at fusion use a toroid design (a big donut shape) with the ionized gas being accelerated by large electromagnets around the outside.While this process does turn some of that gas to plasma, meaning a dissociated jumble of ions, it does not turn all of it to plasma. That is problem number one. The second problem is that a plasma now is filled with charged particles that have, you guessed it, their own little magnetic fields. This means that they mess with the other ions in unpredictable and unwanted ways. This lack of uniformity means that you need to have bigger and more expensive magnets to push them back in line and behave. This means that you need a bigger reactor and more power to get the thing going.The last factor that makes size a big deal is just the...","220,644 followers",Franklin Veaux,823,47.3K,783.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Would-it-be-possible-to-turn-a-hydrogen-fusion-reactor-into-a-weapon

This is because terrestrial fusion devices can achieve much higher fusion reaction rates with hydrogen isotopes like Deuterium or Tritium.Fusion experiments employ a range of underlying technolgies, and some types of fusion have safety liabilities - but more in the way of industrial accidents as opposed to military weapons.Robert Steinhaus's answer to Can scientists experimenting with fusion create a disaster?Robert Steinhaus's answer to Is a nuclear fusion reactor safe?Some conventional non-nuclear fusion safety problem areas-First generation fusion systems will initially struggle to produce reliable electrical power. Fusion reactors tend to be more complex than current fission reactors or fossil fuel power plants. Greater fusion power plant complexity could initially in the first couple of decades of operation tend to translate into unpredictable breakdowns and unplanned outages in power generation. Breakdowns in power generation can damage sensitive electronics and injure delicate loads on the grid that require smooth predictable electrical power without dropouts or transients and in some cases, this can produce a safety problem.- Many fusion experiments utilize very high voltages while producing fusion conditions in plasma. Fusion nuclear workers can be subject to potentially fatal non-nuclear electrical shock while installing and maintaining high voltage systems.Robert Steinhaus's answer to What are some of the negatives of nuclear fusion?It is possible that neutrons produced by commercial fusion reactors could be used to breed fissile fuels for conventional atomic weaponsThere is a small risk that early fusion reactors could be used to manufacture weapons materials for conventional fission and fission-fusion bombs.Fusion reactors operating using DT or DD fusion reactions are abundant sources of cheap neutrons. If fertile nuclear fuels like Thorium or U238 are placed in a breeding blanket surrounding the fusion chamber, weapons materials like U233 or Pu239 can be produced using abundant fusion neutrons. It should be possible to provide safeguards to prevent this, but periodic inspection of fusion reactors by IAEA nuclear inspectors may be necessary to ensure DT and DD fusion reactors are not used to breed fissile materials used to make conventional atomic bombs.Safeguard Requirements for Fusion Power PlantsPure fusion weaponsGiven the ingenuity of man, there is unfortunately some chance that pure fusion technology with entirely peaceful intensions could at some point be applied first to peaceful industrial explosives for excavation and mining and then at some point be redirected toward some form of pure fusion weapon. It is possible to kill with the energy releassed in burning a gallon of automotive gasoline. Practical fusion systems that release commercial energy are likely to have some hazards associated with them. Engineered safety systems will probably be needed to ensure the safety of fusion power plants and ensure the public is fully protected from all hazards.It should be noted that the development of pure fusion weapons is not an entirely negative prospect.Pure fusion weapons would retain many of the advantages of fusion (the majority of fusion fuels arecompletely nonradioactive and the nuclear waste pure fusion produces is only nonradioactive Hellium and free neutrons with an averagee lifetime of only about 15 minutes before they decay into harmless subatomic particles).Pure fusion weapons would in fact be a significant moral advance if people in the future continue to rely on explosive weapons to deter war.A pure fusion weapon can be designed to produce minimal (perhaps no) fallout or fission products at all. It is fallout that presents a long term hazard to life following use of conventional nuclear fission or fission-fusion weapons. Most of the fallout actually results from the fission side of current bombs. A pure fusion weapon could produce a significant (large) release of energy but the long term environmental impacts of use of pure fusion weapons can be designed to be very short term in effect (days with protective equipment and a few weeks without protective equipment). In contrast fission and fission-fusion weapons designs can spread fallout widely and that fallout can be hazardous to humans for hundreds to thousands of years.If mankind insists on retaining nuclear weapons, is would probably be in the interests of everyone on the planet and for all future generation to insist that all weapons retained for national defense be pure fusion weapons producing minimal fallout and minimal long term environmental impact.Note1:DOE published in 2001 the following document -RESTRICTED DATA DECLASSIFICATION DECISIONS 1946 TO THE PRESENThttp://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/rdd-7.htmlcontained in section C of that document are the following facts:Information on the DOE's pure fusion program:(1) Fact that the DOE made a substantial investment in the past to develop a pure fusion experimental explosive device(2) That the U.S. does not have and is not developing a pure fusion weapon; and(3) That no credible design for a pure fusion weapon resulted from the DOE investment.

Several feet of concrete is a reasonable minimum.Reactors also tend to have other requirements absent in RTGs. An RTG has a hot, radioactive spot, and a thermoelectric couple, and then a radiator fin creating a cold spot. This is satisfactory in an RTG, which will typically be used in a location (like a spacecraft) where it won’t ever see maintenance. Therefore, an RTG can accept the low efficiency of the thermoelectric couple. However, a small reactor on Earth would likely benefit from higher efficiency power conversion, like a steam generator or gas turbine. That adds bulk, additional systems (like cooling), and complications to your radiation shielding scheme.I’m sure you could make a small accelerator-driven reactor.
