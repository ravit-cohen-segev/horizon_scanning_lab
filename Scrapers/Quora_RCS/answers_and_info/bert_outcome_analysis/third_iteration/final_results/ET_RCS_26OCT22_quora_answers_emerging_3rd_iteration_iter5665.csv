This is your product and services.To bring value to a business client, you will need to know their business. That’s why you need business analyst skills. You will need to put down your developer hat and wear a business hat to talk business with them. This is how you sell your product.Finally, most of the time you are delivering some kind of finished product to your clients, unless you are the true kind of consultant who charges $500/hr for advice only, then you will need to manage your timeline and activities. How you do this, what methodologies you use, means shit to the client - they are only interested in when and the quality. This is how you deliver your products and services.To start your career in tech consulting, the big players are your best choice. But don’t stay too long. Get out to different technologies and industries. Stand out on your own. Make clients know you and not your company. Don’t be worried about hopping jobs too often - any consulting firm is more than happy to just chuck in a senior consultant from somewhere and throw it in the client’s face for $1000 a day.After u have done some years in those big firms, hop on to smaller ones where you are more visible and “naked” - where you will have to wear multiple hats to the client - programmer, tester, project manager, account manager, etc. Where there is no one else to escalate to when shit hits the fan. This will grow your skills as a consultant and make yourself valuable to future clients and even employers.Of course, you can still stay in the big four and enjoy a nice cushy career for the rest of your life. There’s nothing wrong with that - you are paid well and you have job security. but if you want to be a true consultant, go out and see the world.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-does-an-Emerging-Technology-consultant-do

And choosing a career in these domains should be more about your interests than simply joining the bandwagon. If joining the bandwagon is the intent, AI wins handsdown as a recent survey conducted by IIT Madras in collaboration with Office of Principal Scientific Advisor to PM shows. The survey indicated 43% of Indian respondents perceiving AI as the big bet while Quantum computing trails a distant second and technology like 5G is languishing in single digits of public perception.The perception may not be the truth and it maybe deceptive.For starters, AI seems the most attractive due to its potential to replace human mental intervention by emulating the nature's most amazing creation - human brain.However, much of our daily function of brain is dependent on memory and prior experiences which makes Data a vital component of AI.The explosion of Data creation has to lead to a corresponding expansion in Data Science in order to makes sense of it. While Data Science will feed patterns and structure into AI, cybersecurity is no less important. At the end of the day, any ecosystem will not sustain until the credibility and fidelity of systems aren't guaranteed and cybersecurity will emerge as an important factor.Regardless of Data Scientist to feed into AI or cybersecurity experts to keep the ecosystem safe, it's User experiences which will ultimately drive demand. The coolest technology will need to have an equally cool front end design aka User Interface or the whole technology may fall flat. True that Facebook today has massive Network effect but it's equally true that a lousy interface can alienate users to other platforms in a matter of weeks or months. It's UX which enhances user experience and ensures loyalty towards a brand of product or service.What about cloud or 5G you may say. Cloud is just ""other person's computer"" while 5G is mostly about higher speed and better infrastructure.It's UX design which will be the new customer experience touch point, AI - the new employee, Data - the new oil and Cybersecurity - the new policeman.","3,754 followers",Venkateshwar Jayakanth,9.7K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-does-an-Emerging-Technology-consultant-do
