But in the last four years, .NET Core has been proven to run fast, and reliably on pretty much all major platforms. According to the benchmarks game, C# running on .NET Core is actually faster than Java.In the upcoming months, all the separate .Net versions are being unified into a single .NET: .NET 5. That means everything. .Net Core, Mono, Xamarin and the .NET framework are all being joined into a single entity, further proving the portability of the code.There are amazing new projects that make it all more interesting:Blazor for example.

7,"We don’t “have to.” You could row a trireme from Europe to Asia. But when the actual costs are calculated, it is far too expensive.That’s true of most technology. Steam engines had to stop every hour or two for water and fuel.

When we got mail trains, your reply could come on Wednesday.Then we got electric signalling. A telegram sent on Monday Morning may well receive a reply before 5 o’ clock on Monday night. This led to telephones, where you could receive an instant reply verbally, and act before the paperwork arrived, and radio, where we could receive information autonomously and act upon it, and television, which is radio with pictures, conveying much more. Now we have internet streaming, so you can get your info as you demand, and e-mail, which is actually a step backwards from the telephone but is quicker and cheaper than post and telegraph.Mechanical eng tends to move at a slower pace than electronic because it’s all based on screws, pulleys, levers, wheels and axles, and inclined planes and there’s only so much you can do in banging those together, but nevertheless the Hyundai thing in the driveway is demonstrably faster, safer, more efficient and more comfortable than my grandad’s Austin 7 which in turn is more comfy, efficient etc than the Landau my great-grandmother might have ponced about in:Though why she’d have been poncing about in that particular Landau, which belonged to the High Sherrif of Wiltshire, she never vouchsafed to me, and one does not like to ask such things.In short, we replace the old with the new when the new does the same job as the old but more conveniently.

10,"The one military system that I can immediately think of that was far more useful when applied in a different mission than its original designed purpose is this big beautiful bastard:The F-105 Thunderchief was originally designed as a tactical nuclear bomber, one that would fly over the front lines in an anticipated European theater against the Soviets, supersonic and low altitude, to deliver a tactical nuke against command and control elements.

Instead, it found itself flying over strike missions over the jungles of Vietnam, thanks to its capability of carrying more bombs on its external pylons than a B-17. As rugged as the Thunderchief was, it was woefully out of its element in Vietnam, and performed admirably thanks to its more than capable pilots, and the amazing air crews that kept them aloft. The plane was extremely rugged, but not as maneuverable as the MiG-21 it faced. It was eventually pulled from service due to high losses, but not before leaving its mark on the war, showing how capable the platform was as a strike aircraft.But that’s not the unusual application of the Thud, as these warhorses were known as. A major problem that arose in Vietnam was the Soviet surface-to-air missiles (SAM) that were deployed. These missiles were a major threat to the B-52 bombing campaigns. Thanks to the ability of the Thud to take massive damage, as well as its endurance, the Thud took on the role of “Wild Weasel”, essentially baiting the missile sites to find them and attack with anti-radiation missiles.","358,952 followers",Sean Kernan,11.4K,5.6K,726.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-technology-that-could-replace-Java-in-the-future

You’ve tried everything.The IED’s deaths slow down.….and then they pick back up again. It’s frustrating and it is stumping your entire team.You don’t have any idea who is doing it. After the bomb goes off you have no way of knowing how it got there. Nobody will talk to you. The terrorists have control over the populace.It happens at random. It is happening constantly.How do you solve this problem:One solution in the sky is predators. You have a fleet of them.You can have them follow the riskiest persons you know of, keeping track of their whereabouts.This presents a secondary problem: your predators can videotape these people. But IED’s are still going off. They aren’t being planted by these individuals.This is called “the soda straw problem”.It simply refers to the idea that your sky drones can only video one thing at a time, they cannot see the whole picture.Your soldiers are still dying.Here is how “hypothetical” you solves that problem:New technology emerges called Constant Hawk.It’s a special video technology developed by the smartest people in the US Military Contracting.It’s a special camera that attaches to the bottom of your planes:These cameras, flown on several planes around the clock, allow you to create real-time google earth that lives and breathes as you choose.Just imagine you could open up google earth right now, and zoom in anywhere in the world, down to micro levels. Watching what people are doing.Constant Hawk does this.Now - this won’t allow you to stop every bomb initially. When you are viewing this live google earth, it will just look like a city full of people. Cars moving in and about.There won’t be a giant picture of a guy with a bomb that says “Get him!”.But here’s how it helps clinch the problem.This camera isn’t just watching - it is recording.The next time an IED goes off on a road.You can then work your way back in time, zooming in on that exact spot in the road, and find the part where suddenly, a car stops alongside the road and men get out to dig a hole and place the bomb.You can then continue working your way backward in reverse on this recording, seeing where that car came from, where the men got in, what stops they made.You will have a wormhole into the past.

Allen in his book, you get the numbers below.To put the energy numbers in perspective, this GE Diesel locomotive weighs around 400,000 pounds. If you could convert the energy delivered by the P-47 firing, into thrust, 4 minutes worth would move this beast 1 foot.In 2009, the Army awarded General Dynamics a $9M contract to design and build prototypes to replace the aging M2 design. They came up with this.The weapon, at 40 pounds, was about half the weight of the Browning, had improved safety features, and was easier to disassemble. There were only 2 problems.They couldn't get anywhereIn 2012, the program was cancelled, and they decided to spend the money on improvements to the M2.Ma’ Deuce lives!!!!Edit One: 3/12/2019Look at the recoil movement on the barrel.

While there are tents you can use to climb a mountain, non are as rugged as an Army artic tent (you pay for it in weight).Army field ration packaging has not changed much since the 1980s. There are dehydrated foods, but they don’t taste as good and they are a lot more expensive.They still have field phones with hand cranks. You can run out of batteries.Our machetes, axes, and shovels can not be replaced chainsaws and backhoes (we use them), there are not enough chainsaws and backhoes, the require fuel and maintance and there are not as mobile.Airborne forces still use static line parachute systems instead of free fall systems. The basic design dates to WW2.The Canadian engineer knife dates atleast the 1970’s. It is a great design.While we use GPS, I can not imagine a Canadian Infantry Senior NCO or officer leaving his house without a compass based on design from the 1950s.Like wise the Canadian Army will still issue whistles to infantry leaders who want them for signalling. Though most use a Fox40. At least a twenty year old design. Pen flares, about the size of a close pin, that use a spring mech to fire date back to at least to the early 80’s but maybe back to the 1950’s.Canadian assault boats look they same as they did in the early 1970’s.Some units still take manual typewiters into the field. They don’t need power and they secure from intercept.We still teach some of our soldiers to canoe.We use thirty and forty year old cross country skis.The M72 light anti-tank rocket (no ones uses it on tanks, but it is ok on light skinned vehicles near it is great for blowing holes through walls was used in Vietnam. It ain’t leaving the system anytime soon.The 50cal MG used by the Canadain Army dates to atleast the 1960’s. It is an awesome weapon.The Canadian Army uses a 50 year old thermos, a sixty year old 1 quart water bottle, a 30 year 2 quarter water bottle, and a 15 year old camelback.They use a forty year fresh food container system (metal not plastic) supplied by a fifty year field kitchen.They use the same stretchers they used during the Korean War.I am sure I can think of more if I took the time.There are, as others pointed out, three reasons for this. They are:There is a lot of equipment. It is very expensive to replace it. Armies focus on the biggest bang for the buck which usually means weapons systems, optics, radars, camouflage and things that will save lives (helmets, vests, medical equipment) before things that will make life more comfortable.Sometimes, primitive is better. It may be more reliable and stronger than the new tech.Third, sometimes, an Army designs the perfect piece of kit or adopts the perfect of piece of kit and nothing new can compete with it (assault boats, pen flares, army rations, hand crank field phones, and knives come to mind).",26 followers,Frank Zhang,9.7K,142,4.7M,2016,https://www.quora.com/If-technology-is-slowly-but-surely-replacing-jobs-what-industries-will-todays-20-year-olds-be-in-when-they-turn-40
