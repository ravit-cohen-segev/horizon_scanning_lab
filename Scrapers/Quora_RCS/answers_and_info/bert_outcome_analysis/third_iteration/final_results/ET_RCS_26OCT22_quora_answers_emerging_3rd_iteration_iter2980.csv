3,"I consider Artificial intelligence as the greatest technology of human society as of 2019.Artificial intelligence (AI)Computer or computer-controlledRobot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience.

The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very complex tasks—as, for example, discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess —with great proficiency. Still, despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. On the other hand, some programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals in performing certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications a diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, and voice or handwriting recognition.What is the purpose of artificial intelligence?The traditional problems (or goals) of research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects. GeneralHow artificial intelligence changing the world.The advent of Artificial Intelligence, or AI as it is more commonly called, has been accompanied to a large extent by high-profile prediction of pessimism and doom. We read that the age of automation will mean that no worker will be safe from replacement by a machine and that the robots are coming for our jobs. There are even survival guides that warn us that we must start putting strategies in place to profit rather than perish when the inevitable happens. We hear from tech moguls such as Elon Musk, who publically critiques, AI and warns government officials that AI poses a greater disruptive risk to the world than a North Korean nuclear attackCredits : Kimberly Chulis","66,035 followers",Niklas Göke,22.5K,235,32.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-has-advancing-technology-improved-your-life-from-the-beginning-of-2019-to-2020

8,"At first, we should understand what is technology and its importance in our life?Like most, I use technology such as computers and the Internet to complete schoolwork, projects, and to conduct research. Technology helps to speed up the learning process for students like myself because it creates a more efficient learning environment in many ways.Technology is an absolute need we cannot escape from. Let’s just say, it has a very big role in most aspects of our lives. In other words, it answers most of the Mankind problems. Across centuries technology evolves.

Technology helps to speed up the learning process for students like myself because it creates a more efficient learning environment in many ways.Technology is an absolute need we cannot escape from. Let’s just say, it has a very big role in most aspects of our lives. In other words, it answers most of the Mankind problems. Across centuries technology evolves. The importance of technology is aiming for comfort of use in whichever form it is. It always directs for easiness in life.Take mobile technology for example. The faster the world is moving, the more hi-end the features are offered. Laptop gets thinner and smaller. It becomes more compact every year and offers more capabilities and top performance. It should load a lot of stuff in a more concise shape. That is the need. Period. People should not take time to think of what should be brought over a sales presentation in the southern state since everything is already “filed” in the laptop.How technology can change our life?Technology has changed our lives by increasing the speed of time. We were human. We invented and developed the technologies to change our life to its best. Now that technology is changing our lives every second.Robots are our new human model and at the end, only robots control this world. Technology is now trying to go inside our body it’s almost there and the target is human blood and emotions. So, far! Technology is successful in that.In business, the use of Artificial Intelligence, cloud computing, machine learning, predictive analytics, and business intelligence tools, applications now creating new methods to conduct, operate and manage the business.The rise of cloud computing, cloud storage, Artificial intelligence, and Machine learning is the example, that we will be soon on the node that connects our body and capture the data of human activities in real time.Invention and development of Technology have changed our life positively and negatively. The new technologies and inventions are results of our curiosity, creativity, and problem-solving techniques.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-has-advancing-technology-improved-your-life-from-the-beginning-of-2019-to-2020
9,"When you think about technology advancement you need to consider the level of expertise. For example, if Japan, Singapore, Korean and the UK ranks top in their technological expertise and let’s say works towards artificial intelligence - it’s one thing.And when you take developing countries working towards AI, you may hesitate to call their technology an advanced one, even if it is the technology of the same domain.Unhackable internet,Anti-ageing drugs,Digital money,AI-based hyper-personalized medicineSeems like advanced technologies and the list of them would be quite long if we go into moreWhen you think about technology advancement you need to consider the level of expertise.
