2,"Assuming the best lenses from 50 years ago forward, the lens design has advanced in making lenses faster without sacrificing resolution. Lens design has advanced in allowing lenses to focus closer to the subject without being a specialized macro lens. And some of the newer lenses collimate light in a way as to force the rays of light to travel within a very small tolerance of angle into the sensor wells. In analogue (film) cameras there was no need to collimate light so radically in a straight line since film didn’t care as long as the light struck the film plane.

Lens design has advanced in allowing lenses to focus closer to the subject without being a specialized macro lens. And some of the newer lenses collimate light in a way as to force the rays of light to travel within a very small tolerance of angle into the sensor wells. In analogue (film) cameras there was no need to collimate light so radically in a straight line since film didn’t care as long as the light struck the film plane. In digital the sensor wells really care how straight into the well each ray of light travels, so the newer designs add this as a design feature.Also there has been several other design features, one of which are the coatings and the other of which are the materials used in the lenses and some of the elements in the lens design doing extra special duty. Fresnell lenses and aspherical lenses incorporated into the lens design have aided in improving over all performance of the transmission of light within the lens.What has not improved all that much for lenses of a normal to narrow angle of view is resolution, old lenses were designed even a hundred years ago to resolve with a great deal of accuracy. The exception to that are smaller format wide angle lenses especially those for single lens reflex cameras have evolved in resolution greatly. In large format that is not as true, but an ultra wide lens for an 8 x 10 camera is 159mm long and usually a whopping f/9 to boot, so getting a lot of resolution out of a 6 inch lens is not too much of a trick. Even 30 years ago wide angle lenses for a 4 x 5 were high resolving lenses and I doubt they have gotten any sharper in the last 30 years. What has improved dramatically are medium format wide angle lenses for digital, especially the ultra wide lenses.","41,225 followers",Dave Haynie,680,6.9K,95.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-have-camera-lenses-evolved-with-the-implementation-of-newer-technologies-over-the-last-few-decades

8,"I find this question interesting as this is the central tenet of the philosophy of Pere Teilhard de Chardin, SJ.He believes in ‘involution’ rather than ‘evolution’. We are collectively involving into one being. Life was destined to be directed to one spiritual end point. Technology is not by accident, but rather by design and it is inevitable. It is an essential part of the involutionary process which will create the noosphere. Because earth is limited in size, humanity had to converge and merge together. Disparate people met. Technology enables physical merger.

We are collectively involving into one being. Life was destined to be directed to one spiritual end point. Technology is not by accident, but rather by design and it is inevitable. It is an essential part of the involutionary process which will create the noosphere. Because earth is limited in size, humanity had to converge and merge together. Disparate people met. Technology enables physical merger. But it also enables the merger of the mind and this he terms the noosphere. The Noosphere is shared thought and experience. A thought or feeling would no longer be remote but rather, it would be experienced everywhere, by everyone at once. The spiritual implication of this is to cause man to reach the omega point.According to Teilhard, there were three ‘quantum’ leaps (of kind), from rock to life, from life to intelligent life, and then finally to Godhead, or the Omega Point. The process accelerates and speeds up. It was eons from rock to life. From life to intelligent life was not quite so long. Since the birth of mankind, it was a short time to recorded history. It was a very short time from recorded history to the birth of steam. Then even shorter to the discovery of electricity. Then to the discovery of electrical emissions or waves. Then the Radio was developed. Then the television and then the computer. The biggest creation of earth is the internet. Technology is advancing very quickly, and the experience of man is becoming universal. The Omega Point is the end of mankind in a universal spiritual experience. If Teilhard is correct, we are accelerating towards this point.I’m happy that we have attained the technology we have. We really don’t need any more. I say we get into a holding pattern and hover for a while.

In reality, the universe is more like Spirit that it is like we have been badly told about matter. I have been asked to call that ‘Pure Information’.At the moment, most of society is run by those who deeply feel that they are ‘not enough’ and are competing to see if they can ever ‘feel better’ by getting even more. Although that is not working (and can never work) they don’t understand what Love is and deny that it is important. Love and spirituality go together, so society steers us away from spirituality into just barely surviving in Fear.Anyone who gets deeply into Love and spirituality becomes uncontrollable and, if you use Fear to control others so that you can feel safer, those who choose Love are dangerous and must be dissuaded from staying there!
