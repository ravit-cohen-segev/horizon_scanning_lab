0,"CRISPR and similar method of genome editing. Once we understand complete DNA interactions and have the ability to change it as we like, we world is truly ours. See the grass growing in the front yard. Instead of making carbohydrates in form of grass proteins, imagine growing the same supply of pure gasoline on your front yard. Nevermind gas, same machinery that grows grass, can be diverted to growing spare hearts, lungs l and all vital organs in essentially unlimited quantity. Third set of teeth, no problem.

3,Aviation as a whole is VERY slow to change. (if it works don't mess with it attitude)general aviation aircraft are flying with engines designed in the 1920 and 30’s.with that said aviation has evolved lots in the past 20 years in regards to avionics and radios.747–100747–800Aviation as a whole is VERY slow to change.

4,"Nanotechnology, but in a really cool way.You remember the microbots in Big Hero 6, right? Well, unfortunately, those microbots are impossible, but there is a similar technology that’s being developed in real life.The idea is to build tiny replicators that can create more of themselves, like a sort of super bacteria that never stops replicating. Such a technology would be“…the first replicator assembles a copy in one thousand seconds, the two replicators then build two more in the next thousand seconds, the four build another four . . in less than two days, theyNanotechnology, but in a really cool way.You remember the microbots in Big Hero 6, right?

But they would have an abundance of material on Earth, especially of carbon, which would likely be the building blocks of such an assemblers. If you were carrying a jar of them and tripped and they spilled out, and they had no limit, they would quickly devour the entire earth with no way of stopping them.But here is where things get interesting: These tiny robots would have the ability to construct molecules from atoms, giving them the ability to produce amazing materials like graphene, cubes of apple, and even brain material.With advanced nanotechnology in the form of self-replicators, the entire world would experience a revolution. Think for a second about what wouldn’t change in the face of machines that can produceProduction jobs would cease. The price of every item ever created would be lowered massively. Supercomputers and experiments regarding brain material would become almost commonplace. Terraforming other planets would take years if not months. And all of this is actuallyThere is a lot of power contained within those tiny machines.",30 followers,Vijaya Lakshmi,691,1.2K,43.4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-s-the-coolest-upcoming-technology-you-know-of-especially-eye-technology
