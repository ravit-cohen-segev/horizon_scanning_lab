The feeling of not getting a project for a month (even though some of my friend are not getting a project for a year.this is same true am not joke to you) think about these guys mindset and their dreams are start breaking like a oldship starts sinking in the sea.Anyway after some days I managed to have a project in some other which the domain is none of my interest and none of the domain which I had undergone during my training and it also a supporting project. Almost feel like lost everything and I don't have anyother choice. They gave me two chance, one is to take the support project and the second one is to quit the job. Think from my point of view,I am from middle class family where I have to support my family income if I was jobless than how can i do support my family income. Also another thing is bond amount,if you break it you have to pay the amount that is simply impossible for my condition right. So,I choose the 1st and only option which is joining to work for the support project.Now the F**king life starts these are thinks I have felt when I was working in a support project I don't think everyone feel this.1). I was felt that I am a waste and even though dustbin are much better me.2). I was felt that I am just simply wasting my 10 hours.damn waste (just doing some kind of data entry work in MS -excel)3).At sometimes I feel that forgot all my data structure and algorithm concepts.4). Sometime I feel that 4 year degree (every knows it's not piece of cake to get ) is just a f**king joke and that's not require to become a software engineer oops sorry system engineer in a MNC service based company.5).all the time,my thinking is my future (hey guys you don't how passionate when I was joining the company and starting my career in a top most software company)and realise that these not dreams.6). Sometime I want to quit my job but I can't because the reason I have to pay a bulk bond amount , unemployment and also won't burden to my families.7).stop using all social medias except quora8).literally lost the real happy me and wears a silent mask to everything happen around me.9). Start talking less and even sometime not a single word a day.10).damn politics, if you are boot licking guy then you can survive else you will suffer a lot I can earn sure about that.11)…. Continues.... a lot I can say.So ,this is how a fresher may have felt in Service based MNC call centres(sorry software companies).Beyond this, I had a strong faith that There is some dignity for all who are born as human in this world.So,start search for my dignity and start asking for these kind of questions1.why should I born2.for what should I bornI start thinking about myself and start learning about myself….I don't want myself to stressed down with my situation rather than I work my assoff to searching searching searching (still i am searching the reason behind my question). But I will find my those anwser soon.Please DM me incase of any gramatical mistakes in my answer because this was my first answer in quora and this answer take around 30mins to write my experience in this answer.RegardsKarthik .","2,919 followers",Taejun TJ Lee,1.7K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-is-best-for-developing-hybrid-mobile-apps-for-both-iOS-and-Android

You can learn almost everything about blockchain within only 2–3 months.I also put the time behind how long each point will probably take:Once, you have done that, you are already very far ahead in terms of blockchain development. There are probably less than 1,000 developers that have done the above things and there is currently a lot of demand for blockchain developers.Currently blockchain developers are mostly only needed by people who want to start their own cryptocurrency, which aren’t that many.Once banks, government, large companies will start to adopt blockchain, this need will explode, because blockchain will go into the mainstream.If you want to complete your blockchain knowledge and know everything about blockchain development, you can also do these 2 thingsThen you are probably among the most experienced 200 blockchain developers worldwide and very in demand.ConclusionSo, these are the steps to become a real blockchain developer. This all only takes 2–3 months in total, so the learning curve is very steep.I believe blockchain developers will be the developers most in demand in 2 years, so it’s definitely a worthwhile investment.The best way to learn this is by joining a blockchain company, so this way you will actually get paid.There are only a few dozen blockchain companies per country right now, but they are looking for good developers all the time.Some good ones areThey all already have several blockchain projects and some also a couple of ICOs under their belt and are looking for good developers.If you found this answer helpful, please give an upvote.","31,158 followers",Phillip Remaker,1.7K,11K,78.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-is-best-for-developing-hybrid-mobile-apps-for-both-iOS-and-Android

11,"When the United States initiated aggressive sanctions against the Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei, which included the imposition of the ""foreign direct product rule"" to cut it off from the global semiconductor supply chain, many speculated as to whether the company was doomed altogether. Indeed, even its own founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei said the firm was in a struggle for survival. Some tough decisions were made in the wake of the damage, including the sale of its globally popular smartphone brand Honor to a private company, as well as in the inability to keep up its other leading brandWhen the United States initiated aggressive sanctions against the Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei, which included the imposition of the ""foreign direct product rule"" to cut it off from the global semiconductor supply chain, many speculated as to whether the company was doomed altogether. Indeed, even its own founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei said the firm was in a struggle for survival. Some tough decisions were made in the wake of the damage, including the sale of its globally popular smartphone brand Honor to a private company, as well as in the inability to keep up its other leading brands due to chip shortages. In turn, its sales revenues tumbled.However, 2021 will be looked back on as the year when Huawei's fortunes began to change for the better having previously ""hit the bottom"". Through the course of this struggle, the last 12 months has seen the firm plant all the seeds for its revival and prepare to emerge stronger than ever, whilst also simultaneously sustaining its lead as the single global leader in 5G despite Washington pushing many of its allies to ban it. If the United States has sought to destroy this company and curtail its global presence and rise, they have not succeeded. Now, the comeback is on.The Making of a software giantTo offset the damage dealt to its smartphone business, Huawei spent most of the year reorientating itself into a software, IT and cloud provider, an area which the company deemed ""bulletproof"" from American sanctions. Very quickly, Huawei raced around the world investing in IT academies in various developing countries, as well as pledging $300 million for startups in South East Asia, as well as 35 million Euros in European IT talent. By May of this year, it was reported by American think tank CSIS that Huawei had secured ""70 deals in 41 countries"" pertaining to cloud.In addition to this, 2021 also seen Huawei launch its own operating system, known as ""HarmonyOS"". Although often assumed to be simply a replacement for Google's Android after the imposition of US restrictions, the OS is designed to facilitate a wider vision of an ""internet of things"" spanning many devices including televisions, cars, household appliances and even a smart waterbottle! It currently has over 100 million users, and is to be launched globally in 2022. In conjunction with this, it continues to develop and expand the Huawei Appgallery store as its flagship provider of applicationsLaying the foundations for a new supply chainMore exciting and less noticeable however, is Huawei's efforts towards rebuilding its supply chain in the wake of America's weaponization of the semiconductor industry against it. Throughout the year, the company through its various subsidiaries, such as Hubble Technologies, acquired operating stakes in a number of local semiconductor and lithography companies, showing a clear intention to develop the technologies which the US had sought to deprive from it. Rumours circulated by summer that Huawei would establish a ""foundry"" in Wuhan.Then, on December 28th, it was announced that the firm had created a new subsidiary with 600 million Yuan capital known as ""Huawei Precision Manufacturing""- the latter term being defined as ""the manufacture of individual pieces with extreme accuracy. It is used to make parts for various machines, including medical, aeronautical, and any other industry that requires identical parts to be created in large quantities.""Huawei denied the new establishment was a chip making company, but told the press it ""will produce optical communication equipment optoelectronic devices; electronic Components and semiconductor discrete device manufacturing."" This led to a lot of speculation that despite the denial, the company was nonetheless affiliating itself with the chip industry anyway, in particular the construction of devices would then be sold to chipmakers. Either way, either way a significant breakthrough.Powering ahead in 5GBut despite these other developments, 2021 soon established the reality that the United States had failed to deliver significant blows against Huawei's 5G carrier and network business, despite getting a number of allies to blacklist the firm. As of the end of the year, Huawei continues the hold the largest 5G market share in the world, almost double of that of its competitors, Nokia and Ericsson. It continues in tandem to hold the world's largest number of 5G patents. It has recently completed 5G networks in Bangladesh and Laos, is building in Brazil, whilst also winning contract with Ooredoo to build 5G in Qatar, Indonesia, Algeria, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Tunisia, Myanmar and Maldives.""Building Back Better""The slogan ""build back better"" has frequently been used by the Biden administration to describe anti-China initiatives, such as on infrastructure, yet ironically the term could not be more suited to Huawei, who has spent the last 24 months laying the foundations to bounce back from all of the government assault against its enterprise. Indeed, the return of Meng Wanzhou from house arrest in Canada had also become a symbol of the company's perseverance, as well as its change in fortunes. Huawei has been targeted because the United States wishes to curb China's rise in critical technologies, but their biggest mistake is ultimately underestimating the company's resolve, and by turning it into a political stakes battle, they have a lot to prove now.
