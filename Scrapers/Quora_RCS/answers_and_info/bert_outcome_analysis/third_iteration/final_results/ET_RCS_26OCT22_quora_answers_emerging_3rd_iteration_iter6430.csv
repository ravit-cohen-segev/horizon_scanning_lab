0,"I don’t think that the fact that there are oceans between continents makes that much difference. It really only delayed colonization and wars etc. If we look at Europe as a single continent with a multitude of different peoples, we find fighting between tribes, wars and conquest and empires, their decline and the rise of others until finally we have the countries that are there today. The only difference between say the European continent and Australia, which is very distant, is that it took time for the development of ships that were able to travel a long way.

The only difference between say the European continent and Australia, which is very distant, is that it took time for the development of ships that were able to travel a long way. Once that was possible the same fighting and squabbles and wars emerged until finally there are independent nations. So I would say not much different, just that a lot of the wars etc would have happened sooner.",3 followers,Samuel Bateman,1.1K,102,56.3K,2016,https://www.quora.com/How-might-the-history-politics-and-technology-of-the-human-race-have-looked-different-if-we-had-evolved-during-the-time-of-a-single-super-continent-like-Pangaea

2,"The human lineage has possessed technology for at least 2.5 million years, and during that time there have been at least 3 separate species even by the most extreme “lumpers” assessment of what a species is.The possession of technology is not a very useful or practical way of defining a species in humans.This in truth is an issue of practical semantics and has little if anything to do with evolutionary theory itself.",22 followers,Tim Hill,968,4.5K,2.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-might-the-history-politics-and-technology-of-the-human-race-have-looked-different-if-we-had-evolved-during-the-time-of-a-single-super-continent-like-Pangaea
3,"Because technology as we understand the term, has not affected evolution.A generational duration of 20 years in human life means that since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, there have been less than fifteen generations, which is not sufficient for evolutionary change to the body.Bodily, the only difference between ourselves and our Cro-Magnon forebears is that we have smaller heads.",3 followers,Samuel Bateman,1.1K,102,56.3K,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-might-the-history-politics-and-technology-of-the-human-race-have-looked-different-if-we-had-evolved-during-the-time-of-a-single-super-continent-like-Pangaea
4,"CLUE: OP using the term “evolutionist” is possibly someone who divides the world into people who reject the idea of evolution on non-scientific grounds, and those who accept science as a “faith system.”Science actually is a faith system, with exactly one god, DATA. It has one sin, which is to fudge your data. This sin will always find you out and you will be cast into lay (outer) darkness.Since GOD really did say “Let there be light,” you must take it on faith that He said so 13.8 billion years ago.

6,I feel the name is limiting as people have an association with 3G already and it is already outdated. People could carry that association towards the company. I would avoid anything that is evolving (like 3G technology). I also feel that the word internet is too ambiguous. Too many redflags in my opinion,0 followers,Vonn Russell,6.1K,157,6.7M,2014,https://www.quora.com/How-might-the-history-politics-and-technology-of-the-human-race-have-looked-different-if-we-had-evolved-during-the-time-of-a-single-super-continent-like-Pangaea
7,"Terms like ""3G"" and ""i"" have really been branded strongly in the technological world that we live in. If I see a company name like ""3Gi"" I'm thinking its either something about the Internet or an Apple device, or it could possibly be 3G internet for my apple device, IT consulting doesn't come to mind when I look at this name. I do believe the term ""3G"" will limit the company name as it may feel outdated because technology is ever-evolving",256 followers,Priyal Gupta,9.7K,0,0,2014,https://www.quora.com/How-might-the-history-politics-and-technology-of-the-human-race-have-looked-different-if-we-had-evolved-during-the-time-of-a-single-super-continent-like-Pangaea
