0,"IMO, it started with the telephone answering machines, then the PC and internet and now the connected telephone. It all seems so convenient. Now, if you need to determine how much 7 times 6 is, or who discovered America, the answers are at your fingertips rather than in your memory. We, as humans, just get lazier and dumber.","6,480 followers",Michael Soareverix,28.3K,373,6.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-are-emerging-technologies-taking-over-our-minds
1,"Once upon a time…Somebody figured out how to make a material that is 200 times stronger than the strongest steel, transmits heat into electricity, and is extremely lightweight. Its discovery resulted in the Nobel Prize for Physics being given “for groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene.”Graphene is classified as two-dimensional: it is one atom thick (not pure two-dimensional but as close as we can come) and this form creates several fascinating properties.So why hasn’t this material exploded? It’s so useful, it could make phones last a week, charge in secondOnce upon a time…Somebody figured out how to make a material that is 200 times stronger than the strongest steel, transmits heat into electricity, and is extremely lightweight.

It’s so useful, it could make phones last a week, charge in seconds, and could provide unbelievable body armor.Well, unfortunately, producing it large scale is super hard. Peeling down graphite on a nanoscale toEventually, someone is going to discover how to create graphene quickly… and when they do, I’d recommend investing. It isn’t every day that a trillion dollar market is created.","35,897 followers",Rafael Eliassen,1.1K,631,36.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-are-emerging-technologies-taking-over-our-minds
2,"Hadoop went through the hype cycle that every other tech product goes through.Hadoop went through the hype cycle that every other tech product goes through.Will it die? Maybe not. But it may continue to live on as a niche technology for specific purposes.Funny enough, when Hadoop popularity was at an all time high, sometime circa 2016 I posted a humorous take on the google searches for Hadoop and predicted it would die around October 2018. That month was the date that Cloudera and Horton announced their merger. That was for me the bonafide sign that Hadoop commercial market was no longer sustainable.Data sometimes is scary that way.Hadoop is dead. Long live Hadoop.","1,683 followers",Dominic Ligot,1.1K,611,2.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-are-emerging-technologies-taking-over-our-minds
