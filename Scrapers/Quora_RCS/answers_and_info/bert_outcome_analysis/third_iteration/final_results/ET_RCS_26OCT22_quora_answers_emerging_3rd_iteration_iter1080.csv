2,"I think that that technology is going to take over jobs like teaching, tutoring, driving etc.But the jobs that technology can not replace are very little, in fact you need to make sure you know the jobs that technology can not replace.For instance, jobs like police force, higher ranks of the govenment, the creative type of jobs (hobbied) like singing, dancing and in general entertainment are prone to being taken over by technology",UNKNOWN,Ben Y.

3,"Process of elimination. All the jobs that you use people skills for are safe. All the jobs with problem solving skills are safe. All the jobs that go under community service, police, firefighter, etc safe. Teacher safe.

4,"Technical advances lead to the elimination of some jobs and the creation of others, typically many more are created than are eliminated. Technical advances eliminated jobs removing horse dung from city streets.If a person loses an old job he is unemployed until he obtains one of the new jobs.Will",56 followers,Prathamesh More,6.9K,116,1.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-jobs-will-soon-be-replaced-by-technology
5,"No. People who never had the “easy jobs anyone can do” don’t have the perspective to understand what it all really entails. They just see a human doing a simple task without seeing the nuance.I’ll give you a simple example. I used to wash dishes in a restaurant. In theory, this would be a super simple thing to automate if you have enough conveyor belts.The problem was that these dish machines required non-stop maintenance to keep going throughout a night. A human had to intervene all the time for water levels, soap, forks dropped in the bottom, and screwing the loose parts back together.

No technology can do all these things, and if there was a machine that did, you would need a human to maintain that machine to ensure it doesn’t break as well.There are automated burger flipping machines. You need one person to stand next to it all the time, and you also need a specialist to come by and fix and maintain the machine. That’s 2 people for one machine.Other automated systems require more humans to run and maintain the machines than you would need humans to just do it themselves. These machines cost $500k, give or take. It makes no sense financially.Yes, automation has done a lot to reduce manual work. A century ago, most people worked on farms. When that became automated, more people moved to the cities to work in factories. When that became more automated, people moved into offices and the service sector really blew up. The next steps will be something, but it definitely wont remove all jobs.",0 followers,Thomas Kolb,1.3K,575,4.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-jobs-will-soon-be-replaced-by-technology
6,"Yes it is true, in the new paradigm. With the advent of Machine Learning, that is a step beyond what computers were capable of 15 years ago, we now are in the realm of Sci-Fi. In 10–15 years from now it will be at the point where “humans need not apply” for many careers. Not just jobs.It is primitive, but as Elon Musk calls it, the new giga factory, is the machine that builds the machines. There are still places for humans, but that is only temporary. Five years ago there would have been more humans, as in traditional car manufacturing plants. But that got pared down. With more automation thatYes it is true, in the new paradigm.

Five years ago there would have been more humans, as in traditional car manufacturing plants. But that got pared down. With more automation that uses Machine Learning, at more advanced levels of work, there will be need for fewer people. The store cashiers and bank tellers, were one of the more visible ones to feel the brunt of the march of A.I. Back in 1990’s and the Early 2000’s a lot of the down sizing that was going on, in offices at the white collar general job level, was because of “simple computer programming”. Accounting, Stock taking, and Secretarial. They all felt the brunt of the computer revolution, that was taking our desk tops by storm. In 2005, I was one of the casualties, along with a few others, in a church no less. No one was safe before the great crash of 2008. Since then it has only accelerated.Another example, though esoteric, is the Human Genome Project. It began in the early 1980’s, as a study, to see if it were plausible and the money to invest in it was there. In about 1988–9, it began, and by the late 90’s had made only 1% progress. People in the know thought it might take a century to complete. But computing power took a leap forward and it was completed in 2003. Since then reading a human genome has dropped from millions of dollars to less than 1000, and continues to drop. It is projected that soon, it will be routine.That is the speed at which change is happening. I have given more answers elsewhere. Suffice to say, by 2030, the projection that 40% of jobs will be taken over by automation, is probably conservative. I joked with my Cardiologist that I hope to be at his retirement party, within the next 10 years. He is 37.The old paradigm is broken and the new is fighting to take it’s place. The scarcity economic formula is going to be replaced, and those who have acquired wealth are fighting to hold on, because they see that wealth in danger of becoming valueless. At the current rate of transfer of the world’s wealth to the 1%, by 2030 they will own 66%, and by 2045, 100%. It is increasing exponentially. When Technology has advanced to the place that the cost of producing a product is near or equal to zero, without market manipulation, then we will have crossed a barrier into abundance.The only wealth that they can’t take from us, is our knowledge and our abilities. The value of a human being will not rest in how much he or she can sell their life’s time to the wealthy. That is the the old paradigm. What is coming is the value of human beings as what is intrinsic about the individual. What they can contribute to the whole. Find the passion in that and you will know what you can do about the future.","135,530 followers",Hector Quintanilla,3.1K,1.2K,88.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-jobs-will-soon-be-replaced-by-technology
7,"“When farming was automated, farm employment went from 85–90% of the population to now 2%.Where is the 83%+ unemployment?This is how you know technological unemployment is a myth. It is true that people who can learn new skills effectively fare better during such changes, it remains that there is always work to be done, always a need for people who can do what needs to be done.","527,818 followers",Adam D'Angelo,1.1K,990,33.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-jobs-will-soon-be-replaced-by-technology
8,"I don't think it's fair to say no one wants 4K/8K and curved screens. It's more no one except the rich can afford to spend $10 000 on a TV.

Pretty much any newer HD TV you buy today has 3D as a feature. I don't know how it can be dead when it's become a de facto standard.
