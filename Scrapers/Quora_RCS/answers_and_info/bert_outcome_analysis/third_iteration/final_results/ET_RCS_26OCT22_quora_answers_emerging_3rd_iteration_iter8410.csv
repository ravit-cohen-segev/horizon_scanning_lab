Well, it's actually three nearly identical computers.  They all run at the same time, and at any one time, one of them will be considered the primary, another the backup, and the third a standby.  There are an additional forty or so lower level MDMs responsible for systems or hardware.The Russian segment has a computer called the ЦВМ (Центральная вычислительная машина) (central computing machine).  Well, it's actually three nearly identical computers, too.  They operate a little differently, though.  They operate simultaneously and tasks may be assigned to the different lanes.The C&C runs the US segment and the ЦВМ runs the Russian segment.  The two computers are connected to each other via 1553 control buses.  The C&C is the bus controller.These computers are built into the vehicle and, through the tiered network of MDMs, are physically connected to all of the integrated vehicle hardware.  They run the flight software.Telemetry and Command Interface ComputersThe crew do not directly interface with the vehicle management computers - they have no displays or keyboards.  On the US segment, commanding to the vehicle is done using laptops called PCS (Portable Computer System).  They run on a Linux operating system and are connected to the vehicle 1553 system as remote terminals.  There are usually seven PCS laptops deployed throughout the vehicle.On the Russian Segment there are about seven equivalent laptops called, simply, ""Russian Laptops"".  They, too, are Linux based, and are used to command the Russian elements.Both the PCS and Russian Laptop use their own graphical interfaces that depict the ISS and the crew click on the module they wish to interact with and the system, and then the specific piece of hardware.Here's an example of a system page (my old system, Motion Control):This screen gives a health and status overview of the Motion Control Group (combined US MCS and RS СУДН).  Starting from this screen, the crew can access and control any piece of guidance, navigation, control, and propulsion hardware and software on the vehicle (well, Russian hardware commanding would need to be done from their laptop).Support ComputersMost of the remaining laptops are part of the Ops Lan network.  They are called SSC (Station Support Computers).  They are Windows based and are not connected to the ISS 1553 system.  They are used for everything from viewing procedures, performing supply inventory, recording notes, sending e-mail, video conferencing, on down to Twitter.In the above picture, three laptop screens are visible.  The closest to Shannon's head is being used to view the procedure for the robotics activity she is performing.  The one above and to the right of that is current displaying the SSC desktop.  She is likely using that one to view the mission timeline.  In the bottom right corner of the picture is a PCS.  It looks like she has navigated to the US Airlock page, and while nothing is currently in alarm, it looks like she has a caution message to acknowledge and there was a brief loss of comm with a power supply.We can also see a few of the built-in ISS interfaces, in this picture.  Over the hatch is the Caution & Warning Panel and directly to the right of Shannon's face is the ATU (Audio Terminal Unit) (radio/intercom).  And, of course, the big panel in front of her is to control the robotic arm and external cameras.",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,5.5K,9.4K,195.6M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-are-computers-used-for-on-the-ISS

The idea being that a passenger would fly from a local airport to a larger airport and join the A380 to travel onwards to another large airport, ending their journey there or travelling onwards to another local airportBoeing on the other hand, envisioned that passengers would want to go direct from their local airport to their destination. They also had ideas that due to rising fuel prices and the worries around the damage to the climate, that making a fuel efficient aircraft would be the way to go.The A380 due to its size needs additional infrastructure, and as such needs the space that 2 aircraft needs. Meaning that airports had to make special gates or merge gates to cope with a specific type of aircraft. The A380 therefore can only operate to a limited number of destinations. For example, there are only 5 Airports in the U.K. that can accept an A380, and only 14 in the US. This wouldn’t be an issue if Airbus’ idea of Hub to Hub travel had taken off.The reality is that the opposite happened. Airlines didn’t want to spend so much on a giant plane that they could only use on certain routes when passengers wanted to fly direct from their home airport to their destination. The A380s that are flying today are rarely full, the only operators that are truly making a profit from them are the Middle East carriers, such as Emirates, as their location means they are perfect for transcontinental travel. Other airlines, like Virgin Atlantic and Qantas are cancelling their A380 orders as they can’t make it work. Their customers want point to point travel, rather than the hassle of stopping over at other airports.I hope this has explained how the A380 flopped.

Imagine how worse this congestion is going to get in 5–10 years.Proof of how succeful their A380 business model is?Emirates flies 9 A380s into London each day. 9 A380s. That’s a total of 4400 seats.On top of the successful business model for how Emirates works with big hubs and big passengers numbers, the A380 is also a huge selling point.This was from vice president for operations Hubert Frach:The superjumbo has a strong appeal. Super spacious and airy cabin, monumental staircase, the size of the plane itself…Also consider the appeal for Business & First class. Airlines make money mainly out of their top-end product. And the A380 gives Emirates the ability to offer the best premium classes. And again, that is strong selling point.“I’m flying first, who do I go with? Oh, Emirates hasIn the end, Emirates fully understood how to make money out of the A380, how to exploit it and get the max out of it. They built their business model on it, and it’s rewarding them with colossal profits, despite huge investments being done at the same time!And if 142 A380s weren’t enough, they’re ready to order another 50 if Airbus just strips on them the latest fuel-efficient Rolls Royce Trent engine.Emirates nailed it with the A380.In the end, quoting Sir. Tim Clark again, “It’s not Airbus fault if airlines can’t make money out of this plane. It’s the airlines fault, due to their old & failing business model”—- And this one is for all the A380 haters and critics—How can you not",0 followers,Lou Wild,3.6K,263,1.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-computers-used-for-on-the-ISS

Spending a lot of money for a handful of additional sales isn’t a great idea.*They reached production break-even, where they were selling aircraft for more than it cost to produce them, in 2015, and severely cut the production rate in 2017 (which forced them to spread a bunch of fixed costs over fewer airframes).

Hub and spoke is done everywhere else, and nobody is saying out loud what the forecasts are for Emirates. Many agree that the need for a very large airplane will return in 15–25 years, but that it should have two or three engines, carbon composites for the fuselage and wings, a single deck, and wingtips that fold up so that it is possible to fly everywhere else. The 777 will likely suffice for quite a long time. What you don’t see with the A380 are the six narrow bodies that bring passengers to the big airport and back out to the destinations. That’s 12 additional engines to make 20, 18 more landing gears to make 23, and 24 more tires to make 46. You cannot run the A380 without feeders. The big twins can go wherever the passengers want to get on and to wherever they want to get off, in one go, without feeders, 2 engines, 3 gears and 14 tires.",47 followers,Simon Anderson,1.1K,939,890.3K,2018,https://www.quora.com/In-Emirates-Airbus-A380-what-is-the-space-under-the-stairs-used-for-kindly-see-comments-for-details

25,"Incident 1:In 1988, India require supercomputers for research work, to manufacture satellites, for weather-forecasting, to manufacture military weapons. In universities, for scientists to continue their research, we required supercomputers.At that time an American companySo, India wanted to buy supercomputers from that US company for 70 crores. For a company to sell any high-technology goods to another company, it needs to take the permission of government of that country. So, CRAY company asked the permission of American government to sell supercomputersIncident 1:In 1988, India require supercomputers for research work, to manufacture satellites, for weather-forecasting, to manufacture military weapons. In universities, for scientists to continue their research, we required supercomputers.At that time an American companySo, India wanted to buy supercomputers from that US company for 70 crores. For a company to sell any high-technology goods to another company, it needs to take the permission of government of that country. So, CRAY company asked the permission of American government to sell supercomputers for India. But US government didn’t give the permission. US claimed that ‘If we give this technology for India, it will use it for military purposes, instead of educational purposes’. So, America disagreed to sell the supercomputer technology to India. But, for research purposes India require supercomputer urgently.At that time, Rajiv Gandhi was the prime minister of our country. He arranged a meeting with the scientists. In that meeting, a famous scientist namedRajiv Gandhi asked whether we can manufacture a supercomputer.Then Vijay Bhatkar answered “ I did not use a supercomputer till now. I saw CRAY supercomputer also just in a photo. But we have the capacity to manufacture a supercomputer”.Then Rajiv Gandhi asked “How long does it takes?”Vijay Bhatkar replied “ It would take less time than that of what it takes if we import it from America.”Then Rajiv Gandhi asked “ How much it costs to manufacture a supercomputer?”Vijay Bhatkar answered “ The cost of building the institute, developing the technology and manufacturing the supercomputer would take less cost than that of importing it from CRAY company.”Then Rajiv Gandhi was impressed and gave green signal for theFor this project, in 1988 an institute ‘ Centre for Development of Advanced Computing’ (C-DAC) was build. Many scientists started working on this project. Just in 3 years, Indian scientists got the fruit for their hard work. In 1991, India succeeded in manufacturing a supercomputer. It was named asBut America doubted the Indian supercomputer PARAM. It claimed that ‘it is not a supercomputer and it doesn’t have the capability’. Then India took the PARAM supercomputer to International Exhibition. PARAM was tested there. Then they came to know thatNext day in a newspaper headline, about PARAM was“Supercomputer which is manufactured by India has some special features.CRAY supercomputer costs 70 crores, but PARAM costs just 3 crores.That’s why, 14 universities belonging to Britain, Canada and Germany bought our supercomputer. By can’t withstanding the competition from India, CRAY company was forced to reduce the prices of its supercomputer. The power of PARAM was 28 times more than the supercomputer of CRAY.Like this Rajiv Gandhi and Vijay Bhatkar made India into the list of countries having a supercomputer.Incident 2:In 1929, once Bhagat Singh threw some bombs into assembly to scare Britishers. So, Bhagat Singh was arrested and was introduced in the court. And some others who were involved in this case where standing along with Bhagat Singh in the court. Among them Jatindra Nath Das was also present. To testify Fanindra Nath was standing opposite to them.The bombs which were thrown in the assembly were prepared by Fanindra Nath. But he changed as an approver and came to the court to testify. At that time many people don’t know how to prepare bombs and there was no source to collect the information. Fanindra Nath was one of the few persons who know how to prepare bombs.Lawyer came and asked Fanindra Nath whether he prepared bombs.Fanindra Nath said that he only prepared the bombs and gave it to Bhagat Singh.Bhagat Singh replied that Fanindra Nath did not prepare the bombs. He also said that Fanindra did no know how to prepare the bombs.Fanindra Nath said that Jatindra Nath Das, who was beside Bhagat Singh, taught him how to prepare the bombs.Then Jatindra Nath said that he was lying and he don’t know anything about bombs.Fanindra Nath answered that shall I say how to prepare a bomb.Jatindra Nath said that then say to the court how to prepare a bomb.Then Fanindra Nath explained the process of preparing bombs clearly in the court. All the journalists in the court wrote it.After completion of the explanation Fanindra Nath asked can you believe me now that I know how to prepare bombs.Then Bhagat Singh, Jatindra and their followers started laughing and said “ Thanks Fanindra, till now only you know how to prepare bombs. Now, journalists have written the process of preparing bomb, so tomorrow morning through newspapers everyone would know how to prepare a bomb.”All the British officers present over there were shocked. They used the court for their freedom fight. Fanindra Nath was fooled.This Jatindra Nath Das was none other than who died after a hunger-strike for 63 days for the reason that prisoners are not treated well in the prison.Incident 3:In 2014, Mangalyaan Space Vehicle, which belongs to India entered into Mars Planet Orbit. Then New York Times published the following photo:It means, in the Mars orbit already USA and Russia were present from a long time. After so much time, poor country India entered it.In 2017, ISRO created a record by launching 104 satellites. Then Times of India published the following photo:It means, American companies are coming to poor country India, for asking to launch their satellites.Lets see some facts about Mangalyaan:To launch this type of space vehicle into the Mars orbit, NASA took 5 years whereas ISRO took just 15 months to complete this mission.Until now only America, Russia and Europe have succeeded in this mission. That to in 51 times of trials, it succeeded just for 21 times. But India succeeded in its first attempt only.The total cost of this project is 74 million dollars. It means every Indian has contributed ₹ 5 for this project.For complete journey of 780 million km, it costs 6 rupees for every km. It is less than the cost charged by auto drivers per km in india.Incident 4:In 17th century, Dutch East India company was the biggest. It was nearly 10 times bigger than the present Apple company.But an Indian king collapsed such a company. In 17th century, Dutch East India company, had trading with South India for spices. It bought those spices for low prices in India and sold them for higher prices in other countries. So this company became very rich. By that richness, it occupied some kingdoms in South India. In behalf of that they also tried to occupy Travancore kingdom also. At that time, Travancore was ruled byHe did not accept to surrender his kingdom to that company. Then, that company started a war against him. Soldiers of both the kingdoms had a war. But, the Dutch company was defeated badly in this war. Then both had an agreement.By that agreement, all the properties and assets of the company in South India came to Marthanda Varma. The king became rich. He became so rich that, he frequently donated his property to the Padmanabhaswamy Temple in his kingdom. It is one of the reasons for Padnabhaswamy Temple to become rich.Incident 5:If any Indian in foreign asks for help in twitter, then Sushma Swaraj would respond very quickly. One day a person tagged Sushma Swaraj and tweeted:Once in a meeting in UNO, a Pakistan representative named India as Mother of Terrorism. Then Sushma Swaraj replied “ Yes, its true.

U.S. citizens wishing to depart should do so via commercial transportation options when they become available. Keep vital records and travel documents close at hand; U.S. citizens should be prepared to depart at a moment’s notice. The airports are currently closed, but may open unexpectedly; other unforeseen opportunities to depart may also suddenly arise. Additionally, some foreign governments may arrange transportation for their nationals and may be willing to offer assistance to others. There is no guarantee that foreign governments will assist U.S. citizens in leaving Yemen. U.S. citizens who choose to seek foreign government assistance in leaving Yemen should only do so if they can safely make their way to the point of embarkation and have received confirmation that there is space available.

In the absence of canopy; he was exposed to extremely low temperatures ofIn the process, he totally disregarded his critical shoulder injury and the discomfort posed by high speed, high altitude and low temperatures. To avoid the effects of aero-medical problems he quickly descended to 3 Km and simultaneously reduced speed for effective control of the aircraft.

His epic voyage has placed us in the league of few select countries whose citizens have undertaken such arduous voyage”Commander Abhilash Tommy is an Indian Navy officer who became the first Indian, second Asian and the seventy nineth person in the world to complete a solo, non stop , unassisted circumnavigation under sail.This means that he went around the world and conquered the seas all alone in a sail ship!The voyage was part of the Indian Navy's Sagar Parikarma project.Tommy began his journey in Mumbai,from the Gateway of India. He crossed from west to east, the Indian, Pacific, Southern and Atlantic oceans, covering 23,000 nautical miles. The journey took 151 days.During the journey, Tommy faced shortage of drinking water due to the failure of the onborad water treatment plant and diesel leak which contaminated his stored water supply. He was left with approximately 15 litres of water which would last for 15 days, hence he resorted to rain water harvesting.He had not sighted human beings for the last 130 days, the last sighting of his being Srilankan fishermen. Tommy reported that the immigration officers who stamped his passport were confused as they noticed that his passport did not contain the country of arrival once he left India!!He was awarded The Keerthi Chakra and the Tenzing Norgay adventure award for his brave act.A big salute to such brave young men and The Indian navy for imparting such strength and zeal into our young men. They have really been one of the biggest source of pride for India since the country was born.Resources1.P.S. He is also active on quoraEdit : Recently while competing in the golden globe race, one of the most challenging endurance race on the planet commander Tommy had sailed into a hurricane force conditions in a most uncharted and remote place in the Indian ocean last month.Commander Tommy's boat had been hammered by 14 mtrs high waves with wind speed touching 150kmph. He lost the main mast of the boat and was slammed on to the deck. He has suffered a severe back injury and was stranded 1900 nautical miles south of perth. His survival was ensured by only his naval training and sailing skills. He has been rescued by an international effort and has been bought back after his boat had been seriously damaged.The true example of a survivor.","16,376 followers",NAMIT BATHLA,1.2K,280,7.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-incidents-and-events-have-made-India-proud

People came out at the roads offering food and water to stranded people, providing their phones to communicate at commuter's house and providing with quickest mode of transport to reach home or residence if needed. This kind gesture was needed and it was observed all over the city where residents helped strangers in facing the Fury of this devastating rainfall.On TwitterPeople are helping in whichever way they can. One of the gesture I saw in news was trains were completely shut on central line. Roadway was then too affordable hence a truck driver was helping people reach from Kurla to Thane in his truck. I don't have reference to that but such deeds are being performed.Such noble acts of selflessness makes us proud. These generous acts ensuring sufferers face minimal problems bring a huge smile and hope on our face.Some might believe this is the what one ideally should do that is help others in tough times. But today where only news we hear is how people have become selfish, unkind, self-centered; these deeds surely shows ray of hope for better society and brings a refreshing smile that such kind souls too exist.Hatsoff to the spirit of Mumbaikars and all those people who are actively participating in all these.Will like to end with great lines describing my great cityAi dil hai mushakil jeena yahaHappy reading :)SourcesMumbai's 300 mm Rain Makes Tuesday Wettest August Day In 20 YearsRains wreak havoc in Mumbai; Met office predicts more 'heavy showers' - Times of IndiaMumbai Gets 9 Times Usual Rain, Every Minute A StruggleAsIn Rain-Hit Mumbai, Offers Of Food And Shelter Via Twitterhttps://www.google.co.in/amp/m.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/help-pours-in-locals-open-doors-for-people-stranded-in-mumbai-rains/story-tYfYtGRg5raijSrGy9AfAM_amp.html",220 followers,Syed Hashir Adnan,1.7K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-incidents-and-events-have-made-India-proud

Their libraries were burnt and scholars executed in mass and population mass converted into Islam so that no remnants of their culture may survive.However, some of them escaped and found a safe refuge in India. The sacred flame they bought with them in the 8th century still shines bright, and so do their glorious heritage.Not only did they manage to survive and preserve their heritage, but they also enriched India greatly. They are among the richest Indians today and spearheads the Indian economy.MUSLIMSThe Muslims themselves came under a severe onslaught in the 13th century at the hands of Ghenes Khan. Such horrible was his assault that as per estimates over 200,000 to a million Muslims were killed. Their Caliph, as per Marcopolo “was locked in a tower with nothing to eat but gold, and died like a dog”.This led to a major exodus for Muslims from Central Asia and the Middle East, to India which lasted over two decades starting from 1266. This influx included the general population from various walks of life along with 15 sovereigns and their nobles. This mass influx of Muslims changed the demographics of Indus Valley completely which was only destined to get from bad to worse over the next 500 years of Muslim domination.The repeated spells of Islamic zealots, and repeated Muslim invasi...",UNKNOWN,Zack,15.5K,62,2.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-incidents-and-events-have-made-India-proud

British Empire got so much worried about India’s huge advancement in science with such poor facilities that they even removed Prof Raman from his Directorship position and tried their best to stop foreign scientist to get any position in Indian institutes.Here is what one of the most brilliant mind ever lived had to say about us:I will not go into the details as why we are not such an academic super-power anymore but just wanted to show what we used to be.Now one recent event which earned India respect all over the world.Meet Prof Ashoke...",2 followers,Shraddha Pandey,9.3K,830,6.8M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-incidents-and-events-have-made-India-proud

These people then form an incestuous circle, discussing the same three topics again and again, without conspiracy, just because this is what they know, and this is all that the public hears about, and they publicizing a few people endlessly at the expense of all others.Einstein understood the centralized mass media, and he was good at manipulating it, and at becoming a star. Uncharacteristically for a scientist, and despite his social isolation, he had very strong political skills. In the 1910s, he was famous among Berlin University students for his outspoken pacifism, more than for his science. He was offered the presidency of Israel. He made a much better media figure than other physics stars, like Dirac, who didn't talk, or Schrodinger, who openly had two wives, or Heisenberg, who was a geek's geek, or Bohr, who mumbled unclearly, or Pauli, who was an asshole. Einstein always had a pithy quote, and always exuded good humor.The monopolized media needs exactly one great figure, and in Einstein's case, they accidentally happened to stumble on the best guy. They hardly ever do, so one should be grateful when it happens. It's because the guy who was most media-savvy also, by a fortuitous coincidence, happened to be the guy with the most earth-shattering science. If Einstein were a one legged foul-mouthed sex-offender, we would probably be celebrating 100 years of Poincare's special relativity, Planck's E=mc^2, Hilbert's revolutionary theory of gravity, the Smoulochowski fluctuation/dissipation relation, Compton and Millikan's bold photon hypothesis of 1919, Leo Szillard's letter to Roosevelt. This kind of crap happened in Germany when Einstein was politically out.Today, the media environment accomodates a much larger number of people, and allows a fair distribution of credit to the people who actually deserve it. The funny thing about Einstein and Feynman, is that they come out looking good, they deserve it.

I can't prove it, but on the tip of my brain is the suspicion that this just needs some new, off-the-wall insight, by someone who is brilliant but simply doesn't know any better, that is, what they are supposed to think.Even apart form physics, there are still huge strides of basic insight to be made in other fields, such as Cognitive Science. We still don't have a way to build a device that does what nearly all humans do—process language properly. Part of this is Noam Chomsky's fault, but he's been out of the picture long enough. There are some pretty impressive people like George Lakoff, but they largely go unnoticed.As for the time period, that was all when the population was much smaller than it is now. More than half of the people on the planet were born after I was, and I'm still not very old. There have got to be geniuses out there.Before giving my hypothesis, let's look at the three you mentioned in chronological order.Faraday was almost completely uneducated. He was a brilliant tinkerer. He put on shows of things that went ""zap,"" and people noticed. There are still brilliant tinkerers. They put on demos. Who notices? Occasionally, you'll see a video on Facebook, but that's about it.Einstein was better educated, and his patent clerk job was because he knew something about physics and could evaluate patents. Still, he was a patent clerk. His first big paper, the one that started what would become the Theory of Special Relativity, was short and had no references. It wouldn't stand a snowball's chance in a blast furnace of being published today. An Einstein could ""publish"" on the Internet, but it would be lost in a sea of crackpottery, and nobody would notice.Feynman followed a more canonical path, but he was still weird as all weirdness. I can't help thinking that a Feynman today would be diagnosed and medicated long before his brain had a chance to flower.My hypothesis is that Einstein had it right when he said, ""It is almost a miracle that modern teaching methods have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry; for what this delicate little plant needs more than anything, besides stimulation, is freedom."" Only it's much worse.Education is Big Business, Universities especially so. They are all about shunting people along this or that approved track to get the desired result. There's all sorts of talk about role models and the like. If there is oneIf that doesn't ruin you, the Big Business that is called Big Business does. I have some indirect personal experience with that. The two greats in one of my fields were Jim Blinn and Jim Kajiya. Kajiya was one of the two independent developers of the rendering equation, the grand unified theory of computer graphics. Blinn had an entourage and groupies who followed him everywhere. But then Hollywood started noticing computer graphics and corporatized it. Kajiya went to work at Microsoft and was never heard from again. He got Blinn to join him. No more entourage, no more interesting stuff, no more groupies. I went to see Blinn talk at San Antonio. The room was packed because of his reputation. The talk was, perhaps, a bit interesting in an esoteric way.There are still geniuses. I count Linus Torvalds as one, even though Linux is a copy of something else. But like all geniuses, he took a radical left turn somewhere along the way, and everything is carefully designed by some very smart people to prevent that from happening.So I'd say ""yes."" Research has lost its sight. Maybe it always had, and people got through by accident due to incompetence at keeping everyone out, but those days are largely gone.If you want to find the scientists of the future, look at the kids who are doing weird things with LEGO blocks and vinegar and get to them before they get chewed up and digested by a system well designed to produce, in Frank Zappa's words, loyal plastic robots for a world that doesn't care.We also would have to do something about economics if we want to fix it.

No longer can you attach your name to an equation in an egotistical manner for simple things like 16th century mathematicians did. Granted you still had to be white to do even that.. lol.So those people got more impact for discovering minor things. Today it is the opposite. No one can have the same impact as people before the internet or hundreds of years ago did. Today even if you do 10x or 100x what Einstein did, you still won’t become as impactful, famous or a cultural icon. After all, when it comes down to it, that’s what everyone is really after. Some sort of fame or cultural icon status like Einstein who was in essence a rock star!So the bottom line is that impact is not what it seems to be but it is subjective. One can argue that if you come up with something really original, the world will recognize it. No.. most likely it will not. Have you ever witnessed this phenomenon?He gets recognized more than you! That’s the world. So recognition is provided for convenience more than anything else. It is like winning a Grammy. If they don’t have anyone in the rock category, they will find the act that closest fits that category and give the rock award to that person, even though that act might not even be rock. Science is the same way, recognition usually goes to the convenient not necessarily the deserving.Most smart people will not get the recognition as Euler or Gauss because nothing can really cause an impact that would change the world at this point. You’d literally have to invent a time machine. It has to be something that extraordinary. But science is not alone, almost every field is in the same boat.All of these things essentially died after the internet came along because today everybody is a star. That is the mantra of social media. So if you have some profound theory, you could self publish that yourself. You no longer have to wait for it to be accepted by a group of PHDs. This actually creates confusion and saturation because everybody has content to share and today everything is essentially ‘content’. Even if you publish a peer reviewed paper, that is content just like social media content.So no one can have that impact that people before the internet did. Today everything is saturated and we have more participants than spectators. Back then you had more spectators; that is, not everybody tried to do everything. Today due to the internet, anyone can learn to play the guitar or sing or do just about anything. So no matter what field you choose, there is saturation; that is, there are 100s, 1000s, 10,000s of people that are good and you got to compete with all of them to get recognition. A single job at Cisco gets 600 applications, you can’t even stand out there and get a job, how in the hell are you going to stand out for most normal things in life where you are competing with something like 100,000 people?The other thing is crab mentality in the sense that people are so desperate for recognition where ever it may be (science, rock star, movie star, etc) that even if you do something completely original, people will steal your ideas and just present them as their own. In the simplest sense, after I write these somewhat controversial answers, I end up reading all the ideas I have stated being rehashed by other people. lol. So that’s the world we live in today. There is an excess of information and everybody wants recognition and they will do anything to get it. No community, science or otherwise can survive this.Finally, most big discoveries and inventions are done by big corporations that have 100s of scientists, so the concept of the lone wolf scientist who uplifts humanity all by himself is dead today. It may actually be that it never happened that way; that is, people always stood on the shoulders of giants but due to politics and convenience, they were allowed to take the credit. Today that can’t happen, the concept of the Lone Wolf Scientist is dead. Only corporations can make innovation moving forward.",UNKNOWN,Jess H.

China was also being shunned from Super Computers and Space Exploration.

75,"I don’t think China would do anything like that. It does not blame the US companies. They have been good partners over the many years. China understands they are going through duress, too, at this time because they are also under extreme pressure from their president. Would you stop being a friend with a kid when he gets beat up by his father at home ?Will have to see whether the father will be ‘arrested’ for abuse and endangerment.

[ https://world.huanqiu.com/article/3zsznQYcjA6 ] 专访中国工程院院士倪光南：“中国体系”足以缓解芯片困局 [ https://new.qq.com/omn/20200915/20200915A01Y3W00.html ]For the key information infrastructure related to the Chinese national economy and the Chinese livelihood and the general data centers, the use of the advanced Chinese system is enough to alleviate or even basically not be affected by the American embargo of high-end chips. There is a certain gap between the information industry of China and the United States, but it is not particularly large overall.The current Chinese shortcomings are mainly in chips, operating systems, industrial software and large-scale basic software. If the Chinese can integrate their domestic resources and make good use of talents and market advantages, breaking through these shortcomings will not take long.This kind of hegemonic behavior of the United States will certainly cause damage to China, but the Chinese can adopt advanced system design and achieve a high degree of coordination between software and hardware, which can greatly reduce the requirements for the American chips.The Chinese traditional information technology system does depend on the high performance of a single chip, and thus also on the high-end chip manufacturing process. For example, the large-scale business systems and production systems that currently occupy a monopoly position in the finance and telecommunications industries are all US ""IOE"" systems. It is composed of high-performance CPUs from IBM and Intel, Oracle large-scale database software and EMC high-end storage. Each system uses only a small amount (about tens to hundreds) of CPUs, so the performance of a single chip is very important. If the Chinese can’t get rid of the shackles of this traditional system, and they will be firmly stuck in the neck by the aforementioned sanctions by the United States on Chinese high tech companies like Huawei.Relying on the Chinese own existing core technology, chips with 14nm or 28nm technology can still be produced. Although 7nm and 5nm advanced process chips are not available in the short term, this can only affect the mobile phone business, because most technology products use 14nm and 28nm chips more than enough.Fortunately, under the guidance of autonomous independence and innovation ideas, Chinese scientific and technical personnels broke the shackles of traditional thinking and built an original Chinese system by using software to enhance hardware to achieve overall high performance, and it has been used in some key systems successfully in reality.The Chinese system also includes servers, databases and storage. The database software has original core technology, which can aggregate hundreds or thousands of low-end CPU chips into a larger and unified super computing power than American ""IOE"". This technology is unique to China, and there is no similar technology in foreign countries. For users, it is no difference from using traditional foreign systems, even running faster, but in fact the Chinese system uses a large number of low-end CPUs, including domestic CPU chips that use non-latest technology, or those old Intel chips from a few years ago.For example, in June of this year (2020), a Chinese service provider took the lead in using the Chinese system on a large-scale production system, replacing the traditional system of American minicomputers, Oracle databases and high-end storage with 12 old Intel chips from 2014. They replaced two imported minicomputers worth 10 million yuan in the project. The performance of the system did not decrease but increased. It processed tens of millions of transactions every day and has been operating normally for nearly 3 m...","84,371 followers",Paul Denlinger,664,11.5K,55.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-computers-used-for-on-the-ISS
