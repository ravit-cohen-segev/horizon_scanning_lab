Patents buy only very temporary relief. If the owner of the patent made no attempts to commercialise it in that 7 - 10 years, somebody else will when the patent expires, making the patent worthless. Companies act rationally, and if a patent is worth something, they will use it to make money - either by using the invention directly, or through licensing.The premise of your question is false.

1,"Why do you think that ANY valuable technology has been suppressed?  If something is truly ""revolutionary"", then the financial reward in bringing to market would be huge.I think it is best to answer this with an example:The ""100mpg carburetor"" was widely touted in the 1950's.  It was claimed that someone designed a carburetor that would make nearly any car get 100 mpg, but it was not sold because ""the oil companies bought the patent and killed (suppressed) it"".There are several things wrong with this story:1.

In a piston engine it is around 35% - regardless of the fuel. It certainly is not more than 100%It is very, very difficult to keep a good idea secret for long.  You may think that companies want to ""kill"" a technology in order to protect their profits, but the very fact that a certain technology is so threatening means that it is probably very financially lucrative for someone else to bring that technology to market.  In the end, a company that finds a good idea that challenges the status quo is best off by developing that new idea themselves before someone else does.",449 followers,Avinash Sorab,536,77,1.5M,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-has-been-the-most-revolutionary-technology-to-be-suppressed-in-modern-times-1800-present

India, being the second largest populous country in the world, needs to fortify against the devastating second wave of covid outbreak. It is very critical to strictly enforce protection norms such as compulsory thermal screening, wearing face masks, and maintaining social distance.This process is extremely challenging, intimidating, and extensive resource consuming for crowded places like Airports, Railway Stations, Hospitals, Private Offices, Hotels, Malls, Universities, etc. With the existing tools, providing safety at open places (non-gated) like markets, busy streets, tourism/ recreation spots is not practical.How AjnaLens is Supporting Govt and Private Companies to Tackle the COVID-19 PandemicTo create a one-stop solution for all surveillance and security requirements, AjnaLens developed India’s First AI-powered Smart Helmet - AjnaTX. The helmet will ensure a higher level of safety during COVID-19 times and beyond. The smart helmet is equipped with cutting-edge technologies to ensure public safety and helps maintain law and order.Mass Thermal ScreeningAjnaTX helmets use advanced infrared sensors that are capable of scanning 300 people within a short period of just 3 minutes from a safe distance of 3 meters. AjnaTX uses AI and Face detection technologies to measure the accurate temperature of facial points such as the eyes, forehead, and mouth, thus providing a higher accuracy of ±0.5 ˚C.Face Mask DetectionThe artificial intelligence system used in the helmet can also detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not. The system is capable of determining whether a person is covering his mouth using any form of clothing like a dupatta or handkerchief.Dynamic Social Distancing MonitoringThe biggest problem that the authorities face is the flouting of social distancing norms in public places. Today, there is no mechanism to monitor the same. AjnaTX is capable of monitoring social distancing. This feature enables you to identify social distancing violators in any direction and at any distance in your eye-sight. It updates the results in a fraction of a second to give you accurate information.","46,125 followers",Steven Haddock,856,25.6K,343.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-was-the-most-revolutionary-technology-in-the-COVID-19-pandemic

11,"A lot of the excitement and attention in neuromorphic computing is going into robotics, and more generally into problems that require autonomous dynamic adaptation to real-world conditions in real-time. You can usually devise AI methods to do this even using conventional compute, if you have enough hardware available, but the issues are energy consumption and cost. That is, there are many problems (a good example is autonomous flight control) that require more computational horsepower than is realistic/cost effective for the target platform given application constraints. Flying systems, in parA lot of the excitement and attention in neuromorphic computing is going into robotics, and more generally into problems that require autonomous dynamic adaptation to real-world conditions in real-time. You can usually devise AI methods to do this even using conventional compute, if you have enough hardware available, but the issues are energy consumption and cost. That is, there are many problems (a good example is autonomous flight control) that require more computational horsepower than is realistic/cost effective for the target platform given application constraints. Flying systems, in particular, are usually both power and weight constrained, and in situations where remote control isn’t a viable option (e.g. environments with high RF interference, or underground), the power and weight needed for a conventional computer is just too high. I would say more or less any problem dealing with dynamic adaptivity with serious power and weight constraints is a good candidate for neuromorphic computing.Another is dealing with nonstationary systems. Nonstationary systems are ones where the underlying statistics governing the behaviour of the system change with time. Modelling nonstationary dynamics is ferociously complex, especially if the system is large enough, and have historically proven a difficult challenge for conventional computers because of the need to make the processing sequential. A neuromorphic system can, by contrast, model the system itself directly, as opposed to running a discrete state simulator. In principle this can be done again at lower power and much less hardware resource, making it much cheaper; this would be especially true in systems for real-time data processing (e.g. automated trading systems). On the other hand, there has been less tangible progress in this area, perhaps because thus far the people with the greatest potential interest in the technology are also those with the largest budgets and times to throw at conventional systems (which promise more immediate returns on investment; neuromorphics are very much a long-term technology proposition).A final case is for optimising systems where coming up with optimum solutions needs some sort of top-down understanding of the meaning of the problem to be solved. A great example of this is place and route in EDA (electronic design automation). P&R has historically been hard because not only is the general routing problem NP-complete (thus really only heuristic methods are used), but also, optimisation of the problem depends a great deal on the intended function and dynamic behaviour of the circuit to be generated. Neuromorphics offer the potential to be able to represent both the solution and the desirable characteristics of the problem, and to find mappings between the two that converge towards some optimal value reasonably quickly (better than O(N^2 ) or O(N^3) depending upon whether you’re routing 2d or 3d topologies). There may be other alternative hardware architectures able to do the same sorts of things, but we do know that 1) conventional hardware will not likely get into this regime; and 2) neuromorphics are the most promising game in town with the greatest amount of design maturity. One troubling aspect of this, however, is that it may put a lot of electronic design engineers out of work (or at least greatly diminish the value of their skills); the EDA community over the years has shown a pattern of being more interested in automating the parts of the job requiring more skilled labour (e.g. synthesis, device placement) than on the parts that are more mechanical (and thus can be done by unskilled labour), e.g. data entry, dimensional specification, etc.","9,064 followers",Allan Steinhardt,655,2.3K,5.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-has-been-the-most-revolutionary-technology-to-be-suppressed-in-modern-times-1800-present
