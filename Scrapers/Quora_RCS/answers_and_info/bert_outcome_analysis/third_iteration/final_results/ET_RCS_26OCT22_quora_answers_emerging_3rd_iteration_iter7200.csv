In other words, an average person in Taiwan is much better placed in income than most Europeans.In short, technology is not making it harder for countries to become developed. Rather it creates more opportunities by reducing the advantages of big companies in developed countries and levels the playing field [think Finnish Nokia vs. Korea's Samsung or the British Philips vs. LG in TVs]. Africa and South Asia got connected by phones in no time through mobile revolution.I will now address the question details.Think People not just ProductionWhen you try to understand development, look in terms of people not merely in terms of what the country produces. New Zealand and Norway don't produce a lot of high tech things. They import their iPads, software, luxury cars and other tech from other countries. However, they really rank high in human development and are considered developed nations.Thus, countries that dream to become developed should primarily focus on building a highly educated workforce and making sure the rules & infrastructure are there for these people to get employed by businesses. It is as simple.Highly educated people make quite a good salary almost everywhere in the world. If you are a good accountant, software engineer, doctor, dentist, petroleum engineer, insurance actuary, construction manager or a investment banker, you can make $30,000/year even in a poor country like India and that works to $100000/year in percapita income [adjusted to purchase power parity]. If India can get everyone to that level of education/expertise, India becomes developed [developed nations have about $35000/year in average incomes].The role of a governmentIn summary, there are really only 3 key steps to become developed:That's all a good government needs to do.",1 follower,Xitong Zou,6.1K,3K,11.9M,2014,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-major-contributions-of-science-and-technology-to-the-Philippine-nation-building

The thing is we have to take a look at the innards of a country to really know whether or not you are truly developed. That Chinese are so obsessed with portraying the facade that they are technologically advanced and ahead is actually an indication that they have not fully developed yet. Because fully developed countries have no need to show off things like that. Everyone knows they are developed.For example, here is San Francisco:Look, not many skyscrapers right? And look at those old cable cars going around! That must mean they are undeveloped right? Nope. Everyone knows San Francisco is a developed city. That’s why it has no need to show off with luxury skyscrapers and such things.Or how about Florence, Italy?Again, no skyscrapers here. But everyone knows it’s a developed city and Italy is a developed country.My point is, you have got to look at the people and the innards of a country to truly know if they are developed.This is the true face of China:You have got to look at the average person. Does the average Chinese have good access to healthcare (which is ranked near the bottom in WHO rankings btw)? Can they drink tap water safely? Do they have access to quality food? Do all have access to electricity or paved roads or a quality education? The answer is: probably, yes, if you are living in the rich east coast provinces of Jiangsu or Zhejiang or Guangdong- but not if you are living in say - Xinjiang or Gansu or Tibet. China’s wealth is not spread equally, neither is it developed equally. Even though the CCP has developed China quite fast - there is still a lot of work to be done making sure *every Chinese* have equal access to everything.And then you got to look at the attitude of the people. When I was in China I found that you really got to look out for who you trust, because there is a lot of scams going on all the time. You never know what is real, what is fake, what is real price of anything. Why do these scams exist? Because people have to be desperate to make money that’s why.Why are people desperate to make money? Probably because they are not making enough to survive, which is an indication that the country is still developing. You’ll notice that in general, the more developed a country is, the less likely there will be scams. In Korea/Japan/Taiwan, you will not find very many scams. In China and Eastern Europe it’s likely.Another aside I want to note is that Chinese bathrooms don’t contain any toilet paper. Do you know the reason why? It’s because people steal it. Now, in what developed country does this happen? I can’t think of any. Only in a developing country would you need to bring your own toilet paper to the bathroom because there isn’t any there due to fear of people stealing it.I find GDP/capita to be generally a pretty good indicator of how developed a country is. The average GDP/capita (PPP) of China is still around $8k/person. While that is higher than most Asian countries - it’s still below the 4 East Asian tigers + Japan and far from the $62k/person that the USA has.The true measure of a developed society is to observe the people that live in the country and not the appearance of the country itself. Chinese “face” culture is the same. You can just obviously see that China has developed really really fast, and mentality wise people are still harping about luxury products and consumerism - this is where Americans were back in the 50s, 60s and 70s, not now.The biggest consumers of luxury products are Chinese people, not Americans or Europeans. The more developed you are, the less need you have to validate your self worth with materialism. The less desire you have to spend thousands of dollars on your children's schooling just to send them to be educated abroad. The less need to travel to countries like Canada or USA for giving birth so that your child becomes a US or Canadian citizen, or to launder your money by buying up real estate in other countries. Developed countries do not need to do things like that.Thats why you should always pay attention to the old adage -Edit:Of course, Chinese commenters love to bring up the USA. Yes, USA has lots of impoverished areas too; every country has developed areas and undeveloped areas, however my point is that for China there is significantly more undeveloped areas at a higher % compared to the USA. The poverty rate for China is 16% as of 2019 and for USA it is 1.5% as of 2019.

The invasion caused another huge wave of emigration and accelerated the country's decline.Former Czechoslovakia felt from the top 15 most developed countries after WW 2 (moreover quite untouched by the war) to the top 40–60 most developed countries in the late 1980s.Note: It's good to mention that the state was historically created by two very different areas - Czech lands (Modern Czechia), industrialized highly developed part, and Slovakia (Modern Slovakia) where mainly eastern regions were very backward and poor + Ruthenia (before WW2), part of current Ukraine, which was extremely underdeveloped. Throughout the history of Czechoslovakia, money has flowed into the development of these less developed areas from the Czech lands.The local communist regime collapsed not only in political, but above all economic, social and ecological way. The land was (literally) in ruins.Local shops were not empty. But it was quite common for entire segments of goods to be temporarily missing, and there were often things in stores that no one wanted too. Although people were poor compared today and most consumer goods in relation of income, more expensive, people had relatively large savings - there was nothing to spend money on. People often did not shop, but searched and sometimes spend hours in lines. Often response of shop assistants was “Nemáme” - “We do not have this”“I have not become accustomed to Byzantine ways to kiss and thank the beating hand.Scaffolding and wooden corridors became a typical part of Czech towns, It stand on the streets for years and supposed to ""protect"" pedestrians from falling pieces of the facade or roof.“With the Soviet Union, poverty has come to (our) land""The well-known paraphrase of the communist often used slogan ""Banner: ""Banners and posters of this kind were very often in streets and It had a bizarre context. It was often one of the few color things on the gray and crumbling streets. Do you know what is crazy? The decline seemed kind of a norm to the people, because it was everywhere…And the more the country fell down, the harder the party celebrate and talk about a bright future and prosperity and thanks to the occupier. But the reality was exactly the opposite ...The “prosperity” was visible literally everywhere…When censorship was temporarily eased before 1968 and during the 80s. Information about some shortages also reached the media. (English subtitle)Only the basic reconstruction works lasted about 10 years. The business sector mostly had to start from scratch, the country had huge internal debt (outdated or non-existent infrastructure, a highly inefficient economy that largely collapsed shortly after the fall of the regime in 1989, environmental damage worth billions of euros, even ordinary houses were mostly unmaintained.There was no question of what to fix. The question was what to fix first and how to prevent further disintegration.Millions of people have regained their stolen property, houses, shops, land. But the biggest challenge has only just begun, much of the property has been neglected for decades.If you want to see what happens to a small developed country when it is occupied by a backward totalitarian state. We are an example from a textbook. Forget catastrophic movies, this is what the decline of civilization looks like. The video shows the small Czech town of Trutnov in 1990 before the main repairs began.Same town todayCzechia is inVojta Rod's answer to How bad is it to live in Czechia?Hard data for current Czechia - And unlike many other developed countries, all our results are gradually improving.For example, purchasing power has more than tripled since 1989, and the so-called consumer basket is the same as in the rest of developed Europe. In general, social and economic differences are so enormous that it is similar to comparing current France and France in 1920. Moreover, (at least) some statistics were deliberately falsified before 1989, as in other Eastern bloc countries…Btw, the Czechia is probably the only country in the world that makes a clip about how great and various we are ;D.Tens of thousands of people want to start living, working, or studying there every year. I am quite proud of what we have achieved as a nation in the last 30 years.Unfortunately, the country still suffers from the negative stigma caused by this period.Czech Republic - WikipediaAnd finally, a few wise words at the end…“ …communism has two sacks into which it classifies people. In one It's proletarians who will come out of here and make a revolution. In the second is the bourgeoisie, which is then to be beaten and expelled. Thus, the communist throws into the other bag everything that is not organized in the party, and thus perfectly simplifies the image of the worldSo I am not a communist because I love people, because I have more respect and love for the work than for any power.

The person quoted World Happiness Index figures and how Pakistan was way ahead than India. He told me to go and build toilets and then f*** myself. My current answer is very sincerely meant. To that misguided person my only answer is that if you are happy with the state of affairs in Pakistan, the state of the economy, the crashing PKR, then what can I say? Be happy and let things run its course.Land Reforms:Education:Women Education:Infrastructure Development:But ports, roads and bridges are not the only infra. Pakistan has to focus on power including renewable sources, irrigation, housing development, development of new cities, etc. India lags here too.Give up on Terror; hug peace:Forget Kashmir. Increase Trade with India:There are a few more options. Not all are simple. Not all may bring immediate benefits but in the long run they will. It is a matter of setting aside the ego.Edit 2 (30-May-2019):The whole thing has been misunderstood. The rhetoric lies in the minds of the Establishment and not general populace (maybe). The survival of the Army Generals depends upon the anti India stance. Let me also explain how India rhetoric, the unbalanced arms race, terror funding, etc., have crippled Pakistan.In 1985, the Per Capita GDP of Pakistan was about 27.7% higher than India’s (Pak US$350 : Ind US$274). Today, the Pakistan per capita GDP is some US$ 1222.50 and forecasted to grow to US$ 1400 in 2020 while India’s PCGDP is US$ 1963.55 and forecasted to grow to US$ 2350 in 2020. India is 60.1% ahead. How did Pakistan lose out by about 88%?Pakistan, while a smaller nation, is a much blessed nation. Almost whole land is fertile, it has a unique geographic advantageous location, it is rich in minerals, its population is lower (but growing at an alarming rate 2.5 times of India), the problems are lower, etc. Smaller nations grow much more than larger nations. The growth rate till 1985 was about 6% and exceeded India’s measly 2.75%.It was around this time (1985) that Pakistan started funding terrorism against India and started the Kashmiri insurgency heavily. They also started heavy military purchases including the F-16s. Pakistan's general thought that we won the war in Afghanistan by attrition. We can do the same to India. The US was funding Pakistan to fight against Afghans. Some of the heavy funding was to take care of the huge Afghan refugees. But a lot of these funds were misused and ended in terror funding or the corrupt. Pakistan still had to shelter the refugees. The money came from the exchequer.This is what I mean by India rhetoric and it is deeply coupled with Kashmir.People have also questioned on terror and how IK is sincere and wanting to talk and Modi isn't. There are reasons for this. Why did the bus to Lahore in 1999 end up in Kargil? The Kashmir problem was almost solved at that time. Who helped the attack on J&K assembly and later the Indian Parliament? Who sent terrorists to Mumbai on 26/11/2008? Modi invited Nawaz Sharif and he gracefully agreed. Yet pretty soon there were Uri, Pathankot incidents and later Pulwama. Pakistan can’t honestly say that they were ‘freedom fighters’ fighting alone. JeM have taken responsibility of these events. Pakistan can’t hide behind excuses such as ‘give us the proofs’. Where do all these people get the training and logistics support? How is 240+ kg of RDX, detonators, timing devices obtained and where does the training to assemble it come from?Pakistan is always in denial mode. They denied whereabouts of Osama Bin Laden. What happened exactly?All this not only creates mistrust but that logistics support to “freedom fighters” is costing huge amount of money. The army/ISI can’t provide their own arms to the terrorists; they provide funds. The terrorists buy their arms and ammunition from global arms dealers at open market (much higher) price. Hence they require more money - the same money that could be used to build better roads, dams, canals, higher educational institutes, etc.Just a fortnight ago, Pakistan got some $6 billion from IMF and the first result was deep PKR devaluation. What is $6 billion? It is loose change for tea/coffee. A similar sum was spent by Laxmi Mittal to purchase the bankrupt Essar Steel of India. And yet, this money was direly needed. It has come with deep consequences. We went thru same crisis in 1991 and I know what happened. How long will this money last. Without fresh global investments, Pakistan will have to back to IMF in a year. The world views Pakistan as an unsafe place. Reality may be different but perceptions matter.Just imagine ... if peace accord had been signed in 1999. The Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline would have been complete - bringing huge revenues for Pakistan. A road transit would have been created from New Delhi to Central Asia bringing customs duty, cess and road tolls to Pakistan. These two would have earned more than $6b per annum. This is the benefit of bilateral trade.I have told to forget Kashmir and India. Cut down on (useless) defence spending.I could go on. My answer and advice is to take good things.

The thing is we have to take a look at the innards of a country to really know whether or not you are truly developed. That Chinese are so obsessed with portraying the facade that they are technologically advanced and ahead is actually an indication that they have not fully developed yet. Because fully developed countries have no need to show off things like that. Everyone knows they are developed.For example, here is San Francisco:Look, not many skyscrapers right? And look at those old cable cars going around! That must mean they are undeveloped right? Nope. Everyone knows San Francisco is a developed city. That’s why it has no need to show off with luxury skyscrapers and such things.Or how about Florence, Italy?Again, no skyscrapers here. But everyone knows it’s a developed city and Italy is a developed country.My point is, you have got to look at the people and the innards of a country to truly know if they are developed.This is the true face of China:You have got to look at the average person. Does the average Chinese have good access to healthcare (which is ranked near the bottom in WHO rankings btw)? Can they drink tap water safely? Do they have access to quality food? Do all have access to electricity or paved roads or a quality education? The answer is: probably, yes, if you are living in the rich east coast provinces of Jiangsu or Zhejiang or Guangdong- but not if you are living in say - Xinjiang or Gansu or Tibet. China’s wealth is not spread equally, neither is it developed equally. Even though the CCP has developed China quite fast - there is still a lot of work to be done making sure *every Chinese* have equal access to everything.And then you got to look at the attitude of the people. When I was in China I found that you really got to look out for who you trust, because there is a lot of scams going on all the time. You never know what is real, what is fake, what is real price of anything. Why do these scams exist? Because people have to be desperate to make money that’s why.Why are people desperate to make money? Probably because they are not making enough to survive, which is an indication that the country is still developing. You’ll notice that in general, the more developed a country is, the less likely there will be scams. In Korea/Japan/Taiwan, you will not find very many scams. In China and Eastern Europe it’s likely.Another aside I want to note is that Chinese bathrooms don’t contain any toilet paper. Do you know the reason why? It’s because people steal it. Now, in what developed country does this happen? I can’t think of any. Only in a developing country would you need to bring your own toilet paper to the bathroom because there isn’t any there due to fear of people stealing it.I find GDP/capita to be generally a pretty good indicator of how developed a country is. The average GDP/capita (PPP) of China is still around $8k/person. While that is higher than most Asian countries - it’s still below the 4 East Asian tigers + Japan and far from the $62k/person that the USA has.The true measure of a developed society is to observe the people that live in the country and not the appearance of the country itself. Chinese “face” culture is the same. You can just obviously see that China has developed really really fast, and mentality wise people are still harping about luxury products and consumerism - this is where Americans were back in the 50s, 60s and 70s, not now.The biggest consumers of luxury products are Chinese people, not Americans or Europeans. The more developed you are, the less need you have to validate your self worth with materialism. The less desire you have to spend thousands of dollars on your children's schooling just to send them to be educated abroad. The less need to travel to countries like Canada or USA for giving birth so that your child becomes a US or Canadian citizen, or to launder your money by buying up real estate in other countries. Developed countries do not need to do things like that.Thats why you should always pay attention to the old adage -Edit:Of course, Chinese commenters love to bring up the USA. Yes, USA has lots of impoverished areas too; every country has developed areas and undeveloped areas, however my point is that for China there is significantly more undeveloped areas at a higher % compared to the USA. The poverty rate for China is 16% as of 2019 and for USA it is 1.5% as of 2019.

I visit the local government school and I find that the roof leaks when it rains - does not have a fan in hot summer - is not connected by roads - the roads that are laid - were laid ten years ago and are now filled with pot holes.

SALES and MARKETING - selling Indian Goods - is pain not just in the ass but all over!

They will not hesitate - They will not forgive - They will exterminate ruthlessly.The state is atheist not secular - The state only tolerates religion and culture - mind the word TOLERATES i.e. if the state at any point of time believes that the religion is against the state or any culture is against the state - It will exterminate the religion or the culture. The great cultural destruction during Mao’s era is a proof of the extremes to which Chinese would go!It is a very good thing - China had a clean slate - a fresh slate - a slate cleansed with blood of many people who died during the struggle. China got rid of all the superstitions along with their old culture. India on the other hand lives in these superstitions -China is a COPY PASTE MACHINE - of profit makingChina copies - it copies profit making machines - If a business model is working - they will copy it - They copied Iphone - not just the phone but the Istore - that is an incredible achievement - They copied KFC - They copied McDonalds i.e. in china there is a chain of McDonald stores - not owned by McDonald. They have a copy of facebook - they have a copy of uber - they have a copy of twitter - they have a copy of a copy of a copy i.e. there are other companies trying to make copies of the chinese copies.The entire chinese state understood - the necessity of development - and they are pushing for it at any cost. Most of the chinese cities are covered with smog - but chinese can’t afford to stop their development - They need to make goods - services and sell them to make profits - as long as they make profits they develop.The Chinese are done with roads within their countryThe Chinese are done with RailsThe Chinese are done with PORTS - All these are ports developed by ChinaThe Growth Engine of China owes a lot of its Exports and Export trade is done by ships - not by road or by rail.
