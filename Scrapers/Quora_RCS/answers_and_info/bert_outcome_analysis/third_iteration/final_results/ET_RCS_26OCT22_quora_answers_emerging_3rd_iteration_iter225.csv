Bob would nowIf you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.I would try to explain Blockchain in the most simple way I can.Let us assume that there are two people Alice and Bob. Alice borrows some money from Bob and Bob writes it on a piece of paper signed by Alice. After some days Alice denies the existence of such document and claims that Bob has forged that piece of paper. Bob would now find it difficult to prove that Alice actually owes him Money.In this example Alice and Bob are two nodes.Now assume the same scenario, but among a society. So there are ’k’ pair of people transacting with each other. And the only proof that each pair has, is that piece of paper. Looking at this scenario, one person, Kate comes up with a solution. She suggests maintaining a common notebook of transaction for entire society. She designates town hall to be the place where every exchange takes place. In the common notebook, every pair writes the transaction and then the notebook is kept safely. People rejoice and accept Kate as their leader.That notebook can be called a database.But one day, somebody spills wine on the notebook. This makes the notebook illegible. Taking the advantage of this situation, Alice again denies taking money from Bob.This is the problem databases face - single point of failure.Irritated by this problem, Kate comes up with another solution. She suggests maintaining multiple notebooks. She chooses some trustworthy people from the society and gives them a notebook each. Now every time a transaction or exchange takes place between two people, Kate instructs some of those trustworthy people to mention the transaction in their notebooks. So the data is repeated in the notebooks. Now, even if one notebook is destroyed, chances are that all the data regarding transactions are still present in the combination of other notebooks.This is a distributed database and multiple notebooks are the multiple nodes.But next day, another problem arises. Kate has a friend named Bert who owes a lot of money to some people in the society. He asks Kate for help and she agrees to help him. She instructs all the people with the notebooks to remove the entries where Bert received money. Now Bert doesn’t owe any money based on the notebooks.This is the problem with distributed databases - they are centralized. That means one single entity owns all the nodes/resources and can make changes as they deem fit.When the people from the society come to know of it, they remove Kate from the leadership.* They decide to keep a notebook each. Every time a transaction is made between any two people , all the people from the town come together and mention it in their respective notebooks. So if there are n people in the society, then there are n notebooks and no one person controls the overall representation of the transactions. This is decentralization.","31,154 followers",Phillip Remaker,1.7K,11K,78.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-of-blockchain-technology

3,"When it comes to the size of the railway, many countries have a thumbs-up to China, in 2020, China railway has reached 140000 km, including 37900 km of high-speed rail mileage, whether the strength of a country is strong, mainly depends on the size of the high-speed rail, now China's high-speed rail high speed rail mileage accounts for more than 60% in the whole world, Europe and the United States combined have less high-speed rail than China. Moreover, China has accumulated more than 9 billion kilometers of operation mileage and 10 billion passengers, ranking first in scale.Speed is a measureWhen it comes to the size of the railway, many countries have a thumbs-up to China, in 2020, China railway has reached 140000 km, including 37900 km of high-speed rail mileage, whether the strength of a country is strong, mainly depends on the size of the high-speed rail, now China's high-speed rail high speed rail mileage accounts for more than 60% in the whole world, Europe and the United States combined have less high-speed rail than China. Moreover, China has accumulated more than 9 billion kilometers of operation mileage and 10 billion passengers, ranking first in scale.Speed is a measure of a country, and an index of railway technical level, like Vietnam, surrounding the Chinese railway speed also amounted to less than 100 kilometers per hour, the United States, Russia, India and other world powers of railway speed and seldom more than 200 kilometers per hour, but China's high-speed rail can run 350 kilometers of the fastest speed, Common bullet trains can run at speeds of up to 200 km. In addition, the maglev train developed by China has set a new domestic record, and the fastest test data of 620 km per hour has also impressed Western countries. In the future, the railway speed competition will be long behind the East.Technology level since don't have to say more, the Chinese Renaissance, high-speed train, the highest level of the domestic operation of train technology, which is composed of more than 10 units, the cost of a train is more than 1 billion yuan, it is the speed of the current global in operations in the train, the fastest, and a lot of the core technology of this kind of train is domestic research and development, localization rate is very high, It can be seen that the country has attached great importance to railway technology to what extent, the technological level is ahead of the Western countries is an indisputable fact.China's high-speed rail frequent operation and zero accident rate, showing the safety of the train, after all, a high-speed train transported hundreds of thousands of passengers, a trip to national attention, no doubt about the safety of the high-speed rail, finally will said to the environmental protection of China's railway, in order to build Gao Tieshi, minimize the damage to the ecological, and the destruction of the farming land, China's high-speed railways are all driven by viaducts. Viaducts not only solve the problem of foundation settlement, but also reduce the damage to the surrounding environment.Such as reducing the noise, the train don't have to worry about the cultivated land and vegetation affected, because of high iron if it is built on the ground, you must set aside hundreds of meters of buffer space, but to build on the viaduct there is no need to cushion, this method is full of big wisdom, speed, technology, scale, environmental protection and security, the five major railway, China is in the world, These achievements are obtained by the national accumulation of years in railway construction, but also the silent efforts of generations of Chinese people. Now China's railway reputation is worldwide, we should always remember the Chinese people who have paid for the railway construction, and pay tribute to these lovely Chinese people.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,12.7K,996,155.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-advanced-is-Chinese-train-technology-compared-to-American-European-tech

They demand to see my ID. I tell them no thanks. They insist I step out of the vehicle. So I casually start driving at about 5 miles an hour while this Chinese Soldier tries to open my flimsy Field Litter Ambulance door. They start screaming at me to stop, but my Private already turned his bluetooth speaker back on. So we made probably the lowest speed run through a checkpoint in history.Me and one other medic in an ambulance with a M9 and 1 mag, against a squad of Chinese Soldiers with rifles. Yea China, you’re not scaring anyone. Especially not the Japanese. The Chinese forces did that to a a Japanese convoy a week or two before it happened to me, and the Japanese soldiers disarmed the Chinese. One of the other reasons why I felt emboldened, I mean besides just being an American. I wasn’t the only American or even French soldier to experience this, plenty of western soldiers did the same thing to the Chinese.","23,888 followers",Robin Daverman,11.8K,2.3K,40.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-advanced-is-Chinese-train-technology-compared-to-American-European-tech

In the trivial matters of showing one's own moral or political superiority, he no longer pursues progress at the overall level of the country. With regard to the rising China, the USA has only used the despicable and shameless practice of a scumbag to bully and suppress.Chinese companies have a great advantage in manufacturing extra large parts in extra large scale. Hydropower and UHV can be cited as the world's best two examplesOn January 12,A single Baihetan million hydropower unit is more than 50 meters high and weighs more than 8,000 tons. A unit is equivalent to the weight of an Eiffel Tower.Just to cite an example-in terms of the hydraulic research and development of the core technology of the unit. For the first time, Dongfang Electric applied the numerical simulation technology of the whole flow channel and the whole working condition to the engineering practice, innovatively developed the hydraulic evaluation standard and the blade thickening technology, and achieve the best match between the strength of the entire flow-through component and the hydraulic performance, the efficiency reaches more thanChina can build hydropower stations with the largest unit capacity in the world.For human beings to develop, the following three problems: thePower outages in Europe and the United States are all technical failures, while power outages in China are due to natural disasters. In addition, China’s population density is much greater than that of Europe and the United States. However, the number of people affected by power grid outages is much lower than that in Europe and the United States. This reflects extremely high technology and management level liabilty. Especially after the heavy snowstorm in 2008, China has further transformed the power grid, which greatly strengthened the monitoring capabilities of the entire network system, which can effectively predict the occurrence of accidents, and can realize that it does not affect other areas after the accident.China’s leadership in power grid technology not only provides a guarantee for the rapid improvement of China’s industry and residents’ living standards, but also created two world-class super companies: State Grid and China Southern Power Grid, which were ranked among the Forbes Global 500 in 2016TheChina can design, manufacture and commercialize ±1100 kV converter transformers and converter valves in the worldThe distribution of energy resources and power loads in China is extremely uneven. More than 80% of energy resources are distributed in the west and north, while more than 70% of power consumption is concentrated in the east and central.In June 2006, the Yunnan-Guangdong ±800 kV UHV DC transmission demonstration project was established. It took only four years to get done.Since then, several large leading multinational companies have gradually faded out of China's high-voltage and UHV DC market, especially system research, development and design completely were withdrawn from the Chinese market.At present, China's UHV not only solves the problem of independence, but also is at the forefront of the world. It has been widely used by emerging countries such as India, Brazil, South Africa and other emerging countries to drive transnational power transmission and power trade, and promote the Chinese power equipment manufacturing industry for an annual growth of 500 billions RMB leading the global competition.TheThe pressure vessel of a nuclear power plant is one of the core components of a nuclear power plant, and the seal is a key component to prevent leakage. The pressure vessel of China's nuclear power plant has been produced nationwide, and the C-shaped seal is designed and manufactured by Zhejiang Tiansheng Sealing Company, one of China's largest static seal production companies.China's coal-to-liquid technology absolutely leads the world. One small part in this huge system is the one-way valve. There was originally only one German company making it. The small valve cost as much asChina Hunan Sidi Technology Company developed the one-way valve.

If you look closely, the gongs are crooked and untidy. Such an uneven and bumpy gong sounds the best. Those machine made round and flat ones are not up to the task.The crystal required forIn February, 2016, the United States announced that it had broken through China’s 15-year blockade and producedChina becomes the only country in the world that can manufacture practical deep-ultraviolet all-solid-state lasers. However, KBBF contains highly toxic beryllium and its crystal layered growth habit is serious.China has not waited for the United States to catch up in this area. In August, 2015, the Fujian Institute of Physics of China discovered a new type ofRubik's CubeTheAround 2005, Shenzhen Honghe Technology started the development of interactive electronic whiteboards. Unlike the two major international manufacturers, they took the route of infrared technology. Two years later, they launched their products. When it first came out, it could be described in one word, poor, and various failures continue, which is many times more difficult to use than the foreign ones.However, after another one or two years, the product began to stabilize, and more and more manufacturers joined, including iBoard (domestic manufacturers), Xiamen Yintian, Shenzhen Haiya, ...., etc. The prices have been getting cheaper to just more than one thousand yuan. The related industry chain has been becoming more and more complete. The domestic interactive electronic whiteboard technology competition has also kicked off, mainly for the technology of multipoint writing. In just one or two years, it has been overcome by many companies.Due to backward technology, SmartBoard and Prometheus have been in decline, and in the end they all asked the Chinese domestic companies for OEM production. The current interactive electronic whiteboard, technology and production are 100% controlled by the Chinese domestic manufacturers. This industry has also led to the development of two other related industries.TheCompanies that can produce infrared tubes are all over the world, butThis is also due to the rise of the the Chinese domestic electronic whiteboard industry, domestic infrared tube manufacturers have also continued to compete with the development of this industry. In the end, the ones with the best technology and cost control survive. It is understood that these infrared tube manufacturers were small enterprises with only a few employees a few years ago. However, as China's electronic whiteboard industry dominates the world, these small enterprises have also begun to grow. It is precisely because of the development of related industrial chains that there is no foreign electronic whiteboard industry today and in the future.This industry not only provides a large number of low-end assembly positions in China, but also provides tens of thousands of software and electronic engineer positions, creating huge foreign exchange income for China. The most important thing is that the industry does not produce waste gas or water at all, and thus will not cause any negative impact on the environment.If the United States were to block this industry in China, it would not affect China’s interactive whiteboard industry at all. While this industry earns huge foreign exchange for China, it also makes outstanding contributions to the education development of the world, including American classrooms. All the interactive whiteboards made in China are used worldwide!Xuan paperThe Chinese have established aOnce the materials and shipment are out of the warehouse, there must be a strong transportation infrastructure to transport them. This includes a nationwide airport network, a nationwide highway system, and a nationwide high-speed rail network. The material carrying capacity of the aircraft is completely incomparable with the high-speed rail. The Chinese high-speed railway, extremely-cold region railway, plateau railway, and heavy-haul railway technology have entered the world's advanced ranks. The construction technology of the super long and wide bridge and tunnel reaches the world advanced level. A group of the Chinese high-performance railway equipment and technologies with independent intellectual property rights represented by high-speed trains and high-power locomotives have reached the world's advanced level, and some have reached the world's leading level. The Chinese also own the world's leading technology for offshore deep-water port construction, giant estuary channel regulation technology, long river section channel system regulation technology, and large-scale airport engineering construction technology. The manufacturing technology of large-scale specialized terminal loading and unloading equipment, marine machinery special ships, and complete sets of container equipment is world-leading. Sorting technologies such as postal optical character recognition (OCR), video complement, and code address verification are at the world's leading level.China has the most complete domestic communication network in the world. The system built by three state-owned companies covers 99.7% of the national both rural and urban population.Consumer drones made in ChinaChina currently can build rapidly a very large unprecedented world class high-speed railroad system with an extra large scale modern ticket system and signal control system that Americans can't.China has unveiled the prototype for its sleek new magnetic levitation (maglev) train. Its makers say it will be capable of traveling at speeds of 600km/h (about 372 miles/hour).China's new maglev is all set to go into commercial production in 2021.The world's first quantum science experimental satellite named Micius was successfully sent to space by Chinese scientists on August 16, 2016, because this not only means that China is at the forefront of quantum physics, a discipline that can open the door to the new world, the future of mankind.In the process of building an all-superconducting Tokamak Nuclear Fusion Experimental Device (EAST), the Chinese scientists and engineers have developed more than 60 key technologies. 90% of the required superconducting, low-temperature and other cutting-edge materials are researched on their own. It is trial-produced step by step in the workshop of the factory. From superconducting materials, superconducting joints, superconducting wiring to large-scale magnet systems, after about 20 years of continuous efforts, China now has the world's advanced superconducting technology.Not long ago, the Pole Field No. 6 coil (PF6) with an outer diameter of more than 11 meters and a total weight of more than 400 tons passed the final acceptance test at the site of the French International Thermonuclear Fusion Experimental Reactor. PF6, developed by the Hefei Institute of Material Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, is currently the heaviest and most technically difficult superconducting magnet in the world. The Chinese have spent 6 years in independent research and development of PF6.The Chinese scientist named Wang Nianshuang is currently engaged in research in the United States. He designed the stabilization of the coronavirus spike protein (S-2P) by adding two proline mutations, which provides an important structural biology basis for the precise design of mRNA vaccines, and this technology is now widely used, including Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Modena, Novavacs and many other companies in the development of new crown vaccines, may also be used in the development of more vaccines in the future.Wang Nianshuang first started studying the coronavirus inIn 2014, Wang Nianshuang, who graduated from Tsinghua University, joined the newly established laboratory of American scientist Jason McClellan at Dartmouth College. An important project of the laboratory is the cooperation with the vaccine research and development center of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to develop a vaccine against the new coronavirus, and Wang Nianshuang’s task is to find a way to stabilize the spike protein of the coronavirus, which is also a key target for vaccine development.However, what he did not expect was that after experiencing the extreme excitement of the successful experiment, this ground-breaking achievement did not receive the pre-expected favor at the time.After obtaining the new coronavirus sequence in January, 2020, Wang Nianshuang and his colleagues quickly carried out further research on the basis of previous research. In February, 2020, they resolved the structure of the stabilized new coronavirus S protein at the fastest speed. For this reason, the development of new crown diagnostic reagents, vaccines and drugs has provided key information, and has been quickly applied to vaccine trials of pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer, Modena, and Johnson & Johnson.In other words, the reason why Pfizer and other pharmaceutical companies' vaccines can be successfully developed and approved within a year isAfter this new crown epidemic, China's vaccine may be further recognized by the international community. Especially in developing countries, the trust will be greatly improved.A country with the second highest level of technology in the world must have a large number of unique technologiesMore is available until next time.","68,742 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,514,17.3K,413M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-advanced-is-Chinese-train-technology-compared-to-American-European-tech

How powerful is the US?From the political, economic, scientific and technological, military, cultural, diplomatic, and other aspects. China can't compete with the United States in any aspect.A. The US political powerThe US election is the most concerned political event in the world. Any American president who takes office will influence the direction of the world.For example, Trump, an “incredible“man who could not be found for hundreds of years, became the president of the United States. If he is in other fields, it may not have any influence. But he is now the president of the United States.But it is not that he is terrible, but that the global leadership of the United States is terrible!If he is the leader of a very underdeveloped country, I don't think most newspapers will even report it.B. The strength of the US economyThe strength of the US economy can be seen all over the world. The United States has not only influence but control over the global economy!C. The US science and technologyThe US stands at the forefront of science and technology in the world. Most of the high technology in the world is in the hands of Americans or American laboratories. For example, today's China is developing its aerospace industry, which is an achievement that attracts worldwide attention. However, we all know that compared with the United States, we are inferior to the United States and the former Soviet Union at the beginning of the Cold War.But I think Leonard's genius is that a nerd can have a girlfriend like Penny.D. The US militaryThe US military ranks first in the world, and I believe no one will refute me.The largest conventional aircraft carrier in the world is the Kitty Hawk of the US Navy. This aircraft carrier has participated in many foreign operations of the US military.The United States Marine Corps, the firm executor of the national will of the United States, can basically defeat other countries with only one US Marine Corps.I don't think any country in the world would be stupid enough to challenge the United States militarily.5 steps to reshape the US military: Glean, Engage, Focus, Incentivize, and Share.The Kitty Hawk of the US NavyE. The US cultureAmerican culture is an important manifestation of American soft power. Almost everyone on earth knows Hollywood, and even some people may not know where the capital of the United States is, but they must have heard of Titanic and Rambo, an American hero who can beat hundreds of people by himself. Most written works in the world are written and recorded in English. American music is basically the trend. The American brand is basically the guarantee of quality. It can be said that where there are people, there will be American cultural influence, except for newborns in hospitals.TitanicRamboII. What are the advantages of China?China's greatest advantage is the people.From the military point of view, the PLA under the leadership of the Communist Party of China has no advantage in weapons and equipment. But the People's Liberation Army has accomplished every military operation task brilliantly. Because Chairman Mao said: ""The decisive factor in war is people, not weapons and equipment."" Is it true that China respects the US military because the US military has the most powerful weapons and equipment? No, it is because the extraordinary courage displayed by the US military on the battlefield deserves China's respect.Let me show you a couple of the examples that the power of people:A. What has the Communist Party of China done in the history of being regarded as a communist devil by the West?The first National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held secretly in this boat, Shanghai on July 23, 1921. The meeting was attended by only 12 people, announcing the founding of the Communist Party of China. Today, China has 90 million Party members.Under the military attack of the Kuomintang, the army led by the Communist Party was forced to move. The journey is more than 20,000 miles, also known as the 25,000-mile Long March. During the journey, it has traveled 25,000 miles through 11 provinces, 18 mountains, 24 rivers, deserted grassland, and rolling snow-capped mountains.After the Long March, there were only 30,000 Communist troops.In 1932, he was commissioned by the CPC Central Committee to organize the Anti-Japanese Coalition Forces in Northeast China and served as the commander and political commissar of the Anti-Japanese Coalition Forces. He led the soldiers and civilians to fight bloody battles with the Japanese aggressors in the northeast. In the extremely cold environment, under the emergency of running out of ammunition, he finally fought alone with a large number of Japanese aggressors for a few days and nights and died heroically. When the Japanese army caught him, they cut open his stomach and found that there were only bark and cotton in his stomach. He kept fighting by eating these. At that time, the Japanese army stood up and saluted, because Yang Jingyu was a very respectable fighting hero of Communist Party members.The Liberation War was a war waged by the Chinese People's Liberation Army under the leadership of the Communist Party of China from June 1946 to September 1949 to overthrow the Kuomintang rule and liberate the whole of China. It is a decisive battle concerning China's future and destiny. On October 1, 1949, the People's Republic of China was proclaimed in Beijing on the way of PLA marching to the whole country. In 1951, the PLA completed the task of liberating the mainland and offshore islands and the Communist Party of China unified the Chinese mainland.The Communist Party of China has done a lot of things. She made China independent, and at the same time, she led the Chinese people to work hard to build the motherland.Many overseas Chinese are constantly discrediting the Communist Party. It doesn't matter. More than one billion Chinese people now support the Communist Party of China. Is this party good or bad? If the Communist Party is really an extremely evil party, how can it monitor and control 1.4 billion Chinese people?Is it because China is really sinful that it keeps smearing China? Or something else?B. What are the strange characteristics of the Chinese people?Chinese people's character comes from Chinese culture. It is not deep to get in touch with the Chinese without understanding the Chinese character.China's college entrance examination is the exam with the largest number of participants in the world. The history of examinations in China has exceeded 1400 years.Every year in the college entrance examination in June, all cars in China will not whistle, so it is necessary to create a quiet environment for the candidatesParents waiting anxiously outside the examination roomExamination in ancient China. In the highest examinations in ancient China, the invigilator was the emperor. At the same time, any candidate who tries to cheat will be decapitated immediately once he is found.2. Chinese people especially like farmingChina's geographical environment determines that the people here will make a living by farming. Until today, as long as Chinese people see a good piece of land, they will not plant flowers, but grow vegetables.The picture above shows Chinese people growing vegetables in the Antarctic scientific research stations, deserts, university campuses, and space.3. Chinese people love saving money and grainWhen Americans were suffering from pneumonia in COVID-19, many people took to the streets. In fact, it is not necessarily opposed to wearing masks, but Americans do not have the habit of saving money. If the United States does not resume its economic activities, the American people will be unable to live because they have no jobs. But at the request of the Communist Party of China, 1.4 billion people stayed at home. Chinese people can stay at home for two months without going to the streets. It is because Chinese people have the habit of saving money. A country that has been poor for hundreds of years will not spend all its money once it has earned it.4. An incomparable yearning for peaceA unified and centralized country, a country with peasants as its main people, needs a peaceful environment most. Because it is impossible to fight there, I still farm here. Chinese people have always hoped to have a peaceful environment for them to cultivate their land, save some money, and then let their children receive a good education.5. Chinese people's deep love for their families and countriesChina attaches great importance to education. Therefore, Chinese culture can be preserved from generation to generation after thousands of years. In education, loyalty and justice are emphasized. This is why Chinese people have a very strong concept of territory and nationality. Every generation of Chinese will tell their children that you are a Chinese, that you are a Chinese who eat with chopsticks, and that you are a Chinese who write Chinese characters.A very famous story in China, Yue Fei, a famous general in Chinese history, had his mother tattooed his back before joining the army. There are four Chinese characters on it,Every Chinese has been fed with chopsticks in this way, which is calledEvery Chinese child will be taught to use chopsticks by his parents.When eating in China, only the elders say they can eat, and the rest can eat. This is called a6. Once oppressed too much, peaceful farmers will become fearless fightersIn Chinese history, all those who rebelled were peasants. As long as farmers have food to eat, they will not rebel. Once they are starving, Chinese farmers will rise to revolt. Therefore, Chinese people are not afraid of power in their genes. Indeed, many emperors in Chinese history were rebellious peasants. The earliest peasant uprising in Chinese history was the uprising of Chen Sheng and Wu Guang in 209 BC. At that time, the west was still the Roman Republic.What I want to say is that these characteristics of Chinese people come from China's poverty and backwardness, and also from its own understanding. Chinese people may be bullied, but it is impossible to kill all Chinese people.The US is powerful, and the American people are a symbol of freedom and independence. China cannot compete with the United States in any form.III. In the endThe US is the most developed country in the world. The US is ahead of China in every respect. China has been actively learning from the United States. Americans are Chinese teachers.But China does have its advantage, that is, its people.The national anthem of China today was created at the most dangerous time in Chinese history. Her lyrics are like this:起来！不愿做奴隶的人们！把我们的血肉，筑成我们新的长城！中华民族到了最危险的时候，每个人被迫着发出最后的吼声。起来！起来！！起来！！！我们万众一心，冒着敌人的炮火，前进！冒着敌人的炮火，前进！前进！前进进！Get up!People who do not want to be slaves!Build our flesh and blood into our new Great Wall!When the Chinese nation is at its most dangerous time,Everyone was forced to make the final roar.Get up!Get up! !Get up! ! !We are United as one, braved the enemy's fire,Forward! Braving enemy fire,Forward!Forward!Go ahead, and forward!Well, this is what I share with you as a communist devil. Have a nice day, my friends~~~","3,501 followers",Tim Chiappone,5.7K,255,4.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-advanced-is-Chinese-train-technology-compared-to-American-European-tech
