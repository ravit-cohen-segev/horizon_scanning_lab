It is set to replace most of the smart phones and similar gadgets that have been the biggest things lately, and the biggest players (Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Sony and Samsung) are getting into the game.I would like to elaborate more, however, because there are a number of otheWell, I've already answered a similar question, and the answer is pretty much the same.We've had the personal computer, internet, cell phones, what will be the next great technological discovery that will innovate the way we live?Essentially, I think augmented reality is going to top the list of the next big things. It is set to replace most of the smart phones and similar gadgets that have been the biggest things lately, and the biggest players (Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Sony and Samsung) are getting into the game.I would like to elaborate more, however, because there are a number of other really big things in the works, and it looks as if most of these technologies will become mainstream at about the same time, which should make for an amazing technological renaissance that we are about to enter.We have devices that will take measurements of all sorts and provide that information in real time. Including ones that can sense our movements and translate those into actions that control other devices.We have cameras coming that take high quality 3d images in full 360 degrees.We have carbon nanotube fibers that are stronger and lighter than steel, can conduct electricity and can also conduct and even create light. These fibers will be able to be woven into clothing to make the clothing stronger and capable of interacting with electronics.We have graphene that will be able to convert light into energy, conduct electricity, and even hold electricity like a capacitor when coupled with silicene. Which will pave the way for even better computers that are lighter, stronger and faster than ever before.We have additive manufacturing (3d printing) that is taking over nearly every industry and leading the way for yet another revolution in invention. This includes food printing, 3d photography, house building, too many medical uses to name, but printing replacement organs probably tops the list there. Of course most of us are aware this is being used to prototype more new inventions than ever.We have cars that can drive themselves, and this will inevitably lead us finally to the dream of flying cars whose biggest obstacles so far have been, cost, difficulty of use and safety, the latter 2 of which would be greatly reduced by self flying cars.We have printable oled technology that will allow lights to be printed on just about any surface.We have robots that nearly pass for human, and we have humans that are already experimenting with implanting electronic devices.We have the Internet of Things (IOC) which will allow us to monitor and control anything in our house.If they manage to prove it, QEG may have figured out overunity, which will be a newer, much cleaner, much cheaper version of energy than we've ever had before. The jury's still out on that one as many believe it's simply not possible, and there have certainly been a lot of hoaxes. If it turns out to be true, though, wow.There are a few other very cool technologies on the way as well.Any one of these technologies could change the world in dramatic ways. If you imagine these technologies being used together, then you might imagine just how awesome things are about to get.In a manner of speaking, the world is about to end. The world you thought you knew is going to be so different in about 10 years that most kids growing up in the new world won't even be able to imagine what it was like now. We're all about to feel really, really old.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-big-thing-for-consumer-technology

But what we're really waiting for is the Oculus Rift, which is slated for a Q1 2016 release.While wearables are an initiative that the large consumer electronics giants are invested heavily in, it is currently hamstrung by the lack of a suitably portable and capable power source. The batteries have to be small enough to be wearable but at the same time, they have to be powerful enough to enable functionality. Right now there isn't a good balance between functionality and practicality. We've seen that reception towards smartwatches that run out of juice in a day or so is lukewarm at best. (Looking at you Apple Watch)The internet of things is yet another initiative that has been brought back from the dead. It died in the late 90's to early 00's because no one found a particularly compelling use case with the backend computing infrastructure capability of the time and also the low amounts of internet bandwidth available to everyone. Now that most everyone has internet capable mobile devices, what's left is the killer app and application of IOT. It's a growing market but there hasn't been a break-out mass adoption of anything yet.","135,532 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.6M,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-big-thing-for-consumer-technology

3,"Transfer learning in ML models.Humans are really good at generalizing. We only have to see a few dogs before we can recognize a dog when we see one.Machines are not. ML models require millions of examples before forming a reliable classifier, and that classifier is very specific to the data on which it was trained. If your training data doesn't include dogs with three legs, the model won't recognize them.

If we could teach machines to do the same, they would learn exponentially faster and apply that learning more effectively.Transfer learning is a very hot topic in AI research right now, so I expect major breakthroughs in the next few years. I think this may be sufficient to achieve artificial general intelligence, but even if not, it will dramatically extend the range of tasks that machines can accomplish.","45,630 followers",David Seidman,790,3.6K,85.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-big-thing-for-consumer-technology

Artificial intelligence has been around for a while, but hasn’t fully reached an optimum level of development, and I feel that is due to not only the limitations of hardware, paradigms for training, and ethical decisions, but also due to limited datasets.

The Internet of Things (IoT) will rely on Big Data, as well as generate a lot of the datasets that will be used. Artificial intelligence has been around for a while, but hasn’t fully reached an optimum level of development, and I feel that is due to not only the limitations of hardware, paradigms for training, and ethical decisions, but also due to limited datasets. Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality will basically chew through datasets in their efforts to greater immerse their audiences in their “realities.”Big Data is the science of gathering information about complex systems and interactions, and developing the algorithms to better understand the data received. Big Data is what will lead to greater power plant (both large and small, so everything from nuclear reactors to car engines) efficiencies as well as better monitoring of the health of infrastructure, by having a far granular dataset to better predict or react to conditions, such as increased temperatures in one region of the country may require more power produced, while also denoting that a road may need to be patched due to that increase in temperature. Big data will also lead to better economic models, as well as finding correlation in disparate systems, such as the rise in demand for chocolate chip cookies after a particular sports team loses. Big Data will lead to not only better artificial intelligence, but also think of how it would enable self-healing systems. There are so many applications for data collection and analysis.Moore’s Law, the observation that the number of components in an integrated circuit doubles roughly every year to 18 months, has driven semiconductor development, and in turn helped drive software production. Imagine wanting to write a program to do a really cool thing, but the cost of the computer to run your program costs $3,000. If you’re concerned that no one will buy it because the costs are high today, this would put a damper on development. However, if you think that it will take you 4.5 years to develop, the price of the components necessary to run your program would have dropped dramatically, placing an expensive computer that you used as a target for your application to drop in price, thus making your application more financially feasible.Moore’s Law has also affected the price, availability, and capability of sensors at an exponential rate, too. As the price of sensors continues to drop, and the forward progress of cellular technology brings down the price of slower technologies as new ones come online, data collection not only becomes far easier, it also gets exponentially cheaper. When 5G cellular technology rolls out over the next couple of years, 4G/4G LTE will drop in price and become the standard that the IoT will use for communications. Moore’s Law will probably also be used as the baseline for IoT adoption, so you can imagine how quickly sensors and automated systems will be deployed.While we have made tremendous gains in the Information Age, we are still only scratching the surface, and new applications for computer systems are coming every day. At this point in the age of computers and information, we’re just starting to get to the truly disruptive part. Only time will tell how well we progress.","358,933 followers",Sean Kernan,8.6K,5.6K,726.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-big-thing-for-consumer-technology

So, to this question, I could explain using a timeline through which you could map the emerging technologies over the years. I don’t want to dig much deeper into the history since that would be irrelevant to the question.–1980: The period before 1980 was completely dedicated to the development of modern computers. Starting from Vacuum tubes, Digital Electronic Circuits Turing machines, Transistors, Integrated Circuits, modern computers became dominant.1980–2000: People had enough computation machines. They wanted to share that information generated by their computing machines to others. From rockets to news, to security, to everything, everyone wanted to share the information. Boom! The Internet! The new technology became dominant. The Internet Era!2000–2015: Yeah! People share the information. But what did they want to do with that information? There came the technologies for storing lots of data, analyzing those data, concluding what the data says. Yeah! There began the technologies Data Science, Big Data, Cloud Computing. They became dominant and started a new aspect of computing.2015-: So we have the power to store, analyze, conclude about lots of data. What’s next? Educate the computers what to do with that data! Educate the computers what to do when! Educate the computers to make its own decision! Educate the computers to learn by itself. Educate the computers to understand the humans better! Yeah! So began the era of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence.Future: We made the computers to be human assisting. Why not the computers be like humans? You got what I’m saying? Robots!Since these are mainstream technologies that are and will be dominant, they can’t be independently dominant. The other technologies which also contribute in the emerging technologies are Quantum Computing, Cybersecurity, nanotechnology, eye-controlled technologies, 3D printing, Genetic Computing, IoT, etc.So we got some list of technologies! How will it shape our future?* Self-driving cars* Intelligent Wearable devices* Robotic Workforce* Smart Machines* Multi-planetary Civilization.These are some of the results that will be contributed by computer technologies. Hope this answer satisfies your question.PS: The timeline says about the years during which the technologies started and exploded. It no way means that they are not in usage after that period.Cheers!","47,054 followers",Abhinav Sharma,3.5K,865,7.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-big-thing-for-consumer-technology
