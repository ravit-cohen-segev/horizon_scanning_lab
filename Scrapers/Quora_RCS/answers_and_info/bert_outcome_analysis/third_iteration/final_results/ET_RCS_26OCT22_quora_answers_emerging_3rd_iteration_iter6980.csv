The pathetic state of Indian manufacturing can be gauged from the fact that 69 years after independence, India can't even manufacture products as simple as earphones. Yes, even your earphones are probably manufactured in China, though they might contain a Made in India tag, to fool the Indians.Comparing the two countries would be a great injustice to China.

No Indian company is on the list.Measuring a country's ability to innovate in science and technology can be viewed from patents, high-quality scientific journal index(nature index), and R&D investment. In 2018, China's R&D investment is 297.1 billion dollars, ranks second in the world, more than the whole of Europe combined, while India’s R&D investment is 16.8 billion dollars, ranks 18th in the world, only 5.6% of China. As for the number of patent applications, China ranks first in the world, again India’s number is less than 3% of China. And in high-quality scientific journal index(nature index), China ranked second only behind US, while India is not even on the list.As can be seen from the above data, India is no where close to China in technology.China's technological power is not only leading India significantly, but also ahead of Japan, Germany, France, England, only behind the United States.Considering that India’s current technology is much weaker than that of China and China’s R&D investment is over 17 times that of India every year, the technology gap between China and India will not shrink but increase in the future. If India wants to catch up with China in technology, India must invest at least 20 times more R&D fees every year than it does now.

It was also thought that democratic India may even overtake China. Will that dream come true?China experienced many problems in initiating industrialisation, but after some hitches, it switched to an all-round emphasis on heavy and light industries, and had a more successful resource mobilisation strategy than India did. As a result, Chinese manufacturing grew at 9.5 per cent, twice as much as India’s rate, from 1965-80. Also, China managed its agrarian reform better than India did.“China has outrun India in every area of economic endeavour in the last 35 years, except in computer software industry and agricultural research”Few people in 1978 could have imagined the monumental economic progress that China would make because of the economic reforms pushed by Deng Xiaoping. The reforms stressed the principle of “each according to his work” rather than “each according to his need,” professionalism and efficient economic management at all levels and the gradual introduction of policy changes to avoid problems in implementation.The primary difference between the performance of the Indian and Chinese economy has been the faster growth of capital stock in China. With only a slight difference in the growth of employment, this translated into a more rapid growth of capital intensity. The growth of total factor productivity has also been faster in China. This appears to reflect a greater ease for labour to move out of agriculture into higher productivity sectors in China than in India. China has outdistanced India in every area of economic endeavour in the last 35 years, except in computer software industry and agricultural research.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,6.9K,5.6K,427.2M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-ahead-in-technology-China-or-India

The secondary school had Wi-Fi.All the villagers wore helmets while riding their electric scooters. Every single one of them could read and write Mandarin, and none of them littered or spat or peed in the open.The women all wore jeans, dresses, skirts etc. and no one judged them and shamed them for “aping the west”. What mattered was their ability, not what clothes they wore.It was completely safe to wander around the village after dark. No one got harassed for their gender, nationality etc. None of the female participants in the homestay program ever mentioned that they felt uncomfortable, or were stared at by men for wearing shorts. None of us faced any racist taunts.I’m not saying that China has no problems, but this Chinese village had better services than most Indian cities (we can still only dream of uninterrupted power supply, or 24x7 water, or pothole-free roads).I cannot say with authority that all villages in China are like this, but I would wager that many of them are. The cities are of course in a different league. I stayed in the suburbs to the north of Shanghai for a few days, not a tourist area. The neighbourhoods were clean, with excellent roads, and footpaths were not cluttered by hawkers. People followed traffic rules. I went to a side street where there were stalls selling street food, and it was clean. No one littered, there was no garbage anywhere.It’s not just their GDP or infrastructure.

I visit the local government school and I find that the roof leaks when it rains - does not have a fan in hot summer - is not connected by roads - the roads that are laid - were laid ten years ago and are now filled with pot holes. LOGISTICS i.e. the art of moving goods - there are no roads - There are no air ports - there are no shipping ports. SALES and MARKETING - selling Indian Goods - is pain not just in the ass but all over! You will understand this because - every Indian Good falls short in quality - according to international standards - most of the Indian goods are discarded i.e. thrown away because they don’t fit the requirements set by the buyer. Corruption is not a problem - it never was - Businessmen would earn more profits to pay for the corrupt - but the problem is that the corrupt money is not being used for infrastructure - China is as corrupt as India!What is China Doing?China has many structural advantages compared to IndiaThey are communists - They will kill anyone who stands in the way of the state! They will not hesitate - They will not forgive - They will exterminate ruthlessly.The state is atheist not secular - The state only tolerates religion and culture - mind the word TOLERATES i.e. if the state at any point of time believes that the religion is against the state or any culture is against the state - It will exterminate the religion or the culture. The great cultural destruction during Mao’s era is a proof of the extremes to which Chinese would go!It is a very good thing - China had a clean slate - a fresh slate - a slate cleansed with blood of many people who died during the struggle. China got rid of all the superstitions along with their old culture. India on the other hand lives in these superstitions -China is a COPY PASTE MACHINE - of profit makingChina copies - it copies profit making machines - If a business model is working - they will copy it - They copied Iphone - not just the phone but the Istore - that is an incredible achievement - They copied KFC - They copied McDonalds i.e. in china there is a chain of McDonald stores - not owned by McDonald. They have a copy of facebook - they have a copy of uber - they have a copy of twitter - they have a copy of a copy of a copy i.e. there are other companies trying to make copies of the chinese copies.The entire chinese state understood - the necessity of development - and they are pushing for it at any cost. Most of the chinese cities are covered with smog - but chinese can’t afford to stop their development - They need to make goods - services and sell them to make profits - as long as they make profits they develop.The Chinese are done with roads within their countryThe Chinese are done with RailsThe Chinese are done with PORTS - All these are ports developed by ChinaThe Growth Engine of China owes a lot of its Exports and Export trade is done by ships - not by road or by rail. Globalization happened over Container Terminals, Ports and Oceans - Unfortunately most of Indian - Ports are unfit for Docking International Ships - Hilarious but True - Indians never invested in making their ports world class - Chinese are done with ports not only in their country but also internationally -The Chinese are NOT Done with AIRPORTS YETThe only comparable infrastructure of India with China is in terms of AIRPORTS - India can compete with China on air traffic.But this too will pass - With China building hundreds of airports - by 2020 they will induct more than 100 new airports - to tackle the extreme congestion and delays in air port travel across the nation.I WILL SUM IT UPIndia pales in comparison to China in International PatentsNOTHING CAN BE DONE WITHOUT INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE - i.e. utilization of WEALTH to create more WEALTH - which starts a virtuous cycleEquivalent to investing the first twenty years of your life to education - China spent twenty years of its life from 1980 to 2000 in learning about developing profit making machines and investing in them - building cities - tows - roads - railways - and everything and anything in a mad rush to build - sell - repeat;make - sell - repeat; after millions of these selling cycles to international customers - The Country is now reaping the fruits of its investments made decades ago and pursued relentlessly.",307 followers,Shashank Goyal,3.4K,63,9.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-ahead-in-technology-China-or-India

I could take a high speed train from Nanjing to Shanghai in about 1.5 hours!In contrast, I took an Amtrak train from Detroit to Chicago (about 300 miles/480 km) and it took over 8 hours!Another area China wins at is public utilities. They provide electricity, water, and gas for billions of people for very affordable prices! I paid maybe a total of $20 (US) per month for all utility bills, whereas it cost me over $100 in America! Atop of that is wireless technology (which is considered a public utility in China). I paid 100 rmb ($15) monthly for 16 GB of 4G data, with 1000 texts and 500 minutes of talk (which pretty much meant unlimited everything for me). In America I pay $50 a month for my unlimited plan. Yes, the 4G is a little faster, but that may just be because I’m not trying to access the foreign web here…A third area (kinda related to the second) is how the CCP controls markets and prices so everyone can live a comfortable life.

You got to be a millionaire to buy an okayish flat in Tokyo.

Almost every “Expert” predicted that Japan will overtake USA’s economy by 2010 or so…But we all know that never really happened. So what went wrong?As it turned out, almost Everything….. The young Japanese people preferred staying single than marrying and having children.About 30% Japanese people never marry. So the population started aging rapidly. The population even started declining. The problem with this is, in order to have a flourishing economy you need constant supply of young, innovative work force. And Japan ran out of just that..So in 1990s, Japan entered a phase of GREAT STAGNATION. That means it showed almost zero growth in last 3 decades!. It's economy is still $4.9 trillion.China which had 50 times smaller economy than Japan back in 1980s, ironically has 3 times larger economy compared to Japan today. All that in 4 decades.The whole point is, as of now, China is indeed doing great in terms of economy as compared to India...But the question is for how long?With controversial one child policy, even China’s population is aging rapidly, talent pool is shrinking too, so what happened to Japan might very well happen to China.Another thing is, much of China’s progress is based upon it's policy of disrespecting Intellectual property rights and avoiding free trade and thereby curtailing competition. Most of countries including USA have sensed that and as a result now they are demanding China to shed off its trade protectionism.I laugh gleefully when my fellow Indians say “India can never beat China even in dreams”. Economics is a Bitch…there was a time when Venezuela was developed and Norway was poor country, at world stage it doesn't take a lot of time to go from rag to riches and other way around.At present India’s potential growth is hugely suppressed by corruption, excessive government control, socialist leaning policies, hostile neighbours and awful education system.. But things are changing rapidly.It's not impossible that India becomes 3rd or 2nd largest economy in the world in the next two decades.Only time will tell whether India leaves China behind or not, Only thing that I can say that it's not impossible.Image source - Google","68,805 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,690,17.3K,413.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-ahead-in-technology-China-or-India

28,"Since you included technology as well as science, we’ll have to go back a long time to find the beginning.

Thus we began to distinguish ourselves from other social mammals and create a new destiny.We learned to carry fire and make fire. This was a huge step, as it protected us from cold and predators.Then we made the first really big, unique technological step: cooking. There have been many attempts to define humanity according to a single difference: tool-user (nope); tool-maker (nope, Lady Goodall found those darned chimps); language user (nope, chimps and parrots). But we are the only species who cooks our food. This was our first great technological development. And cooking changed who we are.The first great technological leap of humanity: cooking. Image fromCooking changed the strength and shape of our jaw and remodeled our digestive tract. We use far less energy and time eating than, say, gorillas, who spend most of their waking hours eating. Less blood and oxygen and work going to the guts meant more for the brain. So the brain, along with color vision and hand-eye coordination allowed us to become thinking social mammals of a whole new order. We grew advanced languages and tribal cultures and literally covered the earth, migrating to every continent except Antarctica.And that was just with five technologies: tool-using, tool-making, fire, cooking, and language. This was all long before civilization.Thriving in these technologies, we reached a point where grandmothers and grandfathers could remain alive and pass down what they learned. This was the beginning of education, and, ultimately, the beginning of what we now know as science. We began to both learn about the world from others and also see the world for ourselves. What we call science today is just a refined, organized way of doing that.On the way from early technologies to science, we took two other big steps: civilization and conquest.Prior to civilization, we were hunter-gatherers, and often migratory. With the development of agriculture, we settled down, creating a local environment for our communities and connecting to particular lands.Big step #2: agricultural villages. Image fromAnother big step came along at the same time. It was a conceptual step. What if we wipe out the apex predator and replace it? All around the world, we wiped out saber-toothed tigers, dire wolves, woolly mammoths, and other major predators who either would eat us or compete with us for food. Then we either achieved uneasy peace or cooperation with the next largest predator. We stayed away from tigers, and they stayed away from us. Largely the same with lions. A lion will prey on herds of cows, but not on a herd of cows with a Masai warrior present. We domesticated elephants. We domesticated dogs and kept wolves at bay.This is the beginning of what we call civilization. We have settled agricultural homes. We still hunt. And we have time to develop new technologies. We go beyond stone arrowheads and enter the bronze age.Just before or as we entered the bronze age, we made a choice. We began to treat other tribes of human beings the same way we treated the apex predators we had eliminated. That is, along with the invention of agriculture and settling down, we invented a new kind of territoriality and a new expression of our nature called war. Along with war came prisoners of war, and, from this, slavery.We then created a self-reinforcing system of war, slavery, civilization, and technological progress that we have been creating and living ever since, and it is still with us today. We invest in technology of war first and foremost, and then use the spin-offs of technology for peaceful or humanitarian pursuits. Then we ran into one more problem: addictive substances and addiction. As we reached a point where survival did not require constant work, we created societies that had individuals - and in richer industrial societies, many individuals - who had more time than purpose. Addiction then fed into our economic system, and modern empires were born on the profitability of civilization enhanced (or degraded) by warfare, slavery, and addiction.Some elements of science are millennia old, but science as we know it today had very early roots around 1600 with the work of Francis Bacon, and even by the late 1700s with Benjamin Franklin, we really were still engaging in natural philosophy, and not what we would, today, call science. Science came in around 1820 as a concept. The US Civil War accelerated military technology to a great degree. The Second Industrial Revolution, with the development of feedback control and Thomas Edison’s industrial engineering center of invention brought us into our current technological revolution, which then accelerated us into the information age.Essentially, science enhanced our ability for precise replicability of engineering results. This gave us greater control over greater power, and brought us to where we are today.The good news is that we have enough science and technology to create a peaceful world where everyone has enough clean water, sanitation, food, basic health care, and education. And we have had, for over 2000 years, the spiritual guidance of the Axial Age to create such a situation.The bad news is that we have not yet given up our addiction to war, slavery, and addiction, so the society and world we are creating (and destroying) is not the wonderful place it could be.",76 followers,Vinod Kumar,48.1K,2.6K,17.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-country-is-more-technologically-advanced-Germany-or-Japan

Eventually Mr. Jenner discovered penicillin. People started washing their hands before sticking them in wounds. Millions of people lived who wouldn’t have before the discovery of antibiotics and the use of alcohol to kill bacteria.
