2,"Theres a fatal flaw in the argument around which the question is based. Theres no such thing as more evolved. Evolution doesnt have a destination. In very broad and simplistic terms, if an adaptation or mutation makes a species more likely to survive and reproduce then it's more likely to be passed down.Intelligence worked for humans because frankly without it the chances of survival of a species that isnt particularly fast over short distances, isnt particularly naturally strong and cant climb particularly well and doesnt produce masses of offspring isnt great without intelligence.

Without weapons, and collaboration very few humans and no small children can fend off a predator.Yes we're successful because of our intelligence, so we naturally value intelligence more than most other traits. But that doesnt necessarily mean that it will enable our long term survival more than other traits. It could potentially lead to our extinction for all we know.

3,"For the three thousandth time, “dinosaur” is not a group on a level with “human” - it’s on a level with “mammal”. It’s taken mammals about 213 million years to produce humans and other great apes, elephants, dolphins, bears and raccoons, and it’s taken dinosaurs 243 million years to produce parrots, corvids and butcher birds (who are all on a level with elephants, non-human great apes etc).

5,"It wasn’t a single species of dinosaur that “ruled”. No individual species of dinosaur ever dominates the biosphere the way humans do today.The environmental conditions of the Mesozoic did not produce the right set of circumstances to select for high human level intelligence.Humans share a common ancestor with dinosaurs dating to about 300 million years ago. Which means that in the brains department the dinosaurs did not get any head start. Both lineages started from the same place and time.At the moment the non-avian dinosaurs went extinct, the human ancestors alive at that time were not notiIt wasn’t a single species of dinosaur that “ruled”.

6,"Claire Jordan has of course pointed out that dinosaurs are equivalent to mammals.When you ask why didn’t a group evolve into something, the question is why should they? All that matters is the survival of the species.There are 33 million sheep in the UK. There are more people but the more intelligent predators of sheep, wolves, are extinct. Sheep have been more successful than wolves. Getting smarter would not help.The second thing is that one branch might have evolved to something occupying the niche that early humans did, if they had not been interrupted by a ruddy great piece of rock.

9,"You answered your own question, in the question.Why is it that dinosaurs ruled the Earth millions of yearsYou might have seen pictures like this.

The dinosaurs were already well adapted to their environment—until it radically changed, and then they weren’t.Evolution does not have an “end goal” of any kind. High intelligence is just one possible adaptation. It is not something evolution always aimed at, and just somehow failed to hit until we came along. It’s just one possible adaptation among many.So, dinosaurs didn’t evolve high intelligence becauseAnd do remember—high intelligence comes withFor us, it’s worked so far.

Similar systems (towed howitzer with hydraulic brakes) were in widespread use already in WW1Katyusha MLRS in use in the Battle of Stalingrad; the basic concept is very similar to the current HIMARSAs for MBT, while the current crop is largely similar to the T-34 in basic concept, they evolved a lot, especially the defensive systems.
