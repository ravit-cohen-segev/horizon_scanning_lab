So, Israel today, has the talent, the concentration and the genetic presence to give Israel;the Jewish Country -the best input, from the best of science and technology.Israel is a Western nation. It is a free economy, a democracy and has many companies that have serious R&D units.2/3 of all households have internet, all businesses have high-speed internet, the telephone network is excellent, and new Start-ups are the standard, and impressive. Most high-school kids and 80% of all adults have smart-phones.For obvious reasons the Military industries are very advance and support our High-Tech Army. We have portable computers with most field-companies, drones overhead, the latest jets in the air and our satellites in the sky.Our tanks are technological wonders. The technology for tanks to fire, at a pin-point target while on the move-at 50 Km/h is made and used in Israel.We have robot boats, tunnel -destroying technology and face-recognition cameras in most ‘hot-spots’.The technology to shoot down enemy rockets-while in the air-over the enemy side of the fence is made in Israel and well applied.Our computerized and radarized anti-‘car-crash’ system is now sold all around the world.In medicine, We have the latest technologies and we have developed many of them....","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-currently-released-advanced-technology

It is not an exact value, only a range of possible values due to the uncertainty principle.The range of values can also change.

As the accuracy of the measurement of the position goes up (the blue has a higher peak), the accuracy of the measurement of the momentum goes down (the red has a lower peak). Vice versa, as the accuracy of momentum goes up, the accuracy of position goes down.

The randomness becomNo, it’s not anything like that. Not an engineering shortcoming in any way. Events at the quantum scale simply include a non-determinism that is innate to reality. At the large scale of our everyday lives the phenomena that we see happening around us involve extremely large numbers of fundamental events, and the “random noise” associated with this non-determinism averages out. The randomness becomes tiny compared to the scale our perception is sensitive to, so we don’t see it or notice it in any way. It was only when we started doing particular experiments that involves small quanta count that these effects became visible to us.If you just think about it for a minute, something of this sort had to happen somewhere in physics. We have free will. People actually argue over that - some people claim we don’t, but I consider it to be a self-evident fact. We are self-aware beings and we have free will. In order for that free will to manifest in physical reality, there had to be something in physics that doesn’t flow from a well-defined and demonstrable cause-and effect relationship. The whole excursion that physicists took into the idea of a “clockwork universe” where the entire future and past could be determined from a “now snapshot” was really folly all along - we should have known better.Now, let me try to answer your question. Why is there uncertainty? First thing to understand is that quantum theory tells us that the state of any system at any given time is specified by a “wave function,” and that this wave function contains absolutely everything that can be known about the system. There is no “more complete” specification - that’s it.Next, we can’t actually measure or observe the wave function itself. It’s “beyond our reach.” But all of the things we can measure are related to that wave function in a probabilistic way. In special cases, when the wave function is already “compatible” with the quantity you wish to measure, it will give you a precise prediction. But most of the time the wave function is not compatible with your observable - in that case the wave function allows you to calculate a set (possibly infinite) of possible outcomes along with the probability that you will get each one as the result of your measurement.The “clockwork universe” of the 1800’s relied upon being able to measure pairs of quantities - the number of such pairs depends on the complexity of your system. In classical mechanics these are referred to as “coordinates” and “conjugate momenta.” In order to make a full prediction of the future state of a classical system, you need all of the coordinate and momentum values associated with your system - you can use these as initial conditions in the differential equations of motion a...",2 followers,Richard Muller,2.2K,2.3K,202.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-currently-released-advanced-technology
