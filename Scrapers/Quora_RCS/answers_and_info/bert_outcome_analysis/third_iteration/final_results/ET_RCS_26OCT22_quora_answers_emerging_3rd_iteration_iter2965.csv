But that doesn’t make what it has got any less capable.As to how China built Tiangong alone while the ISS needed a partnership: The whole point of ISS was that lots of countries would cooperate - led by the US and Russia.

2,"Adding to the answers of Steve Smith and Don V:The Chinese station is a different modular build, and the modules are being lifted by rockets, not by a space shuttle. For its smaller station and different configuration, the Chinese will need far fewer launches and this is part of the reason why they don't need help.

4,"Steve Smith has a very good answer. If you have not read it, you should.I just want to point out that the USSR/Russia had multiple space stations: there was the Salyut series (1971 to 1986) and Mir (1986 to 2001). With Salyut there were six space stations (two of these were military). Mir was the first modular space station and was the first continuously inhabited space station.The U.S. had Skylab (1973 - 1974). The U.S. also had Spacelab, but this was launched as a lab module in the Space Shuttle carg bay and was not a permanent, free-floating space station.

The three men are supposed to be spending three long months aboard on a module some 380km (236 miles) above the Earth in extreme conditions and doing very arduous tasks prepping for new modules to connect to the one they’re staying. These require extraordinary stamina.I had always thought going to space is a young man’s job and they retire you before 45.True, John Glenn went back to space at 77 but I had to do a double take to check on NASA’s age guideline for astronauts. There are no age restrictions and astronaut candidates selected in the past have ranged between the ages of 26 and 46, with the average age being 34.This is new insight! So people who take care of themselves and stay super fit can possibly have a second career after retiring and become an astronaut!! (The general public should not get their hope too high though because education and experience in aerospace engineering required.)I should have known this 20 years ago . . . . .EDIT 6/22/21. Having it let percolate for a week. I do think there’s a message to be had. The 1969 U.S. Apollo 11 crew who landed on the moon -This is why it just automatically hit me hard when I read the ages of the Chinese crew. Their lead astronaut is 4 years away from retirement at 56! And his second is only 2 years younger! How could this be possible??Apparently, this crew is judged able to. Or else, for a mission of such global significance for China as a nation if they were to screw up, They must be their best crew.So, THANK YOU. THANK YOU. For somebody who has seen so much age bias over the last 20 years, I appreciate to see this pair in their 50s given the chance to show that they still have it. They are now the new faces of China’s taikonauts. The mature look.

8,"Because the United States does not allow China to use the International Space Station (which the United States is leading the effort to build)So China has to build a space station of its own.Recently, Shenzhou XII was successfully launched and Chinese astronauts Nie Haisheng, Liu Booming and Tang Hongbo have been stationed on the space station belonging to China itself, where they will carry out a three-month space mission.The previous record holders were Jing Haipeng and Chen Dong, who flew on Shenzhou 11 five years ago and spent 32 days in the Tiangong-2 and Shenzhou-11 cBecause the United States does not allow China to use the International Space Station (which the United States is leading the effort to build)So China has to build a space station of its own.Recently, Shenzhou XII was successfully launched and Chinese astronauts Nie Haisheng, Liu Booming and Tang Hongbo have been stationed on the space station belonging to China itself, where they will carry out a three-month space mission.The previous record holders were Jing Haipeng and Chen Dong, who flew on Shenzhou 11 five years ago and spent 32 days in the Tiangong-2 and Shenzhou-11 combinations.After the construction of the future space station is completed, the Chinese Tiangong space station will be open to the world, accepting applications from countries around the world to be stationed on the Chinese space station.Although the original ISS was called ""International"", only countries that had invested money or technology in the construction of the ISS were eligible to send astronauts on board. Moreover, the time spent on the ISS by astronauts from each country is allocated according to the amount of money or resources invested by their country. As of January 2018, a total of 230 astronauts from 18 countries have visited the ISS, with astronauts from the United States and Russia making up the majority, 145 and 46 respectively.This is not the case with the Chinese space station, where China is willing to offer all countries the opportunity to use the Chinese space station, sending a very positive signal in terms of promoting space exploration and cooperation that will give many countries that do not have access to space the opportunity to do so.A total of 27 countries have applied to be on the Chinese Tiangong space station, and China has agreed to cooperate with 16 countries, including Switzerland, Poland, Germany, Italy, Norway, France, Spain, the Netherlands, India, Russia, Belgium, Kenya, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Peru. Among them, the European Space Agency has already sent astronauts to China to train with Chinese astronauts. Matthias Maurer, an astronaut from the European Space Agency who participated in the training, had even before this started to actively learn Chinese in preparation for entering the Chinese Tiangong space station, and it is safe to say that in the near future we could see images of Chinese and foreign astronauts jointly participating in flights.",UNKNOWN,Clayton C.

These included Mark Messersmith of the Ames Research Center, astrophysicist Debra Fischer of Yale University, astronomer Chris Lintot of Oxford University in the UK, professor Geoff Marcy of the University of California, Berkeley and a number of other heavyweight scientists who also decided not to attend the conference.

Races and people can progress magically, as they progress technologically.The reason the High Elves were able to defeat the Trolls in the Troll Wars was because their magic was stronger. It’s similar to Earth conflicts where one side has better guns. The Elves were further along in their path than the Trolls were.Different magic/technology systems within World of Warcraft would go about accomplishing a task in different ways.Say, for example, that you wanted to level a city. There are several ways that you could go about this.A gnome might very well create a nuclear weapon. That would definitely get the job done. A high elf (or a lunatic Warchief) might use a mana bomb. We saw in the bombing of Theramore that these weapons are just as effective; Jaina’s spell, a massive tidal wave, would have caused even more damage on Orgrimmar if Kalec and Thrall hadn’t stopped her. A shaman might establish a relationship with the elements, and call for an earthquake. A druid might create a massive wisp explosion like a Hyjal, or ask for plants and animals to take over the entire city.Likewise, each magic/technology system might have different ways of healing a bone, procuring food, or flying. These systems are not necessarily inferior to each other. Very advanced magic would trump mediocre technology; amazing technology would trump lackluster magic.
