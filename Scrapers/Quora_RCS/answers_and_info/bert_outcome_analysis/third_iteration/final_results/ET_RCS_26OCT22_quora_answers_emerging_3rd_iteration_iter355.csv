Instead of solely focusing on the grade you are given, focus on how you are being graded and how you can improve, even if you are already getting a high grade.Development of Your ThesisA thesis is the essence of your paper—the claim you are making, the point you are trying to prove. All the other paragraphs in your essay will revolve around this one central idea. Your thesis statement consists of the one or two sentences of your introduction that explain what your position on the topic at hand is. Teachers will evaluate all your other paragraphs on how well they relate to or support this statement.Strong FormA good essay presents thoughts in a logical order. The format should be easy to follow. The introduction should flow naturally to the body paragraphs, and the conclusion should tie everything together. The best way to do this is to lay out the outline of your paper before you begin. After you finish your essay, review the form to see if thoughts progress naturally. Ensure your paragraphs and sentences are in a logical order, the transitions are smooth so that the paragraphs are coherently connected, and that your body paragraphs relate to the thesis statement.StyleJust as your clothes express your personality, the style of your essay reveals your writing persona. You demonstrate your fluency by writing precise sentences that vary in form. A mature writer uses various types of sentences, idiomatic phrases, and demonstrates knowledge of genre-specific vocabulary, all the while ensuring the writing reflects your authentic voice.ConventionsConventions include spelling, punctuation, sentence structure, and grammar. Having lots of mistakes suggests carelessness and diminishes the credibility of your arguments. Furthermore, because most essays are written on computers these days, there is a lower tolerance for spelling mistakes, which can easily be avoided with spell-checking tools such asSupport and ReferencesFinally, your teacher will examine your resources. Select information from reliable websites, articles, and books. Use quotes and paraphrases to support your ideas, but be sure to credit your sources correctly. Also, always remember that copying five consecutive words or more from any source constitutes plagiarism. If you are concerned about unintentionally quoting your sources,The grades you get on your essays are important, but you can never improve your writing if they are the only things you consider. Focus on improving your essays’ overall structure—the thesis development, form, style, conventions, and support. Learning to master these five elements will cause your scores to soar!","4,696 followers",Anton Taiki,1.6K,4.4K,30.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-top-USA-universities-for-food-technology

There isn’t a single science-based answer that reflects the current medical consensus anywhere in the first ten listed here!* It’s not until I got down toWow, I’ve never seen a question on Quora so riddled with nonsense answers. There isn’t a single science-based answer that reflects the current medical consensus anywhere in the first ten listed here!* It’s not until I got down toAs Robert Devor correctly points out, there are a couple of main reasons why not only are the majority of the answers here dangerously wrong, but in fact the question itself is the wrong question.I am writing here only because this kind of misinformation is dangerous, and contributes to the misunderstanding of what cancer is and how it works. It also misunderstands how food works. And though my answer will probably be buried in the middle of the pile of nonsense here because people want a magical cure, I’m still going to write it in the hope that even one person who reads it will potentially learn to think about this question correctly, and not mess around with something as important as one’s lifetime health.I’m going to put a picture of a cancer here, mostly because answers with pictures seem to get higher view counts and rankings, and I am hoping to break through the giant pile of BS in the way. Here goes:This particular picture is of a carcinoma of the lung. This kind of cancer is one of the many that doesn’t give a crap what you eat. It will form and try to kill you no matter how many vitamins, magic berries, keto or paleo feasts, or whatever type of alkaline nonsense you try to feed it. Of course, not smoking so much will probably help.You see those papayas in the second picture near the right hand side? Stop looking so closely, you psycho. It’s just a representation of a variety of foods. If you’re looking too closely at one particular thing that you hope will save you, you’ve missed the point. We know what the stuff is that you can probably eat more of. Lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are good stuff. Eggs and dairy are good stuff as long as you don’t go crazy with saturated fat levels. Eat lots of different stuff. Colorful stuff, savory stuff, crunchy stuff. This isn’t that hard.I think that guy on the right is looking at the girl’s butt in front of him, right?. That’s a fringe benefit of doing some exercise, probably. Win/win!Rowing is so posh. You’re like an Ivy Leaguer!Nice dish, Dave! (I mean, I think he looks like a Dave. Could be Jason or Walter.)Hey you, dude in this stock image: you definitely need some help on your backhand grip. Call me, I can help with that. But good for you for exercising. Cancer called, and it’s really pissed! (And make sure you’re wearing sunscreen…you know, because cancer. ht: Simon Moore)Ok, so where does that leave us? There are quite a few ways to lower your risk of cancer, at least a little bit. And most of them have to do with lifestyle, avoiding obviously dangerous things, consulting with a good doctor on at least an annual basis, and getting a bit of variety in your life. But THERE IS NO FAD DIET OR SPECIFIC FOOD THAT HAS THE BEST CHANCE OF PREVENTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF CANCER. So stop trying to vilify food. Diets are just systems of subtracting foods from your life, and you want to add them. Just eat a variety of things (yes, even gluten), and eat lower amounts of the things you know aren’t the best sources of nutrition. The latest scare foods will change in a few years, as they always do. But none of the things you eat are magic. Stop trying to do magic with food. Magic isn’t real. And for the love of all that is sensible in this world, please don’t go on some nonsense diet just to put a few more pennies in the pockets of the quacks and opportunists who try to sell you diet books, or listen to their brainwashed acolytes. That’s right, here it is again: THERE IS NO FAD DIET OR FOOD THAT HAS THE BEST CHANCE OF PREVENTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF CANCER. Now go outside and play. Sheesh.*This was true of the answer order at the time of writing, but I don’t track relative answer position constantly, so I will have no idea if it remains so. Also, it turns out that Quora shows answers in different orders to different people, based on various algorithms. This presumably means that they’ll be showing the woo-based answers in higher position to people who are already inclined to believe such pablum. That would be a shame.","7,782 followers",Hantani Sadahiko,1.5K,1.9K,21.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-top-USA-universities-for-food-technology

This is soon going to be a major battleground for manufacturers and it will be interesting to see which of the big tech companies will survive and which will be left out. The metaverse is also a tech trend that is something out of a science fiction film.

21,"We live in an era called the information age. New technology is emerging every day to make life simpler, more advanced and better for everyone. The rate at which technology is evolving is almost exponential today. For business organizations, new technology helps to reduce costs, enhance customer experiences and increase profits.Here are some of the top technology trends for 2022:1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (We live in an era called the information age. New technology is emerging every day to make life simpler, more advanced and better for everyone. The rate at which technology is evolving is almost exponential today. For business organizations, new technology helps to reduce costs, enhance customer experiences and increase profits.Here are some of the top technology trends for 2022:1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)Artificial Intelligence, also known as AI, started gaining popularity a decade ago. It has still not slowed down and continues to be one of the leading technologies in 2021. AI is constantly evolving, and newer applications for this technology continue to spring upon the scene. Today’s most popular AI applications are image and speech recognition, navigation programs, voice assistants like Siri and Alexa, and much more.Organizations are looking to use AI to analyse customer and business interactions to derive insights and identify triggers. It will help them predict the demand for services such as hospitals or tourism and aid in the improvement of resource allocation for various projects.2. Robotic Process Automation (RPA)Robotic Process Automation (RPA) uses multiple software and applications to automate business processes such as data collection and analysis, customer service and other repetitive tasks managed previously through manual processes.Like AI and Machine Learning, RPA is a rapidly advancing technology that automates many jobs across different industries. McKinsey has analyzed that fewer than 5% of jobs today can be entirely automated, but nearly 60% can be automated at least partially.RPA offers several new career options and trajectories such as a programmer, project manager, business analyst or consultant. It also opens doors to high-paying jobs with a moderate learning curve in leading organizations. Choosing this technology as a career move can profit you immensely.3. Edge ComputingToday, millions of data points are collecting user information from various sources such as social media, websites, emails, and web searches. As the amount of data collected increases exponentially, other technologies like cloud computing fall short in several situations.Till a decade back, Cloud Computing was one of the fastest-growing technologies. However, it has become fairly mainstream, with the market dominated by major players such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform.As more organizations adopted Cloud Computing, they found several limitations in the technology. Edge Computing helps to bypass the latency that Cloud Computing causes and helps organizations to get data into a data center for processing. It can exist ‘on edge’, in the sense that it is closer to where the data processing will ultimately take place. Edge Computing is used to process time-sensitive data in far-off locations with limited or no connectivity.4. Quantum ComputingQuantum Computing is a type of computing that focuses on developing computer technology based on the principles of quantum theory. This theory explains the behavior of energy and materials on atomic and subatomic levels. In other words, it performs calculations based on the probability of an object’s state before measurement instead of just 0’s and 1’s.Quantum Computing can easily query, analyse and take action based on given data, regardless of the source. These computers are exponentially faster than normal computers.You need experience with quantum mechanics, linear algebra, machine learning, and information theory to enter this field.5. Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)VR and AR have been popular for almost a decade now. Virtual Reality immerses the user into a new environment, while Augmented Reality enhances the user’s existing environment.By 2022, AR and VR are expected to integrate into our everyday lives much more deeply than today. They have huge potential and possible applications in training, entertainment, education, marketing and therapy or post-injury rehabilitation. It is also widely used by advertisers and brands to create new immersive experiences for their customers.Starting a career in VR or AR doesn’t require too much specialization. Basic programming skills and a forward-thinking mindset coupled with optics as a skill set can help you easily secure a job in this field.",256 followers,Priyal Gupta,9.7K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-top-USA-universities-for-food-technology
