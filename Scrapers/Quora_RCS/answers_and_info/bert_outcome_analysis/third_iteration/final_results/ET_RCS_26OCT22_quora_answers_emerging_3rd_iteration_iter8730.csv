Seriously. The signal to the antenna was affected by the electromagnetic presence of a human body. Sometimes when you had bad reception and someone tried to adjust the antenna, they would discover that the picture was perfect when they were standing next to the set, with one hand raised, just so, but moving even a few inches out of position resulted in static.TV was free.",UNKNOWN,C.S.

Before that, I had to write my emails onto a file in a 3.5” floppy disk (which actually wasn’t that floppy) and ask my school friends who had the Internet to send it for me.Of course, if I had forgotten to switch the read-only toggle on the disk corner, that errand would be completely wasted.

So it was a relief to finally have access to the Internet at home.After that, things got better. Sure, I still had to occasionally take the ball out from the bottom of the mouse and blow on the rollers, but that was about it. Going online was now as simple as unplugging the wall phone, unraveling the extension cord, plugging it in on both ends, and voila — dialup!Eventually, however, my parents figured I was spending too much time online — especially with the MMORPG everyone was playing, where you built buildings and cast spells and sent armies with drop down menus. Why, once they even took away the dialup extension cable! I had to unplug the entire computer, and all its peripherals, and bring the whole thing down next to the phone socket to make sure the short little phone cable could still reach the computer.So that meant I had to wise up. The only way I could hide my computer habits from my parents was by making sure they couldn’t detect what I’d been doing. So that meant meticulously cleaning down the computer, deleting any temporary files, and sadly no more keeping CDs in the fridge in the hopes that you could skip past the scratched bits.But most importantly, I made sure I had wet towels on hand, so that the back of the CRT was cool to the touch by the time my parents were home.Clandestine computer use.

We were happy because we got home an hour before our parents and that meant we could watch the TV shows scheduled for the after-school time-slot, though Mum and Dad disapproved. In primary school, I used to enjoy “Agro’s Cartoon Connection.”The downside was that we had to do all our grocery shopping on Thursday nights. There was no other choice because the shops were closed on weekends and other weeknight evenings, so my family was always stressed and rushed on Thursdays. The upside of this was that we often had chips with steak sandwiches for dinner on Thursdays because they were quick to cook.We got a computer at home when I was about eight years old. It came with a tape drive and paddle controls. I could write my own games, but they often required a lot of PEEKs and POKEs, which were difficult to make sense of.Later, we upgraded to a computer with floppy disks and its own CRT. I could print out my homework assignments as long as I started printing before 8 p.m. The dot matrix printer was too noisy to run late at night and too slow to run in the morning before school.At university, it was exciting to go to the notice boards to find out my scores for exams. For privacy reasons, scores were posted by student number rather than name, so I needed to have my student number memorised.When I first moved out of home, I chatted with my parents via IRC to save money on STD calls.

It required a few of us (preferably with leather soled shoes) to continually run/slide down a slight incline to create a ‘schoolyard slide’.I’ve struggled to find a picture, but in this one here …I think the straight grey lines may be what I’m talking about. Maybe some of you will remember this.Another random activity, children climbing trees …No ‘Health and Safety’ regulations in those days!On a similar H&S theme, playing conkers …Back into the grammar school classroom, fountain pens that you had to fill with ink …I learnt ‘real writing’ (nobody called it ‘cursive’ then) with one of these.And finally in a complete return to my early childhood.I remember my father smoking a pipe …This isn’t actually him, but very much like this.Like all small boys I was curious about my father’s behaviour.

My kids (11 and 16) can’t even process the fact that when I was their age car bombs and street shootings were, if not a daily happening, frequent enough that you would interiorize them and inadvertently adapt your daily behavior to the possibility that you could get blown up while walking to school.In the 1970s and 80s several domestic terrorist groups (plus the occasional international group) were very active in Spain, most notably Basque separatist ETA, and terrorist attacks would happen in Madrid with almost predictable frequency. While targets in those days were primarily soldiers and policemen, bombs and stray bullets weren’t particularly picky and bystanders often got caught (and killed) in the fray.So you kind of got used to the almost constant drip of news on the radio and TV, the fake bomb threats, the many unfounded rumors, and adapted accordingly. You avoided cars that were parked in odd locations. You checked under your car in case someone had placed a bomb. You didn’t loiter around garbage cans and discarded cardboard boxes. You perked up if a police car or troop transport van stopped at the same traffic light as you.An army jeep patrolled my neighborhood because a high ranking politician (the minister in charge of police, no less) lived there. A friend of mine was knocked down by a bomb in the airport that killed a civilian. A public prosecutor was machine gunned down a couple of blocks away from my school.And you became numb to the carnage. In fact, as the violence tapered off in later years the attacks became more and more shocking and indiscriminate, in part because the terrorists became convinced that the “normal” killings had no effect any more among the Spanish population (or such was the excuse).My kids were born in a post 9/11 world and of course they are aware of the existence of terrorism, but they can’t conceive the close, intimate presence of deadly violence we used to have in our daily lives back then.",2 followers,Amy Babineaux,5.8K,454,26.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Without-revealing-your-age-what-s-something-you-remember-that-if-you-told-a-child-today-they-would-not-understand

Our second language was Gaelic ( this was in Nova Scotia).My Dad's weekend routine was to sit on the roof with a few beers and shoot mine rats running through our backyard. Well, it was a coal-mining town.Christmas meant walking into the bush with Dad for a tree and dragging it home on Christmas Eve. I received one gift, usually homemade, and a sock filled with hazelnuts and an orange or maybe an apple.Dad worked at the pit. He started at 14 when he'd take buckets of coal from the tailings and sell them door to door. He descended into the pit at 16 but left to go to war. When he returned, one of his jobs was to care for the ponies that hauled the coal out of the pit. They needed care because they were mostly blind after so many years in perpetual darkness.We had no indoor plumbing which meant traipsing to the outhouse in all seasons.The miners worked 12 hour days, six days a week. During winter, they might go a week without seeing the sun. They were permanently tattooed by coal dust in their hands and lined faces. Many were missing assorted body parts from accidents in the hole.How's that for old-timey? Every word is true.I actually told my kids all this when they were little with predictable results. They just wouldn't believe me I quite understand their doubts. Even I can't get my head around the changes since 1948. However, Mom backed me up and saved my rep.

This was in a suburb of Boston.The first thing that always confused me as a child was the fact that every sink and tub had 2 taps. One for hot water and a separate one for cold water.To wash, you either just used whichever you wanted, or you would have to mix in the sink. The hot water was REALLY hot too.There was just one phone in the house and it looked much like this:Yes, those bells were REALLY loud. You could easily hear this outside with the windows closed. The rotary dial was state of the art when it was installed. Apparently they were one of the first families on the street that could directly dial a phone number. My grandmother loved her phone so much, she never wanted to change it.She also never got a driver’s license. When she was married, most people still used horses. By the time those really vanished, she felt it too late to learn to drive.She was meticulous with the family budget. I still have her old ledger where every purchase that was not food was carefully entered. For food, she was given a certain amount of cash which she kept. She would carefully buy essentials in such a way that she could slowly build up money for special dinners around the holidays. When she passed, her “food fund” had several hundred dollars in it.Today, when I show my kids her ledger and what things cost, they simply can not believe it. $2000 for their first new car. And as an insurance agent, my grandfather always drove NICE cars.Social times were at the “club”. No, not the country club, although my grandfather did play golf as part of his business. No, the real social activity was around the Masons.My grandmother passed before I was in High School of cancer. She was nearly 80 at the time. My grandfather was lost. He’d never prepared his own meal or done laundry. I spent high school summers with him at their cottage in New Hampshire mostly to make sure he was cared for. He sold the house near Boston. But his life changed dramatically as Parkinson’s broke him down very quickly and he spent his final years in a nice facility not far from Walden Pond.I was finishing High School as the IBM PC began to change the world. Messing around with those early computers was a passion and ultimately became a career. But trying to explain the machines to my grandfather was difficult. He understood the adding machine and owned one of these:Which I played far too much with as a kid.But grasping the idea of a TV showing something like a spreadsheet was just too beyond his ability. Today, my kids take to computers as if they were born with the knowledge - they simply can’t comprehend going about life without them.The difference in society and technology between 1900 and 2000 is probably the largest advancement humans have made in such a period of time.And we are on track to make those advancements pale in comparison to what happens this century. Even my dad struggles with the newer technologies. While he’s grasped the use of a cell phone for calls and texting and email, the use in commerce and social media are foreign to him. Meanwhile, my oldest entered High School this fall (well, remotely anyway) and he was finally allowed to have a cell phone so that he could check in. And he’s already using features and apps that connect him to his friends in ways I didn’t realize existed.We own an old 1968 tractor. The boys have helped me do all kinds of work on it from time to time. They also help with work on the car. I’ve had them help with work in the house. They thought it was all “hanging out with dad”. What they don’t realize is that they have been learning a lot of the basic skills many people today don’t have. It wasn’t until they were with a friend’s family and got a flat tire that they realized how much they knew. The friend’s parents were trying to get a tow service. My kids were just wondering why they just don’t change it. Turns out, those adults had no idea how to do it. My kids changed the tire for them in under 20 minutes - FAR less time than AAA said a service truck could come.And here is the whole point - understanding the past - the basic way things work - and gaining those skills from the older generations makes for a better rounded person. I have no doubt my kids will use and understand technology far more advanced than anything I know. But I’ve made sure they also understand the things that my parents simply took as common knowledge. There is a great passing of skills that seems to be missing in today’s society. Far too much specialization. I think people lose some sense of control when they don’t understand how some of the basic parts of their lives work. When my grandparents grew up, the concept of indoor plumbing, electricity, and the phone changed their lives. They understood how those systems worked and most people of the time had to know the basics of electrical and plumbing. My parents saw the electronics age where entertainment was the movie house, the radio, and then ultimately the TV. I learned all the older tech from my dad. I’m now passing that on to my kids while they are being brought up in the age of pocket super-computers we call cell phones.","37,923 followers",Ron Rule,95.3K,2.7K,51.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Without-revealing-your-age-what-s-something-you-remember-that-if-you-told-a-child-today-they-would-not-understand

This picture from AlamySome relied on the local coffee board store to buy the beans.These would be roasted to the household's (and guests') preferred roast level.Dan Bollinger's image (below) in Wikipedia is a tad too modern, but imagine this with a cast iron wok, much larger, no insulated handle, longer cast iron spoon, minus the good lighting, plus the aroma of roasting coffee.Some preferred dark roast but since it was more of an acquired taste (less demand), a small batch would be roasted extra and stored separate. (So, closer to coffee harvest season meant little or no dark roast coffee.)All this separation of coffee and connoisseurs wanting their preferred coffee led to a lot of comic situations (which are mostly chauvinistic, because they were ignorant of the extra work it caused the women).Then the cooled beans would be stored in airtight biscuit tins for use over the period of about a year. The tins belonged in the attic. Small quantities were transferred into small containers for daily use stored closer to earth. The picture below from Amazon UK has a square lid, but the ones I'm talking about had a small round opening in the middle of that square top.I can't seem to forget the sunlight shining through the “ventilator” on the back of this tin standing in the attic and creating a wonderful silhouette, with dust floating about in the beams of light on either side just as I woke up after my afternoon siesta at my grandmother's home. Maybe it was 5pm when I woke up and sat dazed staring up at the light streaming into the room and making me sweat a bit. Well… not happening again.That ventilator is another thing many youngsters won't know because of change in construction style. It was actually a very small opening near the roof of a house to allow hot air to escape. It would be right above a window mostly.My bad hand drawing on these digital screens is shown below.Anyway, back to the coffee. Coffee would be ground in those grinders or mills and only as much as necessary would be ground. The coarseness was also a preference, but I will keep it simple.The rest is usually common even today.","11,898 followers",Magda Selmeci,16.1K,7.2K,23.4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Without-revealing-your-age-what-s-something-you-remember-that-if-you-told-a-child-today-they-would-not-understand

25,"“Ever” is a very long time.But I think it’s exceedingly unlikely.FOLLOW THE MONEY, HONEY:The cost of maintaining a colony of a million people can only be managed in one of three ways:CHARITY:I think the “charity” a“Ever” is a very long time.But I think it’s exceedingly unlikely.FOLLOW THE MONEY, HONEY:The cost of maintaining a colony of a million people can only be managed in one of three ways:CHARITY:I think the “charity” angle will work for a while - and I think that scientific data about Mars is a kind of “product” that Earth will value - and I believe that space tourism will work for a while - until every rich person has been there and/or it becomes obvious that it’s not so great to go there and have to spend your entire vacation underground in order to avoid being irradiated by solar radiation - and that the six to eight month trips to get there and back are really kinda tedious.So I think we could maintain a SMALL colony (and I’m going with 100 people - because that’s the number the StarShip should be able to take in one trip) of scientists - and maybe a few artists.PRODUCTS:It seems very unlikely that there are any mineral deposits or similar things on Mars that produce enough value to pay the ungodly costs of shipping them to Earth. Truly - the cost of shipping gold bars to Earth is somewhere close to the price of gold on Earth - so there is no profit in it.The scientific knowledge is a product that could be paid for by (effectively) government-sponsored charity (much as the ISS is paid for) - it’s possible that a TINY amount of space-tourism will pay for more - and doubtless some more cash could be obtained by selling Mars rocks for $10,000 dollars (until everyone who can afford that has one) - then $1,000 dollars (until that market is tapped out) - then $100…and then we can’t ship them back to Earth cheaply enough and they have become about as exciting to people as owning a meteorite or whatever. Maybe a reality TV show set in the colony would keep it alive for a couple of seasons.But ultimately, all of those things depend on “novelty” - new science, new TV shows, super-rare gifts, etc.So there MUST come a time, when the novelty wears off - and the science tapers off - and nothing that comes from Mars has value.This has now happened with the ISS - and governments are talking about de-orbiting it just as soon as the various international groups who control it can agree on a date.SELF SUFFICIENCY:So the only REAL option of having a colony of (say) 200 or more people - is the third one…”Self Sufficiency”.With Mars, this is an exceedingly tall order.Firstly the idea of “terraforming” Mars is ridiculous. There is not enough CO2 to warm up the planet, not enough gravity, too much solar radiation, not enough nitrogen to form an atmosphere that plants can grow in. Fixing these problems using drastic measures like nuking things - or crashing asteroids into Mars are ridiculous - the sheer size of the problem means that it can’t happen.I’ve written at length about this in other Quora answers - and the answer is VERY clear - Mars cannot be terraformed…PERIOD.Some materials that humans need simply don’t exist there in enough quantity.Nitrogen, for example.For whatever reason - there is very little of the stuff on Mars. But we need it as a component of the air we breath (80% of the air here on Earth is nitrogen). It’s also an essential part of plant and algae growth. Nitrogen fertilizer - either added by humans - or “fixed” by bacteria in the roots of legumes - is essential. Without it - no plants.So the Mars colony will need a StarShip load of nitrogen to be delivered. They’ll have to recycle it aggressively - but no recycling system is perfect - so it’ll gradually decline and they’ll have to order more of it.That’s just one example.So no terraforming. What about simply living in domes or underground and living off of what Mars already has?A tough one is oil. Sure, the colonists won’t need oil for energy, they can use solar and nuclear energy - but oil is the source of a HUGE number of industrial chemicals - and without it, making plastics (for example) is almost impossible.Making steel without a coke/coal is almost impossible…the list goes on.Without a supply of cheap plastics and steel - it’s going to be VERY hard to do things like make spacesuits, have seals to keep air where it’s needed, etc, etc.But even making or maintaining the most trivial thing will be hard.Consider your Mars rover - the one you used to drive to the solar panel arrays to remove the dust from them once a month.It has ball bearings - those little balls that go inside the hubs of wheels.Those are made from a special kind of hard-wearing steel that has lots of chromium in it.Will the Mars colony have chromium mines? Chromium refineries? Will a tiny colony the size of just one city be able to go to where the nearest chromium deposits are, maybe thousands of miles away dig up tonnes of the stuff and ship it to their chromium refinery?How will you even build your chromium refinery? Lots of trucks and bulldozers will be needed - all of which need a lot of ball bearings - which you can’t replace because you don’t have a chromium refinery.Ack!Then, when you’ve got your supply of chromium steel - how do you make those perfectly round balls?Well, here on earth (amazingly) they spray liquid steel droplets from a nozzle at the top of a tall tower, and as the droplets fall, they become spherical and cool and harden before they reach the bottom of the tower!!Doing this on Mars will be possible - the tower can be shorter because of the reduced gravity - but will the temperature gradient be right? This is all new technology. Making accurate ball bearings on Mars is going to be different - and in ways that we can’t know well enough until we get there and start doing these things.But, again, a million person colony will start needing bearings very soon after getting started certainly within a decade - and having enough people to go figure out where the chromium is - and how to mine it - and how to refine it - and how to mix the right kind of steel - and how to form those perfect spheres…and ALL of that has to happen before Earth gets bored with shipments of novelty Mars rock gifts - and the fifth season of the “Who gets voted out of the airlock” reality TV show.The ball bearings thing is just one example - think about screws, rivets, glass panels, wires (where’s the copper? what can we make a flexible insulator from?)…and ALL of those things have to work perfectly - or your hydroponic food factory and your oxygen recycling system will fail for want of a ball bearing or a replacement wire - and that will kill off all 1 million people long before a replacement can come from Earth 2 years later.Even in the early stages - when stuff is still coming from Earth. If some vital part of a critical device fails - you can’t just order a replacement and have it FedExed to Mars. It may take over two YEARS for the part to get to you.You’ll die within a month if some critical machine stops working.Then think about medical supplies…what if some disease breaks out and the vaccine isn’t available on Mars yet? What if bacteria in the colony get resistant to all of the antibiotics you brought with you? You don’t have the sophisticated chemical plants to make new antibiotics - so you’re all dead.The more you think about what self sufficiency REALLY means - the more you understand that our high-tech industry rests on lower-tech industry - which in turn rests on gigantic refineries and mining activities which we’ve had running for 200 years.Our technological base here on Earth REQUIRES 200 years of pre-existing infrastructure.But we made that infrastructure using only low-tech equipment.On Mars, you need sophisticated recycling and hydroponics systems just to stay alive - so you don’t HAVE 200 years of low-tech existence to build up your infrastructure.BOTTOM LINE:For there to be a Mars colony - it MUST, for 100% certain, have some kind of long-term sustainable reason for Earth to continue shipping ball bearings, screws, wire, plastic, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc.That means that you MUST find a viable product that you can send back to Earth that’s worth more than the cost of shipping it there.That’s a hell of a stretch.OTHER OPTIONS:RICH PEOPLE:Some people have suggested that very rich people who control huge business empires here on Earth would live on Mars - since their contribution to Earth is in expertise - they could control their vast business interests from Mars and spend the billions that they earn on shipping stuff to maintain their colony.That might work if Mars was some kind of paradise where people would love to live - but it won’t be.The lack of gravity will almost certainly mean that you have to spend HOURS each day on treadmills and such - just as the astronauts on the ISS do. The solar radiation means that you won’t be living in some amazing habitat with views out over the Martian landscape - you’ll be living in a lava-tube tunnel - only seeing the light of day rarely in order to keep your radiation dosimeter in the green.The novelty would wear off…and running a business empire with horrible bandwidth limitations and a 45 minute communications delay would be exceedingly hard.ASTEROID BELT MINING:So the idea here is that Mars is closer to the asteroid belt than Earth - so if you want to mine the riches of the asteroid belt, you’ll need a base on Mars.BULLSHIT.So firstly, humans can’t cope in zero g. So mining asteroids must be a 100% robotic activity.The claim is “Well, Mars is closer to the belt - so less transmission delay to the robots - so being on Mars is a good idea.”…but that’s fuzzy thinking.The asteroid belt bodies have an orbital period of about 4 years and are roughly 2.5 AU from the Sun - Mars has an orbital period of 2 years and is about 1.5 AU from the Sun.So - if you are mining an asteroid at some point on the belt - then for some of the time Mars will be just 1 AU away - and Earth will be somewhere on it’s orbit from 1.5 AU to 2.5 AU away. But for other periods (years at a time) Mars will be on the opposite side of the Sun from your asteroid…4 AU away!!In fact, on average, Earth will be closer to any specific asteroid than Mars is.If communications delay to the belt is the reason for going to Mars - then it would be better to have a base on Mercury - on average, it’s closer to your mining outpost than either Mars or Earth.This is kindof a silly argument anyway - if we’re mining asteroids - then we’re using robots that are sufficiently autonomous that they can work for hours to days without supervision…and if something goes wrong, then we’re going to be out of action for a few years - so there must be replacement parts, replacement robots, etc, etc on our actual asteroid.Another theory is that it requires less delta-V to get from Mars to your asteroid than from Earth…which is true - on those relatively rare times when the Mars/Asteroid transfer orbit is optimal - but those intervals may be 5 years apart…it’s not that great for rapid repair missions.Worse still - because of the lack of things like ball bearing manufacture on Mars - you STILL have to get most of your “stuff” from Earth…so going VIA Mars doesn’t make much sense.So…asteroid mining base…busted.CONCLUSION:Although I desperately wish it were possible - it really does seem like a large Mars colony can’t happen.The ONLY thing that will make it viable is if somehow we find an invaluable product that Earth needs and cannot make by itself - that Mars can make (and SHIP) at a cost that Earth can pay.The size of the Mars colony depends sensitively on the quantity, value and shipping costs of that product.Right now - there is no such product that ANYONE has come up with…and until they do, there cannot be a colony.",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,6.7K,9.4K,195.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Without-revealing-your-age-what-s-something-you-remember-that-if-you-told-a-child-today-they-would-not-understand
