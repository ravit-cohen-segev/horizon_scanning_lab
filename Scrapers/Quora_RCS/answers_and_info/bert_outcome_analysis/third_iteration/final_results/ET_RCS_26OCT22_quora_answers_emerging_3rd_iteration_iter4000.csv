She turned to me and said, “Do you have washing machines in Scotland?” Obviously, I was forced to admit, that no we didn’t. Instead we just went down to the river and bashed our clothes off rocks to clean them.2) Transport - I spent two weeks in the lovely town of Columbia. Missouri. There I amazed the locals with my insistence on using a strange outmoded form of transport known as “walking”. Locals would slow down as they passed in their modern cars, pointing and laughing. To them, it must have been like watching a live action version of the Flintstones.3) Voting – would you believe it, but in the UK we still vote by drawing a little X next to the candidate we want to vote for. No sign of the advanced electronic voting they have over in the states. Indeed, we are so old fashioned that we haven’t even outsourced our voting to the Russians yet!4) Guns – It may be hard for an American to believe but almost nobody in the UK owns their own guns. This means that if we have to rise up and overthrow our own government (currently seems like a good plan) then we will be armed with nothing more than some particularly well sharpened sarcasm.Still, perhaps one day we can hope to be as advanced as the US.

My dad provided for all of us (wife and two daughters) on his income alone, and although we weren’t rich, we never went without.But I think things were probably starting to slowly unravel even then. We just didn’t feel the effects as a society right away. America was still recovering from Vietnam, and Watergate put a damper on Americans’ cheerful optimism. Then came the energy crisis, the hostage crisis, and Reagan’s trickle-down economics. Yeah, he made Americans feel good about themselves again with his “morning in America” sloganeering, and he did help bring down the Iron Curtain, but I think the ’80s was the beginning of when we saw our influence over our elected leaders start to slip away from us and into the hands of lobbyists and corporations.It’s really been downhill from there. Needless wars, stagnating wages, offshoring of once good-paying factory jobs, a widening gap between rich and poor, erosion of personal and civil liberties, mass surveillance, militarization of the police, increasing homelessness, propagandized media, mass incarceration, mass shootings, the crippling cost of higher education and healthcare, the glorification of war and empire, the breakdown of the family, having to work multiple jobs to make ends meet… we’ve lost the script.Trump’s election is a symptom of what’s happening to us. It was a cry for help from people in places like the Rust Belt who have seen their small towns decimated. The factories that employed generations of families have gone overseas, leaving nothing behind but low-paying service jobs and despair. For the first time, Americans don’t believe that their kids will be better off than they are. It’s little wonder that drug abuse and suicide are peaking in so many parts of the country. People don’t know how to process the pain, the hopelessness, so they do anything they can to numb it. And when they can’t numb it, they end it all.It doesn’t help us to dismiss the Trump phenomenon as some kind of petulant temper tantrum by a few disaffected racist white people. It goes far deeper than that. A healthy, thriving society would never have elected him, and we would do well to ponder what went wrong and what we can do about it. He’s not the disease; he’s only a symptom. But one thing’s for sure, and I hope that both voters and the opposition party learn this and learn it well: Propping up the establishment status quo isn’t going to fix what’s wrong, because the “status quo” is the predatory capitalism that’s slowly killing us. We have to stop putting profits before people.There’s no denying that our government is run for the benefit of the wealthy and powerful, and all you need to do to see the result is look around you. We’re choking the life out of our own people. And those in power have us bickering with each other, because they know it distracts us from whatIs it too late to turn things around? I don’t know. I hope not. But the truth is, every nation declines and every empire crumbles. Maybe it’s simply our turn. Maybe our moment in the sun is over.

9,"Men had been contemplating powerful machines to replace or augment horses for many decades, even centuries. By most accounts the first man to try to replace the horse with a motorized engine was by a French army captain named Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot. He built an artillery carrier for the army in 1769 that used a steam boiler attached to a piston and a ratchet. The machine was only capable of making about 2.5 miles an hour and was too unstable for the work it was designed to accomplish but it marked a major advance in technology.

The machine was only capable of making about 2.5 miles an hour and was too unstable for the work it was designed to accomplish but it marked a major advance in technology. The machine exists today in theAfter Cugnot there were many attempts to build automobiles and other motorized vehicles using steam, electricity and various gasses. While much work was done over the years on the internal combustion engine, the first automobile to use one was built by a Swiss inventor, Francois Isaac de Rivaz in 1807. It was crude and clumsy but it was able to slowly move great weight up a grade at slow speeds using coal gas or hydrogen and oxygen. It was seen as a curiosity because by that time the potential of steam engines was becoming more understood. As the decades went on, development of steam vehicles would surge ahead in Europe and America.While they didn’t lead to greater things, Joseph Bozek, a Czech engineer developed one of the first steam cars in the world in 1815 and Thomas Blanchard, a Massachusetts inventor built a successful steam wagon in 1825 but then activity seemed to cease in this area. The “coach and four” still ruled the roads and rich men invested in horse breeding and better carriage “roadsters”. Horse auction sites were built in New York City until 1906.Railroads were becoming the focal point of steam transportation and grew rapidly at the expense of road construction. As much as anything, the lack of good roads throughout most of America hampered the development of road vehicles: it was hard enough in a coach with multiple horses, let alone finnicky and fragile machines powered by steam. However, as developments in steam powered cars seemed to fade developments were being made in electricity and electric cars. Electricity had been known about for centuries but it’s application was a mystery. What was it good for? Robert Davidson was a Scottish chemist and inventor who had made significant sums developing yeast cultures and had money to spend on other inventions, including electric motors. He developed all manner of electric machines but was not taken seriously. Eventually he developed the first electric vehicle, called the “Galvani” in 1842. It was a train that pulled a heavy load of seven tons at about four miles per hour for a significant distance and proved the concept. However, the locomotive used massive, heavy and non-rechargeable zinc-acid batteries. This made the concept impractical and it was seen as a threat by the steam engineers who observed its operation and they later swarmed and destroyed the machine. It was the end of electric trains and cars until French physicist and inventor Gaston Plante invented the rechargeable lead-acid battery in 1859 similar to the technology used to start cars today. It’s this more than anything else that made the possibility of electric vehicles potentially practical. They would soon start to appear in cities around America. However, at about the same time in New York City, Richard Dudgeon invented a practical steam vehicle in 1855 and drove it hundreds of miles through the streets of New York. The vehicle was very loud and clumsy, emanating smoke and steam from all over and scared New Yorkers so much that the city banned its use and he had to move outside the city to continue his experiments. Remarkably, he was able to achieve something like 28 miles per hour in his vehicle, an astonishing achievement at the time. In nearby Boston, Sylvester Roper built a better, more practical steam car in 1863 as well as a steam motorcycle. He regularly achieved 20 miles an hour in his vehicle and from there steam cars and advancements began to suddenly coalesce and appear all over the world.Developments in electricity began to accumulate. In 1855, a Massachusetts native, Charles Grafton Page built a full sized electric locomotive that ran between Washington, DC and Bladesburg, Maryland. When he went to demonstrate his train with passengers, the ride was fraught with breakdowns and calamities and it ended his experiments with electric trains. But the increasing use of tunnels in urban settings were calling out for methods other than steam to drive passengers through those tunnels without asphyxiating them.Finally, in Germany, Werner von Siemens introduced the first practical electric train for passengers in 1879 and from there the introduction of trains in cities like London and Baltimore showed that it was possible. Electric trains were becoming a reality but they were not taking horses off the street. That eventuality happened thanks to the work of American Frank J. Sprague who developed the electric trolley motor. Until his system trolleys were pulled by teams of horses. In New York City in 1888 there were over 6000 horses pulling trolleys through the streets of New York City. That was the year that Sprague introduced his first trolleys in Richmond, Virginia. He followed up with the first subway in America, built in Boston in 1897. New York would follow in 1904. The electric trolley was better, more reliable and faster than the horse drawn trolley and spelled their doom. The last horse drawn trolley in New York was removed from service in 1917.The real impact on the future of New York and the world was being formulated based on the work of many inventors and culminating with the efforts of Nikolaus Otto who perfected the four-stroke internal combustion engine in 1876 leading to the development of the gasoline automobile. There had been many attempts by other inventors along the way who added and contributed to the development of the automobile engine we know today, but it was the product of Otto that achieved such success that automobile engines even today are called “Otto Cycle Engines”. However, Otto was not interested in attaching his engine to movable “automobiles”. He built stationary engines. Instead, the first practical four-stroke car was introduced by Karl Benz in 1879. His device was a velocipede, a three-wheel tricycle. It took the work of English inventor Edward Butler in 1884 to refine the engine and introduce gasoline as the primary fuel. This was a critical breakthrough in automotive evolution since up til that time gasoline was considered a waste by-product created during the “cracking” or refining of oil and kerosene and was dumped by the refiners or burned off in pits. Now, there was an added use for the liquid, one that would change history. Gasoline was so effective for cars that refiners could not keep up with the demand and the lack of the fuel retarded automobile sales and gave additional life to electric and steam vehicles. It wasn’t until 1913 that the refiners developed the methods of producing gasoline in the quantities sufficient to meet demand. Butler also added modern day inventions including the spark plug, the ignition coil and carbeurator. The time of the true automobile had arrived. By 1900 there were various manufacturers of automobiles around the world, centered mostly in Europe, but Karl Benz was the leader, selling about 4500 automobiles per year. The cost of the original three-wheeled “velocipede” machine was about $150 dollars for the first models, about $4500 today. From now on, refinements in cars would only make them increasingly desirable and competitive to the horse, whose days were numbered.But in America, the internal combustion automobile was a rarity compared to in Europe. Benz had even begun exporting cars to the United States and they were far ahead of the few, crude American examples then available. The patent for the automobile in America was granted to Henry Selden, who in 1879 delivered an automobile eight years before Karl Benz in Germany. However, he chose not to build cars but to license the techniques and his patent was delayed for 16 years, allowing Benz to claim the title of “father of the automobile”. Selden would lose his patent in a battle with Henry Ford in the early 1900s and he faded into obscurity, but only after delivering the first semi-trailer truck in 1899. He had made patented his vehicle on the “Brayton Engine” the American courts recognized Otto’s engine as the motive force for automobiles. Meanwhile, two brothers, Charles and Frank Duryea built the first practical gasoline cars in America in Springfield, Massachusetts. As a portent of things to come, it was a Duryea automobile that was involved in the first automobile accident in New York City in 1896 when a car driven by Henry Wells struck a bicyclist and broke his leg. Wells spent the night in jail. The term “backseat driver” arose from the way the Duryea’s built their cars, with the steering tiller in a raised backseat while the passengers sat below the driver in the front. Over time, the expression changed in meaning but at that time it was almost an expression of class and status because to have a “backseat driver” meant you have a chauffeur. But gasoline automobiles would have to survive the challenge of other types of motive power before reigning supreme.",16 followers,William Murphy,666,2.3K,11.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/When-did-innovation-in-automobile-technology-peak-in-the-United-States
