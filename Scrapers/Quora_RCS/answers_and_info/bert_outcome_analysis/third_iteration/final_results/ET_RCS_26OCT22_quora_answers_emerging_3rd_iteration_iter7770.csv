1,"What is the safest form of nuclear power we have today?The safest form of nuclear power we have today is the radio-thermal isotope generator or RTG. Unfortunately, it is very inefficient at converting nuclear energy into electricity and is only used in outer solar system spacecraft where solar is too dim.Another answer to the question involves the sunshine on the planet from the WHOPR® fusion generator, vulgarly known as the sun.","29,977 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.7K,250M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-safest-form-of-nuclear-power-we-have-today

3,"Nuclear Fusion is a beautiful process and has great promise as a potential worldwide energy source.Fusion has some distinctive advantages over traditional methods of energy production and one of fusion’s strongest advantages is safety.Contrary to popular belief that fusion is impractical and “always only 30 years away”, mankind is currently in possession of a practical fission-fusion technology.Devices that produce 95% of their energy from nuclear fusion (and 5% or less of their energy from nuclear fission) have been demonstrated and are routine technology (first-time every-time and whenever yNuclear Fusion is a beautiful process and has great promise as a potential worldwide energy source.Fusion has some distinctive advantages over traditional methods of energy production and one of fusion’s strongest advantages is safety.Contrary to popular belief that fusion is impractical and “always only 30 years away”, mankind is currently in possession of a practical fission-fusion technology.Devices that produce 95% of their energy from nuclear fusion (and 5% or less of their energy from nuclear fission) have been demonstrated and are routine technology (first-time every-time and whenever you want it).Here are a few reasons why fusion should ultimately be- Only tiny amounts of fusion fuel are inside a fusion reactor at any one time. Continuous operation of a fusion power plant is maintained by continual refuelling with the fuel mixture (deuterium-tritium or deuterium-deuterium), so the fuel inventory in the plasma chamber at any time is gram quantity or less and sufficient only for about one minute of operation. The ITER tokamak will contain only grams of fusion fuel as it runs. A NIF laser fusion capsule contains only about 0.17 milligrams of Deuterium-Tritium fuel-No greenhouse gasses produced-No reactor core meltdowns and no fission product decay heat burn downs (Chernboyl, Three Mile Island, Fukushima incidents cannot happen)-No mining of fuel is required for several forms of fusion as deuterium fuel is extracted from water. For first generation deuterium-tritium fusion; lithium must be mined and then exposed to a source of neutrons to form tritium fuel.-Billions of years of fuel available on earth (versus a few thousand years for uranium based fission and a few hundreds of years for fossil fuels)-1/1000ths of the radioactive waste of fission power (typical nuclear power). Nearly all materials become activated to some degree by energetic neutron bombardment. Neutron reactions in DT fusion reactors will inevitably create radioisotopes. The principal radioactive materials present in a DT or DD fusion reactor will therefore be tritium and neutron activated structural materials surrounding the reaction volume.-Radioactive waste remains radioactive ~20 years versus hundreds of thousands. DT fusion reactors would burn and require storage of significant quantities of tritium, a moderately radioactive nuclear isotope of hydrogen. Tritium gas is hard to secure and small leaks in reactor tanks and plumbing could result in some loss of tritium to the environment. Tritium decays while emitting weak Beta radiation and under most circumstances is not highly hazardous to humans. The deuterium-deuterium (DD) fusion process, dispensing with tritium as a fuel and the requirement for Tritium storage. DD fusion does however produce Tritium as part of the DD fusion reaction, but this Tritium does not tend to accumulate but is immediately burned in place inside a DD fusion reactor.-Fuel for energy would no longer be a geopolitical issue (huge benefit for humanity)-No nuclear weapons from waste products (again, huge benefit for humanity)",0 followers,Jackson Morrissett,23K,302,1.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-safest-form-of-nuclear-power-we-have-today
4,"Q:Sure. If climate change is as bad as we're being told it will be, then nuclear energy needs to be in the mix to address it. It is the only truly ""carbon-free"" method for generating electricity that can be scaled to the levels we'd need in that case.Wind and solar farms can be in the mix, but they don't scale (there's only so many places where they can be located), and they also release CO2 into the atmosphere (when the sun isn't shining, for example).Hydro-electric plants are also truly ""carbon-free,"" but as with wind and solar, there are only some maQ:Sure.

Nuclear waste can be managed, and new designs are significantly safer than those that have had catastrophic failures (Three-Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima). Some can even use the spent nuclear fuel from older reactors.There's no reason not to use nuclear energy where it makes sense to do so.","4,773 followers",Fergus Mason,6.5K,6.6K,28M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-safest-form-of-nuclear-power-we-have-today
5,"By “feasible” I’m going to guess you mean capable of commercial electricity generation. We’ve already discovered everything we need to know about the fusion part of the process and have been doing fusion for decades. There are a number of engineering challenges to do with the confinement of very hot plasmas, the generation of strong magnetic fields, the extraction of fusion byproducts, the embrittlement of “first wall” materials by neutron bombardment, the dissipation of heat loads running to tens of megawatts per square metre, and more.

(Not all challenges apply to all fusion concepts as there are many different approaches). But actually, solutions to practically all of the issues are either known or well advanced.Really, the single remaining challenge is the behaviour of the plasma under very extreme conditions. Plasmas carry their own electric currents and magnetic fields which interact with those of the containment. High temperatures introduce chaotic instabilities that cause the plasma to twist like a demon. The trick is to make the plasma behave stably for long enough to do useful amounts of fusion. The plasma behaviour is very difficult to observe as the instabilities grow from microscopic scales, and very difficult to simulate with computer models. Neverthless, great strides have been made with numerical simulations.The trouble is, it’s very hard to predict when anyone will crack this final nut. Looking at nuclear fusion from the outside it can seem as if they’ve just been plugging away at the same problem for decades. But this really isn’t the case. Enormous strides are being made each year. Quite a number of commercial fusion startups claim to be within just two to five years of demonstrating breakeven fusion and then scaling up to commercial sizes. (Fusion rates tend to scale exponentially with machine size). Commercial fusion that actually puts electricity on the grid is definitely not earlier than 2030–2040 but we might be able to say that we are on a definite path to success well before that. (Or … things might never work out after all).",826 followers,George Dowson,4K,527,3.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-safest-form-of-nuclear-power-we-have-today
6,"Q.A. I assume you mean for producing electricity.I read a great quote from Andy Grove, warlord of Intel many decades ago, “gallium arsenide is the substrata of the future, and it always will be.”It appears nuclear fusion for power production is just like that.","220,645 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,783.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-safest-form-of-nuclear-power-we-have-today

9,We already have.We have just recently (2022) succeeded in controlling a fusion reaction from which we gained more energy than we put into it.The next step is to scale it up to practical use. This is going to involve a very big and very expensive machine. At least for the first few. Then we will have to work on scaling the machine itself down.Unfortunately I do not see fusion reactors ever being built within the United States.

10,"Yes, security is the first concern while building a nuclear power plant.Nuclear power plant likes commercial flight in a way: Both are the safest but most fatal. How to make it safer?

Generation 4 reactors are designs that are highly resistant to meltdowns. China has just started operation of a gas-cooled pebble bed reactor prototype. The heat resistant fuel pebbles tolerate much higher heat than current PWR reactors commonly in use. Temperatures that would melt solid Uranium fuel rods.China is trying to find the worlds best technology for nuclear power because it is planning to build over 50 nuclear reactors to meet its fast-growing energy needs. China is the worlds second-largest investor in renewable energy technology but renewable energy will not be able to meet its energy demands. China also is the worlds largest supplier of rare earth minerals that are vital for renewable energy technologies.China is also developing a Molten Salt Reactor, MSR, and a Traveling-Wave Reactor, TWR, prototype. These reactors are much safer than current reactors and produce much less waste. Actually both of these reactors can operate on nuclear waste as fuel. And the MSR can operate on mining waste.These Generation 4 reactors do not use high-pressure water cooling or solid fuel rods. They are also much easier to operate than current reactor types. MSR reactors can turn themselves off safely if they overheat, without need for external power or pumps. The liquid fuels can be completely drained from the reactor automatically and drained into a safe cooling tank. No accident like Fukushima or Chernobyl is possible.Generation 4 reactors may be a vital option s for low carbon energy in future.","43,461 followers",Misha Firer,4K,1.3K,133.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-safest-form-of-nuclear-power-we-have-today
12,"Unlike nuclear fission which has critical mass limitations and can only be built so small and only so large, nuclear fusion is nearly infinitely and continuously scalable for energy yield.With conscientious engineering, you can make Inertial Confinement He3 powered fusion reactors as small or as large as you like.The energy yield per shot achieved by an ICF fusion reactor can be adjusted by using more (or less) He3 fusion fuel per fusion shot.
