2,"As of yesterday it’s no longer “next”.First pig heart being transplanted into a humanYesterday, January 10th, 2022, marks the first time an organ from a genetically modified animal, a pig, was transplanted into a human. We don’t know what will happen, but the pig was genetically modified in a way that makes it unlikely the organ will be rejected by the recepient and pig organs in general are quite similar to our own.I hope the recipient lives a rich full life with his new heart of a pig.

Even if not, this is still a major step forward towards generating organs to order, without fear of rejection. Even if the heart is rejected and the donor dies, what we learn from the process will enable us to succeed the next time. I reckon this will become the mainstream way we get spare parts by the end of the decade in an optimistic scenario, by the end of the next decade in the pessimistic one.Either way, the moment is as groundbreaking as December 3rd, 1967, when the first human heart ever was transplanted, ushering the era of organ transplants of today. That patient died after 18 days, I hope this guy does better.","29,946 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,5.9K,7.7K,249.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-upcoming-technologies-in-IT-for-2018

Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party. Because radiation from nuclear accidents is apparently scarier than way more people dying of regular pollution constantly and the total annihilation of all life on Earth as the oceans boil away.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-amazing-upcoming-technological-advances-in-medicine
