0,"Well, we’ve had two Industrial Revolutions, the Sexual Revolution, the first and Second Feminist Revolutions, the American Civil Rights Movement (which was a revolution in everything but name), Stonewall, and the computer, digital media and internet revolutions, just to name a few.Now none of those were exactly bloodless or violence-free, but they weren’t bloodbaths like the American, French and Russian Revolutions.

1,"How does life make any sense without God?Sorry, but the tone of the question strikes me as really, really sad.Here’s Ed. Ed is a plumber because his father wanted him to be one. It isn’t something he particular enjoys: he would rather have been a lawyer. But he got into the plumbing business because he didn’t want to disappoint his dad.I think that’s sad. Here, I’m going to call it “Level 1 sad.” I think that Ed should pursue his own choice of careers. He can take his dad’s wishes as one factor, and add it to the host of other factors. He could then even decide that he wants to do what his dadHow does life make any sense without God?Sorry, but the tone of the question strikes me as really, really sad.Here’s Ed.

He could then even decide that he wants to do what his dad wants him to. (And that wouldn’t strike me as sad at all.)For Level 2 sad, we’ll change the scenario from “his father wanted him to be a plumber” to “Ed never met his father, but someone said that his father wanted him to be a plumber.” It’s sad enough when the person who raised you has too much input on what you’re going to do. It’s worse when you’ve never met this person, and still put that much weight on it.For Level 3 sad, say that Ed not only didn’t meet his father, but heard from someone what his father wanted him to be, while hearing from other people that his father wanted something entirely different. And heShould we add another level — Level 4 sad? Let’s. Not only did Ed decide what he wanted to be based on an interpretation that someone had of what his father wanted (although other competing interpretations existed), but he didn’t understand how else you would choose a profession. “How would choosing a profession make sense without our fathers’ input?”And that leads us back to the beginning. The tone of this question strikes me as really, really sad.

2,"No. In fact, most of us wouldn’t.Without modern refrigeration, water treatment, fertilizer synthesis, transportation logistics, electricity, and communication infrastructure, six billion of the world’s eight billion people die in the first year.Half of the nitrogen atoms in your body got there because of the Haber–Bosch process [ https://www.chemistryworld.com/features/a-fixation-with-nitrogen/607No. In fact, most of us wouldn’t.Without modern refrigeration, water treatment, fertilizer synthesis, transportation logistics, electricity, and communication infrastructure, six billion of the world’s eight billion people die in the first year.Half of the nitrogen atoms in your body got there because of the Haber–Bosch process [ https://www.chemistryworld.com/features/a-fixation-with-nitrogen/6076.article ], a chemical fixation process that makes nitrogen in the air biologically available as fertilizer. Synthetic nitrogen fixation now equals biological nitrogen fixation worldwide. There’s no way to get rid of synthetic fertilizer and feed the world.A lot of folks say “just use cow manure!” Ha ha ha no. Cows do not fix nitrogen. The nitrogen in their manure comes from...",2 followers,John Nofsinger,6K,3.1K,14.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-improve-human-technological-development-without-engaging-in-warfare-of-any-kind-is-it-possible-to-have-a-revolution-without-violence-or-death
3,"I think that humans are the least violent and most empathetic of all higher life forms. We bemoan our violence, but it has been reduced to such a minuscule level that we consider it to be mind-riveting news when 14 people are murdered in a distant place. No chimpanzee would consider that news.We consider ourselves violent only because our standards have grown so high. When is the last time you have seen a real fight, between two of your neighbors or acquaintances? When is the last time you engaged in a fight, one in which you were seriously trying physically to hurt another person?Maybe your rI think that humans are the least violent and most empathetic of all higher life forms.

To me, that just emphasizes how repulsive we consider true violence to be.","26,856 followers",Lee Ballentine,11.1K,15.7K,52.8M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-improve-human-technological-development-without-engaging-in-warfare-of-any-kind-is-it-possible-to-have-a-revolution-without-violence-or-death

5,"There is some reason to believe that we are almost there. The number of conflicts and the number of people dying in them has been going down fairly sharply for the last century.The more we learn to deal with one another through commerce, by mutual exchange to mutual benefit, the less reason we see to initiate a conflict.The thing that may divert us from this course might be Islam. It is an ideology founded on war and conquest. The more it takes over Western countries, the greater, or worse, the chances that the overall trend might be reversed.There is some reason to believe that we are almost there.
