There are many types of jobs considered ""knowledge based"", from data entry, to based word processing to data science.The last 10 years have seen a massive wave of outsourcing of IT jobs to cheaper locations. And yet, IT jobs have both grown steadily in the US (As tools get commoditized and techniques become more common place and less complex (e.g., desktop publishing, or searching the internet), those jobs get outsourced, and more complex jobs are created. 10 years ago, HTML programming was a highly skilled job, and Oculus and iWatch didn't exist. Today, its completely different.I runWhat should a job seeker do? Never settle. We are past the time when employees settle into 30 year careers at single organizations leaving their professional fate to someone else. Make sure that you are always learning, always being challenged professionally and always growing. Its more important than ever for professionals to take their career into their own hands and make sure that they are getting the skills and training they need to evolve as the economy does.

This signals a new set of advances in neutrino telescopes — opening up yet another new type of telescope.We’re finally finding ourselves in a position to unify 100 years of new physics — and for the first time since Galileo, we have introduced entirely new types of telescopes.Entire regions of our universe that were previously off-limits to us, are now opening up.Gravitational waves, neutrino observations and cosmic rays are offering us a new way to look at the universe.This is aWe are entering a new era of astrophysical observations — if that’s not a “breakthrough”, I don’t know what is!","358,783 followers",Sean Kernan,1.4K,5.6K,726M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-recent-tech-trends-that-are-interesting

Other forms consist of a helix revolving in a fixed cylinder or a helical tube wound around a shaft.The Archimedes Screw is still used today in some limited applications (usually electrically-powered), and can range in size from a quarter of an inch to nearly 4 meters (12 feet) in diameter. A large screw or banks of screws may be used to pump rainstorm runoff or to lift water or wastewater, for example.2.THE BATTERY-The Baghdad Battery, sometimes referred to as the Parthian Battery, is a clay pot which encapsulates a copper cylinder. Suspended in the centre of this cylinder but not touching it is an iron rod. Both the copper cylinder and the iron rod are held in place with an asphalt plug. These artifacts (more than one was found) were discovered during the 1936 excavations of the old village Khujut Rabu, near Baghdad. The village is considered to be about 2000 years old, and was built during the Parthian period (250BC to 224 AD). Although it is not known exactly what the use of such a device would have been, the name ‘Baghdad Battery’, comes from one of the prevailing theories established in 1938 when Wilhelm Konig, the German archaeologist who performed the excavations, examined the battery and concluded that this device was an ancient electric battery. After the Second World War, Willard Gray, an American working at the General Electric High Voltage Laboratory in Pittsfield, built replicas and, filling them with an electrolyte, found that the devices could produce 2 volts of electricity. The question remains, if it really was a battery, what was it used to power?3. THE CALENDAR-Research carried out last year on an ancient site excavated by the National Trust for Scotland in 2004 revealed that it contained a sophisticated calendar system that is approximately 10,000 years old, making it the oldest calendar ever discovered in the world. The site at Warren Field, Crathes, Aberdeenshire – contains a 50 metre long row of twelve pits which were created by Stone Age Britons and which were in use from around 8000 BC (the early Mesolithic period) to around 4,000 BC (the early Neolithic). The pits represent the months of the year as well as the lunar phases of the moon. They were formed in a complex arc design in which each lunar month was divided into three roughly ten day weeks representing the waxing moon, the full moon and the waning moon. It also allowed the observation of the mid-winter sunrise so that the lunar calendar could be recalibrated each year to bring it back in line with the solar year. The entire arc represents a whole year and may also reflect the movements of the moon across the sky.4.STEAM ENGINE-Heron Alexandrinus, otherwise known as the Hero of Alexandria, was a 1st century Greek mathematician and engineer who is known as the first inventor of the steam engine. His steam powered device was called the aeolipile, named after Aiolos, God of the winds. The aeolipile consisted of a sphere positioned in such a way that it could rotate around its axis. Nozzles opposite each other would expel steam and both of the nozzles would generate a combined thrust resulting in torque, causing the sphere to spin around its axis. The rotation force sped up the sphere up to the point where the resistance from traction and air brought it to a stable rotation speed. The steam was created by boiling water under the sphere – the boiler was connected to the rotating sphere through a pair of pipes that at the same time served as pivots for the sphere.Some old steam engines are still used in certain areas of the world and in antique locomotives. However, steam power is still heavily used around the world in various applications. Many modern electrical plants use steam generated by burning coal to produce electricity.5.Earthquake Detector 132 A D -Earthquake Detector 132 A D According to court records of the later Han Dynasty, a seismograph was created by the brilliant inventor Zhang Heng (78-140 AD) in 132 AD. Its function is to determine the direction of an earthquake. In 138 AD, this instrument indicated an earthquake occurring in Longxi a thousand kilometers away. It was the first time that mankind to detect an earthquake. Modern seismographs only began development in 1848 in Europe.6.Paper Money 9th century A.D.-Paper money were first developed by the ancient Chinese, who started using folding money at the end of the 8th or beginning of the 9th century AD. Paper bills were originally used as privately issued bills of credit or exchange notes. A merchant could deposit his cash in the capital, receiving a paper “exchange certificate” which he could exchange for metal coins in other cities.Thanks for scrolling,Sandip bhatnagar.",1 follower,Nick Deakin,1.4K,2.9K,3.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-recent-tech-trends-that-are-interesting

But Brin and Page knew all along that if they could dominate search they’d monetise somehow.And that has been how they’ve approached everything they’ve gone into. They don’t care about the money as the money will eventually come when they dominate.Chromebook, Android, Google Docs, YouTube, Gmail, their leadership in self-driving cars are all seeds that Google have planted, that will make them huge returns at some point. They’re patient.I mean, despite going in well after Apple into the smartphone arena, they now run 82% of the world’s smartphones. An absolutely incredible achievement. They knew this was a space they had to dominate at whatever short-term cost. And just imagine how much money they’ll make from this in the coming decades.The fact that Google trades at a broadly similar PE to Microsoft just shows how short-sighted Wall Street can be…",UNKNOWN,Ali O.

Create a source of income in order to create minimium viable product that deliver 80% of the value with only 20% of the features. In order to do that you may need to start another product or a simple business, basically hustle or save whatever extra you make to have enough money to pay for your MVP.Third, now that you started your dream business with an minimal viable product, try to make it a success without asking for loans, or investments from anyone. Just let your product prove itself in the market and use its revenues to support itself. At this stage you need just a market viability proof so you can have statistics and numbers in your brief case.Fourth, baby you are ready to talk to investors, start with friends and family, then angel investors and finaly talk to venture capitalists . Use the money to get the rest of your 80% of features and expand your marketing and distrbution network, grow your team and so on.

He would bring one home, tune it using an app and a tool he got on eBay, sand and stain the wood if needed, then put it on Facebook for sale with free delivery. The free delivery piece is what seals the deal for big items since most people have no way to move large/heavy things, so he would make that the first words in the title. The last piano he did sold for $900. The one before that was $1,300.Big items like that are the fastest cash (kitchen/dining tables, sectional couches, pianos, etc) but small items work too. Just do what you can. There’s a ton of free stuff out there you can pick up and sell, and it costs you nothing but the trip. Start there and start saving whatever you make, then start a business more suited to your skills once you have some cash saved up.","135,477 followers",Hector Quintanilla,1.9K,1.2K,88.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-most-ancient-technologies-or-methods-that-are-used-even-today

After some days Alice denies the existence of such document and claims that Bob has forged that piece of paper. Bob would nowIf you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.I would try to explain Blockchain in the most simple way I can.Let us assume that there are two people Alice and Bob. Alice borrows some money from Bob and Bob writes it on a piece of paper signed by Alice. After some days Alice denies the existence of such document and claims that Bob has forged that piece of paper. Bob would now find it difficult to prove that Alice actually owes him Money.In this example Alice and Bob are two nodes.Now assume the same scenario, but among a society. So there are ’k’ pair of people transacting with each other. And the only proof that each pair has, is that piece of paper. Looking at this scenario, one person, Kate comes up with a solution. She suggests maintaining a common notebook of transaction for entire society. She designates town hall to be the place where every exchange takes place. In the common notebook, every pair writes the transaction and then the notebook is kept safely. People rejoice and accept Kate as their leader.That notebook can be called a database.But one day, somebody spills wine on the notebook. This makes the notebook illegible. Taking the advantage of this situation, Alice again denies taking money from Bob.This is the problem databases face - single point of failure.Irritated by this problem, Kate comes up with another solution. She suggests maintaining multiple notebooks. She chooses some trustworthy people from the society and gives them a notebook each. Now every time a transaction or exchange takes place between two people, Kate instructs some of those trustworthy people to mention the transaction in their notebooks. So the data is repeated in the notebooks. Now, even if one notebook is destroyed, chances are that all the data regarding transactions are still present in the combination of other notebooks.This is a distributed database and multiple notebooks are the multiple nodes.But next day, another problem arises. Kate has a friend named Bert who owes a lot of money to some people in the society. He asks Kate for help and she agrees to help him. She instructs all the people with the notebooks to remove the entries where Bert received money. Now Bert doesn’t owe any money based on the notebooks.This is the problem with distributed databases - they are centralized. That means one single entity owns all the nodes/resources and can make changes as they deem fit.When the people from the society come to know of it, they remove Kate from the leadership.* They decide to keep a notebook each. Every time a transaction is made between any two people , all the people from the town come together and mention it in their respective notebooks. So if there are n people in the society, then there are n notebooks and no one person controls the overall representation of the transactions. This is decentralization.","31,155 followers",Phillip Remaker,1.7K,11K,78.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Information-Technology-Will-US-knowledge-based-jobs-disappear-as-wealth-continues-to-get-more-concentrated-at-the-top-0-01-between-now-and-2025
