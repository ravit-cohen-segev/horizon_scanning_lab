Mahabharata additionally gives particular descriptions of these weapons received from extraterrestrial beings. From a systematic view descriptions of gods and demigods defined in Mahabharata are aliens some distance more advanced in technological know-how than us.",162 followers,Prasad Chavan,2K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/Which-era-speaks-about-advanced-technology-in-Mahabharata

Live telecastAs Dhritarashtra was blind but wanted to know what was happening at the battlefield, Krishna gifted Sanjay with ""Dibya Drishti"", so that he could see a “Live Telecast” of “Kurukshetra” and describe that to Dhritarashtra. “Dibya drishti” is analogous to modern television set in the sense that Krishna could not give it directly to Dhristarastra but needed Sanjay.3. AstrasThe function of an Astra is more than that of a missile. It is said that Astras used in Mahabharata probably might have also used technologies of emitting most dangerous rays like Gamma and others, which have exceptional powers to penetrate. Some Astras returns to the person who launches it, for instance, Krishna's Sudharsana Chakra. This may be similar to the reusable missiles which the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) is working on.Astras were also used for defensive purposes similar to a Tesla Shield which is used to destroy the enemy Astra coming towards it. The modern ""Tesla shield"" discharges electrical energy and any incoming physical object which hits the shell receives an enormous discharge of that energy and instantly vaporizesSource: Google","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Which-era-speaks-about-advanced-technology-in-Mahabharata
