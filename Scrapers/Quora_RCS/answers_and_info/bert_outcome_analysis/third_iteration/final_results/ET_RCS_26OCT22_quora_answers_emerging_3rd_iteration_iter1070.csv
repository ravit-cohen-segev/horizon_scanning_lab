2,"This answer is slightly unrelated but very appropriate.NEVER hitch yourself with a technology. Technology keeps changing. Drastically and very fast.

That’s 6 months gone for you and you’re back to zero.Instead. Step a level down and figure out the general direction of that and similar tech that you work in or want to work in.

Such people are infinitely more valuable. And they don’t need to change every time the direction of tech changes.Lastly a very appropriate thought for you.A software “architect” is not an appropriate term as it conveys rigidness and firmness in whatever is built. Something that doesn’t change. And you know how wrong that is in tech.A software gardener is more appropriate. You plant the seeds and nurture how and where things grow. Where appropriate you cut them off. Or grow them somewhere else. Or grow faster. Or grow slower.

All those values work together for a car that’s catered to your health and wellness. Safety and awd go together. Outdoorsman likes health which also goes together. And, it’s a premium product which also makes sense.So, I think brands and products will always specialize for a specific market segment based on lifestyle. There is the health and wellness premium brand bose. There is skullcandy which is the fun lower tier brand. There is sony which is premium and masstige. Also, higher end European brands, and beats by dre which is mainstream popular premium brand. House of marley and these small brands are the hipster type of brand. Essentially, if a person likes health and wellness they want it exactly like Bose. If they want the mainstream popular brand they want beats by dre. If they want a more tech focused product they want Sony.In summary, I think brands are becoming more specialized and tailored to people’s lifestyle and deep needs and wants. Health and wellness is satisfying. Hipster lifestyle is satisfying. Luxury is satisfying for a richer or aspirational person. And, popular premium, and performance brand is another type of person. They want it tailored to them.

Autonomous taxi service will make the service more cost effective than owning your own personal vehicle in many cases.  Once driver costs are removed from the equation.  Vehicles can self-park at various locations throughout the city based on demand an be dispatched quickly.  Such vehicles will eliminate deaths due to drunk driving and minimize fuel expense by driving the vehicles in optimized route selection and acceleration/braking pattern.  The vehicles will never get tired and properly maintained they should be capable of near 24 hour transportation.  Insurance and liability costs for the taxi companies will also be greatly reduced.Such vehicles will provide entertainment during the drive and allow commuters to link to their home or office computers systems to conbuct personal business in route.  Some commuters in heavily congested urban areas will gain back two hours of time to either sleep, conduct business or enjoy media giving many of the same benefits as telecommuting.House computer systems will also monitor energy consumption and generation. Solar energy panels will become much more cost effective as higher csunlight conversion efficiencies are obtained using various nanotechnology breakthroughs.  Battery technology will also improve from nanotechnologies allowing the excess solar energy generated during the day to be used at night and possibly removing the need for residential dependency on the power grid altogether.House computers will be capable of monitoring non-violent offenders remanded by the courts to home incarceration.  Monitoring bracelets currently in use will be able to track the prisoner between home and work release making sure that they do not make any sidetrips and violate their conditions for parole.  The constant location monitoring will make it impossible for them to commit a crime without their presence at the crime scene being known.Media for prisoner rehabilitation can be provided to the house and it can monitor whether the prisoner has watched and been tested on the materials deemed necessary  for their rehabilitation.Teachers will transmit homework assignments and educational materials to the home computer systems.  Children will be able to relisten to material they had problems with or work ahead to later lessons to gain rapid promotion.   Student will have access to other course materials not enrolled in to audit the course or take entirely through the home system to gain credit for taking the course.","6,473 followers",Michael Soareverix,28.3K,373,6.6M,2011,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-up-and-coming-technologies-that-will-be-big-in-the-next-2-3-years
