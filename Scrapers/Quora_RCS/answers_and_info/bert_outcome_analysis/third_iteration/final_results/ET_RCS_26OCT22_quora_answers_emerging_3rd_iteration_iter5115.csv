Why not? There is nothing literally magical about the squishy 400–1,500 gram human brain, which generates consciousness.(2)Do robots have the potential to perceive, that is, to see, hear, smell, taste, sense temperature, and so on, more effectively than humans?Yes, of course. There is nothing to prevent a designer from giving them the eyes of an eagle, and so on.(3)Do they have the potential to think more effectively than humans, more quickly and accurately?Yes, of course.(4)Do they have the potential to act more effectively than humans, in building infrastructure, for example?Yes, of course.(5)Do they have the potential to be more robust and free of injury than humans?Yes, of course.(6)Do they have the potential to be free of aging, as it were, by way of frequent, routine repair?Yes, of course.(7)Do they have the potential to enjoy existence more than humans? I cannot write “enjoy life,” for they are nonbiological.Yes, of course.To answer your question, then:Yes, of course. Why not?The key, I think, is this:To generalize on my remark about the human brain, there is nothing magical about the tissue that constitutes a human, and there is no reason to suppose that an agent otherwise constituted, not of that tissue, cannot do better by any reasonable set of criteria.Humans are not magical, period!","105,668 followers",Dave Consiglio,566,6.8K,91.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Will-robots-rule-the-world-in-the-near-future-Why

5,"I get this question quite often- I run an AI powered college and career readiness platform, which has lots of automation to make counselors’, students’, and districts’ workflows a lot more efficient. However, the word “automation” has a very negative connotation in education, more so than in other industries.

When you mention automation in a school district (it obviously depends on the culture of the community), it is as if you are not only destroying their entire Maslow’s hierarchy pyramid from the very bottom, but also destroying their students’ future by taking away all the jobs. I get where the sentiment comes from.My answer is aIt is as simple as this, will you teach your students to do monotonous tasks like data entry or low skilled tasks that can be automated, in hopes that they can eventually add value to society in exchange for a stable pay? I think the answer is no. So why should teachers or counselors hang on to “jobs” that can be automated instead of focusing on the future and gain the skill sets that machines can’t do? After all, it will be better for our students, if they can derive more value out of each experience they have from a specialized entity. A simple example is that it is way more efficient and error free to have a computer program handle error checking for a graduation plan, as opposed to having an overworked counselor go through a stack of papers late at night after a long day.Now, I’d like to talk about the concept of value, and how that is related to the “In short, humans are irreplaceable, but tasks and jobs are automatable.

It’s clear that AI is much better than humans in terms of forwarding sensible and practical and pragmatic ideas that increase the objective power of military along with sensible decisions or choices for the sake of military purpose.However, we need to think ‘Why does diplomacy exist and why is it really important?’ The main reason why this exists is that it’s impossible to resolve various of crises by using diplomacy, rather than using physical forces. It’s the way diplomacy operates and why this is regarded one of the most important tasks in the area of international relations.Humans can communicate and understand one another.
