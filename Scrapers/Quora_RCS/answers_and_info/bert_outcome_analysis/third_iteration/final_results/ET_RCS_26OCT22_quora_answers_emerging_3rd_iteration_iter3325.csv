However, it is expensive and Jake is only a retired military grunt. He’s a nobody and certainly doesn’t have they money for the procedure. The military benefits he receives apparently doesn’t cover this type of (presumed) expensive procedure.You may recall a conversation Jake has with Colonel Miles Quaritch, where the colonel basically says, “You help me by spying on the Na’vi and I’ll fix your legs when we get back to Earth.”“We take care of our own,” he says.I hope I got that right.

Jake Sully is an American citizen, so like the jokes of “If Breaking Bad was set in the UK” his problem is that he likely has no insurance, funds or benefits that would cover the cost of restoring his ability to feel anything below his pelvis. Along with the generous pay by the company from doing this highly experimental mission, Quaritch is offering to pull strings back home as long as Jake works with him.Sure they have that cool mind transference technology that makes the titular avatars possible but my money is that tech being highly experimental and so specific to the project on Pandora that nobody is doing it back at home. Usually whatever toys the military is using will be offered to civilian markets 5–10 years later and it’s fairly concrete the avatar technology was R&D’d specifically for operations on Pandora.","5,986 followers",Johan Torres,698,1.8K,24M,2018,https://www.quora.com/In-the-movie-Avatar-isnt-it-a-bit-absurd-they-have-spaceships-and-very-advanced-technology-where-they-travel-the-stars-and-yet-they-have-one-of-the-main-characters-in-a-wheelchair-Shouldnt-they-have-conquered-paralysis-by-now

One of the main themes that lingers throughout the entire series pertains to this:All of the elements are equally balanced amongst one another.How both TLA and TLoK show this can be questioned a fair amount. The fact that from the beginning of TLA we are shown that the fire nation was this rising empire set to destroy the balance of the world gives us the impression that there is a tier amongst the elements, but that’s not the case, as is explained in multiple episodes. Here are a few for example:1: Zhao with the moon spirit:We see Admiral Zhao literally holding the moon hostage, while the gaang pleads with him on how important the moon spirit is to ALL three nations. We then see General Iroh come as well, also urging Zhao that he doesn’t fully realize how significant it would be if he were to eliminate the moon spirit, fearing that it would knock the world off balance.2: Iroh teaching Zuko about the four elements:This is probably the best episode in explaining why each element is just as significant as the other one. Here is exactly what Iroh tells Zuko.FIRE: The Symbol of Power(force)“Fire is the element of power. The people of the Fire Nation have desire and will and the energy and drive to achieve what they want.”EARTH: The Symbol of Substance(durability)“Earth is the element of substance. The people of the Earth Kingdom are diverse and strong. They are persistent and enduring.”AIR: The Symbol of Freedom(detachment)“Air is the element of freedom. The Air Nomads detached themselves from worldly concerns and found peace and freedom.“WATER: The Symbol of Change(adaptation)“Water is the element of change. The people of the Water Tribes are capable of adapting to many things. They have a sense of community and love that holds them together through anything.”Zuko questioned why Iroh was telling him these “Avatar sounding” things, and as Iroh puts it perfectly:“It is important to draw wisdom from many different places. If you take it from only one place, it becomes rigid and stale. Understanding others, the other elements, and the other nations, will help you become whole. It is the combination of the four elements in one pe...",0 followers,Christopher Abrahams,11.5K,7.3K,22.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/In-the-movie-Avatar-isnt-it-a-bit-absurd-they-have-spaceships-and-very-advanced-technology-where-they-travel-the-stars-and-yet-they-have-one-of-the-main-characters-in-a-wheelchair-Shouldnt-they-have-conquered-paralysis-by-now

8,"Sports Illustrated did a study some time ago (the study probably isn’t on the internet) comparing different popular North American sports to try to determine which was most difficult to play. They decided baseball was the most difficult, and hockey was the second most difficult.I disagree. I agree that hitting in baseball is the most difficult act in sports - even the best hitters are rarely above .350 (they get a hit 35% of the time they are at bat, not including walks). But otherwise the skills needed in baseball are skills that most good athletes can acquire without much difficulty IMHO.AnoSports Illustrated did a study some time ago (the study probably isn’t on the internet) comparing different popular North American sports to try to determine which was most difficult to play.

But otherwise the skills needed in baseball are skills that most good athletes can acquire without much difficulty IMHO.Another answerer here suggested that hockey is easy because the stick is an extension of one’s hands. It isn’t. Ever tried to receive a pass in hockey? I played casual hockey for a few years and I still can’t receive a pass at speed. I’ll admit that my hand-eye coordination is at best average but it’s a more difficult skill than it looks. Don’t believe me? Try it. In a game. With opponents trying to check you and take the puck from you.Yes, the playing area is small, but the speeds are high. Skating is the fastest human non-mechanical activity. Connor McDavid is one of the fastest skaters in the NHL (if not the fastest). He was clocked at 40.9 km/h - 25.5 mph on his second goal in the Oilers’ opening game this season (2019 - 2020). The speed makes everything far more difficult.Hockey demands athleticism, quick reflexes, and intelligence. Specifically - superior hand-eye coordination, strength, size, oxygen processing capability, and intelligence. Hockey players are very well rounded athletes (they must have many talents, not just a couple). I’m fortunate to have Elias Petterson playing for my home team - he can juggle while riding a unicycle. I can ride a unicycle but I can’t juggle. Doing both at the same time is very difficult but he makes it look easy. And those skills translate into an increased ability to knock down an errant pass to his stick. Good skills to have, since hockey rules prohibit hand passes by skaters to anyone other than themselves.I went to a charity hockey game in (about) 2005 - ex-NHLers against an Edmonton city police hockey team. I assume that the police team wasn’t out of condition. Yet they looked busy and sometimes frantic and the exNHLers looked like lazy lions. The exNHLers looked like they were only playing at half speed and anytime the puck came to within the arc of their stick, they received it.One more clue: go to a junior hockey game (players aged between 16 and 18) and notice how frequently snow is cleared from the ice surface (especially in the corners) - they clear it basically at every stoppage in play. The snow is from players’ skates sliding sideways across the ice and thus creating the snow instead of carving the ice as the most skilled players do. Go to an elite men’s hockey game (NHL, Swedish Elite League, etc.) and there’s almost no snow on the ice during periods.Great athletes make the difficult look easy.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/In-the-movie-Avatar-isnt-it-a-bit-absurd-they-have-spaceships-and-very-advanced-technology-where-they-travel-the-stars-and-yet-they-have-one-of-the-main-characters-in-a-wheelchair-Shouldnt-they-have-conquered-paralysis-by-now

Just like iron (and mild steel) rusts, any metal can oxidize. However, aluminum oxide is impenetrable to oxygen. Which means, if you make a thing out of aluminum, and then the surface of it oxidizes, the inside will remain completely pure. There will be only a thin layer of aluminum oxide over an interior that is pure aluminum.I chose aluminum because (unlike iron) heat, gravity, and pressure, are not enough to purify aluminum.Frank Duncan's answer to How is the aluminium purified?To summarize: the ore (called bauxite, for some reason; which is a mixture of aluminum oxide and iron oxide, and sometimes other stuff mixed in) is dissolved in sodium hydroxide. The aluminum oxide dissolves, but the other stuff doesn’t. Then some chemical stuff is done to make the aluminum oxide precipitate out of the solution. Then the aluminum oxide is put into a chamber with two carbon electrodes, and a very strong DC current is run between them. The electricity causes the oxygen in the aluminum oxide to move and bond to carbon from one of the electrodes, forming CO, which is then further oxidized into CO2.I go into all of this detail to show that it is absolutely, completely, totally impossible for any combination of lightning, volcanic activity, or anything else, to make pure aluminum. If we dig up even one single aluminum item, that would prove that ancient people were as advanced as us.“But what if they just didn’t use aluminum?”. Nope. Sorry, any advanced society would ALWAYS use aluminum. How many aluminum items have you been within 20 feet of in the past week (even in Coronavirus quarantine)? I would guess over 1,000. Because aluminum is REALLY useful. Immensely, unbearably, accept-no-substitutes useful. I would risk saying that any society which does not use aluminum is not actually advanced at all.And, as I said above, aluminum does not rust away. If there were advanced ancients, there is 100% certainty that they would have made things out of aluminum, and those things would still exist. We would be digging them up.But, even with all of the lots of digging that modern humans have done, for mines, for building foundations, for tunnels, for underground utilities, etc, we have never found a single piece of ancient aluminum.Now lets talk about plastic. If aluminum is useful, plastic is 10x more useful. Think about how many plastic items you have in your house right now. That isn’t an accident. They are there because you needed a tool to accomplish a certain job, and plastic was the best material anyone could make that tool out of. (Don’t think that an Aquafina water-bottle is a tool? Storing and transporting water is a job, and it is impossible for a human being to do without some type of container, like a clay jug, or an iron pot, or a plastic bottle. Why do you think we are no longer using clay jugs or iron pots?)And, if aluminum is durable, plastic is 10x more durable.If ancient societies were advanced, they would have left piles like this behind, for us to find. Not a bottle here and there, huge mounds like this.Plastic is just too useful to not use.People have been using bio-plastic for for over a thousand years. The three major sources are sumac lacquer, beetle lacquer, and cow horn.Of the three, cow horn was the most easily available, and decently useful, but not good enough. If you boil a cow’s horn in water, it become soft, and you can bend and shape it, and then it will harden again when it cools. But you can’t pour it into a mold.Sumac lacquer is made by boiling down the sap of the sumac tree, the problem is that this releases a horrible neuro-toxic gas. The technicians who did this suffered from horrible chronic pain, and gradually increasing paralysis, until they eventually died young. But the material was so valuable that people did that job anyway! Once you have boiled the sap down enough, you have a type of plastic which can be used to make all kinds of useful things, and reheating it to melt it after initial boiling is way less poisonous.Beetle lacquer, also called shellac, is made from the egg nests of the female lac beetle. She secrets this substance to lay her eggs in. The nests can be scrapped off of the trees that they are laid on, and melted with heat, to make a useful plastic. If you wait until the baby beetles hatch before you scrape up their nest and melt it down, you will have a limited amount of shellac for an unlimited amount of time. But in the 18th and 19th century, global demand for plastics grew so great, the people started harvesting lac nests before the baby beetles had hatched! The species was almost driven to extinction.Then petroleum plastic was invented, and the poor beetles were spared. Today their numbers have fully rebounded. Some amount of shellac is still harvested, for restoration work, and historical reproductions, and for people who just really like making things in the old style. Almost all of what is now harvested is used as finish for wood furniture.But there was a time when it was used for hundreds of different applications.An object made from any of these types of bio-plastic can last for 1,000 years… if you keep it dry, and out of direct sunlight, and don’t cook it. But if you bury such an object in the ground, or let it sit out in a yard, or try to store it anywhere in a tropical climate, then it will rot away in a few years.But petroleum plastic is forever. The plastic bottle that you just drank 20oz of Pepsi out of could still be in existence when the sun explodes. You think that “diamonds are forever”? Ha! A diamond is a mere blooming flower, fading before the frost, compared to a plastic gateraid bottle. Or electrical wire insulation, or pair of cheap sunglasses, or… the list could go on and on. If your romantic partner wants you to get them something that will last “forever, just like our love”, do go for a diamond, go to Home Depot and pick up 6″ of insulated electrical wire. If your partner actually appreciates the joke, they’re a keeper.All of this is to say, if ancient cultures had been advanced, they would have made a lot of stuff out of plastic, and most of it would still exist. But not only have we never dug up a single piece of ancient aluminum, we have also never dug up a single piece of ancient petro-plastic. Not one.This answer has already gotten REALLY long, and I haven’t even talked about concrete (Advanced civilizations make things that last forever.

(THE CITY WALL OF NANJING, built 600 years ago, was the first line of defense for the founding capital of the Ming dynasty. Originally 22 miles long, it was built with 350 million bricks, most of which have survived centuries of weathering.Many kinds of materials have been used over the years in masonry mortars, and the technology has gradually evolved from the single-component mortar of ancient times to hybrid versions containing several ingredients. Beginning in 2450 BCE, lime was used as masonry mortar in Europe.Sticky RicePerhaps because of the absence of natural materials such as volcanic ash, hydraulic mortar technology was not developed in ancient China.The earliest record of this technique can be found in an encyclopaedia, theThis use of gummy grains in Chinese concrete as an adhesive is not entirely surprising. Cooked rice was first boiled into a paste, then blended with sand and lime, a substance produced by heating limestone.Scientists have long been fascinated with this unusual formula, and in recent years, different teams have conducted studies to better understand it. Researchers Jiajia Li and Bingjian Zhang spent six years collecting 378 samples of ancient mortar from 159 sites throughout China, dating from the Taosi phase (2300-1900 BC) all the way to the late Qing dynasty (1644-1911).Parts of Nanjing’s city wall are held together with sticky rice mortar. (One notable sample, from a 2000-year-old tomb in Jiangsu province, turned up what the researchers say is the oldest known trace of sticky rice mortar.Pyramid-shapedSticky rice is sweet, and augments savory dishes such asMortar samples from ancient constructions were analyzed by both chemical methods (including the iodine starch test and the acid attack experiment) and instrumental methods (including thermogravimetric differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, and scanning electron microscopy).Mortar samples from halls and the garden of the famed Forbidden City, built in the 15th century, tested positive for the starch.Animal blood might sound like a grisly substance for building walls, but it was a perfectly normal additive used by several cultures. Historical recipes written in French, Italian, and English have detailed ways to mix oxblood and lime mortars.Tiger Hill Pagoda - WikipediaConstruction workers were a disposable commodity when it came to building the wall. It’s estimated that as many as 400,000 people died building the wall, earning it the sobriquet “longest cemetery on Earth.”Many other organic additives favored by the Chinese helped repel water. Oil samples from 87 sites, contained tung oil, a common waterproof seal for wooden ships.Researchers found sugar in the mortar of Suzhou’s Tiger Hill Pagoda. (Great design is often the result of thinking beyond form and function. Philosophy, the researchers posit, might be one poetic inspiration for these fusion pastes:“Ancient Chinese people advocated a view of nature often termed ‘heaven-and-human oneness. The use of agricultural, forestry, and animal products in building materials reflected architectural aesthetics that sought to integrate architecture and nature.”After the Song and Yuan dynasties, the recipe of sticky rice mortar matured, being utilized in the famous Forbidden City in Beijing, a stretch of Great Wall built during the Ming Dynasty, the Chengde Mountain Resort, the Eastern Qing tombs, and the Qiantang River wall built during the Ming and Qing dynasties..Fujian Tulou (“earthen buildings”).(The Fujian Tulou (literally “earthen buildings”) are famous for their durability. Giant multistoried homes capable of housing close to 800 individuals and built with wood and fortified with mud walls were constructed between the 15th and 20th centuries.Incredibly, structures built with sticky rice mortar have survived more than natural erosion. A Ming tomb, of the minister Xu Pu and his wife, was nearly damaged by a bulldozer when found in 1978, but it was “so firm [the vehicle] could do nothing about it.”Although clearly effective, these revolutionary adhesives fell out of fashion in the late Qing dynasty. China’s first cement factory opened in 1889 in Hebei province,Shouchang BridgeBut researchers still see potential in these ancient formulas, especially to stabilize historical sites. Due to high quantities of salt, cement is detrimental and incompatible (being too strong and rigid) with traditional lime-based mortars.In Xichang, Sichuan Province, a restoration projectEvery day, the builders put 500 kilograms of glutinous rice on the boil, and then mix this starchy alternative with a few other ingredients, such as limestone, to form a mortar which will hold the wall together. It’s estimated that the entire project will require an impressive total of 50 tons of rice, in all. At the site of construction, five giant pots are heated over coal, and workers must keep stirring the rice inside these pots to prevent it sticking, as they haven’t invented non-stick crockery of these proportions yet.Researchers and conservationists from the Getty Conservation Insitute have combined the ancient technology of sticky rice with relatively new nanotechnology to develop an innovative treatment for historical sites.",13 followers,Vishal Upadhyay,9.5K,52,717.9K,2020,https://www.quora.com/In-the-movie-Avatar-isnt-it-a-bit-absurd-they-have-spaceships-and-very-advanced-technology-where-they-travel-the-stars-and-yet-they-have-one-of-the-main-characters-in-a-wheelchair-Shouldnt-they-have-conquered-paralysis-by-now

On example is the technology that existed then. They have been many discoveries that determine that the ancient Greeks, Romans, and other civilizations had devised numerous technologies to accomplish day-to-day work. From refrigerators for keeping ice cool in the hot desert to cups that could change color, we bring to you 10 incredible ancient technologies that will just blow your mind.1. By 400 BC, Persian engineers had mastered the technique of storing ice during summers in the desert.Yakhchal or icehouse (exterior), Meybod, Iran. Image Credit:During the winters, the Persian people used to bring ice from nearby mountains and store them in pits they created in the middle of the desert. The ice pits, known as “yakhchal,” were one of the most ancient refrigerators known to mankind. They were also used to keep food cool and healthy during the intense summers.On first glance, the structure looks like a large dome made from mud brick. Some of the structures were as tall as 60 feet. Below the dome lies a large underground space with excess storage area. The underground space was as large as 5,00 cubic meters. The underground space was connected to a “qanat,” or wind catch. The wind catch consisted of multiple windcatchers that had the ability to bring down the temperature to frigid levels during the summers.Yakhchal of Yazd province/ Icehouse (interior), Meybod, IranThe wall of the dome used to be as thick as two meters. Moreover, it was made by a special mortar that was comprised of sand, clay, egg whites, lime, goat hair, and ash in specific proportions. The walls were resistant to heat transfer, thus keeping the insides cool. Also, they were impenetrable to water which helped to keep the ice and food safe. But what if somehow the ice melted a little bit? For such unforeseen circumstances, a trench was provided at the bottom so that the melted water could be caught and frozen again during the chilly desert nights. The entire structure was really well-thought despite being from an ancient era. (1 [ http://eartharchitecture.org/?p=570 ], 2 [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakhch%C4%81l ])2. The “Archimedes screw” is a hand-operated machine that can move water up using gravity. If reversed, it can generate energy by water moving down.Archimedes ScrewThe Archimedes screw was predominantly used for irrigation purposes in the ancient times. The machine was a screw inside a hollow pipe. The screw was initially operated by hand but later, wind energy was utilized. The technology exists to this day and is operated with the help of a motor. As the shaft starts to turn, the bottom end of the device scoops up water. this water is then pushed to the top of the screw via the rotating helcoid until it comes out from the top end.3. There is an ancient masonry technology in Mexico that allows bricklayers to build vaults and roof-type domes using only their trowel, without formworks or ceiling mounts.Tequisquiapan is a town located in the state of Querétaro Arteaga, one of the 32 federal entities of Mexico. The town is home to a generation of masons known as “bovederos.” These masons seem to have a superpower as they can build vaults and roofs of domes with just their trowel! For those who do not know what a trowel is, it is a small hand tool that is mostly used for digging or when applying concrete to bricks.So, these masons from Mexico do not need the aid of any support and build domes with just their trowels! The video above shows this gravity-defying act in action. These masons do not require any formworks or ceiling mounts. It is said that the technology has been passed on from parents to children from generation to generation. This is one of the ancient technologies that still exists today.4. The ancient Egyptians invented the ramp to aid construction processes.Ancient Egyptian ramp.The Egyptians are well known for their massive architectural structures such as pyramids. They normally make their structures quite tall and uniquely shaped. Such massive structures call for the use of ramps during construction. Ancient Egyptians have been known to invent ramps to be used to carry materials during construction. A ramp is just an inclined plane against a horizontal surface that enables people to overcome resistance. By applying a small force for a longer distance, the load can be carried to a height rather than applying intense force to lift or raise it vertically. The Egyptians were surely ahead in their time when it came to construction.5. The “Antikythera mechanism” is a 2,000-year-old computer developed by the Greeks. It was used to predict the position of the planets and stars in the sky depending on the calendar month.Antikythera mechanism.One hundred sixteen years ago, divers found came across a shipwreck off the coast of a Greek island. They inspected the site and discovered an odd-looking bronze item. Little did they know that this small discovery would change our understanding of human history.The structure had a series of gears made of brass and dials mounted on something that looked like a mantel clock. The structure had at least two dozen gears laid on top of one another with perfect calibration. Archaeologists came to the conclusion that this must be some kind of analog clock of the past or a calculating device. A debate went on for years until Princeton science historian Derek J. de Solla Price provided a detailed analysis of the device in 1959. His study revealed that the device was used to predict the location of the planets and stars taking into account the calendar month. According to Price’s analysis, the main gear would move to represent the calendar year, in turn, would move the separate smaller gears that represent the motions of the planets, Sun, and Moon. In short, when the main gear is set to the current date, the device would point out the location of the celestial bodies in the sky!In Price’s words, “The mechanism is like a great astronomical clock … or like a modern analog computer which uses mechanical parts to save tedious calculation.” The logic behind calling it an analog computer is that similar to a computer, the user can provide an input and get the desired output based on some calculations.6. A 1,600-year-old Roman chalice, the “Lycurgus Cup,” shows that Roman artisans were nanotechnology pioneers. They’d impregnated the glass with particles of silver and gold as small as 50 nanometers in diameter.Lycurgus Cup. Image Credit:This ancient jade-green cup appears red when lit from behind. Scientists believe that the Romans may have been the first ones to come across the colorful potential of nanoparticles by accident, but they sure perfected it! This amazing property of the Lycurgus Cup puzzled scientists for decades when the cup was acquired by the British Museum in the 1950s. It was not until 1990 that the mystery was solved.Researchers studied broken fragments of the cup under the microscope and discovered that the ancient Romans had created the glass with silver and gold particles that were ground to be as small as 50 nanometers in diameter. This was less than one-thousandth the size of a salt grain. This suggests that the Romans knew what they were doing, meaning they had knowledge of nanoparticles! The way it worked was when the light hit the cup, the electrons belonging to the particles of the cup vibrate in ways that alter the color depending on the position of the observer. So. when different liquids would be poured into the cup, the electrons would behave differently, and the color would change. This is exactly how home pregnancy tests work.7. Heron of Alexandria was the first to create a programmable robot to entertain audiences at the theatre. The device could move on its own and even change directions! He also invented the first vending machine, syringe, and windwheel among others.Hero of Alexandria was surely the “Tony Stark” of his time. Many of his creations were the first to have existed. He has been known to create the first vending machine, syringe, force pump, fountain, etc. He is also said to have created a windwheel operating an organ making it the first instance in history where wind energy was used to run a machine.But the most astonishing of all was the mechanical device that has been termed as the world’s first robot. The device was used to entertain the audience in the theatre. It had the ability to play by itself for almost ten minutes and was powered by a binary-like system of ropes, knots, and simple machines. The entire structure was operated by a rotating cogwheel that was cylindrical in shape. In the video above, the device has been recreated by New Scientist, a media company.8. The Hal Saflieni Hypogeum, built by the people of Malta and Gozo, has incredible acoustic properties. The structure is said to amplify voices dramatically with certain frequencies resonating enough to be felt through the body.The Hal Saflieni Hypogeum is a 6,000-year-old underground burial chamber located on the Mediterranean island of Malta. Archaeologists believe that this underground structure was built by the people of Malta and Gozo around 4000 BCE. It was used for the purpose of ritualizing life and death. The structure consists of a large network of cavities and corridors. But the thing that has attracted experts to the site is the amazingly unique acoustic properties of the underground chamber.Hal Saflieni Hypogeum.Amidst all the chambers and corridors, there exists a special chamber that has been carved out of solid limestone. This is the chamber that produces unique sound properties. Known as the “Oracle Chamber,” any sound made in the chamber gets magnified a hundredfold. Also, the sounds made in the chamber can be heard throughout the structure. According to William Arthur Griffiths, author of Malta and its Re...",427 followers,Rose Thomas,2.1K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/In-the-movie-Avatar-isnt-it-a-bit-absurd-they-have-spaceships-and-very-advanced-technology-where-they-travel-the-stars-and-yet-they-have-one-of-the-main-characters-in-a-wheelchair-Shouldnt-they-have-conquered-paralysis-by-now

For example Roman hypocausts were replaced by Saxon open fires, but hypocausts weren’t as sophisticated as modern central heating.

A seal of this precision would not be seen again until some time after the age of enlightenment. Its detail is comparable with early banknote plates (around the C18th CE). The section below is approximately 10mm in view size.No, these optical lenses…Similar dating, Mount Ida, Crete, ca 1400 BCE, however, this may be when the lenses were stored in the Caves of Minos. Made from precision ground rock-crystal (natural glass), see what I mean, with a dividing compass (callipers) one can create an arc to create a lens and critically measure the arc to improve; in this case: optics.Hang on a minute, maybe these white-hulled ships…Santorini (Thera) before the eruption of 1628 BCE. The reconstruction team thought they used flax linen cloth in pine resin (a natural thermoplastic) with limestone powder to make the hull white (a composite matrix) over a wooden frame. The reinforcement is shown inside and out, if the hull is compromised on rocks, it will delaminate, keeping the hull watertight to make landfall and repair, saving the crew, ship and cargo. Glass fibre composites were invented in 1950’s COMMON ERA. Flax is almost as strong in tension.No this…Later bronze casting currently in the Met Museum, NY, ca 700 BCE from originally Samos, Greece. It's the closest thing I’ve seen to what Daedalus’ glider may have been. An airframe! If the fabled account of Icarus is correct: the remains of his glider were found at IcariaWe have little idea of what technology the Minoan’s really had, most of it has decayed and is lost to time. The Athenians kept the white hull ship Theseus returned in, it was on display for centuries as a trophy of Athens increasing power. According to myth, Theseus tried to secure magnetite and got thrown off a cliff on Skyros, a source of Magnetite! Athens didn’t know how to make another white-hull, they fell out of use, it is sufficiently advanced that they were unable to reproduce it.A communication network across the Aegean? Well, they had one according to Homer, the fall of Troy was reported to Argos in a few hours using island fire beacons (Peak Sanctuaries which have line-of-sight between them and are present throughout the entire Aegean), e.g. a message relayed at a few hundred miles per hour using long-distance signals, fires at night, gravity cast flat mirrors called Labyrs (double-axe) in the day.Peak sanctuary above. Note all the measuring devices!Kit checkBlind embossing printing: Check. Money (Palace gold tokens): Check. Sewers, flushing toilets, interlocking clay pipes with injectors to remove debris, aqueducts, tunnels straight through mountains, hot and cold running water to upper stores. Check, check, check, check, check and check. Are you getting dizzy? All of these things are technically demonstrated in the mid second millennium before common era and were (largely) lost in Bronze Age collapse to be rediscovered often centuries and in some rare cases many millennia later.The fingers. The (Idaean) Dactyls:What is shown above is miltech from the Bronze Age and it makes advanced research agencies of today look like they are playing at it! We should have been on the moon at the beginning of the common era on this trajectory. An enlightenment had already happened before the common era, then an island erupted (1628 BCE), then the Mycenaeans invaded (1450 BCE), then Bronze Age Collapse (1225 BCE): the world had gone very badly wrong and took a different course…What can we not understand about Minoans?And if its prehistory, this…Oldest obsidian bracelet reveals amazing craftsmen's skills in the eighth millennium BCA short time after this, this…“Bird-man”.

The boss, is the thumb: Herakles (position), and likely the artist is referred to this on the first seal, the only people that would realize this are those with a lens inspecting the seal!This is all hidden in plain sight. The Dactyls are the Quartermasters to those perceived as Gods. They made the tools, machines, weapons and systems. One hand is male, the other female. They built the most extraordinary things: transformative technology and systems.Administration may be the glue of civilization, but it is the technology that increases efficiency and with that increased output. Without technology, we would never be able to support such truly huge populations of today and we would otherwise still be living in the stone age, all 7 million of us; three orders of magnitude difference to the actual population of today: 7 billion and counting.These technologies (particularly the old ones) are critical enablers: calendars, machines and platforms to facilitate increased trade in surpluses giving prosperity. Although old in this context is relative.Addison Jump asked for further details of the artifacts which are available here with references for further reading:","20,147 followers",Aitijya Sarkar,5.8K,209,11.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/In-the-movie-Avatar-isnt-it-a-bit-absurd-they-have-spaceships-and-very-advanced-technology-where-they-travel-the-stars-and-yet-they-have-one-of-the-main-characters-in-a-wheelchair-Shouldnt-they-have-conquered-paralysis-by-now

While shotguns have a wider bore diameter than most other small arms, they are volumetrically limited compared to signal pistols and grenade launchers, the shotgun’s more awesome big brothers. For that reason, I’m going to include potential future developments in those areas as well. Shotguns, signal pistols and grenade launchers are all pretty similar anyways, they all throw large projectiles at low velocities using relatively low operating pressures, the differences between them are simply a matter of scale.So where could I see shotguns and other related technologies progressing?Underbarrel shotguns for pistols:Source: (Guns in Movies, TV and Video Games [ http://www.imfdb.org/wiki/Colin_Firth ])Presently, shotguns are mostly used for door breaching [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door_breaching ] operations in the military. Essentially a serviceman takes a shotgun, places the gun against an appropriate portion of the door at an angle, then fires. A portion of the door gets destroyed by the shotgun blast and the serviceman kicks the door in. While specialized breaching rounds [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaching_round ] which break apart on impact are typically used for safety, it is also possible to use standard buckshot if expediency is imperative.The current M1030 breaching round used by US is made of powdered steel and wax. The M26 MASS used by the US Army has a 7.75 inch long barrel.Source: (M26 Modular Accessory Shotgun System [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M26_Modular_Accessory_Shotgun_System ])So I’d like to think it’s pretty well established that you don’t need a particularly long barrel to breach most doors. All that is necessary is reasonably wide projectile with a fair amount of mass. With that in mind, using a modular under barrel shotgun on a pistol could potentially put breaching shotguns in a more compact and convenient package for a lot of servicemen. Something like this:For the sake of the drawing, just imagine the H&K USP uses a Mil-STD-1913 rail.Pictured is a rough sketch of a 20 gauge break action modular accessory shotgun for pistols. To load it, the pink latch under the barrel is retracted rearwards and the green barrel assembly is pivoted upwards. After inserting a cartridge, the barrel is snapped shut. To cock the weapon, the purple spring loaded striker is pushed forwards with a pair of cocking tabs (not pictured) until it engages the yellow sear. When ready to fire, the blue trigger mounted to one side of the pistol’s trigger guard is unfolded. Simply pulling the unfolded trigger pushes the yellow sear assembly forwards and slightly upwards, allowing the striker to spring forwards and hit the pivoting orange hammer. The hammer’s fixed firing pin is pushed forward into the cartridge’s primer, detonating it and firing the weapon. To remove a spent shell, simply unlatch the barrel and pull the casing out using the cutouts on either side of the barrel. If the spent shell becomes stuck, a clearing rod or stick can be shoved down muzzle to dislodge the stubborn casing. If the weapon misfires, it can be recocked by simply pushing the purple striker forwards again.That’s just an idea for a super compact shotgun which uses the limited space available on a pistol’s rail. One potential variation is rotating the folding trigger assembly 90 degrees so it lies horizontal to the weapon’s frame and doesn’t interfere with the pistol’s trigger guard at all. A real engineer would make a CAD diagram of both designs. I’m not a real engineer and I use MS Paint so you only get one picture.So why 20 gauge? First of all, the ammunition is a little narrower than 12 gauge which should make it an easier profile for holsters to accommodate, the device isn’t terribly different in shape than many pistol mounted flashlights. Tooling for manufacturing 20 gauge is already common as well, so ammunition won’t be difficult for the US military to procure. 20 gauge is also about the most recoil you can expect anybody to handle out of such a lightweight weapon, though it shouldn’t flip vertically too much since the recoil would be pretty much in line with the shooter’s wrist. It also prevents servicemen from putting more powerful 12 gauge ammunition in the firearm and potentially damaging the device or breaking their hands. You have to worry about that sort of thing with some servicemen, accidents happen.With roughly a 4 inch barrel and appropriate ammunition, it should work fine for door breaching. But there’s another reason to pick 20 gauge. I happen to know that 14.5mm artillery simulators fit almost perfectly in 20 gauge shells.Source: (20 gauge Air burst ammo, three second delay. 5 round pack. Sold As Is. [ http://www.cdvs.us/20-gauge-Air-burst-ammo-three-second-delay-5-round-pack-Sold-As-Is--P714.aspx ])Source: (20 gauge point detonation ammo. Five round pack. [ http://www.cdvs.us/20-gauge-point-detonation-ammo-Five-round-pack--P715.aspx ])The existing simulators are spin fuzed so rifling in the last inch of barrel would be needed, but the more important part is that the artillery simulators already exist. That means the tooling and production lines for making the projectiles don’t have to be fabricated from scratch. From a system adoption standpoint, that’s a big win.In terms of tactical applications, the artillery simulators can launched into a room for disorientation like a flashbang or used similar to a concussion grenade. There really isn’t enough projectile volume to make an effective fragmentation grenade out of the artillery simulators, but there is certainly enough volume to make an effective white phosphorus munition [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_phosphorus_munitions ]. White phosphorus makes for an equally good smoke screening agent, inextinguishable fire starter, and antipersonnel incendiary munition.It’s also worth noting that the projectiles used by “12 gauge” Orion flares measure 14mm across making them suitable for a 20 gauge weapon. Again, that means existing tooling can be used to manufacture new ammunition. The signal flares don’t have a heck of a lot of volume for chemical payloads, but they work for their designated role of signalling just fine.None of this is revolutionary, but it does add a layer of flexibility to sidearms which isn’t currently seen.Extending the range and broadening the capability of 12 gauge combat shotguns:One type of ammunition which the US military should look back into is flechettes [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flechette ]. Basically they’re little steel darts. When fired from artillery and tank guns, they absolutely shred fleshy things. When tested in shotguns, they’ve often performed inconsistently. This is largely due to designers packing the artillery grade flechettes with their points oriented both backwards and forwards to fit more flechettes inside the shotgun shell. Ever try to play darts by throwing half your darts tail first? It’s really hard. Now imagine shooting darts backwards out of a shotgun; it’s a terrible idea but that’s exactly what most small arms manufacturers have tried to do when making flechette ammunition. The only company I’ve ever seen get flechettes right has been Sabot Designs LLC. The company uses a specialized sabot with thicker flechettes all in a point forward orientation.Source: (12 GA FLECHETTE SHOTGUN ROUNDS FLECHETTE SABOT AMMO [ http://www.antipersonnel.net/sdllc/005.html ])That particular design is worth emulating. Flechettes have good external ballistic performance out to 100 yards and produce minimal recoil for the user. The spread pattern is unlike buckshot or other shotgun ammunition since the flechettes spread rapidly after firing due to turbulence but then stabilize creating a pattern which expands very little thereafter. They also have good performance against Kevlar and other soft body armors. As for terminal performance, they cause lacerations more similar to knives or arrows rather than round wound tracks like buckshot. Flechettes aren’t ideal for every scenario, they possess miserable cover and barrier penetration capabilities, but they do allow a shotgun to flex into a somewhat longer ranged role where slugs would often be used without sacrificing the high hit probability enjoyed by buckshot. Flechette ammunition also weighs less per shell than lead based shot. This means flechette ammunition can be carried at a lower weight penalty to the user.Like the 20 gauge explosive shells seen above, 12 gauge combat shotguns can employ similar projectiles, albeit with slightly higher volume. One example is the FRAG-12 high explosive round (currently stuck in development hell along with its best friend the Atchisson Assault Shotgun [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atchisson_Assault_Shotgun ]).Source: (Auto Assault-12 (AA-12) Full-Auto Machine Shotgun/FRAG-12 High-Explosive Round Combo/Weapon System? [ http://www.defensereview.com/auto-assault-12-shotgunfrag-12-high-explosive-round-comboweapon-system/ ])I really want to like the FRAG-12, but its designers think both it and the AA-12 will revolutionize and fundamentally change the nature of infantry combat. They’re wrong. Instead of looking at the two as a package, the military could just field the FRAG-12 on its own since the ammunition is already compatible with existing shotguns in service with the US military. In addition to the applications and potential payloads for the 14.5mm artillery simulators, the “armor piercing” variant of the FRAG-12 lends itself to stopping light vehicles and penetrating some barriers at medium range, things generally reserved for heavier anti-materiel weapons. Remember what I said above about the modular accessory shotgun for pistols not being revolutionary but adding a layer of flexibility? The same applies here. The FRAG-12 simply doesn’t possess the physical volume to host enough explosive and fragmentation material to compete with the payloads of true grenade launchers, but it does increase the number of things a combat shotgun can do in any given environment.Expanding the roles of signal pistols and grenade launchers:To get some insight into the future development of grenade launchers, we should first look back a ways.The idea of dedicated grenade launchers more or less started around World War II. Rifle grenades of the time were inconvenient and really didn’t pan out. The Japanese Type 89 grenade discharger [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_89_grenade_discharger ], more commonly called the “knee mortar”, was one early example of a dedicated grenade launcher which enjoyed widespread use.Source: (Type 89 grenade discharger [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_89_grenade_discharger ])The knee mortar was a pretty darn good weapon. It was fast to load, could be used for both direct and indirect fire, and was potent against personnel.Near the end of the war, the Germans started producing grenade pistols. Simply put, these were 26.5mm signal pistols fitted with sights and padded stocks.Source: (German WWII Grenade Pistols - The Firearm Blog [ http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2010/05/20/german-wwii-grenade-pistols/ ])Source: (German Grenade Pistol Ammunition (WWII Tactical and Technical Trends, No. 40, December 16, 1943) [ http://www.lonesentry.com/articles/ttt/grenade-pistol-ammunition-kampfpistole.html ])Between those two concepts and the Rheinmetall [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheinmetall ] made 8 cm PAW 600 [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_cm_PAW_600 ] antitank weapon, the US military eventually employed the High–Low Propulsion system [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High%E2%80%93low_system ] for use in the 40mm M79 grenade launcher [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M79_grenade_launcher ] which came into use shortly before the Vietnam War. The High-Low system allows for fairly heavy projectiles to be launched from shoulder fired weapons with reasonably low recoil.Source: (M79 grenade launcher [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M79_grenade_launcher ])Source: (High–low system [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High%E2%80%93low_system ])Source: (File:40mm High-Low Launch System Drawing.jpg [ https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:40mm_High-Low_Launch_System_Drawing.jpg ])The system worked so well that it was also suitable for the underbarrel M203 grenade launcher [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M203_grenade_launcher ].Source: (M203 grenade launcher [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M203_grenade_launcher ])That said, the slide loading M203 kind of sucks since i...","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2016,https://www.quora.com/In-the-movie-Avatar-isnt-it-a-bit-absurd-they-have-spaceships-and-very-advanced-technology-where-they-travel-the-stars-and-yet-they-have-one-of-the-main-characters-in-a-wheelchair-Shouldnt-they-have-conquered-paralysis-by-now

Supposedly, this technology was used to help cripple the Iraqi air defense system when the US invaded.This was important to Cisco because we were working in security and cryptography and the NSA was forever trying to get us to corrupt our products so they could un-encrypt foreign transmissions on the fly. One time we were required to corrupt product that had been shipped to China and it started a major debate about our fiduciary responsibility to the country or to the customer. The issue was that if you sell a security product that you know is corrupted, you are knowingly committing fraud and are liable. As the Product Manager at the time I asked the NSA if they would stand behind us (and me as I might be personally liable) in court if we were discovered. Of course the answer from the NSA was “Hell no.”We were on our own. We then entered into a long debate about how to detect Easter eggs and other corruption introduced into security products unknowingly through another vendor’s corrupted hardware. The issue was never resolved but it should be known that our security source code HAD to be provided to the NSA in order to get FIPS certification and they made certain changes to it.So to answer your question, USA military technology is advanced far beyond anyone’s knowledge to describe the extent.On the other hand, the Chinese probably know more about our technology than we do since they perpetrated the greatest security breach in history by compromising the RSA key technology used by almost everyone in the world.
