0,Most military people don't body build like Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Being able to do quick explosive lifts is the opposite of what a modern infantry soldier needs.  They need to focus on being able to carry a battle load and carry it for an extended time while remaining combat-effective.  Endurance training is very important.

They have training, equipment and defense mechanisms for that.Fitness is stressed so you are in prime physical condition to undertake the training, utilize the equipment and fully operate the defense mechanisms to their maximum potential.With strength, discipline and stamina, your body can push through limits many others would crumble at.Unfortunately, there is no physical exercise to prevent death.

3,"Body-building is, IMO, a modern insane and narcissistic obsession. Many in the military think it makes them better at being in the military. OTOH, despite having had weight issues for much of my adult life, and joining ten years later in life than most do, I last longer without sleep than most of the gym rats, walk faster and for longer, have less effect from high altitude and adjust to altitude very quickly.

He goes down in the dust with a curse, and there's more bullets striking the ground all around him. He weighs 230 plus easily with his gear. Are you going to leave him there? Of course not. You make the pickup and carry him to cover.Now you're in close, block-by-block urban war. It's 140 degrees in the shade. You're operating on little to,no sleep. You've been at it for 12 hours or more when you storm another house, clear it in a terrifying few minutes where you expend a lot of ammo. Just when you think it's over, an enemy bursts out of a closet that someone forgot to clear with a live grenade, pin pulled, but hand still clamped on the spoon. He's closest to you.There is a child, hurt in the crossfire.

Where we know more details, the picture is larger, and where we don’t, it is very schematic and smaller. Like this picture, which I borrowed fromThis represents the hyperbolic plane, which is infinite, mapped into a (finite) disk. As you move towards the edge there are more and more details, so if you would advance only one step at a time, they become smaller and smaller, and you’ll never reach the end. We do this, just like we do with what we see: we map the entire sky on our small retina.And our representation is not only distorted, but approximate, inaccurate, even for what it’s in the circle of knowledge. And facing new data, we tend to weight more the data which confirms our previous picture, and to ignore that which doesn’t. When we find new pieces for our puzzle, we tend to keep only those which seem to match to what we already have. We are happy with vague matching, we cut the new pieces to fit the old ones and so on.The picture above applies not only to ignorant people who think they know better, it applies to experts as well. Even what all the experts in the world know, is very little compared to what reality is, and they tend to underestimate what is still to be known. Just like some religious cults proclaim the end of the world every once in a while, many experts proclaim the apogee of their field too soon. Like we all do when we estimate how long it will take us to complete a task.But what experts know is much more than the average guy knows, so I’m not saying is the same. 1000000 is much greater than 10, even though seen as percents from infinity, they both are zero.Having a larger circle means also a longer boundary, so experts tend to have better awareness of their own limits and of what’s beyond.When you get immersed in a domain of expertise, really immersed, like having contact with it daily, being among experts, you realize how little you know.

But thanks for subsidizing the cheap buffets, clean buses and excellent (free) street parties every summer.Next you have the issue of The Median Is Not the Message (Stephen J. Gould). This is one of those things you can tell most humans literally thousands of times, and then the next time they face it, it falls right out of their heads. If the average life expectancy is 40 years, this does not mean they all die between 39 and 41! You can have lots and lots and lots die just after/at birth and the survivors all hit a century. So that one you're seeing is very UNlikely to die at 40.Scale. OMG, this thing is amazing. It kills 99.99 percent of bacteria. Yeah, whatever, you still have millions left behind. We have 10,000 illegals trying to cross the border every day. Yeah, but at one border crossing you have over 100,000 crossing normally. Hire a few more clerks or pay for a little overtime. Done. Next! We spend millions on food stamp fraud! Ok, but we spend hundreds of thousands trying to stop it. All that money fed someone … good enough. Next! (I didn't look up the food stamp numbers.)Correlation is not causation. Drinking diet soda does not make you fat, taking insulin does not cause cancer and getting vaccinated does not cause autism. (Other than more fat people drink diet, and only living people get cancer or show signs of autism, corpses don't.)Prices don't care about costs, beyond most people not willing to pay more for something they can make for themselves for less … with all factors considered. If a burger costs 10 to make and the consumer will only pay 2. Not a good business to be in. But if it costs 2, and the consumer will pay 10, you're golden. You're not going to pay the fry cook more. (Now the consumer might pay more if they know the extra is going to their buddy back behind the grill, but that's because they VALUE it more, not because it actually costs more.)Helmets, seat belts, gun laws, sin taxes, drug laws, save lives! Yes, they do, but so does banning fire, sharp objects, private automobiles and mountain climbing. Under a certain noise level, ‘public safety regulations’ have no real effect except to the individuals involved … which is where all the gnashing of teeth comes from. “But if you can save one life!” No, it doesn't work like that, but the math is ultimately even more awkward than proving the first item above. Things that affect a lot of people in one way are beneficial, such as food inspections, public health measures and public policing are generally useful. Things that affect a very small number, relatively speaking, such as seatbelt laws, (which really only affect the person wearing or not wearing the item) are not really all that useful when the population as a whole is taken into account, particularly over time. This is also because stupid people generally will find a way to commit suicide and ya can't outlaw dumb. Trying to is about as effective and useful as getting the proverbial pig to sing.Common risks are far more likely to kill you than big splashy ones. You aren't special. Lets round up mass shooting victims for the ten plus years from 2006 to 2017 to 2000 people. In 2016 alone, there were over 37,000 automobile fatalities.

You may even be pretty confident in it, but that doesn’t change things one bit.You just don’t know.There’s reasons why the Army and Marines go through drill after drill after drill of scenario after scenario after scenario, non-stop training. They’re trying to pound your reactions and responses into you to make it muscle memory and instinct, to force you to do the right things at the right times.Guess what? People still fail. When the chips are down and the bullets are flying, people still forget all that training and screw up.Ten years ago, I was at a grocery store. Just as I was reaching for a grocery cart, some teenagers driving by threw a bunch of lit firecrackers and fireworks out their car window and drove away; Roman candles began firing into the store, scattering people everywhere.I panicked and dove behind a wall…I left my wife and daughter standing in the entrance.Five years ago, at a sandwich shop, I noticed there was a really “iffy” looking guy standing to the side, waiting for his order; he had a large pistol on his hip and just had that look of somebody who wasn’t exactly right in the head. While I was placing my order, somebody dropped a big pan of lettuce behind the counter, landing with a loud boom; the guy yelled and pulled his gun, pointing towards the counter.I jumped forward, pushed my daughters behind me, and began speaking to the guy in a calm voice to get him to settle down.If either of these situations happened again today, I’d like to think I’d react in the bravest manner, like in the second situation…I’d really like to….But I don’t know. There’s no way of knowing.The same applies for hundreds of scenarios where people insist they know exactly how they’d behave.“I’d never cheat on my wife.”“I know ex-ACTLY what I’d do if I won the lottery.”“If I ever run into that man again, I’ll tell him exactly what I think of him.”In all of those cases and so many others, we should all know that there’s no guarantees on any of that…in fact, it’s almost guaranteed you won’t do what you’re sure you will.Remember when you made that New Year’s Resolution? Remember how confident you were that you’d lose those 40 pounds? Only 8% of people actually stick to their resolutions, and even THAT is self-reported.Remember when you told yourself, “That’s the last drink I’ll ever have”? Even Alcoholics Anonymous has an extremely low success rate, between five and ten percent.Remember that thing you bought from Amazon, so sure that you’d use it?

There’s reasons why psychologists, therapists, and psychiatrists make so much money, and it’s also the reason why so many of those professionals get help from mental health professionals themselvesReal quick thought experiment for you: do you have prejudices? A lot of people do recognize that they do, though they don’t recognize to what extent; quite a few people will insist they don’t.So, just ask yourself a simple question: why do you treat men and women differently, regardless of your gender? Why do you treat people of different races, religions, and nationalities differently? How about old people versus young people? Rich versus poor?And if you’re sitting out there saying, “I don’t treat anybody differently,” then you may want to ask some questions of your friends and family….This is one of the most disturbing things that one must come to grips with, and it is something that generally only comes with age and wisdom. Many people never fully comprehend the baffling thing that we all call “me”. It’s best to learn to accept this fact when it first begins dawning on you, as it helps you to understand so many things about other people.",10 followers,Sajeev Rajan,3K,1.5K,46.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-some-people-behave-as-though-they-are-experts-when-in-fact-they-know-little-or-nothing
