The force applied as the paddle moves through the water propels the canoe in the opposite direction. It’s also why jet engines generate thrust: As the engine expels hot gases backward, the plane moves forward.EmDrive works by generating thrust by bouncing around electromagnetic energy (in this case, microwave photons) in a closed, cone-shaped chamber. As those photons collide with the chamber’s walls, they somehow propel the device forward, despite the fact that nothing is released from the chamber. By contrast, ion drives now in use on some NASA spacecraft create thrust by ionizing a propellant, often xenon gas, and shooting out beams of charged atoms, which follows Newton’s third law.Daily we learn something new as a human race, and I think it would definitely take another 10,000 years if not less to understand everything completely.","17,083 followers",Ghost Orange,1.1K,14.9K,33.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Does-technology-and-human-evolution-follow-a-logarithmic-representation-of-where-it-will-eventually-cap-out-and-stop-evolving-at-the-rate-it-is-today

11,"Darwin proposed two processes that he thought could drive evolution of species. Everyone seems to focus on natural selection. But Darwin also proposed mate selection as well. It’s for sure that natural selection was a powerful force that shaped hominids to become modern humans. But I also believe that Darwin was correct in thinking that mate selection also played a crucial role.Humans are very unique among mammals in our ability to form large cooperative social networks with individuals that are not our kins.

Everyone seems to focus on natural selection. But Darwin also proposed mate selection as well. It’s for sure that natural selection was a powerful force that shaped hominids to become modern humans. But I also believe that Darwin was correct in thinking that mate selection also played a crucial role.Humans are very unique among mammals in our ability to form large cooperative social networks with individuals that are not our kins. When people work for a company, the employees are forming mutually beneficial social bonds even though most are not related to each other. We take this for granted but this is not found anywhere else in nature in the scale that humans carry out on a routine basis.Everyone points to ants, but all ants in a colony are closely related to each other. Chimps do form friendships among unrelated individuals but this is always at a very small scale and male violence and aggression is an ever present danger.But I doubt that natural selection alone was enough to change humans to become the most social specie on earth. I find it hard to see how tendency for kindness and empathy toward non-kin individuals could be easily produced by killing off the mean ones as the only method. The survival of the fittest would have required that those that were mean and anti-social became so disadvantaged that they were more likely to die than those that were kinder and sociable. While I do think natural selection was a contributing factor but I doubt that it was enough.I think just as we’ve domesticated dogs as the kinder and friendlier mutant version of the wolf, human beings have been domesticating ourselves.How?Our women have been choosing their men as mates very selectively. They do so even now and we know how this frustrates a lot of young men. In fact in many human societies as many as 30% of the men fail to have children largely as the result of not finding a mate. Women have been choosing men that are more stable, cooperative, kinder, and safer providers for the families the women want to have. Women have been and are selectively breeding men!Men work hard to earn favor from women by displaying their status, wealth, and power. But the men also find that if they don’t treat their women and other people with kindness and empathy, they will lose out to their competition. This is the power that our ancestral mothers used to domesticate men to be the way we are today. I don’t see any advances in technology and science that will diminish the power of this process to continue to evolve men to be kinder, less violent, pro-social beings.How about women?They are also under intense mate selection pressure as well. Competition over the favored men is intense among women. In some human societies, some women will settle for sharing a man with sister wives rather than settling for a mediocre man of her own. Even in monogamous societies some women marry older divorced men that may have children from a prior marriage. It’s almost a cliche to see an older wealthier man married to younger pretty woman.But in order to win over those “good” men, women have been evolving to become ever more beautiful. It’s simple truth to say that women in general are much better looking physically than the men. This diversion of the two sexes can only be explained by the different criteria each sex use to choose their mates. So men have been and are continuing to evolve women to become ever more attractive and beautiful. Of course most men also look for their women to be good mothers, and so pro-social traits are important to men as well. It’s hard to live with a wife that is hostile and anti-social.Civilization only became possible with the development of cities. Cities only became possible because humans could form large social networks well beyond the circle of relatives. The intensification of urbanization and large scale enterprises as the driving force for wealth and status means that people are continuing to choose their mates for their ability to work well with others, showing kindness and empathy, and demonstrate other pro-social qualities.I may also mention that many evolutionary psychologists are seeing a relationship between intelligence and the density of social bonds found in their societies. Cultures that have greater urbanization may be associated with higher average level of intelligence. If true, I think that phenomenon is also likely driven largely by mate selection as well. Women are choosing smarter men to mate with because intelligent men are increasingly able to achieve higher status in urbanized societies.Therefore far from slowing down the pace of evolution, the emergence of civilization is probably accelerating and intensifying the pace of human evolution. We are literally breeding each other to be smarter, kinder, and friendlier!","220,632 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,783M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-modern-humans-evolved-10-000-years-ago-why-havent-we-unraveled-discovered-the-marvels-of-science-and-technology-until-recently
