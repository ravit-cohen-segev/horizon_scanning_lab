Because they have a very hungry demand and loads of money and a very intelligent and trained populace.","68,768 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-much-future-is-there-for-a-digital-printing-company-with-mostly-construction-companies-as-customers-given-upcoming-technologies-like-AR-and-digital-displays

Well, unfortunately, those microbots are impossible, but there is a similar technology that’s being developed in real life.The idea is to build tiny replicators that can create more of themselves, like a sort of super bacteria that never stops replicating. Such a technology would be“…the first replicator assembles a copy in one thousand seconds, the two replicators then build two more in the next thousand seconds, the four build another four . . in less than two days, theyNanotechnology, but in a really cool way.You remember the microbots in Big Hero 6, right?

Such a technology would be“…the first replicator assembles a copy in one thousand seconds, the two replicators then build two more in the next thousand seconds, the four build another four . . in less than two days, they would outweigh the Earth; in another four hours, they would exceed the mass of the Sun and all the planets combined …”Of course, self-replicators require materials, so they aren’t going to spread through space or anything. But they would have an abundance of material on Earth, especially of carbon, which would likely be the building blocks of such an assemblers. If you were carrying a jar of them and tripped and they spilled out, and they had no limit, they would quickly devour the entire earth with no way of stopping them.But here is where things get interesting: These tiny robots would have the ability to construct molecules from atoms, giving them the ability to produce amazing materials like graphene, cubes of apple, and even brain material.With advanced nanotechnology in the form of self-replicators, the entire world would experience a revolution. Think for a second about what wouldn’t change in the face of machines that can produceProduction jobs would cease. The price of every item ever created would be lowered massively. Supercomputers and experiments regarding brain material would become almost commonplace. Terraforming other planets would take years if not months. And all of this is actuallyThere is a lot of power contained within those tiny machines.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Which-businesses-are-surely-going-to-benefit-based-on-upcoming-technological-advancements

Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party. Because radiation from nuclear accidents is apparently scarier than way more people dying of regular pollution constantly and the total annihilation of all life on Earth as the oceans boil away.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-businesses-are-surely-going-to-benefit-based-on-upcoming-technological-advancements

And your family would find solace in the fact that this was your decision.

(It’s easier to transport ashes back home.)Lawyers for will and testament reasons.The entire package would be all-inclusive. Once everything was done, your family would fly home, full of happy memories of your final days on Earth.Does this sound crazy? Think about this: Have you ever lost a loved one to a long-term chronic illness? Have you ever seen someone you love, on life support for an extended amount of time, with no hope of recovery? Do you know someone whose final weeks on Earth were spent racking up expensive medical bills for their loved ones to deal with after their death?When you really think about it, this idea is genius. It’s the best option for all involved.It can’t be automated.It can’t be outsourced.If I had the money, I’d open one of these as soon as possible.If YOU have the money and open one, at least give me a little credit please.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,5K,996,155.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Which-businesses-are-surely-going-to-benefit-based-on-upcoming-technological-advancements

9,"Programming is just a means to an end. In AI/Machine Learning, programming is the easiest part. While you can do programming in any language you want, I would recommend to learn one of Python, R, Matlab/Octave (in order to be able to build code fast), and one of Java, C++, C (in order to build code that runs fast, of course C runs faster than C++, C++ runs faster than Java). In addition, you need to know about the basic algorithms and data structures, otherwise the code will be messy and slow.The difficult part is mathematics. The more you know, the better.

Other books can be used to supplement those.Of course, that is only if you're planning to spend decades of your life on building intelligent agents. If you're just planning of using algorithms done by others, then very likely, the first group would be more than enough.If you've read those books (first and second group), then diving into machine learning books will be much more easy. Some recommended books are:----The first two are more readable than the last two, but the last two might be better.--You can supplement the books with online courses (or the other way around). Some nice online courses are:-------Ok, that should cover it.So:- if you want just to use machine learning, do the first course from Ng, get a data set and start learning. Kaggle competitions might be a good start after it.- if you want to understand how Machine Learning works, the inner workings of many algorithms, maybe even slightly change them, do one of machine learning courses, AI course and deep learning course, in addition to reading the first group of mathematics books and some of machine learning books.- if you want to do serious research on AI/Machine Learning, read all the given books a few times, in addition to some other books, and then spend your lifetime reading research papers.Have fun!","8,703 followers",Mario Galindo Queralt,529,637,8.8M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Which-businesses-are-surely-going-to-benefit-based-on-upcoming-technological-advancements
