We live in self-contained villages with big walls and travel single-file, every time on a new path, between villages. It's the only way we're able to live until all thefishhave beencanned. How did this happen?2021 Google perfects the self driving car, called twelve sigma for the very low probability of running out of fuel,ever. The twelve sigma has efficient solar panels and hydrogen storage, where excess sunlight is used to convert moisture in the air into hydrogen reserves. With just 8 hours of sunlight it can drive 24 hours at 120MPH. The tires never go flat, the self-inflating tire was invented in 2015 as part of Ford's seminal Drive It Rough campaign.  The twelve sigma drives itself perfectly. Because focus groups had concerns with animal safety, especially dogs and cats, the twelve sigma designers includes echo re-location technology that acts as inverse sonar, leading objects in its path to see where they should be, effectively incentivizing them to relocate themselves out of the path of the vehicle. Echo re-location was shown to be, coincidentally, 12 sigma accurate, so the designers assumed there would be no obstacles in the road, allowing them to focus on a hyper efficient bullet train driving machine. Humans find the echo re-location disorienting. To strike a middle ground, some roads are marked as car only - no humans outside of cars allowed.2025 All cars on the road worldwide are replaced with twelve sigmas, by mandate of the UN. The idea is that hyper efficient transportation will stem the mounting global warming crisis. There is no room for error, action is taken immediately. Within 12 months all cars are self driving. Because of declining resources to build and maintain roads, all roads become car-only to maximize the transportion throughput.2026 Thirteen sigma is released that uses optimized inference AI under the new laws of 2025. Chaos theory scholars call the new roadway organizationally intelligent, aself-assembling super transporter. Local AI inferences build up to optimal routing decisions, guided by a master GPS+. + is added to GPS to to support readings even under cover, as in tunnels and underground structures. It relies on a ad-hoc network of smart dust that augments the pre-millennial GPS satellite network. The optimized AI inference is smart enough to drive itself along available roads even in the case when GPS+ is not available. Like the clunky DARPA challenge predecessors that drove across the Mojave desert (back in the days when people were still using Internet 1, Internet 2 came around in 2017 and blew it away), the optimized AI inference could pick out roads from the local environment and keep driving without any guidance.October 2, 2027 A rogue African nation uses a laser to blow a hole in the GPS satellite network. 1, 2, 3, 4, 10 satellites down.

Chill isn't at all the same thing as staying calm under pressure. The most important part of staying calm under pressure is you can act to deal with whatever is causing the pressure. The point of chill is to not give a shit one way or the other.Here's an example.  In the old movie Aliens there are four groups of characters:The Chill Apocalypse will be self-limiting in one sense.

But I still needed an income, so my mother had hired my younger sister and me to do the dirty, back-breaking work in her shop while she took care of her first infant granddaughter.My sister and I were working at our mom’s antique store one summer day. Mom had just gotten a truckload of European oak furniture that needed to be cleaned and polished, have the handles screwed on and so forth.A nice-looking young man came into the store and started talking to my sister, who was 17 at the time. He introduced himself as Ted Smith, and we laughed and said we must be related as mom’s maiden name was Smith also. He chatted both of us up, but focused on sis for the most part.He purchased an armoire, but said he’d have to go get his truck, since at the moment he was driving his VW Bug—an old VW Bug. He then asked my sister and me if we wanted to go out to dinner that night with him. We were sweaty and dirty from work, I had a baby to care for, and sis already had a boyfriend, so we said “Thanks, but no thanks, Ted”.He asked me to ride with him to get his truck so he could drop his Bug off at the auto shop for repairs, but by that point I had to get home to my infant—-right away, because I was still nursing her and I thought my breasts were going to begin leaking at any minute.However, he wouldn’t give up trying to get one or both of us away from the shop.He said he could come back about 10:00 that evening for his armoire and asked whether one or both of us be there. We replied, “No, we close the shop at six, and we both have places to be tonight.”He was persistent. “How about tomorrow night?”“No, we close at 6:00, except on Saturdays, when we close at 4:00.”He asked whether one of us could meet him early in the morning, like at 5:30 a.m., but neither of us wanted to.He was getting to be a bit creepy and sis and I were eye-rolling at each other.Eventually, he said he was sorry but he couldn’t buy the armoire if we couldn’t be flexible.We hated to give up the sale, but after he had been there for two hours, we thought he was just looking and taking up our time. We still had a lot of work to do on the furniture that had just arrived in the shop.Finally, we just wanted to finish our work and go home.At 6:00 p.m., as we were leaving, his VW Bug was parked outside and he asked us whether we want to go for coffee; he especially wanted my sister to go.We said, “Thanks, Ted, but no thanks, like we said earlier, we have plans,” but he continued to be insistent.Finally I said, “Sis, let’s go—I’ll take you home.” Even though she had her car there, for some reason I didn’t want to leave her to drive home alone with this guy around.So he drove off in his Bug and we really didn’t think of it again…Until the next year, when this picture appeared in the paper:Ted Bundy.It still sends chills up my spine, writing this, and sis and I talk about it occasionally.

One of his buddies brought a cellphone that could report longitude and latitude in exacting detail.So, they called me. And I used their latitude and longitude on an everyday computer with everyday Google Maps and its satellite images to pinpoint their location. They’d traipse around in one direction for a while, call me with a new latitude and longitude report, and I’d verify which direction they were heading. Eventually, I got them heading to the canal and their airboat.In between those calls to the swamps of Florida, my parents called from a trip to Europe.

Its semiotics are sensationalist, singing songs of what the common man thinks the future may be like. And since that’s usually based on nothing but Teletubby voodoo, that makes it a pipe dream.In other words, “futuristic” is a nice way of saying something is an absolute crackpot fantasy, devoid of actual substance.That’s why I don’t want any of my students to ever use that word to describe something they have invested time and effort in.

It comes up often when we are working with artists on depicting a scenario that is telling a story about the future. How do we picture something that hasn’t happened yet? The artists illustrating sci fi have an easier time of it because they can fantasize more freely.However, I’ve found a couple of ideas useful. One is to round the corners of objects. For some reason that tends to make an image more futuristic looking. Another is to simplify your image. In the past inventors would add all sorts of wires and doodads to their inventions, but unless for some reason we go back to that need to fancify gadgets, we are moving towards simpler, sleeker—and smaller—devices. Frequently too, new technologies are rigid at first—future versions may well be floppy, or bendable.We had the idea, years ago, that screens would be ubiquitous—on the walls, everywhere. That’s been modified by having more hand-held devices, so you might consider a future in which devices are embedded in the human rather than in his/her surroundings. In other words, our devices move from being on the walls, on our desks, to in our hands and then in our bodies. There are versions of such devices today, such as exoskeletons and wheelchairs that enable a person to stand—much sleeker versions are possible in the future.Hope this helps.","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,631,1.5K,2.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Apocalyptic-and-Post-Apocalyptic-Hypothetical-Scenarios-How-long-would-it-take-for-there-to-be-no-evidence-that-we-used-advanced-technology-if-society-and-civilization-were-to-suddenly-collapse
