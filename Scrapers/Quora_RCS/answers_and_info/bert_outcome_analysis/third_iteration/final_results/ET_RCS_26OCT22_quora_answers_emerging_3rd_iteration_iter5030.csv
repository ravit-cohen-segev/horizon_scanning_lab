The satellite doesn’t get any information from cars and cellphones at all. It cannot ever become “overloaded”.In the car’s navigation system - it sees those radio signals coming from a bunch of different satellites and can use the fact that the radio signal takes time to get to the car to trianglulate it’s position.So the output from the car’s GPS interface is: Latitude, Longitude, Altitude and Time.That’s it…nothing else. The car can infer speed by looking at consecutive positions and times - and it can (mostly) infer direction by looking at consecutive positions too.FROM POSITION TO MAP:So to turn that bare position information into a moving map display requires that the car contain a map of the world with roads and such marked on it. All it has to do is to draw enough of that map onto the screen around the position that the GPS unit says it’s at.So your question comes down to what data is included on the map.WHAT IS THE MAP AND WHERE DOES IT COME FROM?If the map in your car had little icons showing where there are traffic signals - then the car could certainly draw them.In fact, in the very most recent update to my car’s software (I have a Tesla), there are now little traffic signal icons in the center of every junction where there are traffic signals.But for some unknown reason, it’s also started showing me where there are bus stops?!?Anyway - what data is on the map depends on the map’s supplier. For Tesla, the primary map data comes from Google and is loaded into the car via the cellular phone network - just like Google Maps on your phone.Many cars have speed limits stored in their maps - and it would be possible to store other data there too.But so long as humans are driving cars themselves - we’ll still need the signs because you don’t want to be staring down at the map while driving - so having a physical sign, out there in the real world - will be essential for as long as people drive cars.When cars are self-driving, it’s MUCH easier to have the information about junctions and such stored in a digital map.The huge problem with that is that there are no guarantees that the physical signs and the digital data agree.WHY YOU CAN’T TRUST THE MAP:So a road near me has always been a four-way-stop - but recently, they built a fire station on one corner of the junction and they replaced the stop signs with traffic lights.Whichever city government did that clearly didn’t bother to tell Google - because my car still thinks it’s a four-way-stop. (Fortunately, when it’s driving itself, it also uses cameras to decide what kind of a junction it is - so it should be OK).Much more common are changes that are made to speed limits - where the signs quite often disagree with the mapping data.For at least the last two years, the section of i10 that goes through the middle of El Paso has been signposted as 65mph - but all of the mapping software that I’ve checked believes it to be 75mph.At some point, you have to wonder which is correct.Local governments don’t seem to have registers of where every single road sign is - or what it says. So could it be that the workers simply missed a couple of old 65mph signs when the speed limit was changed? Could it be that nobody bothered to tell Google (and other) digital map makers that it changed?This is a VERY unsatisfactory situation - and it REALLY should be fixed.Ideally, there should be a country-by-country or US-state-by-state register of all of the road signs - something that would legally have to be maintained accurately.But there is no such thing.This problem is everywhere. I live in a newly built home on a section of road that was marked by Google as “unnamed road”. Google thought it was an L-shaped road (my house is right in the corner of the “L”).This caused problems - especially during the pandemic - because none of the delivery services could find our address. Even ordering a pizza was a nightmare.My neighbors and I bombarded Google with error reports - and EVENTUALLY - after about 6 months - they updated the map.But that “L”-shaped corner is now (correctly) the junction of two differently named roads - and precisely where it switches from one road to another isn’t too well defined.In reality, you *can* tell because my house number - and that of my neighbor differ by about 2,000 numbers instead of 2 as you might normally expect. But Google thinks my house is on the same road as my neighbors - and this freaks out the mapping system.So while everyone else in my area can now get reliable deliveries - we still have trouble.MAPPING MATTERS:With the rise of delivery services and self-driving cars - this whole business of exact digital mapping can be extremely important.","28,152 followers",Tim Dees,1K,14.9K,157.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Can-stop-lights-road-signs-appear-in-GPS-based-devices-inside-the-car-and-be-replaced-by-technology-will-this-overload-GPS-system-Can-this-technology-be-reliadble-one-day

Therefore, the level of AI and automation needed for a UAV to be as effective as a manned aircraft is going to be difficult to pass through a lot of parliaments!- Rules of Engagement (ROE). This too falls under politics and becomes quite messy with UAVs. Firstly, others have discussed BVR engagements already yet I am not aware of a single BVR Air to Air engagement in any conflict for the last 20+ years. Quite simply the requirement to ensure the target you are shooting at is a legitimate target takes a priority. Visual identification is needed. Unless we have an all out war between super powers this requirement is unlikely to change.Additionally, pilots will make judgement calls based on both the ROE and ethics. For example, a human pilot may chose to let an aircraft that is out of weapons, smoke pouring from 1 engine and heading home live to fight another day (the aircraft would take weeks to repair anyway). Would AI make the same call? Not without decades of development.EffectivenessThe effectiveness of UAVs has been greatly misrepresented by the media and movies. UAVs can not find the needle in the hay stack, they still go wrong, they are still affected by weather, human error and so on. A UAV tasked to hit the wrong target is probably worse than a manned aircraft tasked to hit the wrong target as the human pilot can still make a call.An example:You know that a insurgent leader will meet with his 5 regional commanders at an unknown location within 10 miles of a known point. How can a UAV find this location? On its own it can't. First we needed other intelligence to be aware of the meeting in the first place. Now we need other assets to help:SIGINT - we may be able to pick up chatter, perhaps hear the location mentioned or direction find from the signal.If all goes well we may then be able to send an armed UAV to a much smaller area where it can search and locate the meeting location. Then, based on the ROE it may be able to put down ordnance and then asses the success of he strike.Owing to the nature of SIGINT and ISTAR manned aircraft are still required (although these are often backed up by manpower and ground stations).One day could there be a combined ISTAR/SIGINT/PHOTO/Armed UAV? Perhaps, but we are talking decades and decades and putting all your eggs in one basket rarely works. Plus we still need to solve the issues of weather, ROE, politics, jamming, self defence and so on.So no, I do not think UAVs will ever replace manned aircraft, they will continue to supplement them instead.EDITAn article on BVR with examples of some kills:Usefulness of BVR combatAnd anotherBVR combat analysis ( a bit to long but... - Defence technology",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,6.1K,5.6K,427.2M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-robots-replace-human-soldiers-What-are-the-main-gaps-in-technology

It means developers can run software on their local computers and be confident that it will run in the cloud as well.Kubernetes has its drawbacks, though. It has a pretty steep learning curve, and it requires a good bit of administration to keep a cluster running in production. Because of that, I think it will be replaced by something else pretty soon.

Sometimes big programs fed data to other programs via a variety of mechanisms, such as data files transferred around, or eventually, databases and messaging systems.More recently, say, in the Early Middle Ages, we began to modularize things. This makes software easier to think about—you write a module, link it to other modules, and they form a software package with some reusable components. If the modules can be deployed separately and updated separately, then you gain some advantages of independence and reduced risk. This led to n-tier architectures, which are basically tightly-coupled systems of 2 or 3 or 4 components which work together to deliver some capability.Architects noticed that the tiers could talk to each other directly, which sped up delivery of some systems and allowed for more re-use. Thus was born the “Service-Oriented Architecture” (SOA), which emerged as a thing in the Late Middle Ages to the Early Modern Era. While there were (are) a lot of tools for implementing SOA, most teams just shared their interfaces via email and all the services talked to each other willy-nilly over the company LAN, and ultimately, WAN.As we continued to get better at ad-hoc SOA, enterprises got bigger and the distinction between WAN and LAN started to disappear. At the same time, the general public noticed the Internet, and companies like Google and Facebook started building world-wide systems with billions of customers. Components had to become smaller and smarter just to manage the load… so services became more specialized and tools arose to make scaling up and updating systems, and dealing with failures easier. Microservice architectures were born.Engineering VPs in the Modern Era thought “well, it’s good enough for Google, so it should be good enough for our team, too”, and directed their people (who were just as enthusiastic about the idea, because New Toys!) to move to microservices.

More specifically, this is why it is a great choice for making prototypes but bad for manufacturing goods.If you try to manufacture something, there are a certain number of critical aspects of that part which you have to get right. For example, if you want to make a shoe, then generally it needs to fit, to not break, and to be comfortable.Usually the overall geometry is an important feature, but that’s not always true. Some things are designed to be flexible and have some misalignment, like body panels on cars. Other important aspects could be material strength, or the size of a particular hole, or even just having a smooth surface.When you’re working on these important details, you’ll have to do a certain number of “manufacturing operations” to produce them from the raw material. Each of those manufacturing operations will have a chance of failing, and some operations are more reliable than others. The more critical manufacturing operations you have to do, and the less reliable those operations are, the larger your chance is of failing.Returning to the body panels example, we manufacture the geometry by stamping metal sheets, and then we get the surface smooth and nice-looking by painting. Of the two, painting is a lot more sensitive to mistakes. That's part of why they will wait until parts are fully assembled to paint them.The reason that 3D printing is overrated is this exact idea. The technology allows you to make parts without having to develop a specific manufacturing process, but it gains that flexibility by using a “naïve” approach - there’s basically no assumptions made about what kind of part you’re building.That means your printer is doing a lot more critical manufacturing operations than are necessary, and those operations aren’t being chosen to minimize failure risk. Those two problems combined mean your chance of having manufacturing errors is astronomical compared to other approaches.So, to 3D print parts that have a lot of critical features, you either need to accept a very large failure rate or spend a lot of money on improving the reliability of your printer.For parts that require precision or material strength, making a printer reliable enough to produce them is practically impossible. Instead, we 3D print a rough shape that has a higher chance of succeeding, and then use traditional machining to finish the job:If you run into a high-performance application of 3D printing, this is guaranteed to be what they’re doing. They’re just not telling you about it.By design, 3D printing is a lot less useful for manufacturing than people are making it out to be. The problem is that pretty much everyone who has an interest in 3D printing is under pressure to adopt the technology so they don’t get left behind. That means people are sweeping these challenges under the rug.Don’t get me wrong, 3D printing is a powerful tool, especially when you don’t have the time or money to develop a traditional manufacturing approach. It enables you to do a lot of things that just weren’t practical before, and it’s game-changing for small-run manufacturing.But, like most tools, there are some things it’s just not useful for, and right now people in the industry are pressuring each other to ignore that.",47 followers,Skotti Alexis Kimble,1K,146,335K,2019,https://www.quora.com/Can-stop-lights-road-signs-appear-in-GPS-based-devices-inside-the-car-and-be-replaced-by-technology-will-this-overload-GPS-system-Can-this-technology-be-reliadble-one-day

Rather than heralding actors’ obsolescence, new technology such as motion capture has been the catalyst for significantly improving the realism in both human and animal animations.It all requires an actor to build the expression and movement libraries.If we want to “replace” actors then what will likely be needed is software that knows how a human will move (and smoothly), can capture the minute entails of the face (again, smoothly). And we’re asking the software to do all that without a stocked library of human movements.That kind of artificial intelligence, however, is a long way away.The day when this can be done without an actual actor is a long way away. It may never come, or by the time it does the entity that will replace the actor has civil rights.
