Educators, teachers, facilitators, and teachers would often do better by including all the key stakeholders in the system intentionally when suggesting ways forward. In complex systems engineering, for example, the system being developed or improved will likely fail if attention is paid only to the ""sexy"" technology while ignoring the stakeholders. Those protagonists that do wonder why their attempts fail but still keep trying the same old, ineffective techniques. The complexity (a continuum much beyond the simplest form, complication) of many situations is mainly due to the independent, prejudicial, and unpredictable nature of human beings. One should understand that no one is in control, one can only try to influence the situation by intervening, pursuing opportunities with informed risk, and hoping for the best while waiting some suitable length of time (decision making is necessary but is an art in itself) to see what happens and then perhaps intervening again. Please let me know if you wish more thoughts along these lines. :-)","1,043 followers",Priti Kairam,784,85,691.1K,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-believe-our-educational-policies-and-systems-should-adapt-to-emerging-technologies-and-the-new-digital-culture

From this perspective, the biggest problem with the influence of technology on higher education is the temptation for instructors to rely on the technology rather than on personal interaction with the students.

I have integrated shared Google docs in class exercises to attempt to improve the quality of writing in my undergraduate classes. I utilize freely available online statistical software in my statistics classes to focus on student learning of statistical applications rather than mathematical calculations.

2,"Ones that offer increasing concrete ROI in a short amount of time. Businesses that are succeeding are able to prove value in a short amount of time, typically enabling revenue.

Think retail stores, small convenience stores, small mom and pop shops that deal in cash. All this cash is vaulted away for the night.This has three inherent problems:This cash cannot be invested (overnight) whilst locked in a small safe.If all these stores/shops can become human ATMs, i.e. be able to dispense cash out to you, whereby you pay to them electronically, that would be a really big deal.So breaking down a specific banking &/or payments segment, and then asking the question:Sure there are other innovations, but this","135,546 followers",Hector Quintanilla,2.4K,1.2K,88.6M,2015,https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-believe-our-educational-policies-and-systems-should-adapt-to-emerging-technologies-and-the-new-digital-culture

People will save more money, understand how they’re spending their money better, all while having a completely online banking experience.—But that’s not all! By integrating other FinTech’s into their products on the retail and business side, they’ll be able to offer a wide variety of products allowing other FinTechs to grow with them! The big challenger (FinTech) banks that are targeting the mass populations like the ones above will be the ones that will be able to push the whole FinTech revolution into the hands and eyes of millions of people: payment, financial software (budget, accounting, taxes), business software, etc.Watch out for the big FinTech banks… They are the ones that will make a massive difference.

5,"My personal favorite is the hub and spoke model.In this model what you do is a have core product (lets say pizza) where you have a low or even negative profit margin. This cheaper but quality product allows you to be able to gain business and sales more easily even when competitors have similar or better products.Although you don't make much money (or any sometimes) off the hub, what happens is that you offer several 'spokes' which are high profit margin services/products. So lets call this (wings, molten chocolate cakes, 2 liter of Dr. Pepper).

Some will be allergic to wings or hate Dr. Pepper, well great, you can still sell the hub and one spoke (because who doesn't love molten chocolate cakes) and still make a profit and have a satisfied customer.Jordan SolomonSome of the fastest growing Saas companies and 'Unicorns' have unleashed this model recently and are having extreme success, such as:So in 2016 and 2017 I would say that if you're looking to innovate, find areas where the hub and spoke model isn't being used and then USE it to your advantage.",0 followers,Leonard Kim,709,593,15.3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-kind-of-business-model-seem-to-be-emerging-in-technology-business-with-reference-to-Financial-Services-industry
