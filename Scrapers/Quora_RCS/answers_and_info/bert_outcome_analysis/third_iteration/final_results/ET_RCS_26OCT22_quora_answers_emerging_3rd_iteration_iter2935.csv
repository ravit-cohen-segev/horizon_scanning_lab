No sign of the advanced electronic voting they have over in the states. Indeed, we are so old fashioned that we haven’t even outsourced our voting to the Russians yet!4) Guns – It may be hard for an American to believe but almost nobody in the UK owns their own guns.

The F-16 is every bit as effective a weapon now as it was when it was first created, and barring a major paradigm shift in air combat, it will remain effective for the foreseeable future.Compare this to a Commodore personal computer from roughly the same time period. This machine is hopelessly outdated. It would have a hard time running a modern word processor, let alone anything I’d actually want to use a computer for. But the machine was only a couple hundred dollars, which is what it would cost me today to get one about a million times more powerful.To be more precise, if we look at transistor count, a computer from 1974 has roughly 10 million times fewer transistors than a computer made last year. Let that sink in.And the people who manufactured both devices knew this. Military engineers knew they were making big, expensive products that were going to be in service for decades, and which wouldn’t really need to be improved upon until there was another major war. And at that point there’s no telling what improvements would be required.Consumer products engineers knew they were making small, cheap, disposable products that the customer would probably throw away in under a decade, because by then an improved version would appear. They could make the device sturdier, but that would increase the cost to the consumer for a device they were going to throw away anyway.If a Commodore microcomputer was indestructible, you’d still have thrown it away by now because you don’t need it anymore.

Supposedly, this technology was used to help cripple the Iraqi air defense system when the US invaded.This was important to Cisco because we were working in security and cryptography and the NSA was forever trying to get us to corrupt our products so they could un-encrypt foreign transmissions on the fly. One time we were required to corrupt product that had been shipped to China and it started a major debate about our fiduciary responsibility to the country or to the customer. The issue was that if you sell a security product that you know is corrupted, you are knowingly committing fraud and are liable. As the Product Manager at the time I asked the NSA if they would stand behind us (and me as I might be personally liable) in court if we were discovered. Of course the answer from the NSA was “Hell no.”We were on our own. We then entered into a long debate about how to detect Easter eggs and other corruption introduced into security products unknowingly through another vendor’s corrupted hardware. The issue was never resolved but it should be known that our security source code HAD to be provided to the NSA in order to get FIPS certification and they made certain changes to it.So to answer your question, USA military technology is advanced far beyond anyone’s knowledge to describe the extent.On the other hand, the Chinese probably know more about our technology than we do since they perpetrated the greatest security breach in history by compromising the RSA key technology used by almost everyone in the world.

In fact in 2018, the world only has 25% of the nuclear weapons that existed 30 years ago and the total destructive force of this total is less than 10% of the record high. So not only has the quantity dropped steeply but the yield has dropped even farther.That 10 percent I mentioned on the total destructive force … well even that is overstated as nuclear weapons today can all be dialed down to a very small percentage of their total yield depending on the target requirements.So a full scale nuclear war today would result in a total destructive force about 1/250 - 1/500 of what it would have been in 1986.Misunderstandings people have about wars…These things make nuclear war something the military doesn't want to engage in.If they have to use the nukes it will be very selective.The 21st Century is a century that can be described as the century of precision. This is the reason that bigger isn't better.The following is an excerpt from another answer of mine …the footnotes will take you there.Multi Megaton Weapons Now ObsoleteWhat has changed that the world no longer is building megaton weapons? The need for multi-megaton weapons was the result of low accuracy of warhead delivery on target…. we needed a sledgehammer approach to take out hardened targets and the way that was done was through very high yield bombs >=5 MT typically. The average nuclear weapon size today in 2016 is about 443 KT at full yield but a large portion of those bombs can be adjusted in the field to a very small fraction of their potential yield.Today the accuracy of on target delivery has improved significantly ..we hit what we aim for. Making a weapon twice as accurate has the same effect on lethality as making the warhead eight times as powerful. Phrased another way, making the missile twice as precise would only require one-eighth the explosive power to maintain the same lethality.In the 1980’s the development of earth penetrating rounds was another game changer. Not only were we on target but now we could penetrate hundreds of feet of earth and concrete before detonating the warhead. This allowed a 100 KT weapon to do the damage of a >1 MT surface detonation.This is the primary method now for targeting hardened targets and is the final driver for smaller yield bombs. (Note that conventional warheads can penetrate 100’s of feet through concrete, nuclear warheads are usually limited to less than 30 ft in concrete due to the complexity of the warhead not surviving further penetration. Soil penetration depth varies with composition but to get full ground coupling of energy only 4 or 5 meters is required)The net effect of the use of EPW’s (Earth Penetrating Weapons) is a reduction in the number of casualties as compared with the number of casualties from a surface burst. This is primarily due to a 96% reduction in the weapon yield needed using an EPW. The greater coupling of the released energy to the ground shock for a buried detonation is the same as a surface burst with 25 times the explosive energy.For rural targets, the use of a nuclear earth-penetrator weapon is estimated to reduce casualties by a factor of 10 to 100 relative to a nuclear surface burst of equivalent probability of damage.To exploit that efficiency, in 1997 the US replaced its aging 9-megaton bombs with a lower-yield but earth-penetrating 300-kt model by putting the nuclear warhead from an earlier bomb design into a strengthened alloy-steel casing and a new nose cone.Pictured above is the first US precision guided EPW tactical nuclear gravity bomb. The B61-12 is designed to have four selectable explosive yields: 0.3 kilotons (kt), 1.5 kt, 10 kt and 50 kt. The B61-12 will be integrated on virtually all nuclear-capable U.S. and NATO aircraft: B-2, LRS-B (next-generation long-range bomber), F-35A, F-16, F-15E, and PA-200 Tornado.Continued from above……To fully appreciate this evolution consider a targeting scenario as it was in the 1970’s as compared to 2020. In the 1970′s a hardened silo target required multiple megaton bombs to destroy a 1000 psi rated silo. Since weapons accuracy was no better than 200–300 yards you needed surface burst weapons greater than 1 megaton to take out the target.Now advance to the early 2000’s. That same target can be destroyed with a 70 kt EPW with a 100 yard accuracy. Fast forward to 2020 and that target can be taken out with a 1 kt EPW weapon with an accuracy of 10 meters.There is no need for more powerful weapons",UNKNOWN,Bill Yu Liao (廖彧),650,138,1.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-that-the-United-States-could-have-an-advanced-technological-weaponry-that-could-be-used-if-they-have-to

By technology we can think of things like “missile technology” or “rocket propulsion technology” etc.I will answer with what comes to my mind and I might miss some things and get others wrong but I’ll try.For instance we have air to air missiles. Europeans are currently developing Meteor missile which reached initial operating capability (IOC) less than a month ago.What is publicly known is that the missile has a ramjet propulsion system and can reach speeds of over 4 mach.According to MBDA, Meteor has three to six times the kinematic performance of current air-air missiles of its type. The key to Meteor's performance is a throttleable ducted rocket (Meteor (missile)Here’s an article claiming that Meteor is in fact the best air to air missile.The Best Air-to-Air Missile in the World Is in Sweden — War Is BoringAssuming this public information is correct and I don’t see why it wouldn’t be - Europeans are ahead of US at the moment with their air to air Meteor missile which was developed over concern for Russia’s R-77 Vympel ramjet missile and according to some sources Meteor missile was built to “wipe the table clear of all opposition”.M777 howitzer is actually designed by BAE (UK).It was immediately widely adopted by US Army and US Marine Corps as well as Canadian Army and Australian Army.The lighter weight and smaller size allows the M777 to be transported by theM777 howitzerAMOS mortar system is joint design by Sweden and Finland.AMOSWhen fitted to a vehicle, bothAMOSGotland class attack submarine originates from Sweden.It is said to be the world’s quietest submarine.TheOn the water surface, the submarine is powered by two sets ofThis capability had previously only been available withGotland-class submarineThe secret to the world’s most silent submarineArcher Artillery System is also from Sweden, it’s dubbed as the world’s fastest howitzer.It uses a Swedish howitzer system that has far superior performance against for instance the M109.The system is designed for high strategic, operational and tactical mobility.

The Russians also have a very established aerospace industry and they do in fact produce a lot of planes that can go toe-to-toe with Airbus and Boeing products.

Unfortunately, the 4 engine setup and lack of any substantial upgrades does not really set it up for success in 2021 and the sales numbers show. It’s only sold something like 30 aircraft with a good number of them going to the Russian Government.That being said, the fact that UAL is still able to produce a high-capacity, long range wide-body airliner is very impressive in itself and is indicative of Russia’s technical know-how in aerospace.

The Airbus model equivalent to a Boeing is usually more spacious, but payload restricted. Thus Airbus usually worked out by reinforcing their models and make gradual improvements, dubbing their updates as “HGW” or High Gross Weight variant of the model.The A330 freighter has to be modified with a reinforcing bulge on the nose landing gear to make itBoeing 737 still uses airframe derived from 707’s fuselage, dating back from 1950s. Meanwhile, Airbus A320 is a fresh design from 1980s. Despite 737’s sleek looks and lower fuel burn rate per seats, the plane is slightly heavier with less space.Boeing 737 hails fromAirbus A320, with its rounder fuselage shape, allows for wider cabin. It is also taller as well, with more cargo space too. Check this out:You'll notice 737’s oval cross section may give it lower aerodynamic profile, but it also gave them less space to sell for cargo revenue. Moreover, the Airbus, being a taller plane, has no problem when it adopted new engine.This engine cowling looks and is completely round (Pratt & Whitney 1000G pictured)Yes the LEAP-1 indeed has that strange dent at the bottom, but I swear, this is just Boeing 737’s ridiculously low ground clearance. It is roughly as tall as your SUV.The LEAP-1 on an Airbus shown here has a completely round nacelle, that lower right side-mounted CFM starter motor protruding hump does not alter the overall shape, nor it affects the already good ground clearance.The problem with 737MAX is the reason why they are doing that NSA/NMA as you seen above. Boeing has to stop A320, the Canadians and their Bombardier CS/Airbus A220s, and soon the Russian MC-21 and the Chinese C919 with fresh airframe designs. We can't turn blind eye to many of these factors anymore.Now, let's talk about that famous Airbus widebody fuselage.So, this Airbus A300 has this famous Airbus widebody Fuselage that has been used from 1972 to this day, from the pictured A300, then to its sibling A310, the updated A330, A340, A340NG, all the way to A330NEO.Really, this is the same body, she just use sunglass to hide that familiar cockpit windshield arrangements.Apart from the big hump that makes the wing root, almost everything in this Airbus' fuselage is the same.This is A330NEO, demasked.That triangular second window and trapezoidal side window is strikingly similar. Well, in fact, probably still have the same part number, just updated material.In response to this Airbus widebody, Boeing developed the 767, which came out in 1981. Being a newer design, the Boeing is of course, more efficient than the Airbus. Moreover, the 767 is also narrower than the bus (2–3–2 seating config instead of 2–4–2 in the bus)Boeing is so proud with its creation, the 767 that its nose will still be transplanted to its latest creation, the 777X.To keep up with 767 that is going to kill its A300, Airbus developed the A330, transplanting a new wing, new wingroot implant, and avionics. Then, they will also use more composite materials to make the A330 lighter, and therefore more fuel efficient.Sure, the 767 burn less fuel than the A330, but the bus is significantly bigger than the 767. This is like saying, “yeah, my hatchback burns less fuel than your MPV”. Given the decent size and capacity of the A330, the plane is able to generate more $$$, and the numbers just don't look good for the 767. The 777 is bigger and heavier, thus Boeing has no definitive answer to A330. Something must be done here.When Boeing had enough with frankensteining their current fuselage, they started fresh with 7E7. This is going to be a totally new thing. This will be the game changing, no more A330 supremacy.This plane will become the 787. This plane is constructed using composite materials and features full fly-by-wire controls. So Boeing after letting their fans use the popular “plastic plane” and “not a pilot's plane” slogan on Airbus, they finally swallowed their own words and did it themselves.Airbus, initially content with their A330, doesn't intend to reply. But remembering how much arse-kicking their A320 has given the 737, that it takes them two generations to finally beat, Airbus finally decided to get together and come up with “A330 with new wing and engine”. But Boeing went all out with bleedless engine technology, and an entire plane design intended to give the best efficiency that only existed in our dreams (hence the name “Dreamliner”). Airlines who are expecting a more serious reply are nervous and begin pestering the Airbus. So they listened to their customers.No more toying around with their 1974 fuselage. Like the 7E7, this new Airbus XWB will be an entirely new thing.The XWB is later given the A350 designation. It is made from even more composite materials.Realising how expensive a new 787 or A350 are, when some of the models asked well over $300 million, a money that buys you 4 engined double-decker not long ago, Airbus saw the potential to undercut these segment by offering the A330neo. Hence, the old shelved project were relaunched anyway. Undercutting the 787 by $25 million, it gave the customers 5 to 6 years of acquisition cost advantage before the 787’s inherrently superior efficiency could start taking its toll on the competition. Boeing started to dump 787’s price on their customers who are considering the A330NEO to replace their aging 767s.In the future, planes will be different, very different. I guess, the A350 and 787 could be the last conventional-looking jets ever. Well, bar several prestige-seeking nations trying to build their first widebody jet using this familiar shape. But, I couldn't see anymore use of this 1972 Airbus widebody fuselage shape.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-that-the-United-States-could-have-an-advanced-technological-weaponry-that-could-be-used-if-they-have-to
37,"BecauseI have to say that this is absolutely one of my favorite commercial airplane of all time, but, here is what is wrong with it.It uses a lot of fuel.The Concorde uses turbojet engines instead of turbofan engines, which resulted in the high fuel consumption.If we look at this graph, you will see that the closer the airspeed is to the sound barrier, the higher the drag is. More drag means more fuel is needed to maintain the speed.The tickets are expensive.A standard ticket from LondBecauseI have to say that this is absolutely one of my favorite commercial airplane of all time, but, here is what is wrong with it.It uses a lot of fuel.The Concorde uses turbojet engines instead of turbofan engines, which resulted in the high fuel consumption.If we look at this graph, you will see that the closer the airspeed is to the sound barrier, the higher the drag is.

Thus leaving the transatlantic flights their only option.We simply do not need our planes to go faster. However, a supersonic plane will be beneficial for some business people, they can wake up in New York, have a business meeting in London, and be in time to tuck their children in bed in New York again.However, there is a new company calledHope this helped.","7,692 followers",Tom Farrier,518,3K,18.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-that-the-United-States-could-have-an-advanced-technological-weaponry-that-could-be-used-if-they-have-to
38,"It isn’t - airlines buy the product for the job, with maybe a pro-Boeing bias in the US and a pro-Airbus bias in some European countries. Boeing introduced its first long-haul aircraft in 1939 - the B314 Clipper commissioned by Pan Am. Airbus first widebody - the A300 - entered service 35 years later was a medium haul aircraft. True long haul capability came only with the A340(1993) and A330 (1994). With a lead of more than 50 years, the Boeing in-service long-haul fleet has always been larger than the AIrbus equivalent.At the end of the twentieth century Airbus bet heavily on the four-enginedIt isn’t - airlines buy the product for the job, with maybe a pro-Boeing bias in the US and a pro-Airbus bias in some European countries.

Both programs have had their problems, but the extension of ETOPS (Extended Operations) rules that allowed twin engined planes to fly up to five hours from an airport dramatically reduced the number of routes for which a four-engined jet is effective. The A380 was just too big and too expensive to own and operate and production is being gradually phased out. By contrast the B787 is an excellent replacement for the aging B767 fleet, with much longer range, and has sold well. However, delays and cost overruns means that Boeing’s break-even on the plane comes only after between 1000 and 1500 have been delivered.The new Airbus A350 is now offering effective competition to the 787 with its greater capacity and use of new technology. Right now, the pendulum is swinging toward Airbus, but when the new versions of the B777 appear in a year or three (that program is also behind schedule with GE engine problems preventing a first flight), Boeing will likely see a growing share of long-haul deliveries again. The travelling public are beneficiaries of the intense competition between Boeing and Airbus, that has kept down the cost of long-haul travel for many years.",720 followers,Sandip Bhatnagar,629,321,1.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-that-the-United-States-could-have-an-advanced-technological-weaponry-that-could-be-used-if-they-have-to
