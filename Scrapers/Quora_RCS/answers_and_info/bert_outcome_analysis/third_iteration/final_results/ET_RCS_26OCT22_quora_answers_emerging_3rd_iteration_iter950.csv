Give young people the freedom to think on their own.That’s it. We are smart people working in an outdated educational system",16 followers,Subodh Mathur,1.6K,1.4K,17.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-technological-advancement-in-India
1,"China. Miles ahead.This is one of their technological monsters. It is called SLJ/32Bridge Building Machine. This monster weighs about 580 tonnes, is 91 metres long and 7 metres wide.The machine transports itself, via its set of 64 wheels, which are split into four sections consisting of 16 wheels each. As the name suggests, it is used to build bridges.Do you know how difficult it is to build tunnels? A few years ago, only Germany and Japan could build machines that could do the job, and China had to remain dependent on other countries for boring tunnels.

A few years ago, only Germany and Japan could build machines that could do the job, and China had to remain dependent on other countries for boring tunnels. Not until they decided to build this monster:Very few countries, not more than 3 or 4, can manufacture these machines. India has to import all TBMs, we don't have any capacity to build one.They also have this monster:It is used to build railway tracks. It can do the job, much faster and perfectly.In manufacturing, research and development, and technology India doesn't even stand a chance against China. Comparing the two is preposterous. The pathetic state of Indian manufacturing can be gauged from the fact that 69 years after independence, India can't even manufacture products as simple as earphones. Yes, even your earphones are probably manufactured in China, though they might contain a Made in India tag, to fool the Indians.Comparing the two countries would be a great injustice to China. Most of Chinese people don't want their country to be compared with India, they think of it below their dignity, the same way we think of Pakistan. They like to compare their country with countries like America and Japan.Images source:",189 followers,Prashant Kumar,5.7K,428,335.1K,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-technological-advancement-in-India
2,"Before answering this question, I would split the question into two. By splitting the question I get a frame of reference and then the answer becomes fairly straight forward to comprehendThe answer to the first question is straight forward and India is much advanced compared to where we were in 2000. I am not going to elaborate this further because its for us to see. But should we be happy about it? That leads us tBefore answering this question, I would split the question into two. By splitting the question I get a frame of reference and then the answer becomes fairly straight forward to comprehendThe answer to the first question is straight forward and India is much advanced compared to where we were in 2000. I am not going to elaborate this further because its for us to see. But should we be happy about it? That leads us to my second questionWhile it is true that India has advanced immensely in the last 20 years, the real question is has this made us more dependent on other countries? Most notably the United States and recently China?Despite having a population of 1.3 billion people and being touted as the software superpower (thanks to the IT services industry) not so long ago, India does not have self-reliance when it comes to technology. China created companies like Ali Baba, Baidu and Tencent a parallel to the American tech giants while India (even India’s telecom minister recently) takes pride in being the largest consumer of Whatsapp, and Facebook! Yes almost everyone has a mobile phone in India today and therefore the opportunities for growth is tremendous. But the real question one should ask is, who will be the beneficiaries of these opportunities? The mobile phones used in India are Chinese phones and the software used in these phones are U.S owned. Basically all our data, from our shopping habits to our entertainment preferences are in the hands of foreign technology companies. Now we know IoT is catching up fast and that means more control to these companies and India will be a proud consumer supplying data.One of the many important aspects discussed in Rajiv Malhotra’s latest book “Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Power, Five Battlegrounds” is India’s military dependence on foreign technology. While the manufacturing of Rafale jets will happen in India, the technology is owned by the French and let’s understand when such technology transfers occur between countries, the supplying country will always provide a technology that is one generation behind to the consuming country. That means we are technologically and militarily advanced compared to our previous generations but we are at least one generation behind the innovating countries! In certain areas like military that is not good newsMy last point on this is our pride in our Human resource and how skilled we are! Yes as individuals many Indians are CEOs of big foreign tech giants. But how does that benefit India as a nation? Do we have a stake in the intellectual property of these products? Can we say for instance Sunder Pichai as Google’s CEO holds the same clout in his company as Mark Zuckerberg holds in Facebook? Certainly not! Let’s not confuse individual brilliance with technological advancement as nation.For India to have a grand standing in the world stage as a technologically advanced nation, we need to come out of our consumer mindset and to quote Rajiv Malhotra’s words “be producers of knowledge and technology”.",0 followers,Priyan Bopitiya,4.7K,269,7.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-technological-advancement-in-India

5,"India, that is not even a question. North Korea is not a technologically advanced country other than its nuclear and rocket technologies. Even then, its technologies lag far behind most developed countries.Three things NK does know how to make - nuclear reactors, ballistic missiles, and nuclear bombs. All based on old design, but still more advanced that many third world countries. But to compare to India is just absurd even for the nuclear and missile technology.India, that is not even a question.
