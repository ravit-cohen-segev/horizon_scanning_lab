Lots of teams and individuals are both physically fit snd skilful but not always successful snd the reason is down to the not just doing things right ( both physically and skilfully as in being efficient) but in doing THE RIGHT THINGS RIGHT as in What, When and how to go things to beat an opponent. That’s why managers and coaches are essential in determining what the RIGHT THINGS are required to be concentrating on and perfecting.The Chinese have a proverb ‘ Like a chai, You are only as strong as your weakest link’ technology will, I believe, enable athletes and teams to determine what THE RIGHT THINGS are in order to DO THFM RIGHT !","5,084 followers",Bobby Tatro,3.9K,2.2K,45.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-will-technology-affect-professional-sports-in-the-next-10-years

Technology took disadvantage and made it a advantage. A runner with prosthetic legs can outrun a bodily able runner by a good distance.Moving away from running, there is no game rule in tennis that say, if a man without arms, obtained two arms, could not play professional tennis with bodily able sportmen. Would say player is still now considered disabled by society defination? Or is the player now wholesome and therefore compete with healthy people? Even if they are rejected, I can see a market appearing for these “ disabled” players. Sports and society are not ready for such confrontation.As for the game, imagine two mechanic arms. The length and power are only limited by its design or intention, could and would give the assuming “disable” player the ultimate advantage.This is just but one of the many possible examples that might rise up with sport technologies.","75,030 followers",Neman Ashraf,4.5K,410,37.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-will-technology-affect-professional-sports-in-the-next-10-years

Many of us in the developed world already have three or more full-time devices connected to the Internet when factoring in PCs,No. 2: Not just Big Data, but a zettafloodAbout 5 exabytes of unique information were created in 2008. That's 1 billion DVDs. Fast forward three years and we are creating 1.2 zettabytes, with one zettabyte equal to 1,024 exabytes. This is the same as every person on Earth tweeting for 100 years, or 125 million years of your favorite one-hour TV show. Our love of high-definition video accounts for much of the increase. By Cisco's count, 91% of Internet data in 2015 will be video.No. 3: Wisdom of the cloudMuch of the zettaflood of data will be stored in the cloud. Certainly, most of it is being accessed by the cloud, rather than only on private networks. By 2020, one-third of all data will live in or pass through the cloud, Cisco predicts.No. 4: The next 'NetEvans talks about his home as an example of the speed of network improvements. Network performance has increased by 170,000 times since 1990, when he had just one telnet connection.Over the next 10 years, companies expects the speed to to increase by 3 million times.No. 5: The world gets smallerSocial influences will continue to move rapidly between cultures.A smaller world also means faster information dissemination.No. 6: The power of powerThe human population also continues to grow, and it is estimated that a city with 1 million inhabitants will be built every month over the next two decades. More efficient methods to power those cities are becoming a necessity, particularly solar energy.Solar alone can meet our energy needs. In fact, to address today's global demand for energy, 25 solar super sites -- each consisting of 36 square miles -- could be erected. Compare this to the 170,000 square kilometers of forest area destroyed each year. Such a solar farm could be completed in just three years.No. 7: Tea. Earl Grey. HotMore items will move from physical to virtual. Today, we download e-books and movies, rather than bound books and DVDs. A technology called 3D printing will allow us to instantly manufacture any physical item, from food to bicycles, using printer technology. This is strikingly like the replicator concept from ""Star Trek.""Trend 8: Another family treeVirtual humans, both physical (robots) and online avatars will be added to the workforce. Already, animated characters can recognize speech, convert text to speech, and have knowledge of previous encounters.By 2020, robots will be physically superior to humans. IBM's Blue Brain project, for instance, is a 10-year mission to create a human brain using hardware and software. They believe that within a decade they'll start to see consciousness emerge with this brain.By 2025, the robot population will surpass the number of humans in the developed world. By 2032, robots will be mentally superior to humans. And by 2035, robots could completely replace humans in the workforce.REMEMBER…..Robot Movie climax of Rajinikanth…..!!!!No. 9: Yes, there's a cure for thatIn the next 10 years, it is believed medical technologies will grow vastly more sophisticated as computing power becomes available in smaller forms. Devices such as nanobots and the ability to grow replacement organs from our own tissues will be the norm. The ultimate integration may be brain-machine interfaces that eventually allow people with spinal cord injuries to live normal livesToday we have mind-controlled video games and wheelchairs, software by Intel that can scan the brain and tell what you are thinking and tools that can actually predict what you are going to do before you do it.No. 10: Humans or Borg?According to Stephen Hawking, ""Humans are entering a stage of self-designed evolution."" Taking the medical technology idea to the next level, healthy humans will be given the tools to augment themselves.While the early use of these technologies will be to repair unhealthy tissue or fix the consequences of brain injury, eventually designer enhancements will be available to all.Ultimately, humans will use so much technology to mend, improve or enhance our bodies, that we will become the Borg. Futurist Ray Kurzweil is pioneering this idea with a concept he calls singularity, the point at which man and machine merge and become a new species. (Kurzweil says this will happen by 2054). Evans is not convinced about singularity, particularly in Kurzweil's time frame. Evans sits on the Singularity University in Mountain View and finds the data plausible, and agrees that we are on that trajectory.Lets Hope for a better tomorrow….!!!!Thanks…!!!",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-will-technology-affect-professional-sports-in-the-next-10-years
