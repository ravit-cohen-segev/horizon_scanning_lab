So most give up, thankfully - because it isn’t easy to write good music that matters.Being a professional musician is not easy,Well, to be honest, I thank God learning a musical instrument ISN’T as easy to learn or “user friendly”.As an example… when recording equipment became affordable to anyone, and I mean anyone, they bought it and began to record their music…and most of it was horrible…because writing good music with consistency is not easy.So, they write their music and put it on iTunes and CDBaby…and find it isn’t so easy to become “famous” and “rich” writing and recording their songs. So most give up, thankfully - because it isn’t easy to write good music that matters.Being a professional musician is not easy, either. And the work required to do what we do weeds out those who think it would be “fun” and “easy” and a good career choice.Back to the main point: many instruments are actually easy to learn, in the beginning: piano and percussion instruments.“Improved”… meaning what, exactly?How does a piano need to be improved?Very, very, very, very smart people invented musical instruments, or improved them many, many years ago, even centuries - to the point at which no improvements are required, let alone desired.The violin was perfected in the 17th century. There are zero modifications that will improve it. Think about that. Over 300 years ago, the violin was perfected, for all intents and purposes.As were most other instruments between then and the mid 20th century.It takes actual commitment to become good at anything. And it is good some things are difficult because then you know those who stayed with it are dedicated and motivated to play well.I do not say any of this to discourage, far from it. I teach music, both piano, guitar and bass guitar. I WANT you to succeed. But I want you to also understand you will have to dedicate yourself to taking the time to learn. And that requires commitment.I want to teach you if you want to learn, and are serious about learning to play well. Maybe not professionally, but for personal enjoyment.And the greatest takeaway in learning to play an instrument well is that you will enjoy it for your entire life…even if it is not as easy as you want it to be. It is still worth every minute you invest in playing - because you are investing in YOURSELF in a way that is important.And THAT is why I teach…and why you should not worry about how hard it is to learn to play an instrument. Lots of things are hard.But learning to play music, hard as it may be, is one of the most rewarding things you can do for yourself because you get to enjoy playing music for your whole life.",UNKNOWN,Charlie Knoles,576,629,7.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-is-our-world-evolving-going-to-evolve-in-terms-of-humans-and-technology

RPA will streamArtificial intelligence affects every individual's life, and this changes mushrooms from commercial enterprises and non-commercial organizations.Before delving into the future of Artificial Intelligence and what it means for enterprises, it is imperative for businesses to leverage theLet's now understand the major upcoming trends of artificial intelligence of 2020 and beyond.Major Upcoming Trends of Artificial Intelligence to look out forHere are the top 6 trends you need to keep an eye out for.1. RPA will streamline business processesWhile right now, most robotic systems deployed in the workplace help employees automate simple tasks such as manufacturing, packaging, and production lines. More advanced software-based robots take on the high-frequency, repetitive, and relatively more complex jobs that employees administer on computers like getting forms filled, storing them, analyzing their data, and generating reports.Robotic process automationIn the future, enterprises that already use RPA will look for more ways to leverage these tools to enhance their business processes. This will replace the traditional practice of outsourcing operational tasks to less expensive off-shore locations by several in-house robots. In-house robot developers can also be put in place to design and deploy robotic intelligence as and when needed. This futuristic practice is called Robosourcing, wherein businesses will be outsourcing tasks to robots to help improve in enhancing their business processes and also employees' satisfaction and efficacy.2. Hyper-customization on the customer endAI-powered recommender algorithms (e.g., Amazon's ""Customers who bought this item also bought"" and Netflix's recommended programming) is something consumers are becoming quite accustomed to. And it's good for business, too.AI will enable businesses to serve up the right content to the right people at the right time based on what they've consumed, inquired for in the past, or their demographics.Take an example of Netflix, the leading entertainment streaming platform.Once logged in to your account, you receive relevant recommendations on what to consume next. Those recommendations are based on your behavior on the platform, like what genre of shows you previously watched, etc. When you choose to see the suggestions or don't, the machine learns your pattern and better understands your behavior.Artificial intelligence through ML can also help enterprises to serve their site visitors with brand's content like articles, blog posts, videos, ebooks, or other types of content that they might enjoy or need next, based on how they've interacted with the brand in the past.In the future, this personalization will be more sophisticated, allowing businesses to3. AI will process computer simulations to give precise decisionsThe quality of information available on customer trends, demand and supply of a product or service, and the past, present, and future market trajectory directly affects an enterprise and its operations.Cognitive AI helps in gathering this data and allowing businesses to make data-driven decisions. This data processing requires real-world interactions.But, as the methods of simulating real-world processes and mechanisms in digital forms are now improving, access to accurate data is easier than ever.For instance, Car manufacturers can gain thousands of hours of driving data without vehicles, even leaving the lab with the help of advanced simulations.This leads to big cuts in manufacturing costs. It also gives precise reports on desired variables as there is an increase in the quality and quantity of data possible for gathering.When AI enables computers to be robust and accurate-enough with data, it is possible to create many digital world simulations. This also helps mitigate the risks of expense and danger of testing AI systems in the real world.In near future, we will see an increase in the accuracy and availability of real-world simulations, which will help AI give more robust and accurate business decisions.4. Repurposing of all software and hardwareAI will seep deeper into the day-to-day lives of humans. This will be partly because the hardware and expertise needed to deploy AI become cheaper and more available in the future.AI will, therefore, be used more across all kinds of tools, gadgets, and devices. Right now, we are already using AI to make our mobile apps smarter and efficient. These apps give usIn the coming years, as the cost of hardware and software continues to fall, AI will be used to empower day-to-day complex devices like automobiles, household appliances, and workplace tools.Technology such as augmented reality and virtual reality display and paradigms like the cloud and Internet of Things sounds like SciFi but will become a reality in the near future. In the future, we will see a lot of devices of every shape and size that will start to think and learn for themselves.5. AI and Human Intelligence to make a better teamContrary to the common idea that AI will replace human jobs and make human employees obsolete, AI strengthens the capacity of every social employee, by helping them do better complex tasks and giving them adequate data.All devices capture of processing large volumes of data. They capture every transaction, every customer gesture, every micro- and macroeconomic indicator, and all the other information to help make better decisions.In the future, this data-rich environment will grow, and AI will help enterprises scrutinize all these data and create workflows for employees to digest. IT departments will have a flow of information using machines (databases, distributed file systems, and the like). AI will break these massive volumes of data down to small summaries for human consumption. Humans will then process these summaries using tools like spreadsheets, dashboards, and analytics applications and supplemented with human logic and other info.This is highly processed, and now manageably small data is presented for decision-making, which can be known as the ""data-driven"" workflow. Even in the future, human judgment would still be the central processor; only now, it would be using summarized data as a new input.6. A paradigm shift in the entertainment domainEntertainment is a way of stimulating oneself. It also creates a portal for humans to indulge in different realities. AI helps entertainment providers to create new realities efficiently.There always have been news making rounds that AI-generated music, poetry, or storytelling is now likely as good as humans. But there is still some way to go until their output is as enjoyable to us as the best that humans can produce.However, it is not possible to undermine the influence of AI on entertainment media. This year we saw acclaimed director Robert De Niro de-aged in front of our eyes with AI's assistance, in Martin Scorsese's epic The Irishman, and the use of AI in creating brand new visual effects and trickery is likely to become increasingly common.Some months ago, Netflix released the first-ever interactive show Bandersnatch, where viewers could interact with and control the storyline.Moreover, in video games, AI will be used to create futuristic scenarios and human-like characters for players. AI will also help players to adjust gameplay and difficulty, so players have a tailored and immersive experience within a single game.AI is also taking a quantum leap in terms of entertainment and gaming with augmented reality and virtual reality.ConclusionArtificial intelligence is not going to make human intelligence obsolete, but it will make things easier for everyone involved from big businesses to a single consumer.Artificial intelligence massively reduces the possibility of manual errors and leverages data on making the right decisions leaving no room for doubt or error.","284,852 followers",James Altucher,992,878,91.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-is-our-world-evolving-going-to-evolve-in-terms-of-humans-and-technology

Filling in structures, creating reports and graphs and delivering documentation and guidelines are for the most part undertakings that can be computerized by machines that watch what we do and figure out how to do it for us in a snappier and more smoothed out way. This mechanization – known as mechanical procedure computerization – will liberate us from the drudgery of tedious yet basic authoritative work, leaving us to invest more energy in intricate, key, innovative and relational errands.3. The AI AssistanceArtificial intelligenceThe client can expect more applications and projects that would be there with the Artificial Intelligence System, which permits the client to work different undertakings. The greater part of the pursuits are sifted through with the assistance of voice orders.4.

And keeping in mind that most independent things are right now tried in ensured situations or just in restricted zones, man-made reasoning is turning out to be better step by step. These self-sufficient things continue gaining from one another and soon you may see self-ruling robots a great deal openly!5.

How does Alexa understand the words you just said?In 1989 I was visiting Carnegie Mellon to decide if I would go to graduate school there.One of the graduate students, Kai-Fu-Lee (now one of the most famous investors in the world and I would check out his excellent recent TED talk on AI) showed me what he was working on:It was speech recognition for the 60 or so commands that might happen on a Navy battleship (ten guesses as to who was funding his project).When you say the word ""Fire!"" a sound wave is created. When you say the word ""hello"" a sound wave that looks different is created.If 100 people say ""Fire"" and 100 people say ""hello"", all of those sounds waves are stored in a database.Now, if a brand new person says ""Hello"" the computer program needs to determine if that person said ""Hello"" or ""fire"".There might be 10 different attributes of every sound wave. It breaks the new person's sound wave into those 10 attributes.Then it compares that ""vector"" of 10 attributes with all of the vectors in its database for ""Hello"" and ""Fire!""It uses a statistical technique called ""Hidden Markov Analysis"" to determine if the sound wave is more like the ""hello""s in the database or more like the ""Fire!"" in the database.Then it says to itself, ""This guy said ""Hello"". ""It then has a line of code that says, ""If someone says ""Hello"" Then say ""Hello"" back"".Additionally, it adds your ""Hello"" to its database.Your ""Hello"" might be slightly different than the other 100 ""Hello""s so it just learned a new way to say ""Hello"". That gives it greater ability in the future to recognize the word ""hello"".In other words, it ""learned"".So it used Statistics to hear you, code to respond to you, and database technology to learn. There's no real intelligence there but it feels like it's intelligence.Multiply that by 30 years and millions of patterns and computers a million times faster and you have Alexa and Siri in today's kitchens.Ask ""Siri"" what gender it is.-----B) EVALUATION FUNCTIONI just mentioned about language recognition. But how does a self-driving car work?Every second it has to make a decision. Does it move forward? Does it brake? Does it swerve to avoid an accident? Does it turn left?How does it get from point A to point B?1) Google Maps. - Using GPS it knows where it is. And it puts itself on Google Maps.2) List all of the possible routes. This is a ""hard"" problem in the mathematical sense (there's no way for it to guess the fastest route. It has to list each route and then sort by the shortest. )But now computers are so fast what would normally be a slow decision (drive me from this corner in Piscataway, New Jersey to the capital building of Sacramento, California) now just takes seconds.3) Waze. Use Waze to eliminate the routes with too much traffic.4) Start driving.5) Statistics: Every microsecond it uses statistics to see if there is blank space or an object that must be avoided or a traffic sign that must be followed.6) Decide what to do according to the code. For each traffic sign, it has code that tells it what to do (if a sign says ""Stop"" it Stops for a second, uses Statistics to see if any traffic is happening on its sides (with radar and cameras to provide the images). )If there is a person standing in front of it, it might just stop.If there's traffic it didn't expect, it might trigger the program to re-route.If it's blank space it will just keep going.If there's a baby crossing the street and it has to swerve to avoid hitting it, but if swerving will cause the car to hit a truck, killing the passenger in the car, then the ""AI"" of the car is dependent on the ethical decisions of the programmer of the car.In other words, in every situation, it determines it's options, then uses an ""evaluation function"" programmed by a coder, to determine which option has the most successful outcome (move the trip forward, don't kill anyone).Eventually the evaluation function will NOT be programmed by a human coder.Instead, through thousands of experiences of other self-driving cars, the experiences plus the outcomes will all be put into a central database.When a new experience is encountered, the code will look up that experience in the database and the database will spit back the best possible outcome.The code will learn statistically what the best outcomes are of each possibly decision and change the code accordingly and send updates to all self-driving cars.-----C) TREESThe hardest game in the world is a board game called GO. With chess, if a computer can evaluate a billion possibilities a second, it can be a world champion level player.But a Go game can involve trillions of possibilities. How did Google make a program, Deep Go, to beat the world's best Go player. This was thought to be impossible.And yet Google did it.For any game, a computer program first builds a tree of possibilities. Much like a human would.A human thinks: ""If I make this move in checkers, my opponent might respond with A, B, or C and then I can do D, E, or F and then my opponent can do G, H, I if I do D or it can do J, K, L if I do E and I'm never going to do F.A computer doesn't select as well as a human so it builds the FULL tree. Meaning, what are ALL of the possible moves it can do, what are ALL of the possible responses of my opponent, etc.And then it uses a programmed evaluation function to look at the leaves of the tree it built.Whichever move results in the best leaf of the tree (as determined by the evaluation function) that is the move it makes.That's how computer chess worked for decades. I'll get to the secret sauce in a second for how computers conquered chess.And then after that I'll describe how computers miraculously conquered Go.It's only a miracle until science can explain it. It's only ""intelligence"" until it can be coded by a programmer.D) HARDWAREEverybody thought for decades (including many Nobel Prize winners) that the best computer chess programs would be developed when scientists encoded the knowledge of the best chess players in the world into the evaluation function.How does the world champion value a position instead of a weak player?This turned out to be wrong.The MORE code in the evaluation function (i.e. the ""smarter"" the evaluation function was from a human perspective) the SLOWER the program.Which meant a smaller tree would be built, which meant less possibilities would be analyzed.What really allowed the programmers at IBM to build ""Deep Blue"" which beat Garry Kasparov in 1997 were two things.Both related to hardware.a. Computers got faster.And finally, they made the evaluation function STUPID in order to use less code so the hardware could value more positions.Then, before anyone caught on to their ""artificial intelligence"" they retired Deep Blue right after it beat the World Champion of chess.As hardware gets faster, artificial intelligence gets ""smarter"".[as an aside, I once gave a date a chip that was the initial chip for “Chip Test” - the “ancestor” of what became the best chess computer, Deep Blue. She was weirded out.]----INTERLUDEWhat I just described is all the basics. You can stop now.The rest of artificial intelligence is simply combining the basics to make more advanced techniques.-----E) STATISTICS + TREERemember the TREE from computer gaming. And STATISTICS from speech recognition.Now let's go to the impossible game of Go. Google developed the program ""AlphaGo"" to win at Go when everyone else thought it would take another 20 to 50 years.First, remember Kai-Fu Lee who worked on speech recognition. And later developed Apple's first attempts at speech recognition in the 90s?At one point in his grad student days, he was getting tired of navy battleship commands (as one does) and decided to focus on building a program to play Othello.He ended up building the world champion of Othello.He took a lot of games, let's say a million, and put them in a database. And each position from each game, he would label, ""winning"" (if it was a position on the winning side) or ""losing"" in a massive database.He would identify several attributes of each position (how many white pieces, versus black pieces, how many corners were controlled, how many pieces were on the sides, etc).Now, if the computer was playing a brand new game, it would determine all the attributes of that position, then use Hidden Markov Analysis (remember: speech recognition) to match that position to the database.If the position pattern-matched a ""winning position"" then it would make the move that would lead to that winning position. If it matched a ""losing position"" it would not make that move.That program became the world champion of Othello.AlphaGo took it one step further.It put in the positions of millions of Go positions and did the same sort of breakdown.It used faster hardware to speed up the process.Then, once it became pretty good at GO, it played BILLIONS of games against ITSELF to put many BILLIONS of new positions into the database. In other words, it ""learned"".Now it was ready to play Go. It crushed the world champion------That's basically it. That's all of artificial intelligence.Let's say a bank wanted to fire all of the employees in charge of lending. And replace them by artificial intelligence.How would the bank lend money?Well, there's 100s of millions of loans already out there. And for each person who has ever borrowed money I know:- their ageI can put all these vectors in a database and divide them into people ""most likely to pay back the loan"" and people ""most likely to default"".Then, just like speech recognition or the Othello program above, I can use statistics to determine who I should loan money to.And if I say ""no"", I don't have to explain. On to the next one!---Let's say I want to fight terrorists.I already have examples of many terrorists who trained in the US and then went on to perform or attempt acts of terror.I know everything about their bank accounts. How often they transferred money. How often they traveled. How often they took out cash versus using a debit card.And so on.I can build a vector of attributes of what a terrorist bank account looks like. Then I can match new people against that database of vectors of terrorists.Believe me, every time you do a bank transfer, some AI program is out there trying to determine if you are a terrorist.----This is all that AI is.It is nothing more. It's not ""intelligent"" from a human sense. It's not conscious, nor will it ever be.Here's how AI has improved in the past forty years (and how it will improve the next 40):- statistics has gotten betterWhat is changing the fastest is data. The land grab of modern society is not land, or gold, or oil.It's data.I have been invested in many companies that collect and sell data. I was an early investor (and on the board of)Believe me when I say, data-driven companies know how many strawberries you ate last summer.And right now that data is used mostly to target you for ads about sneakers. Or politics.But this is AI 1.0. Soon that data will be used to target your every movement, your every want, your every need.Amazon Prime won't be about delivering you what you want tomorrow. Amazon Prime Plus will be about delivering you what you want yesterday.Police 2.0 will be like the movie ""Minority Report"".Even art and music will be driven by AI that studies the neurochemical responses to music you like to music you don't like. And then compose accordingly.Where will humans still be unique?I don't know. Ask the humans with AI implants that enhance their brains so when they look at you they know exactly what answers will make you happy.BUT… will AI replace jobs?The answer (at least in the next decade or so…) is NO.Look at recent examples:A) Many people were worried ATM machines would replace bank tellers.Instead, the banks made so much in profits they opened up more branches than ever, creating new jobs.B) Will autonomous delivery services cost jobs.Right now there are millions of truck drivers involved in delivering goods. With autonomous delivery, less people will go shopping, more people will be required to shop in the aisles, finding products for people.Obviously this is not a high-end job. But this replaces the fact that less cashiers and drivers will be needed.Meanwhile, there will be more high-end jobs. More maintenance engineers for the cars, customer service, marketing, etc.C) Ecommerce. Branding will become less important (branding is VERY important when everyone is shopping at the big box store but advertising will have to become more clever and digital) so the millions in profits that are generated from AI will filter down to more people starting e-commerce ventures and the ancillary businesses associated with that.)Final conclusion:This is probably a net NEGATIVE for society as the higher classes will be able to afford “super AI” capabilities, making them demi-gods to lower-classes.Instead, massive profits will be generated, which will be soaked into the economy through a rising stock market, increase in opportunities, etc.","8,707 followers",Mario Galindo Queralt,529,637,8.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-is-our-world-evolving-going-to-evolve-in-terms-of-humans-and-technology
