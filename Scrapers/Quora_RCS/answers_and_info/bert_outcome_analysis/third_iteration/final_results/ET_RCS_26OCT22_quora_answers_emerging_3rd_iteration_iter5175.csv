2,"I think in the next twenty years coilguns will be used. Even now hobbyists are building them and have made fully automatic or selective fire versions capable of killing small game using off the shelf commercial parts. Coilguns are much quieter than normal firearms. They don’t have the barrel wear issues of railguns, but they are inherently more complex therefore they need a decde or two to mature to become operational. We are slowly getting to the point of strong enough batteries due to the recent development of some next gen lithium ions that might have the density of gasoline.

In the future we might be able to get batteries with the density of modern propellants, but that would be at least a few decades. Their advantage is that thay have a much flatter trajectory due to the stabilization of the magnetic fields on the projectile allowing for more accuracy.","15,093 followers",Jason Almendra,4.4K,21.3K,105.4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-has-the-best-chance-of-replacing-gunpowder-weapons-in-the-future
3,"If we didn't discover blackpowder (charcoal, saltpeter & sulfur). We still would have discovered & used smokeless powder. They're basically a mixture of nitrocellulose (guncotton) & nitroglycerine. (Kids don't fool around with these). As a military commander you need something called a “force multiplier”. A Kalashnikov rifle delivers 2k joules per shot. Mike Tyson in his prime could deliver a 1.6k joule punch, maximum.Force multiplication - WikipediaIf we didn't discover blackpowder (charcoal, saltpeter & sulfur).

4,"Forget weapons technology, the largest difference by far would be political. Gunpowder weapons slowly made all other weapons either obsolete (crossbow), or at least something that had to be used in combination with the gunpowder weapon (spear -> musket with bayonet).Without gunpowder there’s no way of creating a citizen militia army that stands a chance against professionals, clad in steel. They may win a battle here or there sure (Agincourt), but will lose far more often than not. This has a profound effect on development of culture, society and technology. It could well be Europe gets stuckForget weapons technology, the largest difference by far would be political.

They may win a battle here or there sure (Agincourt), but will lose far more often than not. This has a profound effect on development of culture, society and technology. It could well be Europe gets stuck in the pre-modern era, like China did.It is, of course, possible to create guncotton (nitrocellulose) without having knowledge of gunpowder. But why would you study nitrocellulose at all if you have no concept of explosive weapons? Gunpowder is made of materials that are easily available, you need a nitrate salt you can obtain from human urine or mined (saltpeter), charcoal is readily available and a little sulfur, which is not all that rare and had various uses.To produce guncotton you need nitric acid. To make nitric acid you need to route nitrogen oxide into water. That’s simple enough, but where do you source nitrogen oxide if you have no grasp of chemistry? You need to heat a mineral you know under the name “sweet lead”, then run the fumes into water, until you get a nice yellow liquid that stains everything:Nitric acid on skinThen you need to apply this to cloth or paper of some sort, then set that alight and observe it burns very quickly. Then you need to put that in a barrell and see it become an explosive. If you didn’t concentrate the nitric acid enough you will just observe it burn more rapidly.There’s a term for that: irreducible complexity. Legend goes the Chinese alchemist discovered gunpowder when he was searching for an elixir of life. The preparation of gunpowder is simple enough, powder the three ingredients, all of which are present and available, and set them alight. Even that only happened once in history to the best of our knowledge, even though it’s just a mixture of three powders an alchemist would have already. To get to guncotton you need to heat up a salt you normally wouldn’t heat, lead the fumes into water for some reason until you get a yellow liquid (and not just slightly yellow either, but until the foul-smelling vapors begin to penetrate through without dissolving), then apply the yellow liquid to cloth, then apply fire to cloth and discover it’s explosive. There’s no big puff of smoke like with gunpowder either so a small scrap won’t do.It’s possible I suppose, but likely? Only if you already have a running chemical society and are actively trying to find new and interesting things. It defies reason that an agricultural, feudal society would develop something like that. It’s not impossible, but it is rather unlikely.",0 followers,Pieter,1.3K,4.2K,24.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-has-the-best-chance-of-replacing-gunpowder-weapons-in-the-future

Not true at all. Technology has only ever been used as a tool toAnd frankly, in a similar vein,WhatAnd so today, there are graduates who barely scraped by in their degree, and who aren't actually capable of software engineering, andBack to the question: Software engineering requires human level understanding of the problem you're trying to solve. So does software “management”, especially if you're talking about creative product vision ownership and handling the interfacing with the client. Both fundamentally deal with people problems, and without human levels of learning and understanding, you can't replace either with software.The difference is that software engineering also requires an aptitude for writing software, for systems engineering, for breaking down problems into smaller pieces, for understanding multiple layers of complexity.So in either case we'd need a strong AI (which we're nowhere close to achieving, by the way — probably at least 20-50 years out). But in the software engineer case, we'd need a strong AIThink about it this way: How many stories do you know of software engineers becoming successful managers or product owners? How about the converse? Management is also an acquired skill, but I think it's not as rare as ability to write software. As such it's very likely to be harder for our first attempt at strong AI.That said, the creative aspects of product ownership areI'm just talking about what I've observed, and I'm looking at where salaries have been going for talented software engineers versus talented managers.Granted the historical management salary has been higher than that of the software engineer, but I ascribe that to the fact that the managers have also historically had closer relationships with those higher in the hierarchy. Even more than software, management is notoriously difficult to measure performance in objectively.But the very fact that the trend is reversing, that supply and demand is pushing software wages above management wages, implies to me that the skill of software engineering is more rare among humans than that of managing teams.But that said, we'reAnd if the customers who need software written don't want to talk directly to the AI (which lacks some level of human intelligence in this scenario), then the software engineers with the best people and design skills could be that last level of interfacing between the customer and the “AI software engineers”. Because who better to talk the right language than someone who knows how the sausage is made?So in all cases it's likely that software engineers will be the last job standing before strong AI can do","44,314 followers",Kurt Guntheroth,713,13.7K,167.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Will-5G-eliminate-the-need-for-fiber

Managing people well is a veryIf you study complexity one feature is that the next higher state is often amazingly unpredictable from what you see happening right now. Leaders are wrong more often than right, but can envision what PEOPLE are likely to be able to do that they’ve never done before and what might satisfy PEOPLE that has never existed before - the iPad, iPhone, etc., are thought to be among those things, maybe based on the wild idea of Star Trek communicators. It’s that complexity, not the complicated, multistep mechanical things that computers will be just fine doing - like designing more, bigger hardware and software programs and tools. That implies forward movement through evolution of what we know and possibly by massive trial and error, where human leadership has been able to make solid gains with much less trial and error.","135,539 followers",Hector Quintanilla,3.1K,1.2K,88.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-has-the-best-chance-of-replacing-gunpowder-weapons-in-the-future

There is no need for any trusted party to validate and secure transactions as anyone with the resources can participate in the validation ""mining"".
