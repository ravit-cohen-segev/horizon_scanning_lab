I can relay that while the European profits are realized in their home countries, the actual research is done in North America, due to a more favorable regulatory framework.See all of that blue, in every bar on the chart?

1,"Unfortunately, most of the ratings are old. For example, the Forbes article is dated by 2011. And I doubt that medical innovations can be measured in the number of articles. I can use information about how much of the GDP is invested in medicine, like the more money you have the more innovations you will produce. According to this logic, the leaders are:1.

5,"You don’t advance technology as a monolith. Germany is a leader in material science and mechanical engineering.Germany is sub-par in software engineering and in its physical communication infrastructure.

Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party. Because radiation from nuclear accidents is apparently scarier than way more people dying of regular pollution constantly and the total annihilation of all life on Earth as the oceans boil away.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-countries-produce-most-of-the-healthcare-innovations
6,"DRAM can actually be scaled to 8 channels (256-bit interface) but that’s only available on server boards and require processors with multiple memory controllers which occupy a lot of die space. Implementing this in consumer grade processors would be a waste of precious die space (larger die = more expensive) as the average joe does not anything higher than dual channel memory (128-bits) and current-gen platforms are capped to 128GB (4x32GB).For dedicated graphics memory, it boils down to power, signalling and PCB complexity. Most of the energy use is computers isDRAM can actually be scaled to 8 channels (256-bit interface) but that’s only available on server boards and require processors with multiple memory controllers which occupy a lot of die space.

Most of the energy use is computers isBesides, current-gen graphics card typically use GDDR6 memory on a 256-bit interface (so eight GDDR6 chips). Increasing the bus width would imply adding using more of those chips which in turn increase the PCB area required and thus power consumption as well. If you want a wider bus, go with a graphics card which uses high bandwidth memory (HBM), this offers higher bit density per module compared to any GDDR version but it is significantly more expensive and power hungry as it requires complex in-package interposers or bridges between the GPU and HBM module. HBM2 can for example use a 4096-bit interface.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-countries-produce-most-of-the-healthcare-innovations

8,"The hypothetical scenario:Let’s pretend, Proxima Centauri b is a habitable planet (sure, it orbits its host star in the goldilocks zone) and let’s pretend that it is inhabited by sapient and sentient intelligent life.So, life formed around 300 millions of years earlier since Proxima Centauri is about this time span older than our sunny sun and its solar system.If such a hypothetical intelligent species formed at around 4.4 billion years after the first fully developed single cell microbes formed, this hypothetical species would have developed roughly at around 300 Million BCE in the time beforThe hypothetical scenario:Let’s pretend, Proxima Centauri b is a habitable planet (sure, it orbits its host star in the goldilocks zone) and let’s pretend that it is inhabited by sapient and sentient intelligent life.So, life formed around 300 millions of years earlier since Proxima Centauri is about this time span older than our sunny sun and its solar system.If such a hypothetical intelligent species formed at around 4.4 billion years after the first fully developed single cell microbes formed, this hypothetical species would have developed roughly at around 300 Million BCE in the time before here on Earth dinosaurs roamed Earth.this would make the ProxCentaurians by far older than makind thus surely much more advanced. Probably they alreade left their tiny solar system for a bigger one or they retreated to a vast neverending virtual world.This is only valid if this sapient civilization went the scientific and technological way we humans do now.The first catch:In the imagination of most, any civilization inevitable would go the exact way, humanity developed from a stone age, to a mostly post-industrial space- and information age due to toe already achieved globalization of our humanities development.Pre-globalization, many cultures on Earth, especially those isolated from each other, let’s say, the ancient Romans and the ancient predecessors of the Mesoamerican Toltheks and the early Mayan, went into different directions.Whereas the Romans already were in the late iron age with almost modern cities, the early Mayans on the other side of the Oceanus Atlanticus still were in a late stone age (nevertheless with a fascinating civilization). The Roman and the Mayan concept of how a city works was slightly different (e.g. the placement of temples, the city quarters).Another thing on how much a civilization might progress is how strong the competitive nature is.So, a civilization could stick to an early agrarian stage for ages, not progressing much or it could have developed even faster than mankind (→ ancient steam engine by Heron, the water pipes in Greek temples, the first gas pipelines in ancient China, the modern printing in ancient China).The even bigger catch in this story?:In reality, Proxima Centauri is a small red dwarf star which is extremely active, it’s a flare star. This means, the strong flares, several dozen if not thousand times stronger than a solar flare of our calm yellow-white star and the need for the planet Proxima Centauri b to orbit its host star in the habitable zone means, that the red dwarf star surely stripped the planet from its atmosphere if it even had one.So, it’s much more likely that we have a barren rock orbiting Proxima Centaury than a blooming and thriving planet with an already 300 million years old civilization.The scenario, attendum:Assumed that ProxCent b is a habitable planet, how could we find evidence for a civilization or for any advanced large scale multicellular life?If the planet orbits its star, the starlight briefly shines through the atmosphere.When the light shines through the layers of the atmosphere, astronomers can analyze the atmosphere’s composition and can find out if the planet has bio markers like methane.If wen have sufficiently advanced telescopes, we could even see mountains, large oceans while the planet starts a transit.To find out, if the planet is inhabited by an advanced techlologically civilization, additional markers like industrial waste, artificial lights from the night side and other hints could be detected with a sufficiently capable telescope or an array with interferrometrie astronomy.The last proof would be radio signals or a laser communication when the laser beam generated coincidentially points to our direction (for instance as a result of the communication between the home base of their space program with a manned space station which lies between ProxCent b and our Earth at the right moment.Conclusion:It surely would be nice to have a neigboring AND friendly civilization but look back at the bigh catch on the story and we have to say bye, bye ProxCentaurians.Well, perhaps we could find life on a moon of Proxima Centauri c, a neptune sized planet farther out but witch an excentric orbit which allows for the gravitational forces to heat up the moon via the tidal forces and one day, a man made space probe reach this moon and finds life beneath the thick ice shell. *Dream mode on*.",778 followers,Rebecca Harbison,516,2.7K,2.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-countries-produce-most-of-the-healthcare-innovations
9,"There is no way to know. They could be millions of years ahead of us, or as intelligent as grass, if they even exist at all. Just because humans are on Earth (and think they are smart) does not mean that intelligent life developed on any other particular planet anywhere else.
