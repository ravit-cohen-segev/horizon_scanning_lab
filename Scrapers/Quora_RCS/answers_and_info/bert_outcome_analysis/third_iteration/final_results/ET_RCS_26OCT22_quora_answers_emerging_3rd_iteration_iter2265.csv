And this is pretty much word for word what grownups said about kids back then:Young kids get caught up with so many things ... and try to follow these things even when they are not at all mature enough to understand it. Going through pictures, videos ... etc. and knowing how adults live or talk or what are the ""cool"" things and then doing the same seems to be pretty much of a custom. Becoming parents before reaching the age of 16, doing drugs, using foul languages, making alcohol a grown up symbol, having sex so early, bashing society or parents, living with ""It's my life, I can do whatever I want"" philosophy etc. etc. They don't want to live with any rules it seems.The web has certainly changed society, including young people. But you're worrying about the same things grownups have always worried about when it comes to kids, Internet or no Internet.Yes, the web has magnified some problems. I worry that many kids are sensually deprived. They rarely make anything with their hands. They don't spend much time in nature. They don't hike or climb trees.Meanwhile, it has eased others. When I was growing up, in a small town in the 80s, me and my peers felt trapped. Like most teens, we didn't have the perspective to know that our lives would one day be different. And any kid who was a little bit different -- who was gay, ""too smart,"" into books or movies that his peers weren't into, etc. -- felt like he was alone in all the world.Because the Internet didn't exist, that teenage feeling of ""no one understands me"" was impossible to avoid. You couldn't just google ""Asperger's Syndrome"" or ""Star Trek fandom."" You couldn't go on Quora and ask for advice about that girl or boy you had a crush on.So many of my high school friends dealt with their isolation by turning to drugs and sex.

Internet has made a significant impact on everything from economics, society, health care, and spirituality. Internet has, however, created new challenges for society, and the most pressing one is its impact on children.We are witnessing the dramatic impact of social media, smartphones, and digital devices on our kids' daily lives, both at home and school. Children of all ages use tablets, smartphones, and apps, moving online and using their devices.Children's use of technology has numerous positives, but the Internet can also have disadvantages. Children who use technology today face many disadvantages. Both major and minor issues are prevalent, and both are as important as each other.It has been shown to negatively affect children in numerous studies over the years. This calls for careful guidance regarding internet usage by children. Let's go over the factors that make the Internet a threat to children.Effect on Physical Health:Having a healthy and active lifestyle begins at an early age for children. A large increase in the use of technology among children is diminishing the time spent performing physical activities as they spend more time using these devices.Many children now shun all outdoor activities because of the availability of games on the Internet. The result is that children do not get the exercise they need, which negatively impacts their health and well-being.Effect on Child development:Children's creativity plays an instrumental role in their development. Technology, on the other hand, can greatly diminish a child's creative ability. With the Internet at their disposal, kids can literally look up anything and everything, so they do not fully utilize their imagination. In the past, kids have used their imaginations to cultivate their creativity.Effect on Social Life:Social competence is starting to disappear from the lives of today's children. It has a lot to do with technology. Computers and games consoles are part of the everyday lives of most kids today.The importance of physical engagement with people in a child's early development cannot be overstated, but technology interferes with this and, as a consequence, creates a multitude of negative effects, such as poor social skills.Vulnerability of cybercrime:You probably know what we are talking about if you have been following the news lately. Child sexual abuse and molestation have been committed by pedophiles posing as good Samaritans, luring children into their traps.In addition, the Internet has eased access to children by unscrupulous elements, resulting in rising cases of kidnapping and identity theft. According to U.S. studies, about 60% of young people said they answered messages from strangers.Children have become extremely vulnerable to cyber-crime as a result of this kind of risky behavior.Today's children are also very concerned about manners and etiquette. Children today spend most of their time staring at whatever device they are using.It is clear that the Internet can be extremely spoiling for young children for many reasons, and it is my absolute belief that these issues will only worsen with time.",952 followers,Geoffrey Walton,613,570,3M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-Internet-spoiling-young-children
