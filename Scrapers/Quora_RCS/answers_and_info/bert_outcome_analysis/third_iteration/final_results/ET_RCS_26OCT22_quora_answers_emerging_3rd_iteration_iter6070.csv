1,"The hardest challenge is often finding strong leaders to surround yourself with. If you can do this, the rest of the journey is easier. This is what I find most challenging, and quite often it means you have to completely self-motivate, and drive change from within, rather than gaining moral support from others.","358,964 followers",Sean Kernan,891,5.6K,726.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/In-the-emerging-chaotic-workforce-and-dynamic-technological-changes-how-will-leadership-change-What-are-the-new-skills-leaders-will-require

Strong cattle, horses, stuff like that—which isn’t available everywhere in the world, especially not until they had bred critters specifically for it. And the horse collar wasn’t actually invented until the 5th century CE (in China, like so many other things)—until then, you basically only had oxen if you wanted to pull something heavy, horses get strangled if they pull with a collar for oxen. War chariots, yes, but they aren’t for heavy transport, they can only carry one or two people—they’re forAnd this shows something else: you also have to have aBecause next, you have to haveAnd to build a proper road network, you need not only the economy that makes it a useful proposition. You need the administration to collect taxes to pay for building them, and a long-term approach that makes you see how it’s a useful investment. You basically didn’t get that until the Romans, who needed a huge road network—not primarily for trade, but for quickly dispatching legions to whatever corner of their vast empire that needed an uprising quashed. (Again, the Chinese had similar ideas.) Generally speaking, you have no use for roads unless you have carts, and you have no use for carts unless you have roads; it was not until the big empires found reasons to have a lot of people move on foot that there was a use for roads that didn’t involve carts.So you see, it’s not just the wheel. You need the wheel to be useful for something, and that takes much more than just a lone genius somewhere.

5,"Good question—and one to which NO-ONE can or does know the answer since the invention of the wheel took place so far back in history that the event was not recorded and there is no archaeological evidence that can pull back the curtains of time on it, even though there is evidence of the presence of the wheel as a tool that could be used to move heavy loads early as 3500 BC, and a thousand years eGood question—and one to which NO-ONE can or does know the answer since the invention of the wheel took place so far back in history that the event was not recorded and there is no archaeological evidence that can pull back the curtains of time on it, even though there is evidence of the presence of the wheel as a tool that could be used to move heavy loads early as 3500 BC, and a thousand years earlier than that in the form of the potters’ wheel.One thing to keep in mind is that hind-sight is 20/20, and while it might seem like the invention of the wheel would be a no-brainer from our 21st-century perspective, it probably wasn’t as obvious or intuitive as it might seem. In fact, according to one researcher the manufacture of a useable wheel for the transporting of objects (the only reason for developing it) is not something that could evolve gradually over time; it was something all of whose parts needed to be put together into a useable system from the get-go for it to become a practical tool. If any one part didn’t work, then the entire contraption would have been considered useless and a waste of time. In fact, it might not even have been that obvious as to what a wheel could be used for in a practical sense.It reminds me of the clever FTX Super Bowl commercial of a Mesopotamian-type nobleman overseeing his workers in the fields when an enterprising inventor rolls up a large stone wheel. The overseer asks what it can do, while a group of workers drags a heavy head by on the ground in the background. The inventor replies that it can roll. The overseer dismisses it immediately, replying: “So does a bagel, but at least you can eat a bagel.”That nicely encapsulates a reason why the invention of the wheel was delayed: what purpose could it reasonably serve when another tool was already adequate for the task?One reason why it may have taken so long to invent the wheel is that examples of wheels and axles are not found in nature. Many tools are based on things that occur naturally in nature, and whose purpose can be discerned. And while it might be obvious that an object like a wheel can roll, it is useless without the axel. So, not only does someone have to conceive of a disk-like object that can roll but also of a contraption that connects it to a second disk-like object before it can even begin to become a useful tool.So, the really tricky thing about the wheel is not conceiving the notion of a cylinder rolling on its edge; it's figuring out how to connect a stable, stationary platform that can carry things to that cylinder without impeding the cylinder's movement.Also, making a wooden wheel is not as easy as simply chopping a disk from a tree trunk. Which, of course, implies that whoever is going to invent a wooden wheel has to live in an area where thick, straight trees can be found (not a lot of those in Mesopotamia, for instance). Also, that person would need to live in an area whose terrain is relatively flat so the wheel could reasonably negotiate the terrain (so, probably not a mountainous area).Besides, making a useable wooden wheel by creating a disk-like slice from a tree trunk would not work by itself because it would have quickly failed. The problem is that the direction of the grain in the trunk would have caused the disk to deform under weight, if not collapse. So, someone who hit upon the idea of creating a wheel-like tool to carry heavy objects from a trunk might have given up after initial failures.So, as can be seen in this imaged of one of the first wheel ever made, the solution was to build a composite wheel out of multiple vertically-cut planks. These would need to have been carefully doweled together and then shaped into a perfectly round form. But what good would that be? Make a nice table, maybe. But in order for it to be a functional tool, you would have needed another one just like it that could be connected in some way so they could work in tandem.That, of course, is what an axel does. So, the axel would also have to be invented at the same time. The first ones, as seen in the photo, had squared ends that fit into a square hole in the center of the wheel. This would mean that the wheel and the axel turned together. That is problematic because how could such a contraption be used to move a load? Well, you would need another such combination behind it and then attach some kind of platform on it that can be carried on the four-wheel contraption. But, since the axel turns along with the wheels, how would you attach the platform (the wagon bed) to the axels so the axels could still move?The obvious answer to that is to create an axel with perfectly round ends that would fit into round holes in the center of the wheels so the wheel could turn while the axel remained stationary. But that takes some ingenious work, and both the axel and the hole would need to be precisely carved so they fit together tightly enough that the whole contraption would not wobble dangerously, but loosely enough that the w...","9,587 followers",Max Searle,2.1K,82,6.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Can-a-technological-civilisation-comparable-to-ours-emerge-without-the-invention-of-the-wheel
