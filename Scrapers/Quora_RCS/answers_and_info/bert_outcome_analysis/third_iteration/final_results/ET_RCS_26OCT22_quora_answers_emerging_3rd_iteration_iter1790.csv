It's physically impossible to indefinitely consume a thing that exists in a finite quantity.Hybrids are a useful transitional technology, but they do have disadvantages, and it seems likely that as EVs mature over time, the practical limitations that have hindered their adoption will be sufficiently overcome to make them the preferred solution for most applications.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,17K,996,156M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-upcoming-technological-advances-to-hybrid-vehicle-in-the-next-few-years

2,"I hope that fully-electric vehicles don’t displace hybrids, particularly plug-in hybrids, in the near future.For those who don’t follow the ins and outs of vehicle electrification, hybrids have an internal combustion engine that works along with a bank of batteries and an electric motor to propel the car.In a plain-old hybrid, the batteries are always recharged by the gasoline engine. So the vehicle still gets its energy entirely from fossil fuels, albeit somewhat more efficiently than just an internal combustion engine (ICE) by tweaking whether gasoline or electric propulsion predominates.A pI hope that fully-electric vehicles don’t displace hybrids, particularly plug-in hybrids, in the near future.For those who don’t follow the ins and outs of vehicle electrification, hybrids have an internal combustion engine that works along with a bank of batteries and an electric motor to propel the car.In a plain-old hybrid, the batteries are always recharged by the gasoline engine. So the vehicle still gets its energy entirely from fossil fuels, albeit somewhat more efficiently than just an internal combustion engine (ICE) by tweaking whether gasoline or electric propulsion predominates.A plug-in hybrid adds the ability to recharge the batteries by plugging in to the power grid rather than burning gasoline. And in my opinion, this small tweak makes plug-in hybrids the transition technology that the transportation world needs for the next 50 to 100 years.The greatest advantage of plug-in hybrids is the ability to combatBecause most people drive fewer than 60 miles in a day, jamming 250 or more miles of range into an all-electric vehicle is really a waste of batteries, which are the single most expensive component of an electric vehicle. When the batteries decline in output and need to be replaced, it’s far more expensive to replace that larger battery pack. A plug-in hybrid lets an owner get by on 50 or 60 miles of electric range and then fill in with a little ICE power for the rare trips that exceed that range.Another advantage of plug-in hybrids over fully-electric vehicles is the charging regime. Charging for fully-electric vehicles is a delicate operation: you need to charge just often enough—but not too often—to get the most life out of your batteries. People aren’t really very good at doing this. They either charge their cars fully too often, or they run the batteries down almost to zero, which shortens the lifespan of most types of batteries.But a plug-in hybrid lets technology step in to charge the batteries at the perfect rate for their internal chemistry, never letting them get too low nor overcharging them. This technology is used by fully-electric vehicles, but because plug-in hybrids have an on-board charger, batteries get the attention they need even while the vehicle is in use.A final advantage of plug-in hybrids, which has not been fully realized yet, is the opportunity to fine-tune the ICE so that it performs its electric assist function at utmost efficiency. You might think that the gasoline engine is a stable technology that has reached its peak efficiency, since it’s been used in vehicles for over a hundred years. But, in fact, ICE power is not very well suited to transportation. The torque required for accelerating the vehicle from a standstill is very different from the torque required to keep moving at a uniform speed, and the engine RPMs to provide this torque rarely match those required for peak efficiency. In contrast, running an engine to recharge batteries requires stable and unchanging torque. When the market for plug-in hybrid is large enough, it’s likely that completely new ICE designs will arise, with the potential for much greater efficiency.I’m looking forward to a mix of all-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles together completely displacing traditional ICE vehicles. I hope it happens during my lifetime.","135,531 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.6M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-upcoming-technological-advances-to-hybrid-vehicle-in-the-next-few-years

11,Well the invention of radio brought us from just reading newspapers to hearing the latest news and entertainment in just a few years and then watching it on a television a few years after that. It took 60 or so years from us riding bicycles and horse draw garages to the automobile powering everyone everywhere and then to becoming the back bone of civilisation and transportation. It also went from us walking to us flying in the air to us going into outer space.
