1,"I don’t think so. Most of the Indian Banks use Finacle (by Infosys) and SBI uses Bancs (by TCS). Then there are many other software modules for various assets and liabiity products. Smaller nationalized banks such as Andhra Bank, Corporation Bank also have been technologically advanced. SBI being very large sized may has some scale advantages.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Why-SBI-has-more-advanced-technology-as-compared-to-other-nationalised-banks
2,"My simple answer - Job SecurityIf you are puzzled by the answer, compare a service banker/manager in SBI vs someone in private banks (like HDFC, ICICI, etc.). When you walk into a private bank branch and you even look lost thinking which counter to go to, there will be someone to ask you what you need and help you out. When you walk into an SBI branch, figure out who is the right person for the job, go to him or her and you still not might not get the job done.I went to three different branches to get a simple KYC update / mobile number update to get a reply “go get it done in your home branchMy simple answer - Job SecurityIf you are puzzled by the answer, compare a service banker/manager in SBI vs someone in private banks (like HDFC, ICICI, etc.).

This is when they saw that my home branch is 1000 km away in a different city. The funny thing is this is not even a rule that KYC update needs to be done in home branch as a fourth branch did it for me without question. Here, I compare with a HDFC or ICICI bank where you can visit the nearest branch to get the job done. Even better, most of the simple things are self serve via netbanking, unlike SBI, where you need to visit the branch for every little thing and the chances of getting the job done depends on the bankers mood.All this is because SBI is a government company where people have job security. Most employees (not all) do not deliver proper service to the customers and can still get away with it. This is not at all possible in a good private bank. Yes, they do handle a lot of low balance accounts and government schemes for poor to lower middle class fellow citizens, that does not justify the rudeness of the employees.","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,631,1.5K,2.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-SBI-has-more-advanced-technology-as-compared-to-other-nationalised-banks

Three of the servants of Sauron were upon the Bridge, but they withdrew and I pursued them westward. I came also upon two others, but they turned away southward.Furthermore; He was able to - albeit with some help call on the river to flood and temporarily stop the Nazgul.4.If your goal is to kill Orcs, Ecthelion of the house of Fountain is your guy. He killed more Orcs during the fall of Gondolin than anyone in the history of middle earth. More than Feanor, More than Fingolfin.If not for Ecthelion, Tuor would have been slain. Not only did he save Tuor’s life, He slew Morgoth’s second most powerful lieutenant AKA Gothmog who - due to being a maia was immensely powerful and just happened to be the leader of the Balrogs.While not about Ecthelion, song is about Gondolin. One of my all time favorite songs:3.""For Fëanor was made the mightiest in all parts of body and mind: in valour, in endurance, in beauty, in understanding, in skill, in strength and subtlety alike: of all the Children of Ilúvatar, and a bright flame was in him.""― Quenta Silmarillion, ""Of the Sun and Moon and the Hiding of Valinor""This fucking guy….He was the greatest of the children of Ilúvatar. He was the most beautiful, the most knowledgeable, the most skilled smith, and could convince really smart people to literally leave Heaven ← This actually happened. He wanted revenge and his jewels back. Problem was he was a fucking conceited Jackass who would not listen to a soul.Anyway, Back to the question. Not only was Fëanor a great fighter, he could also recruit you an army with his words, and arm them with the best weapons he himself creates.If you do get him on your side, Just make sure you bring his younger brother with you. He would be your only chance to stop Fëanor when he gets bored with you and attempts a coupe.2.He was technically half man, Half Elf but since this is my list and he ended up as an Elf anyway, I will allow it.He was destined to be a savior. Though his life is full of tragedy, He is immensely powerful, and the lone reason why the Forces of Valar(Led by Eaonwe the Maia) were able to beat the armies of Morgoth.Then, seeing that his hosts were overthrown and his power dispersed, Morgoth quailed, and he dared not to come forth himself. But he loosed upon his foes the last desperate assault that he had prepared, and out of the pits of Angband there issued the winged dragons, that had not before been seen; and so sudden and ruinous was the onset of that dreadful fleet that the host of the Valar was driven back, for the coming of the dragons was with great thunder, and lightning, and a tempest of fire.But Eärendil came, shining with white flame, and about Vingilot were gathered all the great birds of heaven and Thorondor was their captain, and there was battle in the air all the day and through a dark night of doubt. Before the rising of the sun Eärendil slew Ancalagon the Black, the mightiest of the dragon-host, and cast him from the sky; and he fell upon the towers of Thangorodrim, and they were broken in his ruin.SilmarillionIf you kill the biggest dragon in the history of middle earth, One so large he broke a mountain range when he fell, you are a certified Badass.Remember when I said to bring Fëanor’s younger brother with you? Say Hello to the most badass Elf to have ever lived. Although Fëanor was more learned, Fingolfin was the strongest and most valiant of children of Ilúvatar.Dagor Bragollach(Battle of sudden flame) was a turning point for the Noldor. They were defeated on all fronts and pushed back. With so many losses, Fingolfin attempted a feat which stamps his name as the Baddest living thing to have ever existed. He rode up to the gates of Angband(Literally Hell), and challenged Morgoth, the second most powerful deity in the world - besides Eru himself.Then Fingolfin beheld (as it seemed to him) the utter ruin of the Noldor, and the defeat beyond redress of all their houses; and filled with wrath and despair he mounted upon Rochallor his great horse and rode forth alone, and none might restrain him. He passed over Dor-nu-Fauglith like a wind amid the dust, and all that beheld his onset fled in amaze, thinking that Oromë himself was come: for a great madness of rage was upon him, so that his eyes shone like the eyes of the Valar. Thus he came alone to Angband's gates, and he sounded his horn, and smote once more upon the brazen doors, and challenged Morgoth to come forth to single combat. And Morgoth came.That was the last time in those wars that he passed the doors of his stronghold, and it is said that he took not the challenge willingly; for though his might was greatest of all things in this world, alone of the Valar he knew fear. But he could not now deny the challenge before the face of his captains; for the rocks rang with the shrill music of Fingolfin's horn, and his voice came keen and clear down into the depths of Angband; and Fingolfin named Morgoth craven, and lord of slaves. Therefore Morgoth came, climbing slowly from his subterranean throne, and the rumour of his feet was like thunder underground. And he issued forth clad in black armour; and he stood before the King like a tower, iron-crowned, and his vast shield, sable on-blazoned, cast a shadow over him like a stormcloud. But Fingolfin gleamed beneath it as a star; for his mail was overlaid with silver, and his blue shield was set with crystals; and he drew his sword Ringil, that glittered like ice.Then Morgoth hurled aloft Grond, the Hammer of the Underworld, and swung it down like a bolt of thunder. But Fingolfin sprang aside, and Grond rent a mighty pit in the earth, whence smoke and fire darted. Many times Morgoth essayed to smite him, and each time Fingolfin leaped away, as a 'lightning shoots from under a dark cloud; and he wounded Morgoth with seven wounds, and seven times Morgoth gave a cry of anguish, whereat the hosts of Angband fell upon their faces in dismay, and the cries echoed in the Northlands.But at the last the King grew weary, and Morgoth bore down his shield upon him. Thrice he was crushed to his knees, and thrice arose again and bore up his broken shield and stricken helm. But the earth was all rent and pitted about him, and he stumbled and fell backward before the feet of Morgoth; and Morgoth set his left foot upon his neck, and the weight of it was like a fallen hill. Yet with his last and desperate stroke Fingolfin hewed the foot with Ringil, and the blood gashed forth black and smoking and filled the pits of Grond.Thus died Fingolfin, High King of the Noldor, most proud and valiant of the Elven-kings of old. The Orcs made no boast of that duel at the gate; neither do the Elves sing of it, for their sorrow is too deep. Yet the tale of it is remembered still, for Thorondor King of Eagles brought the tidings to Gondolin, and to Hithlum afar off. And Morgoth took the body of the Elven-king and broke it, and would cast it to his wolves; but Thorondor came hasting from his eyrie among the peaks of the Crissaegrim, and he stooped upon Morgoth and marred his face. The rushing of the wings of Thorondor was like the noise of the winds of Manwë, and he seized the body in his mighty talons, and soaring suddenly above the darts of the Orcs he bore the King away. And he laid him upon a mountain-top that looked from the north upon the hidden valley of Gondolin; and Turgon coming built a high cairn over his father. No Orc dared ever after to pass over the mount of Fingolfin or draw nigh his tomb, until the doom of Gondolin was come and treachery was born among his kin. Morgoth went ever halt of one foot after that day, and the pain of his wounds could not be healed; and in his face was the scar that Thorondor made.Silmarillion - Of the Ruin of Beleriand and the Fall of FingolfinTo put this into perspective, Melkor was so powerful that he had dominion over most of Beleriand while he was fighting THE OTHER VALAR COMBINED. It took Tulkas joining the Valar to tip the balance of power in their favor. Of course, Morgoth’s power was diminished at the time of his duel against Fingolfin, but that doesn't take away from the courage it takes to challenge essentially Satan to a duel.Furthermore; Morgoth was so terrifying that he could turn Elves into his spies.Thus in his rear and to the north Morgoth had no foes, and by that way his spies at times went out, and came by devious routes into Beleriand. And desiring above all to sow fear and disunion among the Eldar, he commanded the Orcs to take alive any of them that they could and bring them bound to Angband; and some he so daunted by the terror of his eyes that they needed no chains more, but walked ever in fear of him, doing his will wherever they might be.Yet, none of this seemed to affect Fingolfin. Instead of Cowering staring at Morgoth, He cursed at Morgoth and even called him a coward…I cant think of a more courageous deed in all the history of middle earth.PS - I typically answer these questions hoping I can entice as many people as possible to read the Tolkien legenderium. I believe if I can show how deep, exciting, and amazing the books are, maybe people would get over the “it is too hard to read” issue.Edit - Going through Spotify, I was reminded of these gems. These are some true gems by Blind Guardian. I will attach each song to the character the song was meant for.

The Coopers who failed ended up making “dry barrels” that only held produce or things that wouldn’t spoil. There are very few people who know how to make a barrel today. Even Jack Daniels, the biggest barrel maker in the world, uses an automated process now because making them by hand is too slow. The art of coopering is dying. There are very, very few people who know how to make a barrel left in the world and fewer every year, yet barrel making was an advanced technology that changed the entire world for literally thousands of years.Incidentally. the most prolific barrel in the world today is the ASB or American Standard Barrel that hold 53 gallons because America makes more barrels than anyone else in the world. Many used Jack Daniels barrels are re-used to make other kinds of liquor in other parts of the world.Do you know who the highest paid man in the community was in “ancient times”? It was the Wheelwright.Making a wheel from wood with an axle that attaches to a cart and doesn’t fall apart within a mile or two is one of the most “advanced technologies” of all time. Without it, most civilizations would have failed or failed to spread. Cart wheels are complex and the forces must play against each other continuously to hold the wheel together as it rolls. A Cartwright made as much then as a jet airline pilot back does today. In the 1880s when the average wage was $1.50 a day, the Wheelwright was making 90 dollars a week. On the Mayflower they brought one single cart over to America and it was the most valuable thing on the ship manifest, worth more than 10 times the next most valuable thing on the ship. Can you make a cartwheel?

More often it simply made you poorer by the price of a chicken.After that you could calculate your profit from eggs and goat’s milk and balance that against the cost of grain and fish and vegetables for you and your family. It became trivial to discover the basic price for each that would guarantee you would make a profit (however small) and still be competitive with your neighbors.Before that wealth could only be had by accumulating more goons than anybody else in your area, and then thrashing everybody else periodically until they handed theirs over to you.Algebra made peace possible.It also gave mankind a good reason to use reason to solve life’s travails, rather than cower in the darkness and pray that tomorrow’s situation would be better.It gave men and women a means of distributing scarce resources fairly, and still ensure that enough was left over to plant crops next year and feed the domestic animals,It was the first magic that worked. Always. It was reproducible — anybody who had the knack could do it. You could dump your shaman (the lecherous old leech didn’t do all that much anyway), and teach your kids the same knack so that their lives would be better too.It made writing valuable — before that the only use for it was to perpetuate myths and fables that entertained people, and who needed that anyway? Memory would do that just as well, and initially only the leisure class could afford to waste days sitting on their rumps learning all those jiggly little symbols, assigning sounds to each one.Algebra was magic incarnate — it gave written symbols power over the world that mere myths and fables ...","114,094 followers",Alon Amit,1.4K,7.5K,119.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-SBI-has-more-advanced-technology-as-compared-to-other-nationalised-banks

So, Israel today, has the talent, the concentration and the genetic presence to give Israel;the Jewish Country -the best input, from the best of science and technology.Israel is a Western nation. It is a free economy, a democracy and has many companies that have serious R&D units.2/3 of all households have internet, all businesses have high-speed internet, the telephone network is excellent, and new Start-ups are the standard, and impressive. Most high-school kids and 80% of all adults have smart-phones.For obvious reasons the Military industries are very advance and support our High-Tech Army. We have portable computers with most field-companies, drones overhead, the latest jets in the air and our satellites in the sky.Our tanks are technological wonders.

It’s ok though, because I’ve been thinking about it for the better part of thirty years. I learned a reasonable amount of math, and I taught a good deal of math. Of myself, my friends, and my own students, I’ve observed this: no one ever manages to master level N+1 by merely understanding the mechanics, but not the why, of level N. Not once.

It’s ok though, because I’ve been thinking about it for the better part of thirty years. I learned a reasonable amount of math, and I taught a good deal of math. Of myself, my friends, and my own students, I’ve observed this: no one ever manages to master level N+1 by merely understanding the mechanics, but not the why, of level N. Not once. As a teacher, this informs everything I do.Now, what exactly constitutes a “level” here is necessarily quite vague. Also, what “why” means is also quite vague. So don’t expect this claim to be easy to recognize and apply, or refute. But there are lots and lots of instances in math where mastering the next idea requires having full and complete mastery of the previous idea, and this becomes increasingly true as things progress.Many students know how to add fractions, with the common denominator and all that, without fully understanding why they’re doing what they’re doing. Even more students can carry out long division without truly, fully understanding why this particular algorithm works. This is characteristic of the early years: things are so foundational that explaining them is actually quite tricky, and it’s not impossible to survive for several years in school without knowing the reasons such algorithms work.But when you get to polynomial division, and manipulating rational fractions, and the algebra of complex numbers – at that point, if you’re only able to mechanically carry out the addition of simple fractions but have no idea why it works, you’re in serious trouble.By the time you get to calculus and linear algebra, all that changes even more deeply. You’ll be expected to startA student of physics asked me for help a few months ago. He had to solve a problem about a cannon firing a cannonball from a high hill into a lower plane. The question had something to do with the angle, and the initial velocity, and the landing point on the ground. Doesn’t matter. The point is: the student, a bright and hard-working kid, had not a shred of a clue what to do, because he never saw cannons firing from a higher ground in kinematics problems.He did learn how to solve problems with cannons firing things that land at the same ground level as the cannon itself. A simple parabola with the ground serving as theYou can know all theAs you progress in your studies, your (better) teachers will make you solve problems you’ve never seen solved. This is what math is actually about. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve heard students badger the prof to tell them if “this is for the test”, and when something is in the test which doesn’t match perfectly some problem that was given in class, they feel mistreated. They’re not. They are being taught what it means to understand mathematical ideas and use them.If you know, mechanically, how to solve inequalities of the form(is true, then you won’t have any idea how to solve any combinatorial problem that is slightly more elaborate than the number of 3-person committees in a class of ten students. If you know, mechanically, that the circle with radiusYou say you want to study calculus and linear algebra eventually. Here’s my warm advice: drop the attitude that has you question if you really need to understand “why something works”. There’s absolutely no reason for you to study these things if you’re not really curious to know why things work. There are many other beautiful things in the world you can pursue and study; but if you wish to study math, make every effort to understand every possible","68,793 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/In-Middle-Earth-which-race-has-the-most-advanced-technology
