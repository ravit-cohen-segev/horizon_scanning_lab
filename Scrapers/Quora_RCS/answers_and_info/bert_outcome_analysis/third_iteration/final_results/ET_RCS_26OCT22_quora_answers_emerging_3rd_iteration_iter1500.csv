She insisted she was through to the right person, and it was only then did he realize what was happening.Tim Teneyck had seen similar scenarios being shared on social media, but never thought he’d be in the same position today.Here's a transcript of the conversation:Mr Teneyck:Caller:Mr Teneyck:Caller:Mr Teneyck:Caller:Mr Teneyck:Throughout the call, the woman found methods to respond to Mr Teneyck’s yes or no questions.Mr Teneyck:Caller:Mr Teneyck:Caller:The back and forth questions worked. The perpetrator who came home intoxicated and began to behave violently, was caught and arrested.In that moment, the daughter had to think quickly to protect herself and her mother — a hero!Mr Teneyck encouraged victims from that day onwards, to use the words “pepperoni pizza” as a magic word if the abusive person is in close proximity, when calling 911.I can only imagine how difficult his job is. The amount of patience and emotional control a person needs for this career is admirable. He could have easily brushed it off as a prank call, but his dedication to this woman is inspiring.Sitting on the other side of the phone line, not being able to physically be there in person, but to save someone through your words requires strength.","90,341 followers",Alisha Talks,21.9K,910,103.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-of-todays-problems-might-be-solved-in-the-future-with-technology

It is not going to be investment banking, private equity, consulting, hedge funds or venture capital. Can you guess?It is the FINTECH . In my opinion, financial services has faced the least disruption over time. May be credit card, ATM, Pay pal. Anything big you can think of. Now comes the fintech revolution. Currently, one of the industries facing the most exciting innovotive disruption is the financial services. Financial Technology ( Fintech) has the potential to revolutionize the way consumers undertaking financial transactions. It can range from facilitating mobile and online payments and transactions, providing financial planning and advisory, help consumers and businessess in receiving loans and financing.The size of the fintech market is steadily on the rise. You know, which is fintech capital of the world. Any guesses? It is London. Brexit is putting a cloud on its dreams. Yet pundits are of the opinion, that London will overcome the temporary difficulties. Germany is trying to snatch away something from London. It even ran a van across London with a message, 'Dont worry ! Come to Berlin' No doubt the fintech startups in London are worried and some are seriously considering moving to many alternative attractions in Europe, but nothing can replace London. Dublin in Ireland can come closest.Now coming to US. Again another trivia. New York fintech startups attracted more funding than fintechs in silicon valley. In US alone, about 20k fintech startups responsible for creating 500k jobs. More than $50 B is reported to have been invested in fintechs around the world. In the the first quarter ending March 2016, it is estimated fintechs have attracted an investment of $5B.Let me list some of the familiar areas in fintech and some popular and some less popular names currently in fintech.There are thousands around the world aiming big.1. PAYMENTS: PAYPAL, Square, Transferwise, Coin and Stripe.2. TREASURY functions: Coinbase, Digital Assets Holdings, Blockstream, Ripple.3. LENDING: CreditKarma, Sofi, Lending Club, Prosper, Funding Circle, Kabbage, LendUp, OneDeck, Avant.4. RETAIL BANKING: Circle Internet Financial, Mozido.5. INVESTMENT BANKING: Kensho, Circleup, Axial, Iex.6. WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Robinhood, Wealthfront, Betterment.7. FINANCIAL INFO: Angellist, Equidate.These are only handful and there are hundreds of them around the world joggling for place.On their part, Big banks like Citibank ( it has more than 50 percent of its business from retail banking and hence most threatened) have set up a seperate nucleus unit to work on fintech solutions and JPMorgan is following a unique method of allowing fintech startups to work hand-in-hand with their staff, for a period of 6 months and any successful start-up will have the benefit of funding from the bank.The answer is getting too long. I have not talked about crypo currencies, block chain technology and so on.So if you want a piece of action, prepare yourself .","41,553 followers",Rakshith Akira,3.9K,467,18.3M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Which-of-todays-problems-might-be-solved-in-the-future-with-technology

This led to the creation of “specialists”- a handful of people who were masters of the art.Today, internet has completely changed the dynamic. To learn Data Science, I can choose from 10,000 resources on the internet. Just 10 years ago, it wouldn't have been possible. This has led to the creation of “generalists”- people who are jacks of many trades and masters of probably none.Thing is, we need generalists as much as we need specialists. Generalized skills can be transferred at a rapid pace thus quickly building up a work force.Internet can easily be used to transfer these skills from one part of the globe to another. This no longer limits tech innovation and tech jobs to miniscule pockets in developed countries.As a result, tech jobs are springing up in the remotest of areas in the most backward of countries. A lot of these places are giving competition to Silicon Valley. Even in USA itself, cities are trying increase the number and quality of tech jobs...",4 followers,Matthew Bates,553,9.8K,293.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-sector-of-the-technology-industry-will-have-the-most-job-openings-and-job-opportunities-in-the-next-5-years

By this, they can save the advertisement and consultancy fees. Of course they will hire after interviews and based on your experience and knowledge for the job.Job Portals:Before approaching to consultancy company, they try to find the candidate through Job portals. You are create your attractive resume mentioning your desired job profiles and work experience in detail. If company find you suitable for the job, they will contact you directly.Plan a Visit to Qatar:If you can spend some money, you can plan your visit to Qatar.

6,I'd guess almost certainly not. Nothing beats rockets to get the speed you need for orbit.UpdateMy understanding is that high altitude balloons are basically around 50km up. Orbit only starts at around 300km ... so they're only going to do about 6th of the distance you need.

10,"If the artificial intelligence and internet – with its tools such as Facebook or Skype – changed the global economy, entertainment and politics, why not change education? It’s already happening, but we need to take it to the next level. Modern learning methods let students think independently, get immediate feedback, and look at the world from the entirely different perspective. We have blogged about it on our company blog since as an app development agency we have had a pleasure to work with education start-ups quite a bit.","135,532 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-sector-of-the-technology-industry-will-have-the-most-job-openings-and-job-opportunities-in-the-next-5-years

You nod, still tired from work. The automated driver quickly recommends a restaurant nearby and you accept. You’ve never been to this restaurant before but the automated driver knows everything about you and has guessed a restaurant that you’ll love.The automated driver drops you off at the restaurant, calculates the time it will take you to eat, then goes off to pick up more people, ordering for another self-driving cab to pick you up once you’re finished.A while later you come back outside, happy that the food was so good. A cab is waiting for you and you step inside before being driven home.From there, you watch a VR movie and interact with a couple of the characters before taking a pill and going straight to sleep. Your day is over.…That was my approximation of a day in the future. What does all the technology in the above scenerio have in common?Algorithms.Specifically, computer code written to maximize efficiency. You might think that self-driving cars will be the biggest thing in coming years but what you might not expect is the programmer who makes billions off the software for the automated cab driver that recommends restaurants. Good for the customer, good for the restaurant, good for the self-driving cab.Your life is being increasingly dictated by algorithms designed to maximize efficiency. The ticket price when you step on a plane was decided by a computer. So was the price of a train ticket, or shelf item at a store.AI is going to be big, but what will be big earlier will be the algorithms that power the world and maximize efficiency. It isn’t a huge revolution, just a quiet growing efficiency in everything we do.","246,849 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Which-sector-of-the-technology-industry-will-have-the-most-job-openings-and-job-opportunities-in-the-next-5-years
