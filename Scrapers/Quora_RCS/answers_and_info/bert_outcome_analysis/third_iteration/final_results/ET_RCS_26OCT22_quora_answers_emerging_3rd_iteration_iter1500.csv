Our team at Grammarly has compiled a handy list of common grammatical errors to help make your writing accurate, clear, and professional.Ambiguous (“Squinting”) modifiersA squinting modifier is a misplaced modifier that, because of its location in a sentence, could modify either the phrase that precedes it or the one that follows it. In the example sentence, is the subject listening to music slowly or slowly getting a headache? To correct a squinting modifier, move its position in the sentence to clarify to the reader which word you intend to modify.Misuse of lie/layIf you plan to place or put an object somewhere, such as a plate on a table, you should use “lay.” If you intend to stretch out on a bed for a nap, you should use “lie.” The verb “lie” is an intransitive verb, which means it does not need an object. The transitive verb “lay” requires an object.It may take some getting used to this “lay” or “lie” business; after all, misuse of these verbs is common. But if you remember to lay down your fork before you’re full, then you won’t have to lie down later from overeating.Comma splicesHe was very hungry, so he ate a whole pizza.To splice means to connect or join. When a writer joins two independent sentences with a comma instead of separating them with a period or coordinating conjunction, that’s a comma splice.The comma has its jobs to do, but connecting two independent sentences isn’t one of them. Besides, the period gets testy when his sister, the comma, steals his thunder. Periods have their jobs, and so do commas, but never the twain shall meet—unless it’s in the form of a semicolon. Semicolons can also take the place of a coordinating conjunction, such as “and,” “but,” or “so,” among others.Run-on sentencesRun-on sentences, also known as fused sentences, occur when two complete sentences are squashed together without using a coordinating conjunction or proper punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon. Run-on sentences can be short or long. A long sentence isn’t necessarily a run-on sentence.To avoid run-on sentences, see if there is more than one idea communicated by two or more independent clauses. In our examples, there are two complete sentences:Example:Example:Both sentences are complete ideas by themselves; therefore, use a semicolon or a period to indicate that they are separate independent clauses.Using “could of” instead of “could have”“Could have” is always correct; “could of” never is. Writers probably make this grammar gaffe because, when we speak, the contraction “could’ve” sounds an awful lot like “could of.”TautologiesTautologies express the same thing twice with different words. In our example, the word “made” implies that Jack used his own two hands to create the pail. The prepositional phrase “with his own hands” creates a redundancy. Once you know what they are, it’s fun to discover tautologies: dilapidated ruins, close proximity, added bonus, large crowd...The list goes on and on!After reading through this list of common grammatical mistakes, you might be wondering how to remember all these rules as you write.

3,"Look at education today.That’s basically how education will look like in 10 years.Schools and universities are archaic institutions, run by academics that know about their subject matter but don’t know anything about how to move the education system forwards.Educational institutions today are run by people that have been brought up in the system, and so are the last people in the world to change it.Education is going to change, but it’ll change slowly.",30 followers,Vijaya Lakshmi,2.8K,1.2K,43.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-is-technology-going-to-impact-education-over-the-next-25-years

The automated cab driver greets you cheerfully as you step inside and scans your hand before automatically deducting a fee from your account.

You nod, still tired from work. The automated driver quickly recommends a restaurant nearby and you accept. You’ve never been to this restaurant before but the automated driver knows everything about you and has guessed a restaurant that you’ll love.The automated driver drops you off at the restaurant, calculates the time it will take you to eat, then goes off to pick up more people, ordering for another self-driving cab to pick you up once you’re finished.A while later you come back outside, happy that the food was so good. A cab is waiting for you and you step inside before being driven home.From there, you watch a VR movie and interact with a couple of the characters before taking a pill and going straight to sleep. Your day is over.…That was my approximation of a day in the future. What does all the technology in the above scenerio have in common?Algorithms.Specifically, computer code written to maximize efficiency. You might think that self-driving cars will be the biggest thing in coming years but what you might not expect is the programmer who makes billions off the software for the automated cab driver that recommends restaurants. Good for the customer, good for the restaurant, good for the self-driving cab.Your life is being increasingly dictated by algorithms designed to maximize efficiency. The ticket price when you step on a plane was decided by a computer. So was the price of a train ticket, or shelf item at a store.AI is going to be big, but what will be big earlier will be the algorithms that power the world and maximize efficiency. It isn’t a huge revolution, just a quiet growing efficiency in everything we do.","135,499 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.5M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-is-technology-going-to-impact-education-over-the-next-25-years
