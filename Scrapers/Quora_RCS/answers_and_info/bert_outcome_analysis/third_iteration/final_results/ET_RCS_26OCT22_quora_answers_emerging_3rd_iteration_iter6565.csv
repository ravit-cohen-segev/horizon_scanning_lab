0,"In one angle, yes. Technology needs to develop this fast so that the living of human beings becomes even more easier. But it should also be compromising with nature. In another angle, no, technology should not develop so fast. By the way it cannot be stopped, but then we may also become lazier due to developing technology. It may also harm the nature. So, according to me, in this angle, no.",3 followers,Samuel Bateman,1.1K,102,56.4K,UNKNOWN,https://www.quora.com/Does-technology-really-need-to-evolve-this-much-faster

Not to mention that the mutation rate of RNA viruses are many orders of magnitude higher than our own cells.The good news is that we don’t need to wait for the sluggish mutations in our genome because human immune system evolved similar tricks. During B cell activation, antigen specific B cells expand in numbers and acquire random point mutations in the binding sites of antibodies. B cells that acquired higher binding affinity are selected for the next round of clonal selection. As a result, an average memory B cell carries 15~20 point mutations. Even if some viruses like HIV mutate all the time to evade antibodies, a few people’s B cells can evolve to neutralize nearly 100% of HIV strains and acquire dozens of point mutations. This could possibly explain even though viruses mutate way faster, only a few viruses like HIV, influenza, and HCV can outrun our immune system.",366 followers,Brett Alder,1.1K,0,0,2022,https://www.quora.com/Does-technology-really-need-to-evolve-this-much-faster

Grab a drink.This is a fairly interesting question, because there are so many different scenarios that can be gone through. Alternate advancement, the same tech (but a lot later down the line), full-on sci-fi utopia, etc.I’m not going to go through every scenario and just list the one that I personally see as being the most likely/most fun to think about.I think that if war never existed, it would go something like this;Alternate advancement.While there is no war, humans are still humans. We like to fight and compete. The world leaders understand this, and the more enlightened among us tell them this.With the “humans like to fight” fact firmly rooted in reality, both our current and alternate realities, there would be a “Peacekeeper” force for each nation. I use the term “Peacekeeper” because an actual military would be a foreign concept.The peacekeepers’ purpose would be as a safeguard against anyone who might “change their mind.”A Peacekeeper would probably look something like this, if not a 1:1 match.This is a soldier from the Death Korps of Krieg in Warhammer 40k. They heavily draw influence from World War 1 and 2 (mostly 1) in almost all aspects. Their uniforms, their strategies and tactics, and weapons (as far as ballistic weaponry goes). We would still have things like machine guns like the Maxim, rifles like WW2’s StG-44, and vehicles like the M3 Halftrack and the M12 Self-Propelled Gun.There is a twist, however.Wanna know what our homes and cities would look like? They would look like this.That’s the Citadel from Mass Effect. I’m not saying we will have floating cities in space, or contact with sentient extra-terrestrials, however. I’m simply saying “our non-peacekeeper tech would be ridiculously sci-fi.” Since there is no war, medical advancements, our homes, and general quality-of-life tech would be so far above what we have now, it would be considered ridiculous.Our world would be a contrasting combination of grungy Steampunk and sterile space sci-fi.The space race would ALSO still happen, just under different circumstances. It would still be a case of “I’ll race ya.” This is where the “humans like to compete” part comes in.With that in mind, we would indeed eventually have floating space cities akin to The Citadel in Mass Effect, and much sooner than we will in our current reality.Yet, our Peacekeeper tech would still be stagnant in WW1, WW2, and the intermediary years between the two.My inspiration for thinking this subconsciously came from a book (I forget the name of it. The rest of the details are extremely hazy….. I was drunk when he told me about this, so pardon me for inaccuracies.) my dad told me about a few years back, where there was a race of hyper-advanced aliens that conquered the galaxy, as far as they knew they could. Then, they stumbled across our current, real-life Earth. They contacted the US president (of course they did), and said “Earthlings, we are the most powerful and most technologicaly advanced empire in the galaxy. Surrender now or die!”Being humans, who love to fight, we laughed and said “come get us.”Next thing you know, a bunch of aliens start marching off of a troop ship. But what’s this? They’re wearing uniforms like Napolean’s troops…. they’re marching in lines across open fields… they’re performing musket volleys… what?Turns out that the reason why the aliens had such advanced space tech is because they almost completely ignored their military tech. Their experience up until this point had been Zulu War-esque.Suddenly, they’re fighting against US Marines, Army, Airforce, etc. armed with M16s, machineguns like M60s, M1 Abramses, B-52 bombers, AH-64 Apaches, and all other kinds of good stuff.Needless to say, we won that war, remembered what they said during their ultimatum about being “the most powerful and technologically advanced”… “Reclaimed” their ships and went on our own liberation spree across the galaxy, ’cause ‘Murica. Very suddenly, humanity was the most powerful race in the galaxy.Back to the question at hand;The reason I say our tech would be WW1-WW2 level is due to aforementioned “humans know humans like to fight” so we’d be a bit more advanced than firing lines with muskets.That’s all for now. Sorry for the absolute wall of text. You just got my brain ticking.","6,690 followers",Mike Muluk,588,507,5.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Does-technology-really-need-to-evolve-this-much-faster

Simply killing Hitler won't remove their capacity for war. Certainly the Weimar republic was going to fail. It was too weak and too poorly led. Likely some nationalist or fascist element was going to take over and rearm Germany. Once you see WWII as a continuation of WWI, it is a clear inevitability. There was no real defeat of Germany.Hitler's Timing. Germany was successfully rearming and more importantly, modernizing their military. Hitler's invasion cut off this modernization too soon. The Heer (German Army) didn't have enough trucks or equipment to move their forces. The Luftwaffe had no real long range aircraft and couldn't produce their own Hugh quality AV gas. The later it takes to get in the war puts the German army in the lead.Hitler was in complete control and he was a strategic moron. “No step backwards!”, Building jet powered fighter bombers instead of fighters, changing targets from the oil production of the Caucuses to Stalingrad. Etc. Etc. Etc. Hitler was so bad at military strategy the allies took him off limits for assassination, he was the allied MVP by 1944. (and they did assassinate Yamamoto).Hitler and the Jews. Why does this matter? Because Hitler was a dick to the Jews (by 1939 no one really knew about the genocide plans). But it was Hitler's Nazis that brought Albert Einstein to seek asylum in the US in 1933. Some 6 years later Einstein, the most famous scientist in the world, wrote an impassioned letter to President Roosevelt to embark on building the atomic bomb. It was really that letter that set off the Manhattan Project.Without Hitler you have a prepared Germany knocking both France and the UK out of the war. You have Germany with much more lethal and mobile armies, led by more competent men. You have potentially a less Hitler-level evil figure to unite the world against. Although the sheer industrial might of the US and USSR would win the war, the length and losses are staggering.

That’s what I did.Meanwhile, the huge computer market due to PCs also meant that more and more programmers could make a living doing <something> while helping to develop Linux on the side.I believe Linux would not exist as the force it is today had not the dominance of Microsoft and Intel led to the landscape we have today.","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,1.6K,6.8K,91.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-would-the-computer-technology-market-have-evolved-if-Microsoft-never-existed

At the minimum expect to see more open ended essays that require individualized responses. The internet has made objective multiple choice exams into a joke. Nearly every standard essay topic becomes a joke within roughly 6 months. Schools can either choose to ignore the obvious or require personal reflection/recent real world examples in answers.3) More on-demand corporate training. More and more companies will get their hands on Internet Based Training. In the short run that means getting employees to find short bursts to do their training. In the long run, it will be cheaper to offer employees a few bucks to train on their own time.4) More scenario/simulation based training. Current Internet Based Training is great for logico-verbal knowledge. Some well-curated discussion board can make students think. Most skills training stinks. We are talking about glorified videos. Guided “video games” to instill and test skills would be much better for procedural skills.5) More discrete portable education chunks. The traditional semester based course degree is a relic of paper-based academic transcripts. Often students sit in a room for 16 weeks, when they already know 10 weeks of the material. I have a feeling that undergrad universities will be less snobbish about taking transfer credits. From there “semester” courses will be broken into smaller chunks. Eventually pre-tests and other educational credentials will help students avoid wasting time on unneeded content.6) More project based work. This one will take a while. 80% of the knowledge currently taught in undergraduate educational programs could be looked up using Google. Education’s emphasis will gradually shift from knowledge to skills. Doing stuff — with the help of technology — will be important than knowing stuff. Completing projects is one way to test these skills and apply them to meaningful problems.Thanks for the A2A",416 followers,Sagar Dhabadgaonkar,7.7K,89,532.4K,2018,https://www.quora.com/Does-technology-really-need-to-evolve-this-much-faster
