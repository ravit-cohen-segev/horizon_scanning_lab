The development of Science and Technology have been successful in providing customers with better and more consistent quality products. Modern quality control is an integrated approach to a quality function in an organisation. It is the basic object of providing a definite Quality Assurance and keeping the quality cost at an optimum. The integration has to take place in area of Designing manufacturing and uses.QualityThe world quality has become very familiar to us. We often talk of quality in dealing with many things in our day to day life. For purchasing items like cloth food domestic equipments we ensure that the product having good quality in purchased by us. However it is is it is difficult to define or describe what exact quality means. We probably Messy that the colour of the sir purchased is bright and blue the one I like most for it is made of cotton or it perfectly spit and sizes is proper to describe the quality of shirt purchased.Quality has a meaning at all the stages of production and means any characteristics of the material , part assemblies , process and processing conditions and, product including packaging and packing the embracing all spheres of activity.“The degree of Excellence the degree of Excellence which I thing possess” or “ the feature that makes something what it is”.Some expert into his felt define quality as“ Conformance to requirements- Crossby;“ fitness for use""-Juran;“Quality is customers satisfaction""-Juran;The American Society of quality control defined quality as-“ totally of features and characteristics of product our services that bears on its ability to satisfy given needs”.ControlA process Meri visualised to include man machine material inspection equipment and procedure environmental conditions dies xix pictures speed temperature and pressure etc. This type of visualisation helps to determine the source of trouble which is the basic purpose of exercising process control.The concept of control implies the study of quality characteristics through which process is just for conformance for acceptability. The control process is predictable one. That is to see the limits within which the value of characteristics consideration are accepted to lie and loan provided the state of control is maintained.Concept of quality controlQuality control can be defined as :“The process through which we can measure actual quality performance, compare it with standard and act on the difference”.The procedure for meeting the industrial quality goal in termed as quality control. There are four steps in such control.A product, before it is send out for selling to customer from factory equal to number of stages. Naturally in order final product process required quality, the product and its component must be observed at all these stages. Many activities and task must be performed to obtain the fitness for use. These are predicted in a given figure. They start from Research and process to design and development of product purchase of raw material and other facilities for production of product, actual production, process control, inspection, sales and after sales services, acquiring, feedbacks and given to research.Benefits of a quality Control ProgrammeA quality quality control program are discussed here, one by one helping in building an information system. It is not sufficient to merrily produce a product. One must vitamin information system for improving quality and reducing the cost.From the concept of process behaviour cause effect relationship study and experimentation involving in a quality control program a better understanding of process and product is obtained.Apart from the two benefit mentioned above the following are the other benefits of Quality Control Programme.1 Improvement in quality.2 Increased product under the optimum condition.3 Reduction in scrap.4 Reduction ink cost per unit.5 Saving in materials used.6 Reduction in product bottlenecks.7 Reduction in inspection.8 Evaluation of scientific tolerance.9 Quality consciousness.10 Maintenance of operating efficiency.11 Fewer customer complaints.I hope you may like it.Thanks…",256 followers,Priyal Gupta,9.7K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-free-technologies-in-quality-control

4,"Officially, no.Officially, no.Militarily the US never lost a war. However, whether they strategically lost any conflict is another matter. In that situation you’d need to analyze what the US goals were as compared to their enemies goals and then compare to see who accomplished what. Under this analysis, you can make a good argument that the US never won in Vietnam, to which I’d agree. However, upon just viewing the military side of the conflict, the US has never lost a war.Edit:",256 followers,Priyal Gupta,9.7K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/Has-the-US-been-at-the-top-so-long-that-it-has-lost-its-technological-touch

Google also run applications on users’ smartphones through its Google Android operating system along with Web apps on the Google Chrome Operating System notebook computers. To make this possible, Google uses dozens of data centers all over the world to support search and other apps and Web services. That means Google is a major consumer of energy. To help curb some of costs associated with traditional energy consumption, Google has launched serious green initiatives, investing in wind and solar clean power and even securing the ability to buy and sell power as a wholesaler. The company recently assessed the long-term economic impacts for the U.S., assuming breakthroughs were made in several different clean energy technologies, like wind, geothermal and electric vehicles. This includes paring household energy costs by over $942 a year. Google entered 2011 having spent less than $100 million on clean energy. That changed beginning in April with a solid (but modest for its size relative to it $36 billion in cash reserves) investment in BrightSource Energy's Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System. eWEEK walks through Google's clean power initiatives and investments in this slide show.",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,613,0,0,2012,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-free-technologies-in-quality-control

11,"No. I have no idea where this came from.First of all, even if you sit around all day doing nothing, then you won't get obese. You have to eat a lot of calories and do no exercise in order to get like this.People can still use technology while walking around, and running. In fact, a lot of people do this. For example, people use treadmills to work out. Do treadmills really cause obesity?
