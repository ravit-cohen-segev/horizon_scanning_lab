But neither does any other chart:Now, where do we go from here?More than likely, Trump’s usurpation of power will be challenged in court, and he will lose.But suppose that he were to win. I really don’t think it would be a victory for conservatives. Republicans have natural advantages in Congress, but since there are more Democrats than Republicans, and since the presidential election is the closest thing we have to a national at large election—the winner of the popular vote wins the vast majority of the time—Democrats have a greater advantage in the presidential election. In fact, if I were to make a prediction, I would say that over the course of 2020–2040, there will be a Democrat in the White House more often than not.If the norm is that you can make any claim you want, however at odds with reality, declare a national emergency, and re-apportion federal funds any way you want, what is to stop the next Democratic president from declaring that healthcare, climate change, student loans, or income inequality is a national emergency? Is this really how conservatives want this country to be governed? If not, they would do well to think very hard about whether they want to stand by their president in his usurpation of power.For my own part, I would give Trump ten walls if it would grant president Beto O'Rourke the power to unilaterally fund liberal priorities.

2,"Definitely. One thing that most people do not understand is that there is a big delay between the time we start to take action on global warming and the time we get results.First, if we decided today to do all we can, sort of like the US did in World War 2 to change its economy to a war footing, it would take decades to construct enough clean energy sources (mostly solar and wind, with some nuclear and other sources thrown in) to allow us to shut down the fossil fuel power plants. It will likewise take decades to convert all our cars, trucks, ships, etc. to electric to stop burning gasoline anDefinitely.

It will likewise take decades to convert all our cars, trucks, ships, etc. to electric to stop burning gasoline and diesel. In short, it would take a long time to get off fossil fuels.Second, there is about a 30-year lag between the time that greenhouse gases are emitted and the time they reach their peak heating effect. This is similar to the way it takes time for water to boil once you put a pot on the stove and turn on the stove. This means that if we magically stopped adding greenhouse gases to the air today, the world will continue to warm for about 30 years.Third, once warming stops increasing, it will take thousands of years for the world to cool down. This means, for example, that ice will continue to melt and sea-level rise for thousands of years after the temperature stabilizes.What all this amounts to is that we cannot wait until global wrming","84,238 followers",Igor Markov,3.3K,3.9K,49.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-emergency-is-declared-in-India-now-will-it-fail-because-of-technology
