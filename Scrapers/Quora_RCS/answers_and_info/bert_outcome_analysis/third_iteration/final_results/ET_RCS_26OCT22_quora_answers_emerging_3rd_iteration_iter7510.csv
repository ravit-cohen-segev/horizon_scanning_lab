Mining is the process of verifying transactions by solving cryptographic puzzles with computational power – this is the fundamental and original concept of the cryptocurrency industry.Mining is necessary to maintain and secure the blockchain digital ledger and generate new coins withWhen dealing with mathematical problems, miners use special devices propelled by enormous computing power, also known as hash power. The speed of the machines influences how effective they are in finding solutions. Not surprisingly, hash power is a sought-after asset these days.In theory, mining doesn’t seem to be overly complex, but in reality, it requires the proper knowledge and tools to turn the effort into results.CPU MiningIn the beginning, it was possible to mine cryptocurrencies with a personal computer – this is how Satoshi Nakamoto first minedFrom a technical point of view, CPU mining utilizes processors to mine cryptocurrencies. As the years have gone by, mining has rapidly evolved in search of efficient and profitable solutions.Although virtually anybody with a desktop computer can do it, the CPU mining method is fastly becoming obsolete as more efficient mining solutions continue their successful implementation.GPU MiningToday, a popular method for mining cryptocurrencies involves hardware withGPU mining owes its popularity to being both relatively cheapThere are cryptocurrency projects made for mining by GPU rigs. Some of the best crypto to mine with a GPU areASIC MiningASICThe most famous cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is now mostly mined by ASIC miners. This method is the most advanced form of mining.Cloud MiningPeople who aren’t interested in owning a mining rig of their own will often rely on Cloud Mining. This solution uses the computing power of remote data centers.Different plans cost different amounts of money and last for a variety of periods. Generally, a standard plan can cost anywhere from $100/200 up to $5000 and can last from one, two, or five years up to a lifetime.Mining PoolsMining pools have come to dominate the crypto mining world. They consist of a group of miners who combine their resources on a specific network. Together, they attempt to mine the digital currency with increased cumulative computing power.A mining pool has a greater chance of finding a reward, though this reward gets distributed/shared among pool members based on pre-specified terms.One can pool in one’s resources, be it a CPU, GPU, or ASIC, and enjoy the benefits of block rewards through mining pools.Closing ThoughtsThe evolution of crypto mining leaves users with a long list of decisions. Should they embark on a solo adventure and invest in expensive equipment individually?If so, what are the best machines to buy, and how can they be properly maintained? Should they participate in a collaborative process, pooling resources with others?Fortunately, for those looking to participate in this highly competitive world, the various credible solutions covered in this article should facilitate access to the full potential of mining!There are so many avenues to be rich besides long time hodling. There are a lot of opportunities not yet explored in the cryptocurrency world. One of the them is the coinharvest platform (www . coinharvest . org) They offer you amazing ROI whereby all you have to do is wait 10 days.

Miners can set up a hardware operation by themselves or join forces with a large venture via cloud mining. If you are looking to enter this field in 2020, here is what you need to know about the business.What Does It Take to Mine Bitcoin in 2020Bitcoin mining is a transaction security and validation service done via distributed computer systems each racing to solve complex mathematical problems before the competition.Miners Keep the global ledger consistent and immutable by repeatedly adding newly requested transactions into a block, which is then broadcast to the network and verified. For providing their valuable hashing power to the cryptocurrency network, miners are rewarded each time a new block is created by them in this fashion.Anyone thinking about entering this line of work needs to know that long gone are the days where one could just mine bitcoin with a desktop PC or even an old laptop. These days, any profitable bitcoin mining is done via computer systems tailored exclusively for the task, professionally called application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners. The most popular bitcoin mining machines are the Antminer series from Bitmain, but there are additional hardware offerings from companies such as Microbt, Canaan, Ebang and a few others. Take note that while some machines are available to be purchased off shelf already, or even immediately as second hand goods in online markets, when the newer models come out there is often a waiting period until they are shipped, and you need to take that into consideration.Other than the upfront cost of the hardware, your main expense as a miner is electricity. The power is primarily for operation of the computer systems themselves, but also for ventilation and air conditioning systems that might be needed depending on the situation. This is why professional miners routinely migrate around the world to locations that can offer them an optimal combinationof lower electricity prices and hospitable weather.Once the hardware is all set up, you then need to direct your mining machines to a mining pool such as F2pool, Pooling and Antpool. These are groupings of miners that compete to get a block together and share the rewards according to the contributed hashing power, thus spreading the work and streamlining the revenue for each one.How to Start Cloud Mining With BitcoinAn easier alternative to setting up your own mining operation is to go for cloud mining. This is a way to generate cryptocurrency that doesn’t require buying any expensive equipment, or installing the infrastructure needed for it. All you have to do is find a provider that you trust and buy a contract from them, which is in essence renting hash power in a dedicated facility. Zippercoin is one of such provider, with a cloud mining service focused on bitcoin cash(BCH) and BTC.Goodluck…",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,1.4K,996,156.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-remote-cryptocurrency-mining-worth-it

With that said, if you investment millions of dollars into it, yes, even with a very small percentage, you’d still make a good living (e.g. 0.1% on $100,000,000 is still good money to the average Joe, though who has a spare $100,000,000 to make $10,000 per day from?)",2 followers,Kelly Pearson,1.7K,0,0,2022,https://www.quora.com/Is-remote-cryptocurrency-mining-worth-it

6,"A great question, because mining is what holds it all together.To start at the beginning, let's look at why mining exists in the first place. The whole premises of Bitcoin is decentralization. So whose responsiblilty is it to provide security to the users of the network? When you use Visa or PayPal, it is Visa and PayPal who provide the security to the services they provide. But no one owns Bitcoin. No one intrinsically has the incentive to make sure its safe. This could be a problem.So a decentralized method of providing security was invented and made the lifeblood of Bitcoin.

This could be a problem.So a decentralized method of providing security was invented and made the lifeblood of Bitcoin. Instead of one person or entity handling security, now it's everyones responsiblilty. That's what mining is. A decentralized security mechanism.Miners, specifically, are computers running a piece of software on it. Human users operate the computers, but for the most part they just sit there and do their thing. The software being run is Bitcoin Core, available for free from the Bitcoin Foudation. I will end this exposition on a technical review of what's going on in the software.The mining proess consists of collecting transactions broadcasted on the network and putting them into a block to be verified. The verification process includes solving a Proof of Work (POW) algorithm. This algo is the central nerve of Bitcoin. The idea behind POW is easy: make it so computationally expensive just to verify a block that attackers will be hard pressed to launch attacks and mint false coins (attacks can vary in flavor and strength, but network attacks deserve their own post. One good example of an attack is the 51% attack.) In more technical jargon, the miner takes the new transactions, data from the last mined block, and essentially a random number called a nonce and runs it through the hash function SHA-256 twice. If the output, in binary notation, has a certain amount of leading zeroes (the amount of zeroes is dictated by the difficulty rating of bitcoin, adjusted every 2 weeks based on how well miners are solving the POW), then we have produced a valid block! If not, the software changes the nonce and tries again...and again...and again. It's so hard to satisfy this condition that the top mining rigs do giga- and penta- hashes/second. Even with this many calculations, it can be hours, or days, before your machine successfully mines.Upon a successful mine, the miner recieves a reward of Bitcoin's, an amount that will continue to halve until the Bitcoin money supply is dispersed. Right now, the reward is 25 coins. To answer your question about whether this is profitable for you, I would hazard a guess and say no. To start pulling a profit on minining, you can't use just any computer. Specific machines are now made from the ground up to only compute SHA-256 hash functions. For a more in-depth look, see the attached link. They have more formal defintions than I provided here, and they have links to sites that will help you price your expenses and potential earnings and let you see if it's a profitable venture or not.","21,483 followers",Vladislav Zorov,961,16.1K,64M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Is-remote-cryptocurrency-mining-worth-it

The processing of BTC transactions is termed ‘mining’. BTC mining rewards people with computer power by generating BTC and giving fees paid to people who mine.Currently, BTC is processed by an algorithm called SHA-256. Special mining equipment may be purchased to process these transactions with the most advanced miners being purchased by the Chinese maker BitmainMining can be done with either a physical miner or a virtual miner. You then can mine as a collective (Pool) and share the profits, which is the most common way or to solo mine where you maximise profit.When mining is done as a collective where multiple people ‘point’ their miners to an online site you can mine and collect newly produced BTC and the fees that are paid by other people. This is shared out with all the miners depending on how fast each computer miner is. The faster the computer miner, the more BTC earned. It is more complicated than this and a lot of research needs to be done.Pool MiningPointing miners together with other people guarantee regular payouts daily (or more often) but profits can vary depending on what online site you point your miner towards. There are a lot of online BTC profit calculators that can help choose what pool to use to maximize profits.A lot of research needs to be done with mining, as this is a complicated model. As BTC is only software and it has many variables it needs to calculate. Just to name a few, BTC difficulty may change with the available network (this means profit changes, and mostly decreases if computing power remains the same). The value of how much BTC is worth and how fast the miner is.Solo-MiningSolo mining is where you as an individual point your miner to solve equations on the Blockchain and are rewarded with the most BTC. This is only true if you have huge amounts of speed with your miner and are having a good probability.This is why pointing miners together with other people is more common as the combination of all the miners then acts as one huge miner and will mine BTC quickly. The BTC from the processing of transactions is then paid out daily or sometimes more often back to the smaller miners if in a Pool. In solo mining, you will receive close to 100% of the profit (minus a fee).Problems with any type of Pool mining is you must trust the Pool you are mining with not to steal you BTC or get hacked if you are to store the coins there. However, payments can be sent to your private wallet and this is an option offered by many Pools.The problems with solo mining are you are required to have a huge amount of mining power to get regular payments. Technology advances will also require you to purchase new miner’s just to keep down electricity costs and the value to BTC needs to be in favour. Over time the newly created BTC payouts will reduce.The advantage of solo mining is there is a higher chance to make a profit, and since the BTC earned is sent to your private wallet it is more secure than keeping it online.Bitmain has a good reputation for online mining ( or another option to turn a profit is ‘Cloud Mining’.Cloud MiningCloud mining is the easiest form of mining that does not require a physical miner to be sent to you. This removes the cost of electricity, noise, and heating as generated by the miners.Buying online, mining speed for BTC (currently measured in gigahash per second: GHS) is the fast way to turn a profit. Each Company reputation again needs to be considered, as a lot of faith in these companies is placed not to steal your money or to go bankrupt, or even hacked.As technology advances, these companies buy newer miner models and can sell GHS at a set value of BTC given the market price. Any buyer can purchase this. The more GHS you buy, the more BTC is earned.Alternatively, you can also hire individual miners online for a set price of BTC. This is not really cloud mining, as cloud mining is 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Hiring individual miners are only for a set period of time and are prone to going down due to loss of power or network connection. This would mean that you are no longer any profit and are paying for nil speed. Certain websites can broker hiring of miners such as NiceHash.Nicehash does not charge BTC when the miners are not working.Cloud Mining would be a medium to high skill level to profit but once set-up can be considered a passive income with no input. This income will decrease over time but if you can consider all the variables necessary then you can get a good return on investment.Caution:Get your FREE copy of the Bitcoin Believers Manifesto from the link in my profile.Upvote if you found this answer helpful",0 followers,Melissa Aldridge,501,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-remote-cryptocurrency-mining-worth-it

The reason behind it is that the process of acquiring bitcoin is the same as acquiring any other thing, for example, gold mining. The only difference is that gold miners dig through the earth to find gold and bitcoin miners dig through their mind to find the answers of complex mathematical problems. Cryptocurrency is built on a technology known as blockchain. It is a ledger that records every bitcoin transaction.Its is a digital which contains the information of various other bitcoins. When the bitcoin miners solve any complex mathematical problem using powerful computers, one block gets added to this chain and this is how this process goes on. It helps to keep the payment information secure and trustworthy. The miners have a huge contribution in this whole process.Is Bitcoin Mining Legal?Bitcoin Mining has gained an immense amount of popularity in recent times which somehow has affected the control of the government over monetary markets. That’s why the lawfulness of bitcoin totally depends on your geographic reason,i.e, where you live.Therefore, for the above mentioned reason many countries have boycotted bitcoin mining and it’s illegal there. Some of those countries include Nepal ,China, Pakistan, Bolivia, Ecuador, Morocco, Algeria, and Egypt.The Risks Involved In Bitcoin MiningThe risks involved in bitcoin mining are typically that of monetary threat and a restrictive one. As mentioned earlier, Bitcoin mining, and mining normally, may be a monetary risk. One may undergo all the trouble of buying lots of or even thousands of bucks price of mining instrumentation solely to own no return on their investment. Therefore, this risk may be relieved by connexion mining areas. If one is considering mining and board a district that it's prohibited you ought to rethink. It ought to even be an honest plan to analyze your country's regulatory power and overall point of view towards cryptocurrency before investment in mining instrumentation. This is one of the disadvantages of expansion of Bitcoin mining which can’t be ignored. Some other risks involved are price volatility, market opacity and unlawful transactionsWhat Is An Automated Trading Machine?Rise in bitcoin mining has resulted in the rise of trading platforms as well and has allowed the people to earn a good amount of profit while investing in the network. As everything has its own benefits and losses, likewise trading has its own risks too. To earn profit, people need to invest a good amount of capital into trading and they should know when exactly they need to invest and when to sell. One wrong assumption can cost them a huge loss of capital. Therefore, many people don’t want to take this risk and they prefer to invest via traders who are experienced and have enough knowledge about trading of cryptocurrencies and bitcoin mining.. However, many traders tend to make mistakes. Thus, nowadays people prefer automated trading machines over traders as it reduces the risk of errors or inaccuracy.There are platforms which provide the service of automated trading. They use robots in place of human beings for carrying out the assumptions and that’s why the risk of error is close to negligible.

Therefore, the competition for mining more Bitcoin turned into the competition for obtaining the cheapest source of energy in every corner of the world from Latin America Chile and Paraguay to the north of Europe Norway and Sweden to the farthest cold deserts and mountains in Siberia and Magnolia!!Actually 2019 was a start for a race to posses all the efficient and cheap sources of energy all over the world -Northern Bitcoin underground facilities in north of NorwayActually 2019 was a start for a race to posses all the efficient and cheap sources of energy all over the world -a race to energy!According to energy price above 10 Euro/ kwh, Europe was already kicked out of competition in 2018. However, some could find good places in in north of Europe like Norway or Finland but those capacities are not that much to make them a hot bed for bitcoin miners. In 2019, the European company Northern Bitcoin developed their facilities in Maloy Norway bu succeeding in attracting new financial investment through selling their stock in Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Their share-value is now around 7.5 million Euro in Frankfurt. They claims they will extend their capacity of mining upto 120 Mw by the time new stream of fund injected.Hut8 mining containers in Alberta, CanadaTwo Canadian corporate-scale crypto mining firm Hut8 and Bitfarms have capacity of each 100 MW to supply their miners.Hut8mining is formed by joint partnership of Bitfury (ASIC producer) and Galaxy digital (owned by Mike Novogratz) in 2017 and has succeeded to add up their computing capacity frequently.On the other hand, Bitfarms founded by Israili-Canadian investors and owned by the famous millionaire co-founder Pierre-Luc Quimper, have successfully developed their mining facilities in Quebec, Canada. Contrary to Hut8mining, Bitfarms has its own technical team to overhaul and maintaining miners and infrastructures.They already bought and possessed the electrical company Volta with more than 40 person employees to perform the maintenance task and technical support so that they could increase the profit margin for the whole mother company and fast technical repairment to keep the miners up-time in high levels.Canada has turned into a Bitcoin-friendly country at least for miners thanks to its competitive cheap renewable energy sources mostly hydroelectricity. According to the records in 2019, you could find hydro energy with the cost of around 4 $cent/KWh in various part of Canada such as Vancouver, Alberta and Quebec. Although this price is not the best one, it is a decent price among other competitors. Why not best?! Could you find cheaper than 4 $cent?!....The answer is yes. You could find lower prices per KWh in United States in Texas, California, New York, Washington state, Montana. For instance, the new Bitcoin company HashChain has some facility of 12000 miner for crypto mining both Bitcoin and altcoins in Montana, US with the cost of 3 $cent/ Kwh. Moreover, thanks to flare gas generators, you can produce significantly cheap prices even below 3 $cent/ KWH in places holding gas wells like Texas - which is awesome!!DMG crypto mining facility Vancouver, CanadaTexas has turned into a new heaven for Bitcoin miners till the announcement of some energy firms there to provide very good price electricity to those interested in large-scale Bitcoin mining. For example, we could name Bitmain, the biggest name in ASIC manufacturing, announced in 2019 that intends to establish a big farm of 300 MW capacity in Texas in cooperation with DMG Blockchain company as the contractor and developer of the project. There’s no clue about the energy price in the contract between Bitmain and Texas energy firm but some speculations say, it’s around awesome price of 2 $cent/ Kwh!!...II- Bitcoin Mining in 2020 – A race to Energy!Year 2019 had very big achievements for crypto mining industry and lead to big flux of investments and funds into this disruptive economy. We have been witnessing several mining companies entering into financial markets like public stock exchanges and accessing to more financial instruments to finance and lowering their risks by hedging techniques. As such, this will continue also toThis revolution has already started at the end of 2019 by the liquidity provider group GSR. They have formed a startup joint with Caanan, big name in ASIC manufacturing, to introduce derivative products to crypto mining companies so that they could vast effectively mitigate Bitcoin market volatility and higher their margin profits.

I would say an octopus growth!Rich Rosenblum, GSR co-founder, told CoinDesk that the companies were specifically offering two products: “a tailored risk management solution for miners,” which provides an average-priced option or swap contract, and a new type of futures contract that trades based on hash rate.Apart from the emergence of hedging instruments for crypto miners, year 2020 will be aItaipu dam in Paraguay- Golden Goose project power supplierThis race-to-energy has already initiated in 2019. For instance, some Korean investment holding has pre contracted forThe name of the project is Golden Goose and owned by a Korean foundation named Commons Foundation which has entered into an agreement with Paraguay to construct what it claims will be a large mining hub. The government has provided five 10,000-square-meter plots of land to host five planned mining centers. The land is in close proximity to a massive hydroelectric power plant.The best spots and regions for Bitcoin mining are typically built around gas power plants as well as hydro plants amongst which the second one is renewable and a better source to rely on for a sustainable future.Therefore, Canada is one of these spots appropriate for mining thanks to its huge source of renewables including Hydro plants originated from its mountains’ waters. Moreover, regarding its cold climate, it makes it an efficient place for natural cooling of the Bitcoin factory.United States is also turning into a Bitcoin-friendly region gradually; however, not in all the states for sure. As regarding renewables, there are some large-scale renewable plants in US solar and wind that could be used for Bitcoin mining. The important point to mention is that typically solar and wind energies are not economically justified for mining since their least price for selling is above 9 $cent /kwh and this price means death for miners!! Nevertheless, for large and bigger solar or wind farms usually in range of 500 MW-1000 MW, it is possible to sell the output energy in the way lower prices then smaller renewable farms and even in the range below 3 $cent per KWh!But since there aren’t many places around the world to have such a large farm or capable of building it, then you can find very special places in the world to sell you solar/wind energy cheap enough for Bitcoin mining.Amongst these places we can name Mojave, California which a good place for establishing solar panels and produce renewable energy. A new company named Plouton mining already started to build a small mining farm of 5000 miner powered by solar energy.However, this is a small scale solar plant! Is it economical?!...Actually if you have access to good line of credit and long-term loans and other incentives then it could be economical to deploy a small solar farm to be injected into a Bitcoin farm. Hence, they should have obtained a decent finance for their solar farm to the extent that they can bring the production cost of their panels down below 4 $cent per Kwh, otherwise it is not reasonable for them to mine Bitcoin there.Plouton Mining site in Mojave, CaliforniaSo you see this race-to-energy already reached US lands and it is not even limited to renewables but also gas generators and flare gas plants. Utilizing flare gas, which is a wasted gas, to produce energy has found its economic roadmap into Bitcoin mining solution.As such, we are witnessing some start-ups and new companies have started to develop Bitcoin farms along with their own manufactured generators with very very cheap output electricity around 1.5-2 $cent for each Kwh. Examples could be founds in Texas, Illinois and Canada and it is going to take a huge market in 2020. So we can say flare gas could be a golden waste for bitcoiners in 2020!Let’s get back to mining machines and their efficiency growth in 2019. Actually ASIC mining started with 28 nm ASIC chips and then by progress of new tech mother manufacturers like TSMC (which is main chip producer for Bitmain, Caanan,…) new generation of 14 nm ASIC introduced into market in 2017 and this continued into newer generations of ASICs 10nm, and 7nm in 2019.The most famous legendary miner Antminer s9 (by Bitmain) had hashing power of 14.5 Th/s and it was a tech-jump in the time of release in 2017. It’s efficiency was 0.093 J/GH and due to table in the article “What is a good Bitcoin mining hardware?” it would resulted in efficiency of 1% comparing to other ASIC miners.However, in next years the progress in ASIC technology continued till release of new ASIC generations. For instance s11 and a short after s15 succeeded to improve efficiency to 1.5% which was a noticeable improvement with respect to S9.But this wasn’t the end! Since new 7-nm ASICs showed up and lead to release better machines like Antminer s17 with computing power of 53 Th/s. This was an amazing achievement since it lead to performance of 0.039 J/GH or according to aforementioned article an efficiency of 2% which was a great news for the miners in lack of electrical capacity as well as those with higher energy prices.In 2020, we are expecting to see even newer ASIC chips of 5-nm with output efficiency of more than 2.5% that could be improved to higher rates with even better controlling firmware. As we see, Bitcoin not only made his way through technological barriers but also has improved the edge-of-science by its intrinsic value and incentivized economy. However, the older version of miners like Whatsminer m3 and antminer s9 are still widely in use by most of miners and the new efficient fleet will replace them gradually.Another significant factor of Bitcoin mining is how you are cooling your mining machines and environment. Since they give out high temp air and heat so choosing the best and efficient solution for Bitcoin farms is necessary.Although many circles this problem by choosing a region with cold climates like Canada and Siberia, it is still needed the least cooling systems for the hotter seasons or other regions with warm climates.As I already discussed cooling issues in the articles How is a calculated needed cooling system for a Bitcoin mining farm and What infrastructure is required for Bitcoin mining and How do I configure it? There have been developing several solutions for Bitcoin farm cooling. The most simple and effective one is air cooling and air fans. The advantage is that it is very cost effective in terms of initial and maintenance expenses and the defect is that it could only be used for light and normal cooling best suited with places with medium and average temp climate.For more warmer places specially in summer you could use evaporative pads beside the air fans so that you can have a more effective cooling system with a negligible cost. For those very fussy in infrastructure designing, datacenter cooling systems and design could be an specific method to be deployed in establishing their Bitcoin farm; however, it exerts much more initial expenses or capex to the owner.Liquid cooling is a way used by some miners round the world but the method was left very soon as resulted in more cost/efficiency in most cases. Actually, liquid cooling or to be more specific 1-phase liquid cooling has a very good effect in circulate or distributing heat out of miners environment but as soon as it comes to heat exchangers or radiators for getting cool, it has nothing to say more than simple air cooling.Nevertheless, there is other method of liquid cooling named 2-phase cooling or 2-phase immersion cooling, which is a real solution to reduce temperature of mining liquid. Bitfury is one of the pioneer companies that has used this method in their mining containers in Hut8 mining farm in Canada. There still remains an issue of cost and effective rate and if its cost deserves to make it deployed as final solution.....III-	Hopes and RisksInterest in cryptocurrencies has surged since 2015 as bitcoin has seen its value rise from about $300 per coin to a peak of about $20,000 per coin in December 2017, then dropping to about $8,000 per coin as of November 2019.Mining cryptocurrency seems like a no-brainer. Set up a computer to help solve complex math puzzles and you are rewarded with a coin or a fraction of a coin. The first bitcoin miners were able to earn coins relatively quickly just using what computing power they had in their homes.By 2019, cryptocurrency mining has become a little more complicated and involved. With bitcoin, the reward is halved every four years. On top of that, serious miners have built huge arrays to mine, making it harder for smaller miners to compete. You can join a bitcoin mining pool to be more effective, but that comes with a fee, reducing your profits.Investing in expensive equipment and spending high prices in energy bills to mine bitcoin only makes sense if you believe the price of bitcoin will rise by the time! The market of Bitcoin is still small comparing to Gold, metals or big companies like Apple and Amazon. Those that decided to invest in this industry, already hopes that Bitcoin will hugely adopted by crowds all over the world and the its market cap will reach easily above 1000 Billion$.So you see it’s about how much faith or hope you have in this revolution (blockchain and Bitcoin) and how much you are going to risk to be an early Bitcoin adopter or miner in the following years. But what the situation is currently for Bitcoin mining is a high-risk high-reward investment. I myself believe that Crypto Is a Revolution of hope, equality, and wealth decentralization and as such I strongly think it will succeed.The important Halving Event of Bitcoin in 2020:The current global bitcoin network rewards miners 12.5 bitcoin per block, which is approximately 1,800 bitcoin per day. In May 2020, the bitcoin daily reward will halve to 6.25 bitcoin per block, or approximately 900 bitcoin per day. This halving may have a potential impact on the Company’s profitability at the reward level of 6.25 coins.Based on the fundamentals of bitcoin mining and historical data on bitcoin prices and the network difficulty rate after a halving event, it is unlikely that the network difficulty rate and price would remain at the current level when the bitcoin rewards per block are halved.Bitcoiners believe that although the halving would reduce the block reward by 50%, other market factors such as the network difficulty rate and price of bitcoin would change to offset the impact of the halving sufficiently for the Company to maintain profitability.Nevertheless, there is a risk that a halving will render mining companies unprofitable and unable them to continue their existence . However, according to my knowledge and record we are at the most pessimistic level of Bitcoin price 7000$ in Dec 2019 which could be also valid as the bottom line for Halving time.As matter of fact, I don’t believe in any sudden price change in the time of Halving but I expect a gradual Bitcoin price increase to a more reasonable price which originates from a trade-off between network difficulty and miners expectations as well as growing demands by new bitcoin adopters. I see that price to be around 15000 $ in the following months in 2020.By :",UNKNOWN,Jammie Glen,886,106,640.7K,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-remote-cryptocurrency-mining-worth-it
