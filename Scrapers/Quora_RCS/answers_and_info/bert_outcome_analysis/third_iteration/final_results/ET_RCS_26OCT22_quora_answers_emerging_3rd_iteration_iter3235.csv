1,"No, it‚Äôs not aliens. Shame on you‚Äîthat‚Äôs incredibly insulting to millions of people who work very hard.It‚Äôs much simpler than that. As we learn more about the physical world, we develop better and better tools. As we develop better tools, we learn faster. As we learn faster, we develop better tools.No aliens required. No outside help at all required. Just millions of people working very hard to develop better tools, and use those tools to develop better knowledge.",33 followers,Erik Day,9.5K,582,384.2K,2018,https://www.quora.com/Even-if-in-the-far-future-we-had-advanced-technology-would-we-be-no-match-for-aliens-technology

7,"Yes, it certainly sounds like a good idea: develop a safe cigarette / a cancer-free cigarette / whatever.There‚Äôs one small problem though: the smoke. Smoke is toxic and cancerous whatever it comes from, however it is created, whatever you do to filter it. If there‚Äôs any smoke left it is inherently harmful because it‚Äôs smoke.So what we would need to do, to make safe smoke, is:Yes, it certainly sounds like a good idea: develop a safe cigarette / a cancer-free cigarette / whatever.There‚Äôs one small problem though: the smoke. Smoke is toxic and cancerous whatever it comes from, however it is created, whatever you do to filter it. If there‚Äôs any smoke left it is inherently harmful because it‚Äôs smoke.So what we would need to do, to make safe smoke, is:OK so now we have no particulate matter and no gases. Job done. There‚Äôs a problem though: there‚Äôs almost nothing left - we removed it all. No smoke >> no harm >> but no nothing.Not strictly true though: we‚Äôll be left with about 5% of the original aerosol that was heated water vapour and liquids-based aerosols. These were sucked out of the tobacco column as it heated up, before the ignition reached it. These vapour-based products are not all that harmful compared to the solids-based aerosols (smoke particles) and exhaust gases.HnBJob done.Simple HnB products remove about 90% of the toxic exposures delivered by cigarettes, so that‚Äôs pretty good. Complex and more expensive HnB can do a slightly better job. It‚Äôs a big advance over a cigarette.Smoke#ITSS ‚ÄîLose the smoke, fix the problem.",UNKNOWN,Prateek Suryaprakash,30.6K,405,1.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Even-if-in-the-far-future-we-had-advanced-technology-would-we-be-no-match-for-aliens-technology
8,"Because they would if they could.Tobacco leaves are not necessarily cancerous. But its the tobacco smoke that is cancer causing. The smoke is particles which irritate every part of the body in which they come into contact: lips, mouth, tongue throat and lungs. There‚Äôs also the nicotine which is poisonous and damages bones and blood vessels.If cigarettes were safe but delivered the same pleasures and addiction as now, even I would think I‚Äôd about starting again.Thank you for your requested answer",2 followers,Himanshu Chavhan,20.4K,71,659.6K,2019,https://www.quora.com/Even-if-in-the-far-future-we-had-advanced-technology-would-we-be-no-match-for-aliens-technology

10,"Create from what? If you are thinking of it from nothing, a new hypothesis of physics says everything in the universe is created from nothing at the moment of Big Bang.

11,Never. The many radioactive nuclides that are being made for research and medical uses all start with atoms available in nature. We speculate about the extreme conditions of the early Universe when quarks/ leptons were formed - but whatever numbers we have for the pressure or temperature under which this happened are way beyond the capability of any material to withstand.,78 followers,Rajan Singh,1.5K,360,25.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Even-if-in-the-far-future-we-had-advanced-technology-would-we-be-no-match-for-aliens-technology
