0,"Dogs speak a simple language, which they know at birth. They do not have communication issues, irrespective where they are born or travel.Animals that are taught language, by their parents and relations, may speak with regional accents or, on occasion, a vastly different vocabulary. This includes songbirds, hummingbirds, whales, dolphins, bats and a few others. Because of regional variations, they may not be understood, leading to social alienation and far worse - an inability to warn or be warned of existing predators.Dogs speak a simple language, which they know at birth.

1,"Living in the Netherlands I used to have a Dutch Shepherd lady.On holidays in South Tyrol there was a noticable difference meeting German speaking dogs or Italian speaking dogs. South Tyrol is bilingual. It was annexed by Italy in 1919 after the first World War.With German speaking dogs all was relaxed and playfull, both off leash. With Italian dogs, always on a leash, the situation escalated on a whim with quareling dogs and a swearing Italian owner.I don’t know if it was a language barrier, a different culture of dog keeping or just the difference between rural (German) and city (Italian).Living in the Netherlands I used to have a Dutch Shepherd lady.On holidays in South Tyrol there was a noticable difference meeting German speaking dogs or Italian speaking dogs.
