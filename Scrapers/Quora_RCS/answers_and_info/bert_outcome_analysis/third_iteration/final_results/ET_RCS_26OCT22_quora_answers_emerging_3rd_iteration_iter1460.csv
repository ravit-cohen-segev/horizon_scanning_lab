They made big ones, small ones, simple ones, and intricate ones.  Their muscles ached for weeks as they gained the strength needed to throw so many pots.At the end of class, both halves were invited to enter their most perfect pot into the competition.  Once the votes were counted, all of the best pots came from the students that were tasked with quantity.  The practice they gained made them significantly better potters than the planners on a quest for a single, perfect pot.In life, the best way to learn a skill, is to make a lot of pots.Update:  It seems we've found the origin of the story...maybe.

Luckily woods tend to be smaller than a full forest so you might actually be able to get out of there easily, especially if you remember the rough direction of a road. Just keep walking in a straight line, if/when you find water you'll probably need to get off your straight line but just find another tree with lichen and keep heading the same direction as you were previously walking.

It has 32 megapixels.I did the same digital zoom with my DSLR. Mind you, it only has 18 megapixels. There are a couple of take aways here. With the tiny lens, all those megapixels do not get you a clearer picture. And the cellphone picture is very highly processed to look sharper when it just doesn’t have the detail you would expect from so many pixels. If you are really sharp you will notice that the DSLR did not automatically hide the chromatic aberration in the above picture. That is something usually done in post processing on the computer.Now, I just rotated my zoom lens to a longer focal length and took another picture.You still think that a cellphone image matches up to a DSLR?Look at this building in the cell phone.It’s pretty unrecognizable and the phone went basically to black and white.Here is the DSLR. Can you argue that the cell phone is anywhere near professional quality when we are comparing to a new phone to a twelve-year-old starter DSLR APS-C frame with a kit lens? A flagship Canon full frame DSLR with a prime lens would blow even the bottom picture away. By the way, I did not do any processing on the DSLR images and I have the camera set for minimal sharpening and minimal noise reduction and output jpeg files. If I had taken raw images into Photoshop, the difference would be another quantum leap.Or, in other words, if all you ever want to do is take snapshots for social media, your cellphone is all you need.

This means that when the material breaks or has a scratch, the ions and molecules attract to each other to heal the material.This is the first time scientists have created a self-healing material that can conduct electricity, making it especially useful for use for cell phone screens and batteries, Wang says.Some LG phones, like the G Flex, already include a similar material on its back covers that can self-heal scratches. But this material can't conduct electricity, so manufacturers can't use it for screens.Most phone screens have a grid of electrodes underneath, and when you touch it, your finger (which is also conductive) completes a circuit, telling the phone what to do.Wang predicts that this new self-healing material will be used for phone screens and batteries by 2020.The team will present its research at an April 4 meeting of the American Chemical Society, the world's largest scientific organisation devoted to the study of chemistry.""Self-healing materials may seem far away for real application, but I believe they will come out very soon with cell phones. Within three years, more self-healing products will go to market and change our everyday life,"" he says.""It will make our cell phones achieve much better performance than what they can achieve right now.""",166 followers,Sumit Gupta,4.8K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-should-I-learn-next-I-m-learning-Docker-and-Selenium-right-now-what-s-the-next-thing
