Countries spend millions of dollars to participate in multi-national exercises like Red FlagRed Flag 20-3 kicks off amid COVID-19 pandemicIt’s so important that they were still doing it despite the pandemic.Secondly, modern air combat isn’t necessarily going to be purely beyond visual range. A good example is the Gulf of Sidra incident of 1981 (which inspired Top Gun). Two Libyan Su-22 approached the US Navy S-3 Viking that was participating in an exercise.On paper, the F-14s could have fired their very-long range AIM-54 Phoenix or their mid-range AIM-7 Sparrow missiles long before the Su-22 could see them. But thanks to the rule of engagement forbidding them to fire unless fired upon, the F-14 couldn’t do much until one of the Su-22s fired a missile at them. After which, the Su-22s were destroyed easily in what is basically a dogfight.Point is, modern conflicts aren’t like what World War 2 was, where you simply shoot first. You need to positively identify the enemy and make sure that the enemy is really intent on being hostile before you can fire back. And chances are, that would happen only when the two sides closed in to dogfighting range. Long-range missiles are great in a conventional war, but those wars are pretty rare now.B) (Implied): 5th Gen (and similarly new) fighters can’t dogfightSays who?A lot of people tend to repeat some myth (and facts) about the early issues with F-35 and somehow associate that with other similar-looking airplanes. These new stealth jets are probably more deadly than your typical older fighters in a dogfight because of both improvement in technology and also their stealthiness, which makes them harder to pick up. They’re also armed with the absolute latest air-to-air missiles, which can perform maneuvers considered impossible 20–30 years ago.Many of these criticisms are a repeat of the same thing that happened to the M-16 rifle or the M-4 Sherman tank. They didn’t quite come out right the first time and they got some stigma attached to them. But after improvements and improvements, they were easily one of the best in their class for their time.C) Some valid criticismsI have to admit, there are a few potentially valid criticisms. 5th Gen fighters tend to be astronomically expensive to develop, make, and operate. Some might even suggest that the people operating them put too much faith in stealth technology (debatable). But these are normal and you can see it’s not exclusive to 5th Gen fighters.D) No one criticized abandoning the bayonet, the cavalry, and swordsPerhaps it’s because they learned the hard way that those things are outdated (although bayonet is arguably not, since many modern militaries still issue them and train their soldiers to use them).Swords were made obsolete by modern guns. Back in Napoleonic era, you still have a hope into getting within an arms length of your enemy because guns were inaccurate and slow. But by the end of the 19th century, newer rifles and early machineguns made it impossible for you to get close to the enemy without getting torn to shreds. The last two regular armies to issue sword for combat were the Japanese (because the whole Bushido/propaganda thing) and the Chinese (who were so chronically short of firearms that they had no other choice). As predicted, both suffered massive losses:Similarly, the horse-mounted cavalry went the way of the dodo when they found out that men on horseback is rather vulnerable to machineguns, or modern rifles for that matter.Some armies were smart enough to figure out that rather than doing cavalry charges like in the last 4,000 years or so, they realized that the cavalry could be mounted infantry instead, performing raids and recon missions and using their horses to make quick getaway.Of course, not long after, they also found out that it’s much better to do so with armored cars or even motorcycles, which don’t usually die after getting hit by one bullet.And it’s not true that the cavalry went away quietly. There were conservatives in all the armies who insisted that horse-mounted soldiers were there to stay after World War 1. They lost the argument of course, but not before making their stand.",5 followers,Heikki Kultala,2.4K,1.5K,7.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Since-technology-has-made-close-in-dogfighting-an-almost-obsolete-way-for-modern-aircraft-to-engage-each-other-why-is-there-all-the-criticism-of-5th-Generation-fighters-No-one-criticizes-abandoning-the-bayonet
1,"Many people in fact do criticize when bayonet training is abandoned by armies. Melee weapons still have a place in Modern Combat. In the specialized circumstances in which horses are more effective, they are still used. Calvary never became obsolete we just got better horses, ones made out of Steel and fueled by oil. It is very rare that a style of fighting ever truly becomes obsolete. The technology that has that is used in dogfights has advanced, no longer are we pointing revolvers at each other in biplanes.

2,"Since technology has made “close in dogfighting” an “almost” obsolete way for modern aircraft to engage each other, why is there all the criticism of 5th Generation fighters? No one criticizes abandoning the bayonet, swords, or horse cavalry?First I would question two assumptions. First that dog fighting is not going to happen. The last air to air kill i know if was achieved with an AIM-9. The second is that the people who claim that 5th generation fighters are bad at dog fighting know what they are talking about.

There is a group of defense analysts most notably Pierre Sprey who have been critical of every fighter for decades.Sprey liked the f-16 at first but not later on. I would be shocked to find out Sprey had a grandfather in World War I who was complaining about how the Spad had engines and wings and how the army should stick with balloons.The 5th Generation fighters have a kill loss ratio of 20:1 in training and from my understanding the 5th gen pilots like to get close and take simulated shots from what would be a no escape zone.

4,"My personal favorite ace of this category would be Marinos Mitralexis, a Greek ace who flew an elderly PZL. P.24. He shot down 5 Italian aircraft during the Greek-Italian war, one of which he downed by ramming. After ramming his nose into the tail of an Italian bomber, he landed his badly damaged aircraft and captured the Italian crew, who had bailed out. The PZL was an old aircraft, but it was well armed, with 2 Oerlikon FF 20mm cannon supplemented by 2 7.7mm machine guns.

5,"Even the now retired airplane I flew, the A-7E Corsair, had redundant critical systems such as three hydraulic systems, and also armor plating around critical engine components. It also had a back up electrical generator, navigation devices, and self-sealing fuel tanks. Plus flares and self-protection jammers.But it’s a tradeoff. If you load the aircraft down with lots of redundant systems, armor, etc., it adds weight…and that inevitably degrades performance.

6,"I'm not an expert on this, but my understanding is that people did criticize abandoning all those things when they first became obsolete - thus bayonet charges into barbed wire and machine guns, the often misunderstood use of Polish cavalry against tanks (no, they didn't charge them with lances as is commonly talked about), and so on.

Even the dogfighting debate has come up before.

7,"It is not all that difficult to learn how to fly a fighter. However one must be careful because the margin for error is much less than learning to fly a more docile aircraft.What is definitely difficult after one learns to fly it is learning how to how to fly and employ a fighter in a tactical military scenario, both air-to-air and air-to-ground combat.While many are able to learn to fly fighter aircraft and perhaps fly it well, only a percentage learn to fly it as well as it was designed and capable for its various demanding combat missions.",67 followers,Tim Morgan,1.2K,2.1K,12.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Since-technology-has-made-close-in-dogfighting-an-almost-obsolete-way-for-modern-aircraft-to-engage-each-other-why-is-there-all-the-criticism-of-5th-Generation-fighters-No-one-criticizes-abandoning-the-bayonet
