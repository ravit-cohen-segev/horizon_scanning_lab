Buildings had to collapse, and surgeries had to be botched so we would learn to do things the right way.

I'd rephrase it as “twice the size of a man"" or something.If you want to include numbers, we need more. Velocity or more accurately acceleration is key in sci-fi space combat. Force is equal to mass times acceleration. You have a rough size of your projectile, with its shape and composition you could gauge it's mass. Acceleration, and in space/sci-fi it's all about relative acceleration, depends on how you're firing the projectile (is it fired like a gun, does it have a rocket for continuous acceleration, railgun, some combination), and the velocity of both ships. If the projectile fires at 100m/s from a stationary ship and hits the enemy ship traveling at 99m/s in the same direction as the round, the net velocity is only 1m/s…not likely to do alot of damage. This then would effect tactics and ranges. So would need to be considered. Finally, payload. Is it a solid slug only doing kinetic damage? Does it have explosives? Radiation? Bio or Chem weapons? Heat? Electromagnetic pulse? Nuclear? All of these will add to the damage done by the projectile. They will do damage in different ways and be countered differently.A projectile that size could reasonably be expected to hit hard, you're basically throwing a truck at the target. But if you want to go “pure"" sci-fi, you need alot more information. How fast everything is moving will be a place to start. Otherwise, big heavy projectile moving fast is enough, you show how powerful it is when it hits something. If you don't mention the numbers, no one will care. They will see big bullet and big damage and accept that.

The idea that you ‘naturally’ have that skill and talent without education, training or practice and have it to such a greater level than proven professionals is about as likely as you could paint the next great Mona Lisa without education, training and practice.If you want to design games, you can. I did it, but I was also designing games at age 10 and I have been designing games (many failures) for over 50 years! But you cannot do it without a great deal of work, education and practice.","2,986 followers",Mark Maratea,2.5K,3.5K,7.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-s-a-super-power-that-normal-humans-have-which-we-all-regularly-take-for-granted

And if you’re a neck beard who likes seeing kids cry and be “destroyed” with “real talk”, literally screw you, why are you in a creative industry, go back to your cave and shove your eighth and worst installation of the same game up where we don’t have to see it anymore.

22,"Not to be an asshat, but: Most of us don't want to see it.  Ideas are a dime a dozen; over lunch, we regularly churn up more ideas for games than we can possibly develop.  The basic idea is, seriously, the least part of the process.What really counts is the ability to execute, i.e. to actually design and make the game.  Come to us with a working prototype and we might be interested.",1 follower,Chris Nash,13.6K,5K,30.7M,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-s-a-super-power-that-normal-humans-have-which-we-all-regularly-take-for-granted

If they come up with something even remotely like your idea, you could sue them.Also, there are already plenty of idea people in digital games - they are called digital game developers. That is why they are there, why they learned the skills needed to implement their ideas, and why they make games in the first place.

The first thing I teach my students is: Fail Fast! Fail Often! It is through your failures that you can build successes. Make your terrible ideas, then sit back and begin to analyze why it was terrible. Then, begin planning on how you can make your next idea without it being terrible.",152 followers,Alex Mann,602,2K,102.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-s-a-super-power-that-normal-humans-have-which-we-all-regularly-take-for-granted
