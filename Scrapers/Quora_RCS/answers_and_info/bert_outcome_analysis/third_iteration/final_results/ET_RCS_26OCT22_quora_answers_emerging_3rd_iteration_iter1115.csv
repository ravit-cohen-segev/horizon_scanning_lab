With some of these we can already see light at the end of the tunnel others will be more difficult but given the 60 year timeframe I would expect us to crack them all.Aging: This is the crucial one and I've devoted more time to it because it is at the root of most of the problems because basically it has to be factored in that most people become ill due to old age and diseases such as atherosclerosis, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, Heart attacks and diabetes are diseases primarily of old age and they do not generally strike young people so if we address the issue of aging we address many of the health problems as well. I see a better than 50% chance of controlling aging within 25 years but a 90% chance within 60 years. As far as the time span for an actual cure, I would hazard a guess that it is at least 100 years away. The alternative approach is to aim at repairing the accumulated damage and this should be our primary goal because we understand how the damage is laid down even though we understand very little about actually slowing aging or influencing metabolism. This is the reason why age reversal would be simpler then halting ageing because with the engineering approach what it means is you allow the ageing process to carry on that make regular interventions at for example 10 to 15 year intervals to repair the damage.As far as how it would actually work in practice its quite easy to follow and what this means in essence is this,  let’s say you are 60 years old at the time of the first intervention and that this early and fundamentally imperfect treatment repairs 75% of the accumulated damage and winds the clock back by 25 years.  Then 10 years later you would reach the chronological age of 70 but would be biologically only 45 years old and look and feel like a 45 year old. We now come to the vital key to the whole theory which is this, let's say 20 years after the first treatment, when you are chronologically 80 but biologically 55 years old, clearly both your doctor and yourself will realize that the damage that was not repaired in the first treatment combined with the further damage accumulated over the 20 years since is again posing a health risk.  At this point it is time for another intervention. It is now that the progress in medicine comes into play because, by the time 20 years has gone by, anti-aging medicine will have moved on significantly and, whilst the first treatment bought you an extra 20 or 30 years by repairing a fair amount of the damage accumulated over your first 60 years, it did not repair it all. 20 years later medical progress will mean that the latest treatment will not only repair all of the damage corrected by the first intervention but also some of the damage that was not able to be repaired 20 years earlier so in essence you are now chronologically 80 (but biologically in your 50s). This means that, whilst you will have aged 20 years, chronologically you will be biologically younger after the second intervention than you were after the first.My opinion is that we are well on the way in a number of areas such as gene therapy, stem cell therapies, tissue engineering and numerous other types regenerative medicine such as work with Telomeres. Progress depends on funding although a number of factors will drive things forward and interest is increasing among both Scientists and the general population as well as wealthy philanthropists. The greatest driving force of all is that the baby boomers are aging and this will place increasing demands on healthcare systems. Keep in mind that the average person costs more in medical expenditure in the last year of their life than all the other years put together.  Also, the number of workers is declining in most developed countries which means that we need to keep the existing population working and productive as long as possible.These are just two reasons but jointly they pose a serious economic problem to many governments worldwide. So what time-frame do I put on it? I made a projection some time back and, based on current research, I feel we will be pretty much able to treat and manage aging within 20/25 years given sufficient motivation, appropriate research and robust funding which is starting to flow with Google Calico and PayPal founder Peter Thiel on board with SENS plus other wealthy individuals who are waking up to the fact this is something which is possible and no longer in the realms of SciFi. Many of the therapies are progressing quite well already such as stem cell therapies, gene therapies and tissue engineering but without a comprehensive intervention targeting all of the types of damage that arise due to aging the treatments individually will most likely just allow a person to grind on for 5 or 6 years. Of course there are other routes other than engineering approaches such as SENS and I think even Aubrey de Grey knows SENS is only a means to to get a foot on the ladder but clearly once SENS strategies are perfected they will certainly save millions of lives and prevent a great deal of suffering.As I see it there are five technologies which will ultimately lead to radical life extension during the course of this century, these are advanced Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Advanced Robotics, Genetics and Robust Artificial Intelligence often just referred to just as AI, the effect these technologies will have on life extension differs greatly but my guess is that there are three potential approaches which are likely to come to fruition first, one is SENS which is biotechnology the second is nanotechnology which will enable us to repair the body at a cellular and molecular level though this will probably come after SENS - though it's possible that it could arrive in the late 2030’s or early 2040’s - but because this one is more difficult to predict I tend to be very much of the mind that SENS (see",4 followers,Matthew Bates,658,9.8K,293.1M,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-will-medicine-and-technology-cure-in-the-next-60-years

There’s two ways to do this:I suspect there will be a combination of both of those in the next 50 years. There’s too much money to be made feeding people things when they aren’t really hungry.

3,"Everything, I hope! The recent spectacular advances in all the life sciences mean that we're getting a better grasp on how biology works, and the equally spectacular advances in the relevant technologies mean that we'll be able to put our knowledge to good use.There's even serious talk of tackling all the symptoms of aging and their causes, so that we'll all live for several hundred years in youthful good health. That might take a little longer than sixty years to realise, but it's on the way. The future looks rosy!Thanks for the A2A.","135,531 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.6M,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-will-medicine-and-technology-cure-in-the-next-60-years
