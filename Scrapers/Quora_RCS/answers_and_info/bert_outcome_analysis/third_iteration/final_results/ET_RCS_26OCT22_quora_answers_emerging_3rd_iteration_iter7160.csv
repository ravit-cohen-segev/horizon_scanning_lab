Who told you this phrase: talented people like IITIANS?Look at the syllabus for IIT JEE and look at what the job requires. It is entirely different. The syllabus of IIT JEE doesn’t test your interest and wish and merely focusses on mugging. The population is huge so the government has to filter students and guess what? The government chose the worThe country is lagging behind other countries in research and development because of various reasons.The first reason is your question ending itself.*even though we have talented people like the IITians*This above italic sentence is the first reason. Who told you this phrase: talented people like IITIANS?Look at the syllabus for IIT JEE and look at what the job requires. It is entirely different. The syllabus of IIT JEE doesn’t test your interest and wish and merely focusses on mugging. The population is huge so the government has to filter students and guess what? The government chose the worst way to filter out.Suppose a fish wants a job of swimming in the sea. The fish has already done courses and projects with training about swimming. But the so-called JEE-Advanced indeed tests the fish to swim but not in the sea but miles away from the seashore. 90% of the time would be wasted in wrestling and wiggling to reach the seashore and then if energy is left within the fish, it will jump into the sea.Now the question is why IITians become intelligent?It’s becauseRecently, I saw a cheap trend on Inshorts news app. It was like thisNews1: An IITian led startup raises xx$New2: An IITian led startup raises yy $News3: Ram, Shyam led XYZ startup raises zz $News4: Sita, Geeta led ABC startup raises zz $News5: Bittu, Banty led DEF startup raises zz $News6: Sonu, Monu led KUH startup raises zz $News7: Ram, Laxman led EJI startup raises zz $Did you notice the trend?Every engineering graduate is from a certain college. Do we put the name of the college so that the people can get an insight into other colleges as well? NOWe just keep ignoring them and only put “IITians” in highlights just for TRP.Our parents are emotional who blindly believe in this crap and force the children to go through immeasurable trauma. Tons of other people have startups as well but it appears only IITians raise money, have successful startups, beautiful wives etc.Have A look below…Now, look at this discrimination of our so-called education and creativityMost of my friends who are in the US, UK, Australia, etc got Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe in first and second attempts. One of the Anonymous writer has mentioned the non IITian people like the ones having lower IQ.This is the mentality of Indians which demotivates students and your worried parents. Every student is special but all they want is an opportunity which is reserved for only some students in this country.Now coming to other reasons…Reason 2. We are bounded by mythical rules.In the US, a man was an electronics engineer until the age of 37. He left the company then and learned to program within 6 months and got an internship from Adobe which he converted into full time. He worked there until the age of 46 and left for making projects based on animation. At 48, he got into Ubisoft and got retired from Ubisoft at 58 and is now resting himself with painting and sketching.In India, if my career gap is 2 years, I cannot apply to most jobs. If my age is beyond 30, I can’t apply to most of the jobs. If I am not from NIT, IIT, BIT chances to drastically reduce but does not vanish. If I am not a son, niece, cousin of some person already in the company, my pain increases. If I am not bribing to an institution with loads of money, it won’t forward my resume. All the quality entry-level jobs get sucked up by theses institution or by colleges, unlike the US where all the entry-level opportunities are available on the career portal.For people jumping on the reservation, you cannot remove it unless the news stops mentioning the caste of the rape victim explicitly, or the caste of the dead person. Even today parents teach their children to hate certain castes indirectly.For special people here,General has 50 seats and SC has 5 seats for a job. With reservation comes fewer seats too. Without reservation comes a greater number of seats too.Reason 3. We do not have anything to achieve right now.In the US, most students are amazing in certain things and we feel ashamed that all we did was mug and mug for govt. exams of some other form of exams just to get a meager sum of money. The money is not enough to sustain a happy life. Life survival comes first and then comes to education. The second mission won’t be visible until we successfully fulfill the first mission.Reason 4. We have made virtual boundaries.Agree to disagree that we are comfortable at any age. The age of 24 forces me to think about a job of 12 lacs at least. The age of 27 forces me to marry. The age of 31 forces me to have a child. The age of 36 forces me to have a car(Not 2–3 lacks but of 5–6 lacks). The age of 40 forces me to have a 3BHK flat. The age of 18–60 forces me to keep my female partner happy.We are bounded by virtually invisible boundaries. What happens if we do different jobs in different boundaries?? We feel the below image in surroundings.Staring !!! The person who was dead during my childhood wakes up from his/ her grave to ask me “When 100s of people ask the same question, the pressure will undoubtedly arise on the student.Reason 5. The government cares for cheap labor onlyHigh-level politicians target “Religion”Mid Level politicians target “Caste”Bollywood targets “Women Emotions”News targets “Morphed News to Brain”The government doesn’t care at all. They just provide you meager supplies which are bound to exhaust soon and still, nobody cares. I need not say any more for the government. Who knows who will come to arrest me?We invest in statues, cows, temples, mosques, “Jai Shree Ram”, fake rapes, murder, rapes but not on education.100 kids died in Bihar because of a highly infectious disease. I am giving 6 options below. Choose which one can treat them.I guess the reader is intelligent enough to understand the answer.Another example for religious guys here. Egyptians believed in Osiris, Horus, Anubis gods and believed in After life and all. Its fine for me as long they have common sense to differentiate between believe and practicality.Look at the ruins of Egypt now!!!All Pharaohs are nowhere to be seen. Why didn't their god help them after such a long workship of 10000 years ??Its because religion is a path to follow. Its just some principles set by our ancestors. It is merely a road that can take you AHEAD. It wont give you heaven or hell or iPhone. Similarly neither Lord Rama is gonna come to save your ass nor Allah nor Jesus. Its us humans who have to work altogether. The day when we will successfully achieve this we will ultimately feel a strength of goodness which is the real god entering our body and encouraging us to move to next mission i.e. education.Reason 6. We are full of ego and love to shame everybodyThe moment we get a bit rich, we boast our ego. The moment more boys flirt, ego increases. The moment you become senior, your ego increases. The moment you are an upper caste, your ego permanently increases. The moment your popularity increases, your ego increases. We love to shame and embarrass other to that extent where he/ she will definitely try to commit suicide. We don't want others to realize his/ her mistake and let him/her continue with their life. What we love is to see other’s embarrassment. Our ego is more important for us than to discover why Saturn's poles are hexagonal in shape.It however appears that the first mission is itself is damn far, who cares for second as long as a *What more to tell? The queue is damn long.At last visit this link.One of my commenters told me that IITIANS are Ranchos of India…This might enlighten his tiny ego.I am not against IIT or IITians. I hate hate the system. Wasn't it clear from the starting of the answer !!!Its 2019 and the Morons of India dont even know whether Salman killed the blackbuck or not in 1998. That blackbuck would have reincarnated in Africa somewhere eating healthy grass without mentioning his caste.AT last !! Your IQ is not low. Believe in yourself and go ahead.UPDATE:Have a look at another crap.My university students had made a Quadcopter long ago which could spray seeds, water in a small field back in 2011.Bhai ab to IITIANS ne bnaya hai…I guess they must have used Titanium Alloy obtained from Mars and Neptune, and motors were made by aliens from Titans.

3,"I'm actually surprised level of stupidity Indians consider themselves, their ancestors and their heritage.Tell me one thing, US is obsessed with Race in politics, Europe with immigration, India with religion. The reasons is simple, nations tend to be politicised on issue that affect them, even in distant past. Israel and Palestine had issue yet Israel is in a great position.Thing is Religion caused a havoc in country, it divided our Civilisation, it still caused riots, etc. Indian history after 700AD is full of bloody campaigns against Natives. Saying we should forget all this is just like sayI'm actually surprised level of stupidity Indians consider themselves, their ancestors and their heritage.Tell me one thing, US is obsessed with Race in politics, Europe with immigration, India with religion.

Saying we should forget all this is just like saying women should forget about oppression, Dalits should forget about Casteism.The issue isn't religion here, it's much deep with a historical baggage.India in History.India has surpassed all nations in Science, astronomy, mathematicsAl Andalusia, 11 CE (Scholar Islamic Golden age)India has always an edge on science, astronomy, metallurgy ( it's steel and Shipbuilding technique was counted among best) during the ancient even till mediaeval period.While I don't wanna list of it's contribution, you can read it here, let's grip the main part.The Historical baggage;India was colonized twice first by Islam than by British. While first destroyed all Universities, education centre temple's, heavy taxation, less public works, no major development, britsh prevented India from being getting industrialised.Britsh made impossible to buy new technology, sell our products, passed laws to stop indians making their own locomotives.While Europe was developed rapidly, European Colonialism ensures that no one could even live a decent life in colonies. When India got Independence, we have no infrastructure, money, less than 17%literacy, 90% below poverty line and shortage of food.Thus our Education came.Indian Education Journey.India inherited legacy of destruction, there was mess everywhere. We need to build the nations hence government continued british education system to get more engineers, doctors, thanks to colonialism, Indians were obsessed with government jobs as during those times, such job ensure survival of family.Also during such critical time, Nehru Ji adopted Socialism, as it was only option to control a mess, centralised structure of governance. Thus our growth was limited and within four decades Indians economic situation was in brink to collapse hence first liberalization started in 1991 which give a boom.Our education is for job seekers because developing countries needs nation builders, we don't have enough money to support research, citations.Poverty!Thanks to White man's burden (both Islamic and Brits), Indians were in utter poverty. Fool are those who thinks british looted us, only difference was Islamic ruler's kept money to themselves whereas britsh take it to their land.We started from ashes in 1950s, we build ourself despite numerous problems.Look at all Foreign Universities, Harvard has endowment of $32 billion, Yale has $19billiion and Stanford has $16 billion. The total budget of Indian government for whole education is merely just $10billion. Infact Cambridge, Oxford, Harvard, Yale are centuries old whereas IITs are setup by Indian government after 1950s. Our older Universities Takshila (1500 years older than Oxford), Nalanda(estb.5CE) and majority of Universities(till now archaeologist unearthed 16) were destroyed or neglected during Islamic rule. Old universities have better momentum, name, Alumini.IITs have less seats, less faculty, less resources. Even the infrastructure ghosh is bad in many. We need to change, we need to give better wages otherwise teachers will leave for US.IITs are basically for job seeking.We are nation with heavy poverty, majority living in poverty, our gdp/capita is around is just $1900. Rich countries have better advancement in technology because they have money, resources. Research, Volume of citations need a lot of money, Science needs a lot of money, technology too.The problems we have to solve now is much deep. We need a strong party with ideology to change. We need free markets, changed Education system and hell lot of factors,our whole structure is need to be changed. Politics will surround itself to existing issues which will not solve unless you teach right side of history. We always put everything happened to us beneath the carpet to appease a certain community and now we are being eaten up. You want India free from religious politics yet you will not discuss reasons behind it because of political correctness.Corruption is a phenomena because we have stupid colonial laws regulating Police, Governor, administrative officers, Urban body, CBI, etc. We need to reform Constitution itself.Europe pull ahead than rest of world as they got silver from colonies, Industrialisation, than US beat it due much better terms of size, resources, land now China breaking patent records as they get rich.We continue to do blah blah how religion is bad (it's not) whereas it's because of religion today we have amazing festival, arts, musics, traditions, heritage, diversity, beauty and dance. When India dominated world, it was also the height of India's most vibrant religion. Real problem is our economy because we want to do romance with Socialist way, corruption because of weak institutions. Religion is excuse for those people who wants to safeguard people because of whom today religion is an issue.",813 followers,Boni Aditya,5.4K,408,1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-India-lagging-behind-other-countries-in-research-and-development-even-though-we-have-talented-people-like-the-IITians
4,"I have studied in both American and Indian universities, so let me try and give my take.First of all to make anything successful what you need is consumers, people who care for it. As an example you might be the best singer in the world but if no one likes to listen to music, it doesn’t matter. Ex India has good cricket team but not a good football team. Because football doesn’t sell.With that principle, research is also a product that universities produce. They’ll spend more money and time on it if there are more consumers for it.

And not the traditional kinds who like to keep repeating the same things over and over but the ones who need to compete in global markets. They need to innovate and change quickly to remain relevant in market. These are the kinds which will “buy” research from Universities, improving their standard.The university that I was in India, did decent enough job with research projects but most of the profs. will forget about it soon and get busy with other things. Next student coming in will start from ground zero on the same problem.The prof. I worked with in US was more of a salesman then a professor. Even before he started a project he was more concerned about how he can sell it. Which conference can he publish the paper in? Can he spin off a start up from it. He was in fact on board of many start-ups which he helped start.This is where India has lacked. In terms of market predicatbility, law framework etc. Anything can happen in India anytime. A start up like uber in which you might have spent years can suddenly become an illegal business, innovative idea like drones can suddenly be made illegal. You never know.As a consequence industry has less appetite for innovation, less consumption of research, less investment and hence not the quality that you’d expect.But things are changing, I am pretty positive and excited about the future of research in India.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,4.3K,5.6K,427.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-India-lagging-behind-other-countries-in-research-and-development-even-though-we-have-talented-people-like-the-IITians

Before proceeding to read the article written below, you must have to accept the bitter truth of situation!India is a developing nation. We, our technology is not bad enough to overwhelm. But although we are pursuing research and development activities like ISRO, DRDO, TATA research, baba atomic research and other private R&D firms, but are not having a single fame of inventing technology, new innovative ideas for current troubles and problems our country is facing. And except Dr. C.V. Raman, we don’t have any single Nobel Prize winner since a long time. How bitter the truth is?Okay alright, we go deeply but in a simple manner to think about this aspect. First what do we have?For this answer we have one that most or any of the country doesn’t have! Strength of Youngsters!India has more than half of the population youngsters, students and most of them have early or late 20’s. India produces lakhs (millions) of engineers in one year (per year) than any other country could!But all these pros seem to have inefficient way of problem solving for the sake of solution. However we have given the world most of the famous personalities like Sundar Pichai, Satya Nadela. But the fact that wonders us a lot is the institutions or universities of India does not lie in the top 400 universities around the globe!I hereby compliment all of you readers to say sorry as though all of the things do I put down are against self-esteem, faith of the country, but I know the main significant reason why is all such worst happening is going on?Continue to read, you will be startled!Let us assume we have two persons, A & B. Both are individually kept at different surroundings. Now the surrounding is affecting the nourishment, thinking of these two systems. (A & B)Let’s assume person A is forced to put into the western countries like USA, England. Whereas the person B is in India. Now what interesting happens?Let’s first talk about our country India. Indians have always been fallen into the worship, pray and mostly tend to force themselves into the obligation of the religious activities. Due to this do you know what kind of their thinking is? They see the world as what it is! They even don’t bother to change the current situations by adopting new ideas, making any innovation for the well-being of societies. No, Not at all!Instead they rely on imaginary, pseudo faith of so called God that he is the superior power in the universe and that’s it!Another interesting probability is that if any one dares to change the current system, he will be regarded as breaking the rules against destiny. Alas! What a great mishap he has done! (Here assume I’m talking about old days)Such type of surrounding is affected by person B. So hell that inventions, innovations, get down to hell this shit!Next come here in case of person A. In western countries they were also following rules, regulations led by their ancestors like us, but instead of this they were ought to solve the problems by developing new ways. Here what made the difference? They never relate their innovations, ideas to destiny, faith & so. Instead they adopt growing faster in making, in providing necessities to societies, providing them new ways to solve problems. They carried over inventions; apply every possible thing in real life and obviously educating the upcoming young generations to do similar.Hence person A will surely be superior to that of B!Now come here in the recent scenario, In India, Indian parents mentality lies in the fact that our children must be more prosperous than they are. They know there is only one factor…Money! And it is related to education. Here listen carefully, Indian parents not only motivate their child to educate, but educate such that as for praising, admiration. Means society must admire, praise, respect more than education. That is, it claims that there is no any advantage of education if there is no respect, praise by society, people. In simple words, why, do you think, many of the students opt for engineering and medical? Isn’t there exist alternatives such as arts, commerce, design, law, BA, entrepreneur, B.Ed. and so many to count? (Here very fewer students opt for this relatively). Because it (engineering and medical) seem to be professional career than other ones. But it’s not real. But here Parents tend to forget the phenomena rely on specific unique characteristics each and every child, student possesses which make him/her different than crowd. Then however it may be like acting, dancing, singing, mimicry, cooking. But they don’t! This is the tragedy!If I write about education system which is one of the most significant reason and which is nothing but the solution, it would fill my article in about GB’s! No offence, when system will wake up it’s too late for them.According to one of the professor of my college drew my attention to my conversation, told that how we have only one option here, which everyone should adopt is that we have to accept the system and have to develop, lift ourselves by living inside the system, instead of giving it up.Because it is always worth to move your hands and legs rapidly instead of being drown into the sea!",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,6.6K,5.6K,427.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-India-lagging-behind-other-countries-in-research-and-development-even-though-we-have-talented-people-like-the-IITians

Science is not about making things and technological advance is only occasionally advanced by study systematic-enough to be described as ‘science’.Science is evident in the detailed records kept by the Sumerians of the positions of astronomical objects. From their record-keeping they were able to predict eclipses and other phenomena so it was clearly science. However their being able to measure the positions of those bodies with impressive accuracy tells us quite an amount about the quality of their technology.Clearly, scientific method has evolved a great deal since then. However it remains a set of techniques we use to improve our science and not a single ‘scientific method’ discovered by one person at one point in history.Sumerian astronomy also points up that science may rely more on technology than technology relies on science.But to what extent has human history been shaped by science and technology and to what extent have science and technology been shaped by human history?The development of metals and architecture were largely shaped by agricultural communities and the kinds of wars they fought. That accidents of time and place that found them where sedentary agriculture was feasible shaped their technologies and led to a growth in science related to their kind of society. Contributing to the technologies of measuring land to clarify ownership and ways of measuring, transporting and trading agricultural produce, for instance.Indigenous Australian science built - amongst other things - an understanding of fire in the landscape so that the various conditions of dryness, heat, winds and other factors inform decisions about just when and where to burn in any year for best effect and lowest risk.The technologies of Australian tools and weapons fit with the available materials and the nature of the food sources. It takes a powerful bow to kill a kangaroo with an arrow, for instance, but there are - largely speaking - no Australian trees suitable for making a powerful bow. Australian timbers are used in some modern bows, but they are composite bows with the Australian timber taking only compressive loads and another material, often glass fibre, taking the tensile load. Although bows were used in New Guinea and were highly likely to have been seen, and probably tried, occasionally by Australian Aboriginal people using local timbers, the composite bow would have been a huge technological leap that was just not going to happen. Composite bows developed where simple bows already worked, not where they had failed.Metals were not developed in Australia and a large contributor to that is that, even in the several places agriculture did develop the limited fertility of most Australian soils meant that agriculture could only be supplemental, not sedentary. You planted, you went on with your seasonal wanderings, then came back in time for the harvest. However the crop was not enough to keep you in the one place. Because you had to keep wandering, the only heavy tools developed were those that could be left in place for when you needed them next year. That would apply to querns, stone hammers and heavy axes and many other tools. An important aspect of Aboriginal Australian culture is a sense of the place of everything, including every tool you use.The invader culture in Australia prides itself on making the land yield more than aboriginal use did. Yet ‘modern agriculture’ has damaged huge areas and devastated some places in just a couple of hundred years in a land that was maintained in equilibrium for tens of thousands of years. Modern agriculture is liquidating natural capital and passing that yield off as ‘production’.Technology contributes in a major way to human history in another sense. History is not what happened in the past but the stories we tell about the past. That’s why the word stems from the French ‘histoire’ or story. Sedentary or ‘civilised’ cultures keep written records. The histories of mobile cultures, whether seasonal wanderers or true nomads, is primarily in spoken and sung stories and paintings on sheltered cliffs or in caves..","9,670 followers",Paul Mainwood,862,1.5K,16.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-technology-for-website-designing
