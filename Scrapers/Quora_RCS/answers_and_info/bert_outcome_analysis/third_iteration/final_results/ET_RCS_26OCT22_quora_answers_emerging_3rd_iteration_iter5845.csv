1,"The most important one, Energy.The rise of Industrialization 300 years ago was entirely contingent on the energy from, originally steam engines, then electrical and fossil fuel grids.Our dependence on energy is more intensive than ever. We now have 4th Generation Nuclear (Molten Salt Thorium, Pebble Bed, Small Modular Reactors), which is basically safe and clean. A Chernobyl or Fukushima is basically impossible.The most important one, Energy.The rise of Industrialization 300 years ago was entirely contingent on the energy from, originally steam engines, then electrical and fossil fuel grids.Our dependence on energy is more intensive than ever. We now have 4th Generation Nuclear (Molten Salt Thorium, Pebble Bed, Small Modular Reactors), which is basically safe and clean. A Chernobyl or Fukushima is basically impossible.Once that is achieved, it becomes the core of “game changer” for Humanity.Environmental issues will be resolved with the abundant safe and clean energy available from it.As well, mass desalination of sea water, with the energy of pumping it to desert areas, provide clean water to arid areas, we can achieve forestation of these areas, towards creating new “lungs” for filtering carbon dioxide excesses in the planetary ecology. We could then see a reversal of the excesses of carbon dioxide and the particulates they hold, so toxic that they kill 7–10 million people per year, primarily in smoggy cities.Urban Vertical Farming, a means of providing plentiful food crops to cities, has been held back by the energy costs to achieve them. With cheaper electrical energy, they become cost effective and an assurance towards providing plentiful food for urban areas.With a mass level of energy, we will see a mass proliferation of 3D manufacturing and fabrication, providing complex and useful commercial goods for lower prices.We are desperate for resources of ores, rare earths, the materials for metallic fabrication, so we strip and create environmental devastation on the Earth.Where this is heading, eventually, is the means to provide the energy towards ventures like Miguel Alcubierre’s theoretical Warp Drive, and possibly some form of Quantum Drive, achieving interstellar travel for Humanity.","284,852 followers",James Altucher,992,878,91.7M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Besides-artificial-intelligence-what-emerging-scientific-technology-do-you-think-will-be-a-game-changer-for-humanity-in-the-coming-decades
2,"The biggest game changer is not anything positive. It’s the peak of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels will continue to be available until the steep cliff. And then it’s too late. It takes at least 20 years to replace it by renewables, but mostly nuclear power.The scale of the energy to be replaced is astronomical. To replace all fossil fuel with nuclear would require somewhere around 10–15,000 nuclear power plants. It’s just not possible. The required fuel is just not minable.So, humanity will fail big time, and revert to preindustrial level with a few millions of farmers, toiling on the land until tThe biggest game changer is not anything positive.

All easy to use energy is already consumed. Humanity will never again reach these levels of prosperity.With a EROEI around 5 human civilization collapses, the energy cliff.","20,171 followers",Sriraman Madhavan,4.1K,186,7.9M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Besides-artificial-intelligence-what-emerging-scientific-technology-do-you-think-will-be-a-game-changer-for-humanity-in-the-coming-decades
