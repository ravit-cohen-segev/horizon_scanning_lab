3,"I used to be a bitcoin miner for about two years, I stopped doing it because of the miners power consumption. So I would have to say a evolution to 100% solar powered bitcoin miners is a must.ps I had 45 bitcoins and sold them all for about $350 each. I really wish I didn’t do that, last time I looked they were selling for $4850.00 per coin.",0 followers,Glen Boston,655,71,1.7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-way-to-mine-cryptocurrency-on-old-graphics-cards-like-the-Afox-GT-730-4GB-LP-card-and-actually-make-money
4,"There are two major issues with crypto currencies like Bitcoin. one is the scaling problem, and that -as the name suggests- is the problem of making blockchains big enough and fast enough to be used by millions / billions of people. The other is the privacy / anonymity problem. Bitcoin was sold as a an anonymous currency but it's simply isn't, it was only ever a pseudo anonymous currency so people and organisations can track bitcoins. If bitcoins are to replace cash they have to be truly anonymous. Both these problems have theoretical Solutions and the first iteration of these Solutions are juThere are two major issues with crypto currencies like Bitcoin. one is the scaling problem, and that -as the name suggests- is the problem of making blockchains big enough and fast enough to be used by millions / billions of people.

It's speculation.People don't realize thatAnother big misconception is that it's easy to mine crypto and make a profit.My mining rig, image credit-MEI live in United States. I pay approximately $0.11 per kilowatt hour for electricity. I built a mining rig and mined Zcash and Monero for a while in 2016. I learned that I was able to mine it but the cost of the electricity exceeded the value of the currency that I mined.The only people who are possibly making money mining it are people who live in areas where the cost of electricity is very low along with the cost of labor and real estate.If you want to see what it really takes to make money mining crypto, check out this article.Image creditOne might say, “I thought you could use a computer to mine bitcoins.” Not anymore.Notice I mentioned the noise and the heat twice now.Cryptocurrency has reduced crime in one way but increased it in anotherThe only valid reason to purchase cryptocurrency if you need it to purchase something that can only be purchased by way of crypto.",2 followers,Kelly Pearson,1.7K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-kind-of-evolutions-or-upgrades-does-Bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-require-to-solve-its-current-drawbacks

8,"What you see below the screen is the RSI indicator.

It shows the power of a movement (either up or down) and the strength supporting the movement of the price.Now as you see on the chart from point 1 to point 2 the price was rising but take a look at the RSI as it’s falling from point 1 to point 2. Now the question is “Why the heck it the price going up but the RSI falling down?”.Well this is called Divergence. The real reason that this divergence showed up here is that the big (smart) money pulled out of the market at point 1 (Either all of the big smart money or a big chunk of it). Then after point 1 the price decreased for two weeks as you can see on the chart. Now that the big whales are out, the small fish came swimming and put their money in so the price goes up to point 2 but there’s a difference between price reaching point 1 and price reaching point 2. The difference is that for example 10 rich whales invested 10 billion dollars in bitcoin so it reached point 1, then they pulled out their money and the small fish came to play so 100,000 normal people invested 10 billion in bitcoin and it rose again to point 2. Do you see the difference? 10 rich smart whales don’t panic, they know what they’re doing, but 100,000 average traders who are looking to make a quick buck will panic with the first sign of danger. so from point 1 to point 2 those big whales pulled out of the market so slow and subtle that those fish didn’t suspect a thing. They kept buying the overpriced bitcoin and the whales were happy to sell at the top. One red candle shows up, the fish panic and sell like crazy and the rest is history.That divergence is the real reason why the prices dropped but there’s no reason to panic. Heavy drops are good for the market. The funny part is that now while the fish are panicking and selling their valuable assets those whales would enter again and buy the cheap coins to get ready for the $100k bitcoin (remember bitcoin dropped from $20k to $3200 to get ready for the $40k, $50k and $60k.",6 followers,Ryan Burner,735,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-kind-of-evolutions-or-upgrades-does-Bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-require-to-solve-its-current-drawbacks
