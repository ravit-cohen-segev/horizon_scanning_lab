Renaissance has also hired senior researchers who had formerly worked for me for years.  None of these people has ever told me anything about Renaissance's investment strategies.  My observations below have been obtained entirely from publicly available records.In particular, the core strategy is publicly known.  It's the details that are proprietary.  There are millions of details, and they are essential to the performance.  However, the question was about strategy, so that is what I will try to answer.The core strategy is portfolio-level statistical arbitrage carried to the limit and executed extremely well.  Basically, portfolios of long and short positions are created that hedge out market risk, sector risk and any other kind of risk that Renaissance can statistically predict.  The extreme degree of hedging reduces that net rate of return but the volatility of the portfolio is reduced by an even greater factor.  The standard deviation of the value of the portfolio at a future date is much lower than its expected value.  Therefore, with a large number of trades the law of large numbers assures that the probability of a loss is very small.  In such a situation, leverage multiplies both the expected return and the volatility by the same multiple, so even with a high leverage the probability of a loss remains very small.The general properties of the strategy can be deduced from the statement of Renaissance for the Hearing of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, dated July 22, 2014.  [Renaissance collects ""all publicly available data [they] can that [they] believe might bear on the movement of prices of tradable instruments--news stories, analysts' reports, energy reports, crop reports, weather reports, regulatory findings, accounting data, and, of course, quotes and trades from markets around the world.""Their models ""use this data to make predictions about future price changes.""The hearing was specifically about the Medallion fund, about which the statement says ""The model developed by Renaissance for Medallion makes predictions that are profitable only slightly more often than not.""With these properties, there were two reasons that Renaissance would like to have a call option on the portfolio that it has designed: leverage and protection against Black Swan events.Leverage is needed because, unleveraged, the rate of return of the portfolio is low.  However, because the volatility is much less than the expected return there is no limit to how high the leverage could be without increasing the probability of a loss, at least according to the models.  Through years of use and refinement, Renaissance knows that its models are very reliable.  However, they also know that there is always the risk of something happening that is not covered by the models, in particular something that is outside prior experience, which is called a ""Black Swan"" event.Thus, a call option is ideal: it can provide high leverage and can provide protection both against the very low probability of a loss greater than the option premium and also against the unknown probability of a possibly catastrophic loss due to a Black Swan event.We know all this because these are the business reasons for Renaissance accepting Deutsche Bank's proposal of barrier options.  Basically, Deutsche Bank, and later Barclays,  sold the equivalent of a call option to Renaissance on the reference portfolio that Renaissance designed.Of course, writing an uncovered call on the Renaissance portfolio would be equivalent to betting against Renaissance at high leverage, which would seem to be a foolish thing to do.  The banks covered these options by buying all of the securities in the portfolio.  Thus the bank's position was equivalent to a covered call.  In other words, the banks' profits and risks were essentially equivalent to writing a put option, which is a bullish position.  Because the volatility was very low the probability of a loss for the bank was low and the probability of a loss greater than the option premium was even lower.Except for the Black Swan risk.  The probability of a Black Swan risk is unknown.  Part of the premium paid by Renaissance and earned by the banks was equivalent to insurance against Black Swan risk.  I don't know if the amounts of the premiums were publicly disclosed.There were many more details in the statements and the testimony at the hearings.  However, discussion of further details would detract from the important points that I have made above.  In particular, the hearings themselves were about tax issues not about investment strategies.  Renaissance explicitly asserted, under oath, that its ""models do not factor in tax rates when making trading decisions.""  Therefore, tax issues, although they might be very important, are not part of the ""investment strategy"" at least as reflected in the models, so they are outside the scope of this particular discussion.[Edit (added in answer to a comment):  The reference portfolio was highly dynamic.  There were thousands of  trades per day.  To accomplish this, the banks gave RenTech's computers  direct access to execute trades through the banks' trading desks.This  arrangement was part of what created controversy about what should  be the proper tax treatment for this particular case. However, I am not a  tax lawyer and will not try to analyze those issues.  However, if you  want to hear more details on the automatic execution of the trades, and  questions about how much human interaction was present, that is all  discussed in the live testimony before the subcommittee: [",173 followers,James Baker,1.2K,188,4.9M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Does-Renaissance-Technologies-engage-in-illegal-trading

For non-high-frequency quantitative trading, futures are more difficult than equities.The reason is the law of large numbers, across two dimensions:Let’s think about the consequence of the these two points. Thanks to both more instruments and more signals, at any point in time, a quantitative equities fund can put on more uncorrelated trades than a quantitative futures fund can. In active management, we call this “breadth”. And if you know how Sharpe ratio works, having N times as many uncorrelated trades of equal expected return will improve your Sharpe ratio by a factor of sqrt(N). In other words, higher breadth leads to higher risk-adjusted return.This is why if you look at quantitative hedge fund rankings are that done at least semi-professionally (the ones that do not just look at absolute returns but also risk-adjusted returns), the best equities funds in the world will almost always outperform the best futures funds.Now, back to the opening line of this post, in the high-frequency trading space why are futures *not* harder than equities?

Vietnam was a lot messier, and the nature of warfare changed.The post-World War II era has been the age of asymmetrical warfare. The U.S. forces have been frusrated (along with those of every other major power) because they train to win pitched battles. But what do you do with all your firepower when the enemy doesn’t offer any vital target? When fighting them is like fighting shadows and ghosts? Guerrilla fighters in the developing world - or, most often, in the collapsed world - have learned that to fight big. technological armies, you go small, and you go basic. You essentially do what the Americans themselves did in the 18th century to defeat the British.However, the fact is that the U.S. stands by a world system in which countries are not allowed to invade and conquer their neighbors. Villains like Putin are trying to overturn that ideal, right now, and one of the reasons why the West supports Ukraine is that we don’t want to see a return to the free-for-all of the pre-World War II system.

While the war did not end in a WW II-type total victory, that was not the aim, except perhaps in the mind of Douglas MacArthur. It was a limited war and the US achieved its limited aims.The Vietnam War was another limited war. Despite spending billions of dollars and thousands of lives, the US was unable, in the end, to do for South Vietnam what it did for South Korea. Conditions there were very different, and the war dragged on for so long that it became too unpopular to be sustained from the perspective of domestic politics. Nevertheless the US was not militarily defeated, it was the internal politics in the US that caused our negotiated withdrawal which left the South Vietnamese government vulnerable to a North Vietnamese assault.In the first Gulf War, Saddam Hussein's Iraq invaded and took over Kuwait. We, with allies, invaded Kuwait and threw the Iraqi's out. This was a complete victory, we restored the Kuwaiti's government, earned ourselves another ally in the region, soundly defeated the Iraqi army...all of the aims we started with were achieved. It was not our intention to depose Saddam Hussein in that war, and any claim that we ""lost"" is just wrong.In the war in Afghanistan, we clearly won the initial military struggle: we expelled the radical Islamist Taliban theocracy, after they sheltered Osama Bin Laden and other leaders of Al-Qaeda. We did this with astonishing ease. We then made a huge mistake, due to the decisions made by President George W Bush and his team (VP Cheney, SecDef Rumsfeld) to keep troop levels there very low and to pivot to invading Iraq and overthrowing Saddam Hussein. This allowed the Taliban leadership and Osama Bin Laden and others to escape into the tribal zones in Pakistan where they were sheltered and could organize an insurgency against the US occupation and the new government set up in Kabul. Still, this phase of the Afghan war was a victory.Following the disastrous decision to go into Iraq, the Taliban insurgency grew in strength and threatened to again come to power in Kabul. Eventually we put more troops back in there, and so far there seems to be a tenuous success there, with the current government having some apparent success against the insurgents. EDIT 8/29/2022: obviously, events overtook this answer, and the US and its allies/coalition pulled out of Afghanistan and the Taliban are back in power. This was an increasingly unpopular war in the US, and in the Congress, but the negotiation that caused an abrupt US pullout (abrupt as these things go) was accomplished by Donald Trump and Mike Pompeo, leaving the Biden administration no choice but to withdraw the last small number of troops and allow the Taliban into Kabul.The Iraq War (II) was also a military victory. US and allied forces rapidly destroyed the Iraqi military and threw Saddam out of power; ultimately he was captured, tried, and executed by the new Iraqi government. This was another relatively easy victory. What followed was mismanagement by the team Bush & Co put in place, and the failure to properly negotiate a status of forces agreement, leading to a premature withdrawal of too many of the US forces in the early days of the Obama administration. That phase of the war, like its Afghan counterpart, is not yet over, but you certainly cannot call it a military defeat for the US. EDIT 8/29/2022: The US role in the war is essentially over, and the Iraqi government has gravitated toward but not fully into the Iranian orbit. Things there remain politically tenuous, but there has not been and likely will not be a return of Baath Party control (the party of the deceased Saddam Hussein).So, what wars did the US military lose as per the premise of your question?","527,820 followers",Adam,2K,1.1K,5.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Does-Renaissance-Technologies-engage-in-illegal-trading

While American military performance would average out to middling, the strategy behind the conflict was muddled and indecisive. The same can be said for Viet Nam - the lack of a singular strategy other than ""No Reds"" meant the U.S. actively promoted and support corrupt dictatorships, abided regimes that repressed popular sentiment and used its firepower advantage to specious gains.In Iraq (leaving aside show invasions of Panama and Grenada), the 1990-1991 military action was a decisive victory, to a point. The lack of a killer political instinct meant that the U.S. (and Iraqi population) suffered from another decade of Hussein's actions until the final invasion in 2003. What followed was a spectacular insurgency that the military struggled to adapt to and overcome, but was suppressed when the U.S. ""surged"" and then withdrew, without a strong successor government. What followed was national politics that left the Iraqi state weak and ripe for foreign and internal strife. It will not surprise me if the U.S. has to ""re-invade"" Iraq to keep it out of the Iranian sphere of influence.In Afghanistan, you have a American attempts to deal with tribal differences while dealing with state supported terrorism (from Pakistan) and difficult terrain and popular attitudes. Again, no clear political initiative, no decisive application of firepower due to the type of war being fought and you have a ""lost"" situation.The common thread is the lack of a clear and decisive policy followed by a clear and decisive strategy and implementation. Wars are not just military battles, and never have been. America has been trying to refute Clausewitz for most of the 20th and 21st century, and by not having the political will to suffer or inflict casualties, or the willing blindness to abide corruption and ineptness from itself and its allies, America has not been able to formulate a war winning strategy. While its military machine is excellent, it has never been unleashed against a formidable enemy. American went to great lengths to ensure it could not be defeated in a conventional campaign, but has never grasped that no on wants to fight America in a conventional war. Instead, insurgencies, which require political firepower and ability, has derailed the American military time and again.In comparison, Russia decided it was going to act in Syria and look how the war is turning out for Assad. Russia re-armed and re-trained the Syrian army loyal to Assad, integrated the foreign fighters (Iran, Hezbollah) and provided decisive if inaccurate air cover to allow those forces to defeat their main opponents (who are supported somewhat haphazardly by the West). In a few short months Assad now has the upper hand and despite the bad publicity from the Russian actions (and his own) against the civilian population, a clear and decisive policy was enacted.You don't just have to want to fight a war, you have to want to win the war. That means defining a clear strategy for that victory. America has been unwilling or unable to do that.Last, about the Cold War. While it was fought via proxy instead of directly, the idea of containing Communism at all costs led the United States to ally and repress many nations in the interests of ""freedom"". While morally reprehensible and detestable, it worked. Communism failed, eventually, and the American consumer culture driven by capitalism is now resplendent throughout the world - although arguable if that was for the better or worse. But, the details of the ""victory"" show that the same root causes in American action. It also was helpful that Communism, as implemented across the globe, was an unnatural and unsustainable concept, economically, and failed because of this fact.","12,759 followers",Khalid Elhassan,13.3K,1.2K,38.2M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Why-has-America-lost-nearly-every-war-theyve-engaged-in-since-WW2-despite-massive-military-superiority-in-arms-men-and-technology

Only the foggy idea of a growing communist threat or the defense of democracy were offered. In fact, the United States found itself defending the interests of one corrupt leadership after another. We might say we didn't ""win"" that war, either. But if so, then who DID win? Nobody. And strangely enough, Vietnam today, left to its own devices, has turned out to be pretty much what we had in mind at the time; a peaceful country with a thriving economy who doesn't like China.The operations in Afghanistan? Our attack against the radicalized Islamic enemy was a punitive action and an attempt to exact justice after the events of 9/11. Plenty of fighting, lots of battles, but no real war. The goal of installing and supporting a politically moderate government which controls its own territory has been partially achieved owing to the combat. But the eventual achievement of a politically stable and peaceful region can only be the result of aThe Second Iraq War? Maybe a ""win"" in the conventional sense, in which the leadership is toppled and replaced with a government with whom we are friendly. But of course the immediate result was to destabilize the region, such that the various tribes who had always hated each other could start fighting, again. Our goal was to install a government whose leadership would not take hostile actions against neighbors, and whose members would be chosen in a democratic process. The problem here is that people who have never lived in a democracy don't do very well, with it. To them, ""democracy"" is just another word for ""open season.""The current military engagements with ISIL and other radicalized Muslims? Here again, what is the objective? What does a ""win"" look like? Presumably, it looks like peace, freedom and security. But the combatants don't represent a state as we know it. There is no one to ""defeat,"" no one who can sign a treaty. Our only option? ""Kill 'em all and let God sort them out.""

We sharpened sticks into spears, carved flinty rocks into arrowheads, learned how to control fire and use it to keep us warm, cook our food, and change the chemical composition of materials to make pottery and other goods.Tools = technology. And we are all born into different technological eras.When my parents were born, radio was just becoming the mass information and entertainment medium. Nobody had a phone in their home yet, but there might be one down the street at the corner drug store. Planes existed, but only for very brave pilots. Cars were just starting to replaces horses as means of transport on a massive scale.When I was born, just about everyone had a phone in their house, and most people had TVs, but they were still black and white. The computers that existed at that time were massive room-sized machines stored in basements beneath military installations and a handful of large corporations. The transistor had only just been invented. But we had nuclear bombs, as well as ‘duck and cover’ drills in school.When my first child was born, cell phones were still a rarity. Personal computers were common, but they were mostly big bulky things that costs thousands of dollars apiece. There were no flat screen TVs. People still used fax machines. The world wide web was still relatively new, as were websites for mainstream media sites. I remember radio announcers continually stumbling over the URLs they had to read: H T T P colon forward-slash forward-slash W W W dot N P R dot com. Social media did not exist.So you have two choices: Stay locked in at whatever level of technology you inherited, or keep up. Most people, I find, reach a certain level of familiarity with technology and freeze there. They may own a smartphone, but they only use it for a handful of things. They may have a Facebook account, but they’re not on Instagram or WhatsApp or Snapchat.(For the record, I do not get Snapchat and am completely flummoxed as to how to use it. Also: All those teens and 20-somethings who apply dog snouts or cat ears to their photos are really fucking annoying.)But technology is changing the world. It always has, it’s just doing it far more quickly and radically than before. And the pace is increasing. You can either keep abreast of it or not, but if you don’t, you lose the ability to react intelligently to changes that may not be beneficial to you or humanity as a whole.I don’t give a rat’s ass about Facebook’s latest quarterly earnings or whether the Google Pixel phone is better than the iPhone. But I do care about how algorithms are changing society. Right now, today, a resume-scanning algorithm will tell some future employer whether you’re worth interviewing for a job. A profile-matching algorithm could determine the next person you date or marry. A credit-rating algo will tell a bank whether they should loan you money to buy a house.Tl;dr: Technology is already having a pretty damned big impact on your life, whether you want it to or not. And it’s only going to increase. You can be willfully ignorant of it all, but I wouldn’t recommend it.",652 followers,Al Barleta,11.6K,219,1.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Does-Renaissance-Technologies-engage-in-illegal-trading

This failed potential coupled with a heightened sensitivity in game tastes acquired throughout the years by some gamers has created a disparity that many identify as, ""Games today are not as good as they used to be.""Objectively (as much as it's possible) there are as many good games today as there were in the past as many have pointed out. It's easy to forget the multitude of bad or mediocre games you've encountered or avoided in years gone by. However, I do believe that that for their time, the stage of the industry’s development, and with the tools/techniques available that the “good” games of the past represent better realized experiences than the “good” games of the present.I think this can be attributed to a few significant factors. The obvious one is a cultural shift in the industry itself from one fueled by idealism and discovery to one mostly dominated by corporate structures and goals. Make no mistake, games of the past also had the goal of making money, but the culture then (I’m thinking of more than a decade ago) seemed more receptive of explorative work and taking risks at defining what the medium is about.Another contributing factor is the massive team sizes seen in AAA development now. With hundreds of developers and content creators all working on a single project teams are less agile than they used to be and far more constrained. Cross discipline communication and even transmission of ideas within a department moves like molasses in many cases. Often you may have multiple directors, leads, or stakeholders with a say in the overall direction of a project. This leads me to my next point.Lack of a unified vision. Even if a studio has a single creative director calling all of the shots because the process of creating games has becomes so complex and involves so many bifurcating disciplines and individuals execution is ultimately deferred to producers, leads, managers, and ultimately individual developers and content creators. The larger and more complex the team structure the more difficult it is to retain a coherent version of the experience the creative lead(s) seek. There’s basically an inverse relationship between the number of creators on a project and the quality/cohesiveness of the vision.This realization has lead me on a personal crusade to push for what I callI think sole authorship of an experience is the only way to deliver the purest uncompromised vision and allow the most creative freedom. I think the best example of this is authors/novelists. Authors of written work are often able to execute exactly the experience they want. Worst case scenario, they have to make a couple concessions with their publisher, though if they’re self-published they don’t even have to do that. Obviously they can ask for advice or get feedback from others proofreading their work, but they still have ownership over the vision they’re attempting to realize. Imagine the incoherent mess of a story you would have if multiple writers contributed to a single novel.Another analogy that I like to use for modern game development is this:Now imagine a completely inefficient vehicle that has been so compartmentalized that it takes one person to operate the spark plugs, another person to manage the radiator, another person to control electrical flow from the battery, another person controls the brakes, one person steers, another person manages the transmission, etc. Getting anywhere or even being able to communicate between all the necessary personnel to work the vehicle would be a royal pain in the ass. Even if the person steering (the creative director in this analogy) had an explicit destination in mind they’d find it extremely difficult if not damn near impossible to take the route they intend to get there. Ultimately, they might get so frustrated that they settle on a different destination that seems more attainable given the vehicle they have to work with.I want the game industry to move toward creating a vehicle that can be operated by one or a few individuals at most. I think then developers will be much better positioned to craft quality experiences and the expense associated with taking risks won’t be so daunting.",1 follower,Chris Nash,626,5K,30.7M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Does-Renaissance-Technologies-engage-in-illegal-trading

Maybe for some, but on the whole it makes it more accessible to more people, a lot of my friends never played RPGs back then because they thought they were too hard, I think they just didn't write anything down and I get that not everyone would want to do that.Don't get me wrong, I love retro games, I still play on my old systems, and I've repurchased many of my favourite games over the years on newer platforms, one of the main reasons I got a PSP originally was so I could get all the PS One RPGs all in one place, my Vita now has more retro games than new, I play older games quite often and there's a few things I've noticed that you don't remember when you look back on the good old days,* The story is rarely as wonderful as you remember, it's good but it's no better than plot lines in newer titles, they were just as predictable and even more cliche, the fog of time makes them more exciting than they really were.",UNKNOWN,Erwin,951,7.4K,52.5M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Why-has-America-lost-nearly-every-war-theyve-engaged-in-since-WW2-despite-massive-military-superiority-in-arms-men-and-technology

Reality is a tad different.Monthly losses of submarinesIt is commonly repeated that the Soviet Union greatly outproduced Germany in materials relevant to Eastern front (trucks, tanks, artillery) and because most German casualties were in the East, the small forces devoted to Africa, later Italy and garrisons were just a sideshow to the whole thing.Yet this line of reasoning comes crashing down when you realize Germany also produced materials that were not relevant to the Eastern front, but were how the Western front was fought at the time. SubmarinesThat’s the usual Soviet fanboy mantra, yes. Reality is a tad different.Monthly losses of submarinesIt is commonly repeated that the Soviet Union greatly outproduced Germany in materials relevant to Eastern front (trucks, tanks, artillery) and because most German casualties were in the East, the small forces devoted to Africa, later Italy and garrisons were just a sideshow to the whole thing.Yet this line of reasoning comes crashing down when you realize Germany also produced materials that were not relevant to the Eastern front, but were how the Western front was fought at the time. Submarines only need 70 or so crew, but cost as much as about 40 Panzer IVs. 40 Panzer IVs needed 200 crew and this was the expensive way to fight the war in the east. The cheap way was infantry and artillery and the ratio of 3:1 quickly becomes 30:1, compared to submarine warfare.Submarines alone cost Germany about as much as all the tanks combined did. This does not yet include torpedoes and three torpedoes buy you a new Panther. A Type VII submarine typically carried about four brand new tanks worth of torpedoes for a monthlong patrol. An attack against a single merchant ship might cost the same as a brand new Tiger tank.The second reason why “Western front was a sideshow” is dilletantism in action is because of this:RAF bomber commandBombing of Germany caused the Nazis to devote major resources towards defending the skies above Germany. Every fighter built and devoted to defending a German city was a potential fighter-bomber on the Eastern front. Every anti-aircraft gun was a potential anti-tank gun to fight on the Eastern front. Every anti-aircraft shell used to defend Germany was a potential anti-tank or artillery shell to be used in the East.Some 70% of German munition production of caliber 75 mm or greater were anti-aircraft shells to defend Germany. I daresay that if you double or triple German artillery and anti-tank shell supply the Eastern front becomes even bloodier. Most of Luftwaffe was sent to defend skies over Germany in 1943, without that the Red Army may be able to defend the front line but any major breakthroughs are nigh-on impossible. They might break the front line well enough but the progress will soon be checked by the lack of supply thanks to Luftwaffe. This was the case in 1941 and 1942, after all. This is on top of any damage to German industry strategic bombing inflicted, but this is difficult to quanitfy.The third factor is that by 1944, the strongest German divisions were in the West. During Bagration, where Red Army destroyed Army group center, Germany had 800 tanks in Belarus, but over 2,100 in Normandy - including many elite divisions.War couldn’t be won without Soviet blood, but neither could it be won without American factories and British intelligence.

UK and USA jump on Germany from behind and the three hit him with everything they’ve got: CRACK! Germany loses two ribs. KTOW! And another rib! TWOCK!! His jaw! SMASH! His kidney!Germany staggers. Then USSR lands a final sickening blow in his face … and Germany goes down.USA turns around. A final bone-shattering blow, and Japan just drops.The brawl is over.So why did Germany lose?

The remainder were to be Germanized if judged sufficiently Aryan, enslaved and put to work as helots for the ""Master Race"" settlers, or expelled beyond the Urals.A world dominated by people who could calmly plan the murder, enslavement, and ethnic cleansing of hundreds of millions of innocents, would not have been a pleasant one.",0 followers,Brent Cooper,6.2K,7.9K,409.9M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Why-has-America-lost-nearly-every-war-theyve-engaged-in-since-WW2-despite-massive-military-superiority-in-arms-men-and-technology
