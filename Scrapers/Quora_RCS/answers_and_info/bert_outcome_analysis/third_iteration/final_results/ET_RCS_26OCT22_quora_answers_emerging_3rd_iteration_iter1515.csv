2,"Personal vehicle transportation.We will see driver automation allow roads to be more flexible.The cost equation will change. Instead of having an interstate highway that has one car in a 12′ wide lane and 30 feet of space front and back you will be in a self driving vehicle in an 8 foot lane with a 5 feet gap. This means you can fit the same number of vehicles in half as much road width. For a six lane road that’s going from 72 feet down to 32 feet.In rural areas the use of real time communication will allow vehicles to share their routing in the context of having one lane roads.

For a six lane road that’s going from 72 feet down to 32 feet.In rural areas the use of real time communication will allow vehicles to share their routing in the context of having one lane roads. Instead of needing two lanes that sit empty most of the time one lane can be built for most of the length and cars pass at passing zones. In an urban area cars will automatically route to utilize more roads rather than the most direct route ending up congested.Much like stop lights can be programmed, roads could be virtually programmed to change the lane design on demand. Imagine if a technology network detects a bunch of cars going to a big sporting game and it automatically flips lanes to have extra capacity but there’s no signs just beacons telling vehicles which lanes they can use.","135,499 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Excluding-computing-technology-what-is-the-next-big-industry
3,"AI : With the development and improvement of ai,this sector will make so many peoples jobless.Including pilots,machinists,uber&lyft drivers,factory workers.Green energy : This includes fusion power,nuclear power,solar,wind and other sources.Green energy will dominate the market replacing the fossil fuels forever.Software : It is already exploded and almost %70 of all billionaires are owner of software or related companies. In a decade or so demand for software engineers will skyrocket.EV cars : Since most of the developed countries banned fossil fueled cars from 2030,ev car industry will dominAI : With the development and improvement of ai,this sector will make so many peoples jobless.Including pilots,machinists,uber&lyft drivers,factory workers.Green energy : This includes fusion power,nuclear power,solar,wind and other sources.Green energy will dominate the market replacing the fossil fuels forever.Software : It is already exploded and almost %70 of all billionaires are owner of software or related companies. In a decade or so demand for software engineers will skyrocket.EV cars : Since most of the developed countries banned fossil fueled cars from 2030,ev car industry will dominate and control the automotive industry.Space : Companies like Starlink will make billions.However,those who decide to mine the asteroids will become first Trillionaires!Vertical Farming : Vertical farming will become the most common type of agriculture in the future.Maybe not in 10 years but eventually Vertical farming will feed whole World.Also with vertical farming there will be so much more empty land left from the old agriculture lands.This can be used for forestry,housing etc.IOT (Internet Of Things) : With the development of ai, iot will be everywhere in our lives.For example when you wake up,if it snowed outside your car will start working and melt the snow and get ready when you leave the house.Another example,with your mobile phone you will be able to make cleaning robots clean yours house,increase&decrease temperature,make a coffee and make the robot bring it to you or charge your car.",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,2.8K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Excluding-computing-technology-what-is-the-next-big-industry

5,"For me, it’s got to be artificial intelligence. True, we’re already using it to a limited extent in some facilities and for specific use cases, but that’s nothing on what AI could actually do if we had the right systems in place and truly interoperable healthcare data. When you combine population date with artificial intelligence and machine learning, you gain the ability to do long-term studies on population health and even to start identifying ways to save lives or to improve overall healthcare.Being able to use AI to process this data could help to usher in a new era of healthcare in whichFor me, it’s got to be artificial intelligence.

This would also help us to overcome the high costs that are associated with healthcare by using the moderation of lifestyle factors to reduce the need for expensive medicines and treatments.","9,861 followers",Kenzi Mudge,1.8K,1.3K,8.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-problems-will-technology-solve-in-the-next-20-years
