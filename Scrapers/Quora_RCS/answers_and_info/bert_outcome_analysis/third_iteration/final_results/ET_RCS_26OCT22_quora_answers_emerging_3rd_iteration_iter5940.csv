Your hours are flexible, as long as you're getting your work done.I spend the first 30-60 minutes of the day catching up on e-mail. More or less everyone uses the same bug tracking and code review tools, so most of this e-mail is bug reports, requests for me to review someone else's code, comments about my own code, random questions from other teams, etc.The rest of my morning is spent coding. Googlers tend to organize themselves into small teams of 3-6 people focused on one project or a set of projects. Typically, I'm working on multiple things in parallel so I have to prioritize working on what I think is most important. This could be any of new features, bug fixes, code quality cleanup, etc. Usually I'll try to send out a chunk of code to be reviewed before going to lunch.Since lunch is free, convenient, and tasty, my coworkers and I all go to lunch together as close to noon as possible. Contrary to some beliefs, no one is forcing us to go to lunch together or talk about work the entire time, but naturally conversations drift towards what we're working on.I often have a meeting to attend in the afternoon. Sometimes these are regular status update meetings, but the more interesting ones are meetings where we discuss a product issue and come up with a solution of how to address it. The meetings are usually run somewhat informally and are usually ended abruptly when we realize that someone else is waiting to use the room because they have it booked.Throughout the day, I'll get pulled into impromptu conversations with my coworkers. Since my coworkers sit right next to me, it's a frequent occurrence to be interrupted to ask for my opinion on how best to test some code or use some technology. The later the day gets, the more time I have to focus on my own work as my coworkers take off for the day. Often I'll end the day with a workout at the free gym in my office and go home.Though people think it, my day doesn't typically include:What my typical day can include:","224,564 followers",Gayle Laakmann McDowell,2.3K,1.2K,49.8M,2014,https://www.quora.com/I-m-looking-for-a-job-and-i-have-two-offers-on-the-table-Blockchain-engineer-at-a-big-financial-institute-or-software-engineer-at-Google-Given-the-fact-that-Blockchain-is-an-emerging-technology-What-would-you-do-and
