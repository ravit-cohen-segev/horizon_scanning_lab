How ever I would say while Vietnam has been incredibly dynamic and focused since 1996 India has not. The decades 1979 to 1999 were wasted opportunities for India compared to China and ASEAN，now she is begining to pick up her game but it will be hard, look at Modi struggles to pass a basic sales tax, India needs national and state based nationally looking infrastructure urgently.So Vietnam has one major back bone highway, one major rail route，one national telco，one main airline, one main language， two principal cities，5 —7 regional centres, a national education system, one police, customs and civil service， one set of laws， one set of holidays, one main and 2 more minor religions but India has that in every state.","46,129 followers",Steven Haddock,1.4K,25.6K,343.6M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Vietnam-look-much-more-modern-and-developed-than-India

They complain of everything being unauthentic, shunning restaurants loved by locals because they are too big (large scale restaurants are not supposed to be the real Vietnam remember, since Vietnamese must only eat in street stalls as they are incapable of growing a business), moving to small country towns and telling fellow tourists to stay away from a list of “Westernized” cities because they are too large and unauthentic.

Everyone knows what’s wrong with the government, and we (including government workers) love to talk about it, but in the end the economy is booming, no one is dead from hunger, and inequality is present in every country in the world, so does it matter? We just want peace and prosperity.You can follow any religions you want. You can find churches, buddhist and hindu temples, mosques,… all over Vietnam. But the government will sometimes look into new religions to make sure that they are not scams.Weed is banned, on paper only, and is sold everywhere. People smoke weed on the street… But other drugs are no-no. Don’t be stupid and you won’t find yourself in Vietnamese jail.You can get married if you are LGBT, but not legally, that is, the law will not protect the participants if there are disagreements. But there are plans for new laws that will legally recognize same-sex marriage soon. No discrimination towards the LGBT community whatsoever. Plenty of our celebrities are LGBT.Now I might get flamed for this, but my guess is only 0.1% of the population truly, passionately care about freedom of speech, and want a change of the government. But what would be the result of such a change? Even at a 1 percent chance that it would lead to a war, it would still be unacceptable. Our country has paid in blood for generations to buy this peace. People still die every year to unexploded bombs, and children are still being born deformed due to Agent Orange. To throw all of that away for the sake of a few individuals would be an unimaginable insult towards the sacrifices of our people. Here’s what I think an educated, intellectual person should do: work hard, open a company, enrich yourself, and in doing so enrich others around you.

But that’s only half the story.For a thousand years Constantinople was the continued legacy of the empire. Much of the modern-day Hagia Sophia was built under the eye of Justinian I in 537 AD,Maybe not the minarets but definitely the enormous domes and the mosaics inside.The Byzantine Empire had one of the most comprehensive education systems in the world at the time; they had public schools, travelling teachers and if you wanted a bureaucratic job you could move to the city and get a university education. Yet despite this comparative luxury the rest of Europe managed to catch up to them during the Crusades, and the Italian Renaissance was fueled by scholars from the Byzantine Empire fleeing from the Ottoman Turks who assailed the empire for a full century before the empire’s collapse in the late 15th century.As comprehensive as the Byzantine Empire’s education system was, for most citizens the only learning that could be done was reading, writing and adding. It existed primarily to provide a solid labour pool for Constantinople’s enormous bureaucracy.The Roman empire survived for a thousand years past the collapse of the leadership in Rome but that didn’t put them a thousand years ahead of everyone else because Byzantium inherited both the advantages and drawbacks of Rome’s legacy for innovation.See, when it came to invention Rome was like the Borg - it would take ideas it thought were cool and useful and left all the fancy-wordy-stuff to their clients like the Greeks, who were the go-to population for scholars. When Archimedes told a Roman soldier “leave me to my circles” who Had broke into his home during the fall of Syracuse, said soldier respected the old manEven 2000 years ago the nerds were getting beat up by the jocks.It was not an empire with a vision for the betterment of its citizens. It was after glory and power, Rome was the center and apex and everything was designed to show how Rome was better than everyone else. The Romans were great at designing large constructions or organizing a solid army but not so great at ideas for making day-to-day life easier. Mainly because any problem they encountered could be solved with the answerAnd the answer to all of your slave shortages were a market visit away. Large animals helped with the stronger jobs but if a job required a person to do it, or worked well using a person the general answer was to get another person to fill the role instead.“Get slaves to do it”So Medieval Europeans looked for mechanical solutions. The development of windmills, telescope, printing press, sail-focused ships, mechanical cranes and so on were all motivated at least in part because buying a person to do said job was a social no-no. The constant violent infighting between states provided a motivation to which people in power could one-up each other in a practical sense. The arts, engineering, warfare and metallurgy all flourished in this big mosh pit competition to show off which local noble was the most impressive.Rome never saw such extensive competition. Its greatest opposition perished 200 years before Julius Caesar, the main threat was barbarians at the gates and the ones funding all the grand projects were already on top of everyone else.The possibility exists then that Europe and humanity is as advanced as it is now",152 followers,Alex Mann,2.4K,2K,102.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Vietnam-look-much-more-modern-and-developed-than-India

The Princeps learned from the mistake of Gaius Iulius Caesar who behaved too suspicious to the Romans especially during the moment he officially declined a Roman crown.This propaganda act backfired for Caesar and so the assassination of Caesar at the Ides of March 44 BCE / 719 AUC became a neccessity to the murderers of Caesar to protect the Respublica since the Romans then were not yet ready to accept a monarchy again.Augustus himself stylized himself as the savior of the Respublica, its restorer, he maintained the Consuls system, the senate, full of his followers appointed those as Consules he could control. He even maintained the principle that his powers had to be renewed by the senate and openly he “just” maintained his Tribunicia Potestatis” and the “Imperium Maior” as his legal powers. In addition he became the Pontifex Maximus and he accumulated other duties.So, the Romans grateful for the “restauration of the Respublica” mostly didn’t see behind the carefully and masterfully enacted lifelong propaganda done by the Princeps (and his propagandists like Vergilius or Agrippa and even Ovidius prior to his exile to Tomis).Even the transition of power to Tiberius (an emergency solution since the Princeps originally wanted to make his adoptive son Lucius Iulius Caesar his heir but he died 2 CE / 755 AUC due to a sudden illness in Massilia) was accepted by the Romans since they feared, a “restored” full senatorial and consules rule over the Roman state would result in a new series of countless civil wars and the senate still was in power to accept or deny an emperor.And Tiberius despite his own paranoia and shortcomings managed to at least keep the “Respublica” somewhat stable.Openly, the Roman rulers abandoned this kind of propaganda of “still living in a Respublica Romana led by the Princeps” not earlier than two centuries later with the Dominate of Imperator Caesar Diocletianus and his system of Augusti and Caesari.Not early than at the end of the third century CE the Roman state officially acknowledged that it has become a monarchy and even then the senate in Rome, later in Constantinopolis had some powers unlike the absolutist monarchies inspired by France under Louie XIV with some preparations by Cardinal Richelieu.To the Romans, their Principate was or at least seemed more stable than what we call today the late Roman Republic.Until the end of the (already heavily transformed and now Greek speaking) Roman state (Basileon ton Romaion) in 1453 at the hand of the Ottomans, the Romans/Rhomaioi never returned to a Respublica. The last Roman emperor Constantinos XI Palaeologos, the Basileus kai Autokrator ton Rhomaion died during the battle of Constantinopolis in 1453.So, the Roman Empire / Basileon ton Rhomaion had a 12 centuries long history as an open monarchy plus the additional three centures in which the monarchy was disguised as the “restored” Respublica Romana.To me, overall the 2206 years of the history of the Roman state is truly fascinating.And after the Imperium Romanum / Basilion ton Rhomaion the idea of a state led by a parliament in the name of its peoples lived on, gained a bit of traction first in Great Britain and especially in the United States, France and in the modern day most western or at least somewhat western influenced countries.Russia, the “fan fiction about Rome” who called itself the third Rome, the Repubblica Italiana, the land on the soil of their Roman ancestors, Germany, the successor state to the “Holy Roman Empire” aka “the one who ruined the original” are all republican states again.And here, for the fun part of history, a great pictureImage source:A little clarification.

TheseWhat does the Roman Empire not falling entail?When people talk about the fall of the Roman Empire, they’re talking about two separate events: the end of the Western Roman Empire as a unified political entity, and the slow collapse of the Roman economy and destruction of Roman technology. These are connected but not synonymous.The political end of Rome was not too important on its own. We think of hordes of barbarians sacking a great city and plunging the empire into chaos, but that couldn’t be farther from the truth. What really happened was a movement of Germanic people into the empire. These Germans settled in low population regions and quickly adapted Roman life. Many joined the Roman army and became very important parts of the Empire. However, political tensions between Rome and these German vassal kings were high.Many times wars broke out, and sometimes the Romans won and slaughtered the Germans. But, as the Roman economy collapsed, they became more and more reliant on German soldiers. When wars broke out between the two groups, the Germans consistently won. And eventually Rome was no longer able to administer the empire, and Germans took control of their surrounding provinces.For your average Roman living in, say, Gaul, little changed. They were still Roman, they still spoke Latin, they still practiced the Roman religion (ancestor of Catholicism), and they still lived in the Roman Empire. Their coins still had the face of whoever ruled in Constantinople. Their lives were indistinguishable from two hundred years ago.The end of classical Roman life was mostly a result of the massive economic collapse. The political collapse was a result of that. There are so many complex factors behind this economic collapse, so we can probably assume that it was inevitable.Basically, nothing lasts forever. Even if West Rome retained its political unity, its golden age would have permanently ended. This hypothetical scenario is essentially impossible to answer because it goes against human nature. No golden age can last indefinitely.There are two types of alternate history scenarios: the ones that involve changing one specific thing, and the ones that involve changing a conclusion without looking at the causes. The first type can be speculated about, but the second type cannot. We can wonder about if German kingdoms never took control over the empire, but we cannot speculate about the Roman golden age lasting forever because it is impossible.Edit- Technically I should probably refer to this people as Germanic, not German, as that usually implies relation to the modern nation of Germany. That didn’t exist then, or really at any point until the 1800’s. These people were mostly Goths, who are extinct, or Franks, the ancestors of the Dutch. Modern Germans come mostly from the Bavarians, Saxons, and Alemanni, with some Frankish in there. But whatever, these people were referred to as German then.","29,974 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,1K,7.7K,249.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Vietnam-look-much-more-modern-and-developed-than-India

But Huawei will still lose its international market share if Japan-owned,British-operated ARM holdings were to allow the ARM architecture license expires and not renewed, assuming Japan/UK ...",0 followers,Ming Mo,622,118,132.2K,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Vietnam-look-much-more-modern-and-developed-than-India

They took the Linux kernel and built a system on top of it.It is an old saying, but is still a relevant one: don’t reinvent the wheel.

41,"Why bother?The OS exists to run applications. The Open Source movement (and Linux in particular) came to life in order to create a cost “free” platform for running applications. It has, in effect, commoditized operating systems.Chinese companies could invest billions of dollars to compete against core operating systems and earn commodity prices for their effort. Or they could focus on the applications and make a billion. That seems to be working for WeChat, Baidu, Tencent, etc.","36,851 followers",Sylvain Saurel,726,6.2K,266M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Vietnam-look-much-more-modern-and-developed-than-India
42,"Google hasn’t created an OS from scratch. They’ve heavily modifed Linux for Android, but it wasn’t a from-scratch effort.Microsoft has - a couple of times.Apple has too - but OS/X wasn’t entirely from scratch, as it built on Mach, FreeBSD, NeXT, and a LOT of open source code. Apple DID put a lot of effort into OS/X (iOS, et. al.) but they built on the successful and open framework of the descendants of Unix.Developing an entirely new OS entirely from scratch is an enormous undertaking - with very little obvious reward.

A radically new OS would require fixes to all of the open source software that makes so much possible these days - even if it were possible to adapt.There is and always will be room for new specialist operating systems - but they’re not going to be involved in business or consumer applications, or in general purpose computing of other sorts. They’re going to be minimalist systems designed to cope with very special requirements - such as quantum computers.Open source operating systems like Linux and the various BSDs offer plenty of opportunity for most computing needs these days - and they’re general design and architecture are fixed and in place. And Microsoft is offering it’s OS on friendly terms as well.A LARGE number of different operating systems were developed from the 1960s through the 1990s - but an widely adopted operating system needs to have lots of software widely provided. Most of those operating systems never got enough adopters to share the useful things that have come out of open source (yes, there was support in OpenSSL and Apache httpd and Perl for VAX/VMS - but that’s irrelevant now.)Basically, the OS doesn’t matter. It’s the support. And Linux (and the BSDs) are open enough to satisfy China’s concerns about being locked into a single vendor (i.e.: Microsoft.) China isn’t going to adopt Solaris or VAX/VMS or AIX any more than it does Windows.",52 followers,David Levy,2.8K,295,1.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Vietnam-look-much-more-modern-and-developed-than-India

44,"As big as China is in technology, why haven't they developed an operating system entirely from scratch to compete with Google's, Microsoft's and Apple's so that they are free from American products at a large scale?You could ask the same question for many countries who have been technologically advanced before China, and for decades.Even though South Korea is a smaller country than China, it’s probably the best example.

The world has been overflowed with Korean products especially Samsung and until now, Samsung has always failed to develop its own operating system. Tizen is the best example. An OS pushed by Samsung. Does anybody on Quora have or use Tizen in its daily life? For sure not really!Google, Microsoft or Apple have been on the market for so many decades and have become so much powerful that all new opponents have faced difficulties to become popular. Even Microsoft failed in the mobile phone market with its OS. Linux and other “by-products” haven’t been able to attract many customers until yet. It’s simply very hard to change the routine of customers if you don’t offer them something very special or really cheaper.In addition, many Chinese goods such as computers, TV or smartphones don’t hold 100% Chinese technologies. Just take Xiaomi as the best example. Xiaomi smartphones have Japanese, Korean and American components. Even Xiaomi power-banks were launched with LG batteries inside! As well, many Chinese goods which hold technologies seek the foreign markets so there isn’t a real need to develop its own system for everything.",16 followers,Rahul Funde,527,529,915.2K,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Vietnam-look-much-more-modern-and-developed-than-India
