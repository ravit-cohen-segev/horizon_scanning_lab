Night after night throughout the course of the war, F-117s bombed command and control centers deep in the heart of BStealth technology is not useless, it is just not as useful as the US thinks it is. When US stealth technology made its debut in Desert Storm, Soviet leaders were shocked by its effectiveness. American F-117s were able to sneak deep behind Iraqi lines and bomb targets with impunity. Night after night throughout the course of the war, F-117s bombed command and control centers deep in the heart of Baghdad, air defense installations spread throughout the country and strategic infrastructure like bridges and power plants covered by some of Iraq’s most potent air defenses. All told. F-117s flew 1,300 sorties and attacked 40% of the strategic targets in the Gulf War.F-117However, stealth aircraft like the F-117 are only optimized against certain frequencies. Historically, missiles have had to rely high-resolution radars that utilize beams with wavelengths measured in centimeters and millimeters to target stealth aircraft. These frequencies are known as the SHF and EHF bands, respectively. These SHF and EHF band radars are better at estimating the speed and location of non-stealth targets than radars that utilize longer wavelengths, therefore they can guide missiles more accurately. Stealth aircraft are optimized against targets in these bands, making it difficult to get a weapons-quality track on them.No sooner than the dust had cleared over Baghdad did the Russians/Soviets begin work on counters to the US’s stealth technology. The Russians immediately recognized that stealth aircraft had relatively poor performance against radars with wavelengths measured in meters or decimeters, operating in the VHF and UHF bands respectively. Modern stealth aircraft rely on honeycomb type structures in the aircraft skin to trap radar waves. However, these longer wavelength radars produce beams that are too long to get trapped in these structures. Additionally, they have a tendency to resonate off of defining features on the aircraft like the engine inlets or vertical or horizontal stabilizers, that are up to 10x the length of the radar that is observing them, producing a sizable return. Consequently, these radars are able to observe stealth aircraft with relative ease.Nebo VHF-band AESA Radar Used in the S-400However, historically these radars have suffered from poor resolution. UHF and VHF band radars have only been able to track targets within a few hundred meters, making them unsuitable for guiding missiles. Nevertheless, as the computer revolution has progressed, signal processing techniques have been developed that allow UHF and VHF radars to far more accurately fix the location of aircraft, making them more suitable for missile guidance. The Russians have been able to develop radars like the Nebo VHF-band radar utilized in the S-400 that are capable of providing a weapons quality track or at the very least guiding a missile with an infra-red seeker to within a range, where it can autonomously locate and target an aircraft. As a result, radars have advanced to a point where aircraft like the F-117 would no longer be able to survive to perform missions like the ones they performed in Desert Storm.E-2D Advanced HawkeyeThat being said, stealth technology is not totally useless. Radars like the Nebo radar used in the S-400 are enormous. They are simply too large to fit into most aircraft, aside from AWACS aircraft like the American Northrop Grumman E-2D and the Russian Beriev A-100. The E-2D utilizes an UHF-band radar, which has proven capable of guiding SM-6 missiles. Nevertheless, these radars are far too large to fit into most fighter, which are still largely dependent on radars in the SHF and VHF bands. Radars require a number of antennas to be able to effectivel...","68,803 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,514,17.3K,413.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/According-to-ex-Pentagon-software-chief-US-has-already-lost-the-AI-fight-to-China-What-is-the-reason-for-the-slow-pace-of-technological-transformation-in-the-US-military-given-that-these-emerging-technologies-were

The first is thatLet me explain.Not for 20-30 yearsThis answer considers a toe-to-toe confrontation where either side is aiming to defeat their enemy in the field. This kind of conflict is most similar to pre-Cold War conflicts. China, while nearly par economically with the US, has some major deficiencies militarily. China and the United States are separated by thousands of miles of ocean, so any conflict would necessarily be a sea and air battle first, then would convert to a ground when/if either side gained sea/air supremacy. Assuming all things equal, the United States has a vastly more experience army, navy, and air force.China outnumbers the US in terms of total numbers, but the US has a half century headstart in technology and has been continually fighting wars since WWII ended, which cannot be said for China. The current generation of Chinese soldiers would seem inexperienced compared to their American counterparts who would have served 2 or 3 tours of duty in the past ten years against a variety of opponents.China also has a larger air force than the US, technologically still relies on old Russian technology and some newer homegrown additions. The US has the full weight of NATO supplying military research. The F-22, although hardly used, is pretty much the most perfect fighter ever built and would easily win the skies against Chinese opponents.In terms of the navy, the US is simply in a class by itself. It's possible the US could take on the navies of multiple major powers at once and still emerge victorious. The US has more aircraft carriers than the rest of the world combined by nearly a factor of 2. In a traditional context, the Chinese navy would simply stand no chance.China has been working very hard to overcome these deficiencies, but has literally decades of navy-building before it can stand toe-to-toe with the US.China has already caught upChinese policymakers are not stupid. They realize, as most people do, that China is heavily outclassed militarily. Because of this, they have not focused on building a toe-to-toe military capability. Instead, they've worked something called ""asymmetrical"" military force built around a concept of denying regional access. All this means is that China is not looking to ""beat"" the US, but rather deny them access to crucial regions so that a toe-to-toe conflict never occurs. This involves developing ""carrier killer"" missiles and long range drones and that can take out US naval assets before they arrive on the scene. A large submarine fleet was also developed with this strategy in mind.Within this context, it is likely that if a conflict were to emerge between China and Taiwan, it would be difficult for the US to intervene before China has already secured the island. Those privy to the subject will tell you that in the Pacific, there are two island chains. One is close to East Asia and one is further out towards Hawaii. China, like Japan in WWII, knows that it would simply be annihilated if it tread too far past the second island chain. So instead, their policy is to deny the US access to the first island chain and secure regional hegemony.Wrapping upEssentially, depending on how you define the concept, China may be horribly outclassed or on-par with the US. The US is well aware of this strategy by China and has been developing weapons to counter it. If the US finds a way to extend its strike capability past the range of China's missiles, China would have fallen further behind in the arms race. As it stands, the US can expect to lose access to regions like Taiwan and some areas of the South China Sea over the next decade unless regional alliances and military breakthroughs favor US military objectives. No matter what, it will be a long time (maybe never) before China can stand up to the United States and succeed in a blue-water struggle for air and naval dominance.",UNKNOWN,Bill Yu Liao (廖彧),650,138,1.9M,2016,https://www.quora.com/According-to-ex-Pentagon-software-chief-US-has-already-lost-the-AI-fight-to-China-What-is-the-reason-for-the-slow-pace-of-technological-transformation-in-the-US-military-given-that-these-emerging-technologies-were
