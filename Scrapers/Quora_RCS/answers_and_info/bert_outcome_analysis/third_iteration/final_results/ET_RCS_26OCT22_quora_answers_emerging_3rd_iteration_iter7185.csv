Arthashastra , a book written by4.5. Process of fermentation was well known to Indians. Vedas & kautilyas Arthashastra mention about many types of liquors.6.7. The concept that matter is made of indivisible building blocks appeared in india a few centuries BCE.Like this there are lots of examaple to give about the great ancient discoveries of Indians . But i think this will be enough to show greatness, and richness of our culture.THANK YOU !!!",14 followers,Deepankar Sharma,735,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Was-Ancient-indian-science-more-developed-than-todays-modern-science
1,"The plastic surgery that we know today, to change someone’s face, did you know that the technique was actually discovered in India. Not just this but there are several other thousands of medical practices and techniques that were discovered and first used by Sushruta some 2600 years ago which are in use in the present day.Today Banaras (Varanasi) is famous as an ancient religious place but in the 6th century BC this city was renowned for its complicated medical procedures, people from far off areas used to visit this place to get treated.

Not just this but there are several other thousands of medical practices and techniques that were discovered and first used by Sushruta some 2600 years ago which are in use in the present day.Today Banaras (Varanasi) is famous as an ancient religious place but in the 6th century BC this city was renowned for its complicated medical procedures, people from far off areas used to visit this place to get treated. And the credit goes to Maharishi Sushruta who had managed to perform rhinoplasty, cataract surgery and even the most complicated of all brain surgery here with absolute precision at that time. In those times, when kings used to punish people for some petty offences by cutting of their nose, these techniques were not less than a boon for the people.Since there were no advanced machines and equipments available, Sushruta designed and created 121 surgical tools, which were special as they were actually inspired from nature like the cat’s bow which is inspired from the cat’s claws which is used by surgeons even today to reach organs separating the flesh aside. Besides this, all foreceps resembled birds’ peak. We must acknowledge Sushruta’s skill to observe nature which is helping surgeons even today after thousands of years.Precise and appropriate information on Sushruta and his contributions to medical science can be found in Banaras Hindu University (IIT BHU). The texts here clearly depict his techniques, you can also find a book written by Maharishi Sushruta himself, Sushruta Samhita containing 180 chapters describing the 300 procedures devised by him and over 625 medicines that can cure a variety of diseases.In fact I found a video which depicts all his contributions with visuals in an easy to understand language in Hindi. It also shows how British while ruling over India took all his techniques and took away credit from Sushruta and India.Now it is for you to decide, whether ancient Indian science was advanced or not.","1,146 followers",Karmanya Singh,17.3K,279,2.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Was-Ancient-indian-science-more-developed-than-todays-modern-science
2,"Was ancient Indian science best according to its time ? Maybe.Was ancient Indian science more developed than today's modern science? Hell no, only a child or a brainwashed person would believe that. Sure our ancient Indian science provided some basic structure to maybe some modern achievements but it was nowhere near close to modern science.We live in the Era of electricity, internet, computer, planes, space shuttles, etc. You expect me to believe in ancient India we had better technologies than we have today ?

4,"The Dutch have proposed an interesting development in pumped storage technology: remove the need for a hill. Pumped storage is still the most effective large-scale storage system known, but it is greatly limited by having suitable geography (two lakes, one up a hill and one significantly lower). This scheme proposes putting the lower reservoir in a suitable rock formation a long way underground, using standard tunnel-boring technology to make the cavity. This gives you a very large head and thus large storage, but you can build it almost anywhere where you can put a surface lake, and there isThe Dutch have proposed an interesting development in pumped storage technology: remove the need for a hill.

This gives you a very large head and thus large storage, but you can build it almost anywhere where you can put a surface lake, and there is a reasonably solid bed within 1km or so of the surface.Sub-Surface Pumped Hydroelectric StorageI have no idea how much this would cost to build (a lot, probably), but it seems entirely do-able and quite widely applicable. If people really want 100% renewable energy everywhere then something like this is sorely needed.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Was-Ancient-indian-science-more-developed-than-todays-modern-science

7,"The US is the most technologically advanced nation there ever was, so obviously not! I had the privilege of living there for 4 years in the 90s. It was a little like a sci-fi movie when someone gets transported to the future - I would just wander about gazing at the technological marvels that surrounded me. Just to pick out some of the highlights:1) Domestic life - I was once visiting a friend’s house and their mother happened to be loading clothes into the washing machine.

I had the privilege of living there for 4 years in the 90s.

Just to pick out some of the highlights:1) Domestic life - I was once visiting a friend’s house and their mother happened to be loading clothes into the washing machine. She turned to me and said, “Do you have washing machines in Scotland?” Obviously, I was forced to admit, that no we didn’t. Instead we just went down to the river and bashed our clothes off rocks to clean them.2) Transport - I spent two weeks in the lovely town of Columbia. Missouri. There I amazed the locals with my insistence on using a strange outmoded form of transport known as “walking”. Locals would slow down as they passed in their modern cars, pointing and laughing. To them, it must have been like watching a live action version of the Flintstones.3) Voting – would you believe it, but in the UK we still vote by drawing a little X next to the candidate we want to vote for. No sign of the advanced electronic voting they have over in the states. Indeed, we are so old fashioned that we haven’t even outsourced our voting to the Russians yet!4) Guns – It may be hard for an American to believe but almost nobody in the UK owns their own guns. This means that if we have to rise up and overthrow our own government (currently seems like a good plan) then we will be armed with nothing more than some particularly well sharpened sarcasm.Still, perhaps one day we can hope to be as advanced as the US. And there is some hope, as we now have our very own version of Donald Trump as PM!4K","5,361 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Was-Ancient-indian-science-more-developed-than-todays-modern-science
