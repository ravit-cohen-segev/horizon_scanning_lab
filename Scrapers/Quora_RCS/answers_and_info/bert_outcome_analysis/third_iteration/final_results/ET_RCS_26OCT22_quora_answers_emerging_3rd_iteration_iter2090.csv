0,"The 2019 Toyota SupraToyota has a lot riding on this car. For this car to be even close to its MK4 predecessor it needs to be a really amazing car. After realizing this car will be based off of the new BMW Z4 and have a V6 instead of inline 6 is kinda a let down. I wanted it to be unique and have an engine being able to handle a load like the 2JZ-GTE in the MK4 supra. However, the engine may still be super modifiable. If they can make this car a true successor to the last gen supra then this car may be next big sports car. Anyway, I hope that answered your question.*The 2019 Toyota SupraToyota has a lot riding on this car. For this car to be even close to its MK4 predecessor it needs to be a really amazing car.

1,"I asked my boss who is a professional car designer this question and this is the car he suggested I post: 1937 Mercedes Benz 540K.No one has posted it as yet. It’s rare and one of the most, if not the most beautiful Mercedes Benz of all time. I saw one at a concours event and on a field of beautiful cars, it was the star. There are 3 elements to any car design, proportion, surface and detail. This car scores 100 on each one. It’s timeless and so beautiful.I asked my boss who is a professional car designer this question and this is the car he suggested I post: 1937 Mercedes Benz 540K.No one has posted it as yet.

Everyone would be able to fly.It would be much stable than a helicopter because wind speed would be a bit low.How would it work ?It requires a garden in place of helipad, we will enter the destination (longitude and latitude) and it will take us there automatically.But it has many issues too and it will take it alot of time and devlopment for it to work successfully in a nation like India.Issues it will face :",46 followers,Ben Casey,1K,306,3.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-type-of-technology-do-you-want-to-see-in-upcoming-cars

Well, unfortunately, those microbots are impossible, but there is a similar technology that’s being developed in real life.The idea is to build tiny replicators that can create more of themselves, like a sort of super bacteria that never stops replicating. Such a technology would be“…the first replicator assembles a copy in one thousand seconds, the two replicators then build two more in the next thousand seconds, the four build another four . . in less than two days, theyNanotechnology, but in a really cool way.You remember the microbots in Big Hero 6, right?

But they would have an abundance of material on Earth, especially of carbon, which would likely be the building blocks of such an assemblers.

4,"This is my favourite car…Because it's theOkay, so it's not road-legal or ever likely to go into mass production, but it sure is awesome and it's still a car. It has four wheels, two of which are steered. It has a driver, a steering yoke, wheel brakes, active ride suspension, parachutes, instrument panel and, er, two Rolls Royce jet engines.It also looks gorgeous. All production cars are rubbish when compared to this.This is my favourite car…Because it's theOkay, so it's not road-legal or ever likely to go into mass production, but it sure is awesome and it's still a car.

5,"I used to bicycle. A lot. 150–200 miles a week. I had problems - always - with two vehicles only:The fact is, the Prius is driven almost exclusively by people who hate driving and are so absorbed with fear that they can’t be thoughtful of others. Or so obsessed with MPG that they cannot merge, slow down, and certainly can never speed up.(Bicyclists hate them because they insist on hovering on your ass in mountains, all silent like, holding up traffic, and making other drivers hate you; or they force you to pass them on long descents, which is just obnoxiousI used to bicycle.

If you google any story where a bicyclist was attacked, it is almost always by a passenger in a pickup truck. I have many stories surrounding assholes in pickup trucks. All bicyclists do.There are a number of cars that women seem to strongly prefer. I can talk about male assholes in anything, but, as we all know, any mention of “female drivers” or any implication that women prefer one type of gutless, mundane car over another is absolutely unacceptable. So I won’t dare discuss it. But I will say that when I see a Nissan Rogue, or Murano. Oh never mind.","246,849 followers",Dushka Zapata,2.9K,8.5K,232.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-type-of-technology-do-you-want-to-see-in-upcoming-cars
