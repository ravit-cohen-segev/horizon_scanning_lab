8,"In 2010 Erik Verlinde produced a fascinating paper [1001.0785] On the Origin of Gravity and the Laws of Newton [ https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0785 ] wherein one can obtain both Newton’s law of inertia (his third law of motion) and Newton’s gravitational force law, purely from thermodynamics arguments, and the assumption that information is holographic, a la the holographic principle. In other words,In 2010 Erik Verlinde produced a fascinating paper [1001.0785] On the Origin of Gravity and the Laws of Newton [ https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0785 ] wherein one can obtain both Newton’s law of inertia (his third law of motion) and Newton’s gravitational force law, purely from thermodynamics arguments, and the assumption that information is holographic, a la the holographic principle. In other words, it turns the logic that usually leads to the holographic principle on their head. However, this offers a radically new perspective on what may be the origin of gravitation in a quantum theory of gravity. In particular, the fact that one can arrive at these laws from purely thermodynamic arguments suggests that gravity is an emergent force, which emerges from the tendency of a thermodynamic system towards increasing entropy. As such, this approach, known as entropic gravity, is also known as emergent gravity, for the simple reason that one basically appears to get gravity for free, from a theory where gravity is not put in as an initial ingredient.As I mentioned earlier, these results turn around some of the arguments that lead to the idea that black holes are thermodynamic objects! So first I should tell you a little bit about this whole story:Hawking & Bekenstein argued that if we take quantum field theory (our very best model of microscopic physics to date!) and consider what happens when we switch it on around a black hole, something very funny happens. The black hole appears to emit radiation, called Hawking radiation. Also, the black hole actually has, associated to it, an entropy, which is proportional to the area of its event horizon. For a black hole, the event horizon is the region that bounds the “inside” of the black hole, the region from which nothing, not even light can escape. Outside the black hole’s event horizon, is the (unsurprisingly!) “outside” region of the black hole. One incredibly remarkable result is that the entropy of the black hole is proportional to the area and not the volume of the event horizon! If you’re totally new to this, it may not sound like much, but this single observation leads to the idea called the holographic principle, which could be telling us a great deal about how a quantum theory of gravity might work! In short, the holographic principle states that in any theory of quantum gravity, all of the information about things living inside some region is completely determined by what’s happening on the boundary of that region. For example, if there’s a bunch of particles whizzing around inside a ball-shaped region of space, then the holographic principle basically says that everything that’s happening in this region can be completely ascertained by what’s happening on the sphere at the boundary of this region. Nuts, right?Ok, so that’s out detour: so what is Erik Verlinde saying? His proposals work, roughly, as follows: Suppose we take a massive particle in space, and consider that it’s living in a space which is bounded by what we’ll call a “holographic screen” (this is basically playing the role of an event horizon in Bekenstein’s derivation of the black hole entropy). One one side of this screen is the particle, and on the other we are to imagine is nothing (yet!). We’re to imagine that the space is divided on one side of the screen, into “emerged space”, where the particle is living, and on the other the so-called “un-emerged space”, where there’s presently nothing. This might sound a bit silly, but bare with me.Now Bekenstein derived the value of the black hole entropy by considering that if there was a particle really close to the horizon (technically, exactly one Compton wavelength away from it) it would then add “one degree of freedom” to the black hole’s entropy. What Verlinde is saying is that basically this argument applies to the case I’m describing above: when the massive particle is really close to the holographic screen, it then adds “one bit” of information to it.Ok, so we have entropy, but if we’re wanting to do thermodynamics and we want to, for example, consider the first law of thermodynamics, we don’t just need entropy, but also temperature and energy. Here’s where Verlinde assumes the holographic principle, in reverse! What happens is that to define the energy of this system, he imagines that the energy of emerged part of space is spread evenly over the holographic screen. It doesn’t sound like much, and formally what he’s doing is assuming that the equipartition law holds (this is a thermodynamics thing).Ok, entropy and energy defined, what about temperature? How can we associate a temperature to the holographic screen? Well going back to the story of black holes, there’s a way to associate a temperature to the event horizon, and it turns out a similar argument can be used to associate a temperature to the holographic screen we’re considering: Suppose there’s an observer sitting in a vacuum state of quantum fields. If they have a particle detector, they won’t register any “clicks”, because (by definition) they’re sitting in the vacuum. Now suppose that that observer accelerates uniformly. It turns out, if you know a lot about quantum field theory, you can ascertain that this observer will actually detect that the vacuum is actually excited! Purely because they’re accelerating, their detector will click. This is called the Unruh effect! This radiation that they detect has a temperature, called the Unruh temperature.Now it turns out that an observer sitting outside a black hole is continually accelerating in order to maintain their position with respect to the black hole. Consequently, they observe thermal excitations (their detector clicks!) , purely due to the presence of the black hole. This is very roughly how we ascertain that the black hole not only has an entropy, but its event horizon also has a temperature associated to it! The black hole also carries energy, so by now hopefully you can appreciate that black holes have all of the ingredients necessary to know about thermodynamics: temperature, energy, entropy (and in fact chemical potentials too, but let’s ignore that for now!)Ok, so there’s a way to associate a temperature to the black hole, and we can apply this to Verlinde’s holographic screen too. What we do is to suppose that the particle is accelerating towards the screen, and that the screen must have a certain temperature in order to accelerate that particle towards the screen. We take this temperature to be exactly the Unruh temperature corresponding to the required acceleration! Ok this was a very, very long-winded and even bizarre thing we’ve just done, but why? Well it turns out that applying the first law of thermodynamics to this system gets you exactly Newton’s law of inertia, that is F = m a! Where here a is the acceleration towards the holographic screen caused purely by the temperature of the holographic screen. Let me stress this one last time just to get the point across that we’re really going from thermodynamics to inertia: normally with the Unruh effect, we find that an observer who is accelerating sees radiation at a particular temperature, instead here we’re assuming that the massive particle is accelerating because the holographic screen has a certain temperature.It turns out too, that if you consider a holographic screen which is a closed region (such as a sphere), then the first law of thermodynamics applied to that system also gets you Newton’s gravitational force law! Magic right? Ok, well I’m a physicist and I’m familiar with the arguments that lead to black hole thermodynamics and the holographic principle, so in a sense I can appreciate why something like this had to work, but the novelty (as I mentioned earlier) is that we’re not just turning these arguments backwards; in the process we’re finding that we can derive the laws of inertia and gravitation, from purely thermodynamics (and evidently the holographic principle sneakily included!).Ok, well Newton is all well and good, but what about Einstein’s theory of general relativity? We all know that Einstein’s theory is bigger and better that Newton’s theory, so what has this thermodynamic hocus-pocus got to say about that? Well, a pretty good answer is Ted Jacobson’s paper The Einstein Equation of State [ https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9504004 ]. This is quite a lot older than Verlinde’s paper and the latter was in many ways inspired by the former, but herein Jacobson derives not Newton’s equations, but Einstein’s field equations of general relativity, from purely thermodynamics arguments!The reason this is all so exciting is because it offer us the heady idea that gravity, in the terms we think of it, even in the gorgeous terms given to us by Einstein, may not be fundamental at all. It suggests that gravity emerges from some microscopic theory, in the same way that air pressure arises from the microscopic behaviour of wiggling, colliding air molecules! In both cases, the emergent force is not there as an initial ingredient, but emerges from it, purely from the statistical tendency of the theory towards increasing entropy, when you consider things on large scales.For a very long time now, we’re been bashing our heads trying to work out how to describe a theory that is both quantum mechanical and describes gravity. Despite our best attempts, we’re still arguably quite far from a satisfactory resolution to this problem; the so-called problem of quantum gravity. String theory offers one such solution to this problem, but it’s far from clear whether this is the right path; or at least it’s not abundantly clear to appropriately many people! Needless to say, String theory is immensely popular, and it’s far more well-known about than the kind of thermodynamic gravity approaches I’ve just attempted to describe.What the thermodynamic gravity approach may be trying to tell us is “you’ve been doing this all wrong!”. In short, most approaches to the problem of quantum gravity involve trying to state with gravity and add quantum mechanics to it in a sensible way, but these have so far failed, or at least not gone far enough. What the thermodynamic approach may be telling us is that it may make no more sense (I’m more or less paraphrasing Jacobson now!) to quantise general relativity than quantising the ideal gas law. Intriguingly then, the philosophy of this approach might completely undercut what we’ve been trying to do (and so far innovatively failing to do!) for many decades!Ok, but in this answer I’ve referred to a paper from 2010 and even one from as far back as 1995 (when I was in fact running around primary at school pretending to be an eagle!), so why hasn’t this approach proved more popular? Well this approach is very popular in the sense that it takes very seriously the thermodynamic character of black holes, which many physicists are sure entail indispensable hints as to the quantum nature of gravity. But it’s not actually a microscopic model of physics, like string theory, or loop quantum gravity are. Instead, this approach relies on general thermodynamics arguments applied to a hypothetical thermodynamic system. This can apparently do some very fascinating things (such as, as I mentioned, deriving Einstein’s field equations from a purely thermodynamic setup), but it still remains to understand where this system originates. In other words, if I gave you the ideal gas law, it wouldn’t tell you a great deal about how the molecules in the gas behave, and until you knew that, until you had the microscopic description, there are a universe of questions that you couldn’t answer, just based on that general thermodynamic arguments. What we’d really like then, is a microscopic model that can actually explain how gravity can emerge thermodynamically on large scales.I daresay you might have been asking originally about Verlinde’s recent idea from la...",416 followers,Siering Lodrö Pharchin,1.2K,474,1.4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-recent-advances-that-have-been-made-in-the-food-industry
