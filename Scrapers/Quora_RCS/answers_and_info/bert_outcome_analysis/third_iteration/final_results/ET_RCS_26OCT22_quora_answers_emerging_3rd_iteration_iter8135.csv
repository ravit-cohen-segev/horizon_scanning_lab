But I'm going to have to give my vote to Dr Victor Von DoomDr Doom is a lot of things. Megalomaniacal, egotistical, calculating, a tyrant, a despot, a dictator and a lot more. But more than all of this, he's also basically a prophesied savior for humanity.Wait. What?Oh yeah stick around guys and gals.Dr Doom once travelled to Wakanda in spirit form (he actually planned to invade Wakanda but didn't need to) where he met with Bast, the Panther Goddess and chief god of Wakanda. Bast is most known for giving her blessing(s) to the current king and champion of Wakanda, the Black Panther (whoever it may be at the time) and giving this person the capabilities that is often associated with being the Black Panther. Upon meeting with Bast, she informed him that she would devour his soul if he lied to her for his trespassing into her domain.But what was his reason? Doom wanted the Vibranium to aid in his conquest of Earth. Apparently Vibranium has a special property when magic is applied by amplifying it. In this regard, the potential of Vibranium could well be infinite. And being that Doom is a very capable sorcerer, this could only serve him very well.Doom was measured by Bast as she questioned his reasons and his resolve. She was unimpressed with him initially, believing him to be hardly more than another evil and greedy man going so far as to call him a monster for his many crimes. But unsurprisingly, and in a very Doom fashion, Victor spoke honestly with her and didn't make any attempts to sugarcoat his actions or his reasons, going so far as to measure himself against the actions of the whole of humanity and even against the actions taken by the nation and kingdom of Wakanda, gods and even destiny itself.This momentarily angers Bast, as Doom invites her to look into his soul and get a true measure of his character and his actions. Bast does precisely this as she peers into his soul and here she sees and learns of his anguish, his pains and his faith in himself and of his beliefs.Inside his soul with his memories laid bare, Bast sees things as Doom does and it is hectic, violent, and in desperate need of order. As he details all of this to Bast, we can see that both she and Doom are looking on at various events unfolding. Through these visions, we begin to see why Doom schemes and plots these machinations.Presumably while using his magicks, Doom has peered across the history of humanity (past, present and future). Sadly in all of these events, humanity never gets any better except for one possible future. It’s here that we learn of Doom's goal and the one conclusion that he's drawn.Only he can save humanity if humanity was united under him.Doom admits that his actions are less than savory. But he goes further with his explaining and informs Bast that his methods are what's necessary to see his goal accomplished. He believes that people are opposed to him are simply afraid of this because he views himself as an agent of change. He even goes so far as to explain why he dislikes Rees Richards and T'Challa so much. Because they don't want to change. If he represents change (the Doom of what currently is) than this would make Reed and T'Challa his natural enemies as they would want what's better for here and now. Making them agents of conservation. But he wants more and better for a better and brighter tomorrow.Once again, he asks Bast to take measure of him. But this time, he challenges her to do so while measuring him against the crimes and heinous acts of humanity.At the end of this incredibly insightful journey, Bast makes a revelation that is just as surprising as Doom's true goal and intentions.She has also looked into just as many futures as Doom has and more surprisingly…she actually agrees with him.She believes that Doom is all that he believes and claims himself to be. Doom is the leader to make the hard choices and take the hard path to ensure that humanity reaches its full potential. He is the best possible leader for the betterment of mankind.If Dr Doom ever actually won, it would actually be the best thing for humanity. But thanks to his methods and his ruthlessness to see this (for all intents and purposes) divine goal come to fruition, he's regarded as a villain.And there you go.All hail Dr Doom. Our savior.",12 followers,Steven Carter,993,3K,13M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-comic-book-character-is-portrayed-as-a-villain-but-is-actually-a-hero

I will pick something a bit unorthodox here:Vandal Savage as portrayed in Young Justice animated series. You see, Savage starts off being seen as a bonafide villain. He leads the Light,basically a Society of super-villains,a group that gathers mostly behind computer screens and seemingly plot world domination.See? Most of the members believe that humanity is being done disservice in the long run by heroics of the Justice League. Essentially humanity’s evolution and ability to overcome difficulties is being hindered by superheroes who constantly intervene and prevent human progress. Savage is the creator of this idea:In ancient Babylon he stood tall against the invaders from outer space,protecting humanity:Savage defeated them at the cost of his son Nabu(yes,in this universe Doctor Fate). In centuries to come Savage kept influencing and shaping history until he met an unlikely ally:Darkseid invaded Earth. He was impressed by Savage’s resilience and thus Savage managed to negotiate peace. A partnership of sorts,where each other would wage conquest until time came for the final battle between them. Ultimate cosmic survival of the fittest. Possibly an also inevitable outcome. Savage most likely schemes against Darkseid,preparing humanity for that final enemy that threatens all. Savage is one of the more complex characters. I can’t imagine the loneliness,the pain endured for 50 000 yrs watching children die….until you grow numb enough that you put them out of their misery themselves:Savage is definetly an antagonist. He hinders the protagonists,he shows little mercy and most of his actions are in essence ,,evil”. But are they necessary evil? We have no idea what his ultimate plans are. We have no idea how he wills to eventually outsmart Darkseid. We have no idea how powerful Darkseid is in this universe. So basically Savage is playing the long game. Game for the greater good and eventual rise of humanity. His daughter Cassandra considered him humanity’s greatest hero. There is some nobility in him. There is also solitude,pain……I just know I don’t feel that much of “I’m totally evil” vibe from him :D","220,638 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,783.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-comic-book-character-is-portrayed-as-a-villain-but-is-actually-a-hero

Setting aside the fact that the guy rebuilds Gotham and saves the world that time when Superman is busy in another dimension, he’s portrayed as a villain because he keeps trying to kill Superman. And Superman is perfect, right? So he must be a bad guy if he hates Superman. I take issue with that. Here is this alien who shows up on our planet, uninvited, without asking anyone’s permission and then decides that he has the right to fly around the planet doing basically whatever he wants, again, with no one’s invitation or permission. What about our right to self determination? What abLex Luthor.

What about our right to self determination? What about problems of international relations? Does Superman care about any of that or does he think that might makes right? Or that because he thinks he is doing good things, that makes it okay?Lex is worried that Superman is basically unstoppable. Superman clearly feels he has the right to make all the decisions for himself. If he decided that the best way to protect people was to make himself Dictator of Earth exactly what could we do to stop him? And another thing, he is an American citizen, right? So when he shows up in other countries, again, uninvited, without permission, and destroys their property, is that an act of terrorism committed by an American citizen on foreign soil? Or is his tacit approval by the American government make him an agent of said government and therefore it is, in fact, an act of war by America against a foreign country? Did we authorize him to take those actions? Does Congress approve of his reckless behavior? No! He just decided, himself, that he was allowed to do those things.Sure, he does good things, but there’s a road he’s paving by doing that and it doesn’t lead to a good place. And he gets to decide what is and is not good. He decides who is and is not good. Then he acts on that, without anyone else’s input. Sometimes, those are other Kryptonians but sometimes he’s an alien attacking humans. Lex Luthor has a completely legitimate point about there being huge problems with the way Superman behaves and humans’ casual acceptance of that behavior is a failure on our part to properly think about what he is doing. Lex isn’t exactly going about it in the best way, but I think casting him as nothing more than a villain who gamed the system fails to take into account that Superman is not really the hero people want him to be. When you really think about it, it’s almost an accident that Superman is a good guy. Like in the alternate dimension where he is Ultraman. Just because he accidentally ended up having a happy child and being raised by good parents doesn’t make what he’s doing okay and Lex Luthor is the one who is pointing that out. More modern comics and movies have started to take that into account. You know why? Because Lex was right all along.","2,787 followers",Milan Miloradovic,3.4K,2.3K,35.8M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-comic-book-character-is-portrayed-as-a-villain-but-is-actually-a-hero

Venom is most well known as being a Spider Man villain since that is how adaptations presented him to most audiences. That is true for his early appearances, however Venom hasn’t actually been a villain in over twenty years.The popularity of Venom caused him to become an anti-hero, and despite some hiccups he gradually did grow into more than just gritty 90s product who has struggled with coming to grips with his past actions and his desire to kill.

Sleep 9 Hours a NightPlain and simple. You’ll feel better, look better, be more productive, be happier, and be less likely to suffer from obesity and chronic diseases.Sleep isn’t a weakness. It’s a necessity.Get 7.5–9 hours a night and I promise your life will change.2. Be Happy NowHappiness is a choice (even though we’d like to think otherwise).So stop trying toYour life is better than 99% of the human beings who lived on this planet before you.So be happy now.3. Create Passive Income AsapIt’s worth 10x working income and creates ultimate freedom in your life.If you can build a website, write a book, or launch a product that generates $5,000 a month semi-automatically, your life will change forever.4. Exercise EverydayThere’s no reason to go a day without exercise. You don’t have to lift heavy everyday, but you must MOVE.You’ll be happier, stronger, smarter (literally), and more productive.It takes less than 30 minutes to get a good sweat on and it can add years to your life. No excuses.5. Prioritize Lifestyle > Money (But Money Also)Money is great. But living a life of freedom is better. Prioritize living a great life and embrace minimalism. Make money, sure. But don’t make money at the expense of living your life.6. Stop Eating SugarIt’s basically poison and has no nutritional value. A cookie here and there isn’t a big deal, but the less of this crap you eat, the better you’ll feel and the more effectively you’ll perform.7. Do The ThingsLife is too short to live for other people.So your parents want you to be a Doctor? So what! They don’t have to live your life or shoulder your regrets.Do what you want to do and remember that life is too damn short to follow other people’s dreams.8. Only Take Advice From People You’d Trade Lives WithIf someone doesn’t have the life that you want or at leastThis includes me.If you want to be a billionaire mega investor and rule the world, don’t listen to a word I say.If you want to have a life of happiness, financial freedom, and lifestyle independence, I might have a thing or two to teach you.9. Travel More and Travel LongerYou’ll never regret it. It will open your eyes to new ways of living, thinking, and being and will be the most transformative experience of your life.If you have the opportunity to travel somewhere new, always say “Yes.”10. Make Time to ThinkDon’t get so caught up in doing things that you forget to make time to think.Ponder deep questions, ask yourself what you really want out of life, figure out innovative solutions to your problems.Make time for deep thought and you’ll be amazed at how your life will change.11. Quit ComplainingIt doesn’t help you, it pisses off the people around you, and makes you less attractive.Remind me again why you think it’s a good thing to bitch about traffic all the time?12. Stop LyingTo your friends, family, and most importantly… Yourself.Live in truth. Be authentic. Stop making crap up and pretending you’re ok to make other people happy.You can only change your life from a place of truth.Be honest about your reality, desires, and obstacles and you’ll find that the solutions come easier.13. Read as Much as You CanNever pass up an opportunity to expand your mind and broaden your horizons. Read about everything.Science, psychology, self help, business, history, biographies, fiction. You name it.The more you read, the more well rounded you’ll become and the better your life will be.14. Be Nice to YourselfYou’re the only person you have to live with for the rest of your life. So try being nice to yourself.Watch the negative self talk. Believe in yourself. Treat yourself with love and respect.Before you do, say, or pursue anything, ask yourself, “If a close friend was in this situation, how would I respond or what would I encourage him/her to do?”15. Don’t be a DickSeriously…Life is too short to yell at the Verizon customer support agent over a payment dispute. The poor gal wasn’t the one who double charged your account, so don’t take it out on her.Life has a funny way of reprimanding mean people.So be nice to people and stop being a dick, m’kay?Hope this helpsStay Grounded,Want to learn more about my mission and keep the conversation going?Then",1 follower,Rahul K Jha,5.5K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-computer-tricks-that-a-CS-student-must-know
