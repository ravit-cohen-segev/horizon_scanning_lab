Meanwhile, Metal Gear Solid 5 has shipped over 5 million copies. 400 vs. 5. It’s little wonder that they decided to restructure their gaming division earlier this year. Nobody knows for certain at this time that they’ll shift focus to their mobile gaming, but I wouldn’t be surprised.If we look at EA’s latest two games, we have: Apex Legends, a free-to-play battle royale game which garnered 25 million players in the first week and 50 million players by the end of the first month; Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order, a single-player game which sold 26,761 copies within its first week of sale. Four months later, it had sold more than 10 million. Still less than half of the players Apex Legends had in its first week.So with two big companies, we’ve seen first-hand that their single-player game has not done as well as their mobile or free-to-play game. At what point do companies decide, “It’s no longer worth it for me to continue making single-player experiences”? I say that as somebody who prefers single-player games, and it makes me sad to say it.B) We may see a surge of indie-games like we’ve never seen before.For all of the success I’ve already talked about with the big companies and their online games, there are a couple of trends worth mentioning. One is that indie-games continue to be beloved.Kickstarter has launched a number of successful games made by a small team. Examples include The Binding of Isaac, Braid, Bastion, Undertale, Hollow Knight, Super Meat Boy, and the list goes on and on. I’ll bet you’ve heard of at least some of those titles I just listed.Right now it’s easier than ever to make one of these indie-games, with more experienced developers regularly holding ‘game jams’ where they crank out a game in a day or a week.On top of that, you have Minecraft and Roblox teaching kids that they can create the next generation of games like no generation has had before. It’s not hard to imagine a lot of today’s kids becoming tomorrow’s indie game developers.Unforeseen technological advancements will make high-quality game development even easier in a decade or two.C) World War III forces everyone to stop playing games and live off of rations in bunkersWhich of these predictions will come true, if any?

It is the ability to play your games anywhere, at any time, that is so incredibly charming! Boot up a video game on your TV, save, and continue on your mobile or laptop away from home! At some point of time, there will be little to no difference between platforms, with most games being playable on every platform imaginable!This is the future of video games, and there is everything to be excited about! Not only will you be able to play virtually anywhere, but you will also be able to stream your games with ease, as anyone with access to your cloud will be able to watch you play! There is an array of cloud gaming services already available, however, none of them have hit the mainstream due to a lack of functionality. As technology keeps improving, the cloud services will follow and take over the world of gaming!Improved graphicsGraphics has always been a point of focus in game development, therefore, it is no surprise that the future of video games promises to have even more realistic graphics! The graphics have come a very long way over the last decade, however, they are not quite perfect yet! Firing up a game in 4K graphics today is an awe-inspiring experience and it is hard to believe how stunning the environments and the characters look. 4K does not seem to be satisfactory to the game developers though, as what was considered as a revolution in graphics is said to soon be replaced by 8K! Combining 8K graphics with increasingly more powerful game engines, we may come to a time when video game worlds and real life are hard to differentiate!The future of video games is sure to have a step up in realism and working out the way that hair looks in games is one of the main points of focus! No matter how realistic characters and animals in gaming have looked to date, their hair has always caused major issues. It looks more like plastic than hair, often staying motionless while the character is moving. This has seen improvements lately but is yet to be completely worked out. Sure enough, the hair in gaming will look as lifelike as everything else does, it is only a matter of time. The future of video games looks to be as bright as ever at least as far as graphics are concerned!Virtual Reality coming back!Virtual reality has gathered a lot of hype when it first came into prominence a few years ago, however, it never really take-off. Yet! There was a lack of virtual reality video games and those that were there left a lot to be desired. Couple that up with a price-tag that definitely was not for everyone and it is easy to see why virtual reality gaming never hit the mainstream. The times are changing though, and VR has all the qualities needed to be the future of video games!Virtual Reality allows for a level of immersion that cannot be paralleled by any other form of gaming, sending the player into a different world, hence the straightforward name. It does have the ability to provide an otherworldly experience and is now becoming increasingly more affordable, with the technology improving every day! Eventually, VR will become everything we initially expected out of it when the talks first began – plenty of games, all of them working without any disturbance! Multiple video game developers already acknowledged the fact that VR is the future of video games, with incredibly popular games such as Skyrim, Batman: Arkham, Fallout 4, and Doom getting their own VR versions, ensuring that the experiences are going to be there for every owner of a VR set! There is plenty to be excited about in the years to come!More spectators than playersStreaming video games is a massively popular phenomenon nowadays and it keeps on growing every day! Twitch, by far the most popular video game service in the world, has announced to have as many as 1.29 million concurrent viewers on average during 2019 so far! It is a 21% increase from 1.07 million in 2018, leaving no doubts that the future of video games is closely linked with streaming.Streamers are now becoming international superstars and are earning a living just by entertaining their viewers. If platforms such as Twitch continue on growing throughout the years to come, it is inevitable, that more people will be watching video games than playing them! This is increasingly evident with esports as well, since major events are garnering incredible viewing numbers! After all, many major sports such as basketball or football have more people watching them than playing them, there is no reason why that can’t be the case in the future of video games!No matter how awesome it would be to have a magical ball that would show the future, such a thing does not exist, at least not yet. Therefore, this look into what the future might hold for the world of gaming is purely speculative and some of the things mentioned above may not necessarily come to fruition. However, all the signs are there for such things as VR, clouds and improving graphics to be the future of video games and if that is indeed the case, there is plenty to look forward to!",0 followers,Nor Reza,6K,8.6K,50.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-video-gaming

Evolution actually occurs when a random mutation is able to increase the reproductive success of an organism. This is what “fitness” means in the term “survival of the fittest"". The ability to successfully reproduce and have offspring that reproduce successfully.Evolution is not directed. There is no “goal"" besides reproduction, and there is no such thing as more or less evolved, only how well or poorly an organism is adapted for it's environment. African hunting dogs are highly adapted to their savannah environment, and glass shrimp are highly adapted to deep sea volcanic vents. Neither could survive in the other’s environment, and neither is “more"" evolved than the other.The only sense in which an organism could be said to be at the “zenith” of it's evolution would be if it is about to become extinct. Again I must stress, human beings are not more evolved than any other animal. We tend to think we are because we are biased toward the adaptations that are particular to our species, such as intelligence. One of our close relatives, the orangutan, is also highly intelligent, though probably less so than us. If an Orangutan were to consider the relative evolutionary ranks of Humans and Orangutans with a similar bias, they would likely conclude that we are an impressive species, highly intelligent, possibly even moreso than Orangutans, but so inferior when it comes to climbing trees and cracking coconuts that we must be regarded as occupying a lower evolutionary tier.Human beings are certainly still evolving, and in fact some of our evolution is being driven by technology, rather than halted. For instance, mastery of fire and agriculture has caused our jaws to shrink. Domestication of certain ungulates has led to some human populations developing lactase persistence.Technology cannot nullify the “need"" for evolution, because evolution is not based on need. Giraffes didn't get long necks by stretching for leaves. Once upon a time, there was an animal that was ancestral to giraffes. Some of them were born with slightly longer necks, and could reach leaves that others couldn't. At first they were only a little longer, and they just got a few more leaves than their short necked cousins, but this still allowed the longer necks to have better nutrition, and thus more offspring. Over thousands of generations, this trait was magnified, until there was a population with extremely long necks, which gave them acess to food that other browsers couldn't reach at all. Selection pressure lengthened their necks, thus opening the niche of treetop browser to the species.But that doesn't make the giraffe the pinnacle of evolution. Some of the short necks might have been born smaller and faster. They couldnt reach the high leaves, but they needed less food, and could go from tree to tree more quickly. Some might have switched to eating grass, or found a plant that was too tough, thorny, or toxic for other herbivores to eat, and adapted to eat that. This isn't supposed to be a detailed picture of the specifics of the evolution of giraffes and antelopes, but an illustration of how the general principle works.",366 followers,Brett Alder,1.1K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-video-gaming

In other words,Q:You misunderstand the meaning of natural selection. It doesn’t imply killing some and letting others live. Natural selection means differential reproduction success.Do some of your neighbours have one child while others have six? This is natural selection in action: they will pass their genes to next generation with differential success.Whether you see a specific trait that determines it or not is irrelevant: evolution often deals in minute variations, and the outcome isn’t clear until dozens of generations have changed over.Furthermore, natural selection is not a prerequisite for evolution. There’s alsoQ:I don’t know what that means, but I like how you judge it by (alleged) absence of selective pressures.

I mean, last week they weren’t the zenith, and now they are — theQ:If you read all the genomes of every human being currently alive, repeat the same procedure in 100 years, and then compare two results — then I assure you, the gene pools will be different: some genes will change their frequencies, some disappear altogether. Which means evolution, by definition.If you’re looking for an evolutionary advancement to cancel evolution, you could invent a genesis chamber (after Kryptonians).Then, instead of reproducing in the old-fashioned way, humans would be created from a “single source of truth”, and there would be no sequential passing of genetic information AKA heredity.",3 followers,Samuel Bateman,1.1K,102,56.4K,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-video-gaming

10,"While technological advances have reduced selection pressure from conditions such as infectious disease and famine, they’ve hardly eliminated all selection pressure.For example, some people are known to be resistant to the HIV virus because of a mutation in the gene that encodes CCR5, a receptor for HIV; it’s thought that this mutation may have occurred as a consequence of a prior encounter between humans and a retrovirus.Anti-retroviral medications, condom use, circumcision, and behavioral changes all reduce the spread and lethality of HIV, and so it stands to reason that the percentage of thWhile technological advances have reduced selection pressure from conditions such as infectious disease and famine, they’ve hardly eliminated all selection pressure.For example, some people are known to be resistant to the HIV virus because of a mutation in the gene that encodes CCR5, a receptor for HIV; it’s thought that this mutation may have occurred as a consequence of a prior encounter between humans and a retrovirus.Anti-retroviral medications, condom use, circumcision, and behavioral changes all reduce the spread and lethality of HIV, and so it stands to reason that the percentage of the population that have the mutated CCR5 receptor will increase with time.But it doesn’t stop there. Consider that behavior can affect the risk of HIV. Those who are more careful in their choice of sexual partners, e.g., more likely to remain monogamous, or who are more likely to use condoms when having risky sex, will live longer and this will tend as well to shift the balance towards genes that favor judicious behavior.Then too, those who are able to afford anti-retroviral medication will be more likely to survive. And this too could favor certain traits, e.g., traits that lead to economic prosperity.There are numerous examples like this, many unknown. We are in a constant tug-of-war with bacteria and viruses, and we run other risks as well, such as death from accident, occupation, drugs, street violence, and war. All of these shape the human genome over time.So, of course, does another characteristic — the number of children we have. We tend to think of evolution as leading towards qualities we consider desirable, such as higher intelligence. But consider that the most educated people — who in advanced countries tend to be the most intelligent — are no longer reproducing even at replacement rate. This suggests that there is currently downward pressure on human intelligence and on other genes that predict performance in school (many of these genes have recently been discovered, and only about 40% of them affect intelligence — it seems that behavioral genes are just as important).Ultimately, the future belongs to those who have many successful offspring. In the days before birth control, birth rates were pretty much constant within a population, but today a poor, uneducated Catholic who doesn’t use birth control and has a large family is likely to out-produce an educated woman who delays marriage to advance her career. The difference here is of course not entirely genetic, but to the extent that it is, the genes that facilitate fecundity will be favored.Darwin always wins in the end!","220,628 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.9K,47.3K,783M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Evolution-happens-when-a-new-trait-is-required-by-a-species-to-cope-with-its-surroundings-I-believe-technological-advancements-have-nullified-such-a-need-Are-we-the-zenith-of-our-species-Are-human-beings-still-evolving

These “symptoms” seem ideally suited to circumstances where the environment is harsh and famine is a common issue. If women are tougher, don’t have as many babies to feed, are more protective of their children and resources, and their bodies learn to operate on very few calories, storing the rest to use later as needed, wouldn’t that make the people better able to make it through rough living conditions and starvation? I've also noticed that the majority of women with PCOS are bisexual. If men, with faster metabolisms, die of starvation, a woman's children would have a better chance at survival if she was willing to take a partner of either sex. Between 5% and 10% of women have this “disorder” and I can’t help wondering if it’s nature and we’re fighting it because it doesn’t fit well with our current living situation.

Genghis Kahn himself fathered many thousands of children through the rape of captured women.  A huge part of the world's population today can trace their ancestry back to him.The only real mechanism of natural selection any more are really nasty diseases, the kind that can cause massive die offs, plagues, like the black plague of the Middle Ages, or the more recent Spanish Flu.  These work too quickly and in a large scale for us to come up with a cure in time.  So a large percentage of people lacking adequate immunity are killed off, leaving a higher percentage of people with natural immunity, or greater ability to survive.  The human gene pool is thus permanently changed.In the future, our ability to directly modify our genes will change evolution completely.

Life adapts constantly and those species that adapt best to the environment survive the best.There is no “end goal” to evolution, it’s just the process by which life continues on the planet.",282 followers,Michael Anderson,1.8K,4.8K,5.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-video-gaming

We now report a novel PRNP variant--G127V--that was found exclusively in people who lived in the region in which kuru was prevalent and that was present in half of the otherwise susceptible women from the region of highest exposure who were homozygous for methionine at PRNP codon 129. Although this allele is common in the area with the highest incidence of kuru, it is not found in patients with kuru and in unexposed population groups worldwide. Genealogic analysis reveals a significantly lower incidence of kuru in pedigrees that harbor the protective allele than in geographically matched control families.The 127V polymorphism is an acquired prion disease resistance factor selected during the kuru epidemic, rather than a pathogenic mutation that could have triggered the kuru epidemic. Variants at codons 127 and 129 of PRNP demonstrate the population genetic response to an epidemic of prion disease and represent a powerful episode of recent selection in humans.""Full publication is open-access at",99 followers,David Johnson,1.4K,25.8K,15.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-transportation-on-earth
18,"No, it just means we can’t see the future. We can’t tell what humans will evolve into because we don’t know how the climate will change (giving selection pressure a direction), what mutations will occur in the human population (giving natural selection fresh material to work on) and what technology we may develop which will decrease or increase selection pressure.",0 followers,Claire Jordan,1K,45.6K,295.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Evolution-happens-when-a-new-trait-is-required-by-a-species-to-cope-with-its-surroundings-I-believe-technological-advancements-have-nullified-such-a-need-Are-we-the-zenith-of-our-species-Are-human-beings-still-evolving
