You don’t need NAT to route to machines on a network, as they can all have iIPv6 addresses.More and more web sites, email servers have SSL, so don’t need VPN connections.",36 followers,Adam Ambrozy,579,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-future-technology-could-make-VPNs-redundant-or-replace-them
1,"No technology can replace “a concept”Vpn can be implemented in many different technologies. One is more suited than an other, varying from case to case.","36,308 followers",Stan Hanks,1.1K,7.7K,65.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-future-technology-could-make-VPNs-redundant-or-replace-them
2,"Replaces us how? If it means taking over meaningless drudgery, that seems like a good thing overall. If it means taking over analysis of data and situations, that could be an improvement, if we could trust the judgement of the machines (for example self-driving cars). If it’s replacing artists and creative people, it’s just about creating a distinction between the human-made (and therefore sometimes quirky and imperfect) version and the inhumanly perfect and rapid machine made version.

Hand-made crafts are already being presented today as a special valued category. All of these changes could end up teaching us trust and humility, if we could accept them. In the near future, the machines will become better than us at performing more and more tasks. But what we will always have as our advantage, in contrast to the machines, is our capacity for randomness because of our unconscious urges, and the resulting unpredictability which can lead to something unexpected.","2,052 followers",Aaron Jantzen,1.7K,3.4K,13.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-future-technology-could-make-VPNs-redundant-or-replace-them

I’d love to see that day and time come.Unfortunately, I’m too well acquainted with technology to be optimistic about it.

Let us say, your smart home cameras are connected through the router to your smartphone. This helps you keep an eye on the happenings inside your home. A cybercriminal may hack and take similar information about your home. Security experts use big data, machine learning and behaviour analysis to develop better threat detection methods.The Far FutureFast and actionable data will be in great demand. The other things that will see a huge presence are computing, automation and robotics. Evidently, the next-level technology to come to the forefront after this would be Artificial intelligence. This technology may be fraught with risks. The fear of artificial superintelligence taking over all the industries is in our minds.Machines with technological singularity are likely to come in. They will have self-learning, self-improvement cycles which is going to take away much of the human work.

10,"The same way jobs have been replaced since technology began replacing jobs centuries ago: by creating more jobs.Technology replaced the jobs of manually spinning wool into yarn and manually weaving cloth. Those jobs almost entirely disappeared.
