I believe this will be the case for two reasons.If that will be the case, then we can say that in the future, it will be harder to achieve such deep audience targeting (not just based on interest, but also on behavior, demographics, devices…) as it is now, because fewer data will be collected plus users will own their data and choose which one they will allow or publish.Moreover, I believe that ads will be much more engaging in the future, possibly with the higher development of VR devices, so you will be able to feel the experiences more, rather than just taking the effect from the image, video or even a collection of ads. This, of course, applies to the scenario where VRs are integrated with social media.I also believe that more of the marketing process will be automatized, gradually with the development of AI, however, a big part of it will still need to be operated by humans because it will involve much decision-making processes, and AI at that moment will not (yet) be sufficiently developed to deal with that.*Keep in mind that we are talking about predictions in future, which should not be taken for granted. A lot of things can and will change and much of it will depend on the large social media giants and their decisions to allow certain trends.",34 followers,Rahul Chauhan,7.4K,2.5K,101.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-will-social-media-marketing-change-as-new-technologies-emerge

2,The cool thing about social media is that this question potentially could be answered differently a mere two weeks from now. Social is changing rapidly and the developments are CONSTANT. The biggest change I have my eye on right now is the incorporation of VR into strategy.,478 followers,Tabi Vicuna,1K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-will-social-media-marketing-change-as-new-technologies-emerge
3,"Social Media Marketing is on the boom. Long gone are the days when only we used see advertisements only on TVs, newspapers and billboards. With the rise of social media platforms the marketing trend on these are also on the rise.First of all social media marketing is cheaper than traditional ways. Its up to you how much you can spend on your ads, but the less you spend the less people will get them. Traditional ways are above the line marketing methods, and are shown to all the world.Social media marketing is also called target marketing, where you can target a set of people who are related toSocial Media Marketing is on the boom.

If you have a gardening related product and you use this platform to market it, then you can target only the people interested in gardening or the people who works as a gardener. Your ads will be worth to them. Traditional ways can go to waste. For example I’m not interested in this niche but I still see your ad on a TV channel, so I’ll ignore it and switch over.Social Media is everywhere now a days. It is accessible to all the people and they travel with it inside their bags or pockets. That is why social media marketing is growing fast.",0 followers,Alice Garcia,2.1K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-will-social-media-marketing-change-as-new-technologies-emerge
4,"The worst oil spill (2010) was from BP known as Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. About 2,100 km of the U.S. Gulf Coast from Texas to Florida were coated with oil. In the lawsuits that followed, the oil company BP paid $65 billion in compensation to people who relied on the gulf for their livelihoods. Alarmed by these developments, the U.S. made the double hulk compulsory if a ship entered U.S. water plus some nautical miles. Soon developed economies followed the double hulk provision. Many ships flying the flag of friendly countries flout the rules. A recent example is of a Sri Lankan ship which sThe worst oil spill (2010) was from BP known as Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill.

Blockchain or crypto has made a huge impact in today’s society and I’m more fascinated to learn how it will evolve and co-exist with our existing processes and technology.As we all know, cryptocurrencies are getting a lot attention right now since it already surpassed their current status last year more and more people believed that this can be accepted in our current society. More people aren’t scared to explore new currencies and payment methods removing them from the stigma of these big corporations that just simply monopolizes and just limiting our options.One project which I think have made an impact as I was checking for alternatives when it comes to payment was NavCoin. I’m amazed how independent this platform imagine an open-source, blockchain based Proof of Stake cryptocurrency. Its design is public, nobody owns or controls it, and everyone can take part. The platform run by its users, for users like us - with an incentivised network of nodes verifying payments all around the world.Just a quickie history about it NavCoin, it is a community-run network that was started in 2014. It initially used Proof of Work, but quickly made the shift to Proof of Stake. With no ICO or premine, NavCoin has always been self-funded to ensure a fair distribution and that everyone has a chance to get involved.In short this platform are just one of the platforms that clearly provides solutions that many of us have been trying to resolved. We want cheap, fast and performance-driven tools and not just because we don’t have any other options.Imagine if there are more blockchain platforms that resolves such issues, I doubt people will forget it. Clearly blockchain will not be a trend but it will definitely be passed down as a marvelous discovery in today’s technology.","31,157 followers",Phillip Remaker,1.7K,11K,78.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-will-social-media-marketing-change-as-new-technologies-emerge

Bob would nowIf you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.I would try to explain Blockchain in the most simple way I can.Let us assume that there are two people Alice and Bob. Alice borrows some money from Bob and Bob writes it on a piece of paper signed by Alice. After some days Alice denies the existence of such document and claims that Bob has forged that piece of paper. Bob would now find it difficult to prove that Alice actually owes him Money.In this example Alice and Bob are two nodes.Now assume the same scenario, but among a society. So there are ’k’ pair of people transacting with each other. And the only proof that each pair has, is that piece of paper. Looking at this scenario, one person, Kate comes up with a solution. She suggests maintaining a common notebook of transaction for entire society. She designates town hall to be the place where every exchange takes place. In the common notebook, every pair writes the transaction and then the notebook is kept safely. People rejoice and accept Kate as their leader.That notebook can be called a database.But one day, somebody spills wine on the notebook. This makes the notebook illegible. Taking the advantage of this situation, Alice again denies taking money from Bob.This is the problem databases face - single point of failure.Irritated by this problem, Kate comes up with another solution. She suggests maintaining multiple notebooks. She chooses some trustworthy people from the society and gives them a notebook each. Now every time a transaction or exchange takes place between two people, Kate instructs some of those trustworthy people to mention the transaction in their notebooks. So the data is repeated in the notebooks. Now, even if one notebook is destroyed, chances are that all the data regarding transactions are still present in the combination of other notebooks.This is a distributed database and multiple notebooks are the multiple nodes.But next day, another problem arises. Kate has a friend named Bert who owes a lot of money to some people in the society. He asks Kate for help and she agrees to help him. She instructs all the people with the notebooks to remove the entries where Bert received money. Now Bert doesn’t owe any money based on the notebooks.This is the problem with distributed databases - they are centralized. That means one single entity owns all the nodes/resources and can make changes as they deem fit.When the people from the society come to know of it, they remove Kate from the leadership.* They decide to keep a notebook each. Every time a transaction is made between any two people , all the people from the town come together and mention it in their respective notebooks. So if there are n people in the society, then there are n notebooks and no one person controls the overall representation of the transactions. This is decentralization.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-will-social-media-marketing-change-as-new-technologies-emerge

Some of them you just want to grasp by the neck and throttle them, preferably before they’ve had a chance to breed.“I bought this because I thought” is a phrase that strikes dread in to me, because either it’s going to be that they’ve bought the cheapest thing they could find and now isn’t up to the job and they’re not getting their money back unless we can conclusively and without doubt prove that it’s been mis-sold (which in 99.9% of cases it won’t have been as either the customer has not stated their needs clearly or ignored advice they were given at the time and gone the cheapo way) or it does do what they want and they just don’t know how to make it do it. Then of course it’s my fault.Then there’s the thickies. Honestly. Computers today are not what they were back in 1980. They are so simple now that a hamster can use them.Nevertheless.I got somebody on the phone saying her computer was broken a few weeks ago. That’s no good to me, so I asked what it was doing.“E-mails”.?????“Are you not getting e-mails?”“No.”“Right then. I’m going to remote in to your computer and find out what the problem is. I’d like you to go to the remote connection, please.” That’s ten minutes directing her.“What’s it saying?”“No internet connection.”“That’s going to be why you aren’t getting any e-mails, then. How do you normally connect?”“I click the envelope”.“I mean, to what do you normally connect your computer, and how? Do you use a cable or is it wireless?”“It’s my router.”Sigh.“Ok, connect to your router like you’d normally do.”“I don’t normally connect.”“Alright, have you got a clock on the bottom right of the screen?”“No.”“What can you see?”“A speech bubble thing.”“And to the left of that?”“The time.”By this time I’m pulling my hair out. Suffice it to say it took another fifteen minutes to find out she wasn’t at home, she’d moved in with her sister for lockdown, and get her on her sister’s network.“Alright, so now you definitely have internet connection, do you? Good. I’m going to test it. Go on Google, please.”“How?”Sigh. In the end I made sure she was connected, and then told her to “click on the envelope”. Five seconds later she’s moaning nothing’s happening…….fifteen seconds later “oh, I’m getting e-mails. I can do my coursework now! So what caused that then?”I didn’t dare ask what she was studying. I think we can rule out any kind of computer sciences or IT, though.Sigh. I used to work on cutting edge comms and automation systems. I used to work with explosive stuff. And gas containment and detection systems for stuff that wouldn’t have been out of place at the Somme. None of it was as stressful as consumer/business electronics is, though. Still, it keeps me off the streets and out of trouble.:P",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-will-social-media-marketing-change-as-new-technologies-emerge
