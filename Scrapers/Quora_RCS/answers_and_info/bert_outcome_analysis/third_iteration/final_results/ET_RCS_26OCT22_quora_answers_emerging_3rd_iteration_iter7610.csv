You may remember how everybody was buying Netscape, Webvan, Pets.com, etc. I remember one piece of advice which was: “When everybody, including the shoeshine boy, has stock advice, it’s time to get out of the market.” That’s what’s going on with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. People don’t understand the fundamentals and they’re buying without knowing what actually makes the price go up or down.Have you ever watched David Letterman interview a star he’s never hearYes.

It’s like that. You can fake your way through it, but it can go completely wrong. So when it comes to these kinds of investments, do it like you do spare change. Do piggy bank money.

2,"It’s not always about utility, in fact one could say that the ethereum platform has more utility than bitcoin, cause ethereum platform can be used for executable codes for websites, games etc. It’s no dispute that Ether and bitcoin are like the coke and Pepsi of the crypto world, but a close look at them and you’ll see they are almost nothing alike.

First the price of a coin has to do with mostly 2 factorsEdit:Total available bitcoin 21 MillionTotal available ether 100 Million and there is no upper limit on the coin supply for ether. Since ether almost has no max available quantity bitcoin will most always have a better price except another factor comes in place.This is were a lot of people get confused calling ether ethereum is like calling Bitcoin blockchain. Ethereum isn’t a cryptocurrency at all but the platform in which ether the cryptocurrency is based on.If you want to know the future of everything from finance to the judiciary to construction, Bitcoin and Ethereum will likely be a big part of it.It is essential to understand that Bitcoin and Ethereum are fundamentally different ideas. Bitcoin is a store of value. Ethereum is a decentralized platform to program other decentralized ideas. Ether is the currency that runs Ethereum. All of these ideas are important. The blockchain that makes Bitcoin and Ethereum possible is the most important idea to understand. No longer do we have to rely on giving others our precious data to make transactions — blockchain gives us the power to create a trustless, immutable way to do business.There may be little to really compare between Bitcoin and Ethereum, but there will be huge comparisons to life before and after their mainstream acceptance.","99,918 followers",Alcatraz Dey,9K,1.4K,68.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-will-PlexCoin-hold-up-against-cryptocurrencies-like-Bitcoin-and-Ethereum
3,"You get rich by selling during the delusional phase, selling Bitcoin near an all time high to those who think it will continue to rise.If you were wise, you sold your BTC for $19,000. There were many who were happy to buy the coin off you. Now they're stuck waiting for when BTC returns to this ATH (if at all).Over the next ten years, the consensus is that BTC's price curve will flatten out and resemble stock markets, showing smaller bull/bear bubbles. But until then, many will get rich at the expense of the inexperienced or impatient.You get rich by selling during the delusional phase, selling Bitcoin near an all time high to those who think it will continue to rise.If you were wise, you sold your BTC for $19,000.

5,"Investing in cryptocurrencies is almost the same as investing in stocks. However, when you buy company shares, you buy and own a piece of the business, whereas when you buy a cryptocurrency like bitcoin, you own the bitcoin that you have bought, but you don’t own a share or piece of the business. You speculate that the price of the coin will go up and you will make a profit. Nowadays, there are some altcoins that pay you just for holding them in your wallet.Investing in cryptocurrencies is almost the same as investing in stocks.

You speculate that the price of the coin will go up and you will make a profit. Nowadays, there are some altcoins that pay you just for holding them in your wallet.On the 5th of May 2013, a friend of mine, Graciano, invested his $5,000 on bitcoin. He bought 44.06839415 bitcoins for $113.46 each.Today on the 24th of September 2018, each bitcoin costs $6653.83 and his 44.06839415 bitcoins are now worth $293,223.60. Thus, his $5,000 investment has multiplied to become almost $300,000 within 5 years.I know of many other people who became millionaires by buying cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Ripple, Waves, Stratis and Neo at their lowest prices when the projects were just starting and held on to their coins only to sell them when the prices had multiplied a hundred or even a thousand times.Another friend of mine, George, invested his $10,000 in NEO on the 9th of September 2016. He bought 55,555 NEO coins for $0.18 each. NEO pays you a coin called GAS just for holding your NEO coins in your wallet. George is still holding on to his coins and today with the price of each NEO at $19.01, his coins alone without calculating the GAS he has been earning over the years are now worth $1,056,111.George’s 55,555 NEO coins earn 14.6 GAS coins per day and with GAS at the price of $5.30 each, he earns $77.40 everyday.These are just a very small number of examples of how people become wealthy through investing in cryptocurrencies. There are some who became millionaires within a period of less than two years just by investing about $5,000.However, whenever and wherever some clever people make money, there is always people who lose it. So many people just jump into investing in stocks and cryptocurrencies just because they heard about or saw George and Graciano becoming millionaires within 5 years of holding on to their $10,000 investments. After just jumping in without doing their own thorough research first, those people lose money.Investment in anything is very risky and you might lose a large part or even all of your investment over a very short period of time. That’s why they say:These people did the opposite of what every experienced investor says:The cryptocurrency market is very volatile, risky and young. The price of bitcoin can change by $1,000 within one day or within just a few hours. Because cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are very young, their are loads of scams in that market. Some coins that were there in 2013 no longer exist. That means people who invested in them and those still holding on to the coins this day, lost their money.Thus, before you invest, do your thorough research about the project and the people behind it.

Are you aware the cryptocurrency founded 10 years ago is what is been used for buying goods and services as well as for borderless payments?Are you aware people trade the dollar with other currencies (forex) just as btc is traded with multiple other currencies? Same way Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies were invented for people to carry out transactions and be their own bank with state of the art security called the blockchain and decentralization (immutable public distributed ledger) for their funds. Patience and dedication is required to move into the crypto world as one would need.Let’s be honest. Many people in this space aren’t here for the tech but for the opportunity to get rich instantly; and this is not supposed to be so. Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies has made a lot of people a lot of money (and others, well, there are winners and losers in this game because most of them do not fully understand the basics of how it all works).But while many no-coiners and even some Bitcoiners believe it’s all about the price, they’re missing the wider point. Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies are not get-rich-quick scheme, it’s a get-free-quick scheme in plain terms, “financial freedom and stability”.Nevertheless I’ll be urging potential bitcoin and other crypto investors to ensure they “know exactly what they’re buying, why they are buying and that they’re not just relying on hype and excitement from friends or social media”.So I must say ‘Investing in Cryptocurrencies is not a get rich quick scheme, it’s a way to build wealth slowly and attain financial freedom and that goes with patience’ .The key attraction, therefore, is the substantial price appreciation that we’ve seen over the past few years. Additionally, it’s a story many of us have been glued to.CONCLUSION: I hope this article is able to explain how investing in Cryptocurrency is different from get rich quick scheme. The fact states that “Cryptocurrency” is not a get rich scheme as many do believe but a way to attain financial freedom.For further information on crypto related issues and financial consultancy, you can follow my profile and turn in post notification, you can as well reach me through my inbox or the links provided on my profile.
