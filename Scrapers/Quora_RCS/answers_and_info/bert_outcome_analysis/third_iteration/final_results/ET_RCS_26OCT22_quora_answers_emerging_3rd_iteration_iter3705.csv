2,"Great question.First some pesky fizzix, so we know what we're up against.The residents of our Dyson sphere are, quite reasonably, going to want to stick to the floor like wot they evolved to do. Currently, the only way to achieve this artificially is by using centrifugal force by spinning the “habitat”.How much spin? Well, the larger the radius, the slower the angular velocity, but don't let the numbers fool you.

3,"We couldn’t do it.The problem is that to make a Dyson sphere would require more or less all of the mass of all of the planets in the solar system to be put into the sphere.But most of the mass we have is in Jupiter and Saturn - and those are both gas giants. So we’d have to be able to convert the gasses in their atmospheres into materials like steel and aluminium.That requires some insane “fusion reactor” technology…far *FAR* beyond what we know how to do.Plus dismantling an entire planet…that’s some major engineering! But doing all of this while still living on Earth as we do it…that would beWe couldn’t do it.The problem is that to make a Dyson sphere would require more or less all of the mass of all of the planets in the solar system to be put into the sphere.But most of the mass we have is in Jupiter and Saturn - and those are both gas giants.

But doing all of this while still living on Earth as we do it…that would be crazy!Also, it’s really not possible to build a Dyson sphere at all because the thing couldn’t be structurally strong enough to withstand the sun’s crazy gravity without spinning it - but that only provides a means to hold up the “equator” of the sphere. At the poles, it would still be required to support its own enormous weight against the sun’s gravity…and there is no known material (and probably no POSSIBLE material) that has that amount of strength.So - no Dyson sphere. Not happening.What’s more possible is Larry Niven’s “RingWorld” - a narrow ribbon of habitable land in a ring around the Sun. This is a MUCH less ambitious project - but at least it solves the “collapsing poles” problem by not having any poles.Unfortunately (as Larry Niven discovered AFTER publishing the first book in the series) - his fictional world is unstable.If the ring were ever to shift even slightly away from having the sun perfectly centered in the middle of the ring - then the sun’s gravity would pull very slightly more strongly on the side of the ring nearest to the sun - and very slightly less strongly on the opposite side. This would result in the ring moving even further away from the sun being at the center - which would result in even more pull on the nearest side - which means even faster motion. So within not much time, the entire ring would crash into the sun.In the later books, he reveals some seriously big-assed rockets that the builders mounted onto the ring to fix this problem…but that’s an awfully big problem in reality.Same deal with a Dyson sphere by the way.The MOST probable structure is called a “Dyson Swarm” - which is very do-able. The idea is to build satellites to orbit the sun…lots of them - each one following its own path around the sun - then gradually adding more and more satellites (as needed) to gradually fill in the entire sphere around the sun. Imagine them in polar orbits - all at slightly different orientations and slightly different radii (so they don’t collide).Probably, each one would be an O’Neill cylinder.So these disconnected satellites would solve the stability problem - and because each one could be orbiting normally - you’d have none of the “polar collapse” issues. Also, you could build them incrementally rather than having to solve the problem of keeping a half-built mega-structure from collapsing before you finish building it.You could start off by dismantling the easier planets (Mars, Venus, Mercury) which are made of the right kinds of materials to build gigantic fleets of satellites from…and after dismantling even one planet - there would be enough material to re-house all of humanity into them - so we could go ahead and dismantle the Earth too.An unimaginably large amount of time after that - maybe we have the engineering skills to transmute the gasses from Jupiter into the right kinds of metals/plastics/ceramics to make O’Neill cylinders from.But building a big hollow sphere around the sun - doesn’t seem at all plausible.","105,664 followers",Dave Consiglio,1K,6.8K,91.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-generation-like-before-advanced-technology-Were-the-diseases-crimes-etc-lower-or-higher
4,"No. But a Dyson Swarm seems entirely feasible, if difficult.The Dyson Sphere requires a rigid material stronger than anything we’ve ever seen. Is it possible? Sure, I suppose. But it most likely isn’t.A swarm, on the other hand, should be relatively easy to achieve. We already have tons of satellites orbiting the sun...","29,923 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,3.3K,7.7K,249.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-a-Dysons-Sphere-a-feasible-engineering-feat-and-if-so-how-far-would-humanity-have-to-advance-technologically-in-order-to-build-one

Per second of course. Which is on a order of a trillion times more energy, than our current global consumption.But according to Stuart Armstrong of Oxford University, building a Dyson Sphere completely enclosing a star is not feasible. Because the tensile strength, needed to prevent the sphere from tearing itself apart, completely surpasses that of any known material.Estimates for a Dyson Sphere like the one I showed you in the image, put the resource materials needed somewhere around 1.82E+26 Kg. That's 182 septillion tons of materials. The number can fluctuate of course, depending on the density of the materials used.Some have even asked here on Quora, if we could currently build one. And the answer is of course no. We possess neither the right propulsion technology, resource gathering technology, and space survival technology, necessary for such an undertaking.With current technology, it would take us something like 120 trillion years to build a Dyson Sphere around our star.","220,554 followers",Franklin Veaux,630,47.3K,782.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-a-Dysons-Sphere-a-feasible-engineering-feat-and-if-so-how-far-would-humanity-have-to-advance-technologically-in-order-to-build-one

7,No. Yes.The problem with the first question is that we have enough of the fossil record to know that tool-using intelligence did not exist before humans.History depends on finding artifacts.

9,"Yes, I would say all the findings where Archeologists find city structures that have been literally buried under tons of mud, sand, boulders, etc and are still intact and survived whatever cataclysm destroyed the civilization.. The greater majority of today's buildings wouldn't stand a chance with a cataclysmic event that buried these cities.

When our era runs out, and all the little gadgets we have like cellphones, computers, cars, etc. Do you really think the next age is going to find much if anything of our time. Things simply disappear.. Washed away for the next civilization to start over.. I would have to speculate almost all of the technology earlier civilizations, either in our time, or before the last destruction of our planet is lying in the bottom of the oceans. Only 6% of the ocean has been explored under 10,000 feet and 10-12% of the ocean has been explored above 9,000 feet. In retrospect to really answer your question, Archeologists and even common citizens have found man made objects that they can't even begin to figure out what they are.. Most if not all of these findings are completely mysterious to us, as if they found some of our technology would probably be to them.
