My conclusion:NOTHING.At least in-universe.A “very special hologram,” Vic Fontaine (left) joined DS9 late in the series, entertaining and giving sage romantic advice as needed. Perhaps Vic’s finest moments came in the episode “It’s Only A Paper Moon,” when Vic helped a despondent Nog (right) come to terms with losing a leg in battle, an episode ranked as one of DS9’s best.It can’t be a question of memory space or computing power, after all, we once saw an entire ship of holograms (“Flesh and Blood,” Parts I and II) and they were doing just fine.The Voyager Doctor created a wife and family for himself, and it seems likely his three other family members shared a lot of the sophistication of his own program because, you know, the Doc wouldn’t have settled for anything less. Zero impact on the ship’s memory.And all this, years after the TNG episode “Elementary, Dear Data,” in which computer of the Enterprise-D created the sentient hologram Moriarty (Daniel Davis), Sherlock Holmes’ arch-enemy, after Geordie had instructed it to create an adversary that could “defeat Data” (not “defeat Sherlock Holmes”, the character whom Data was playing in the program.)In a follow-on episode, “Ship In A Bottle,” Moriarty later introduced a second hologram, his equally complex lady friend, the delightful Countess Regina Batholomew (Stephanie Beacham), and there was, again, no mention of any impacts on the ship’s computing capacity or memory space. Moriarty exercised a dangerous level of control over the Enterprise, but despite originally being programmed as a criminal, proved to have grown beyond his programming; he was quite reasonable, although determined to secure a life outside of the holodeck for himself and the Countess.Because this was impossible at the time, both holograms had to be tricked by nested holoprograms - false worlds-within-worlds - into believing that they had been given permanent solidity with no need for holoemitters; they were given leave, so they thought, to take an Enterprise shuttlecraft and depart the ship to explore the galaxy with the blessings of the crew.The reality was that their programs had been transferred seamlessly into a holo-environment tailored to their needs, and running inside a futuristic device the size of a shoebox, capable of essentially doing whatever the ship’s holodeck could do. Picard had his team fill the holo-shoebox with enough complexity to allow them to realise their impossible dreams - something that not even Andy Williams ever got to do.The hologram James Moriarty (Daniel Davis), from TNG, was, with apologies to a lady named Minuet, the most sophisticated hologram to have been created in a Starfleet holodeck prior to Voyager’s caustic EMH, the Doctor or “Doc”.Clearly, in-universe technology should offer no impediment to implementing multiple holographic personnel to serve aboard Starfleet vessels equipped with suitable holo-emitters.However, there are out-of-universe reasons why the writers have not rushed to create a lot of holographic persons.I don’t necessarily agree, and synthetic personalities have been used successfully throughout science fiction, whetherWilliam (Samuel Anderson, left), a hologram in the Netflix series “Another Life,” was designed to assist the captain and crew of an Earth spaceship. William becomes an integral part of the story, thanks in part to his emotional interactions with his flesh-and-blood companions, including Captain Nico Breckinridge (Katee Sackhoff, right), with whom he falls in love.As Voyager’s Doctor has shown us, virtually any danger that can threaten humans can also be made to threaten holograms. They have capabilities, but also limitations.Doc’s program could be altered, resulting in catastrophic behavioural changes (like mutilating the odd ex-Borg drone while singing “O My Darling Clementine” in the two-part episode “Equinox”);Anything that threatens Voyager’s computer also threatens Doc with destruction, particularly the dreaded “de-compiling”;The required holo-emitters could be destroyed or taken off line;A plot device to give the hologram more mobility (eg., the portable emitter device) can be stolen or - well, let’s go with stolen, I can’t bear to contemplate worse things happening to it;The hologram can be programmed to experience pain, the symptoms of illness, etc., whether for good reasons (eg., improve bedside manner through developing empathy) or nefarious ones (eg., torture.)And something that the SF series Red Dwarf explored that Star Trek has not is the difference between “soft light” and “hard light” holograms.Arnold Rimmer of Red Dwarf was a holographic version of a not-terribly-popular, human crew member, now a not-terribly-missed deceased crew member; the holographic version of Rimmer had an H on his forehead to stand for hologram, although I don’t know why that was actually necessary. Initially a soft-light hologram, his role expanded when a technical breakthrough allowed him to become a hard-light hologram.A “soft light” hologram is the kind we have today, made entirely of projected light and unable to interact with the real-world physical environment.A “hard light” hologram is the kind who can interact with the physical world, for example picking up medical tricorders, scrubbing deuterium tanks, slapping people on the face with large fish, having sex, etc.Could Star Trek make use of this distinction? Of course, or the writers aren’t earning their pay. Voyager’s Doctor was originally restricted to Sick Bay and the holodeck until the writers gave him his mobile emitter; but they could have granted him at least soft-light access to most of the ship at once with simple modifications to existing lighting systems (vs. installing the far more complex and energy-intensive full holo-emitters). At least he could diagnose and instruct; but at times, whatever he was carrying would fall to the deck because he had just walked into an area on which the holo-emitters were malfunctioning, reducing him to the impotence of a soft-light image.There could be a component to the holo-emitter that provides the image with the hard-light capability, a kind of holo-force field generator. In a show heavy with holographic characters, the term would end up used so much that it would join the “Heisenberg compensator” and “inertial dampeners” as staples of Starfleet’s technical vocabulary.Whatever writers want to do, they can and will make it work. I do not believe there would be any plausible impediment to providing a lot more holographic persons to back up the human ones, particularly in emergency situations.And they don’t all have to be doctors. Some could be commando fighters, like the Military Assault Command Operations (MACO) troops who accompanied Enterprise NX-01 in The Xindi period. What would have happened to USS Prometheus of 60 MACOs had appeared suddenly on the ship just as 27 Romulans beamed aboard - would the entire human crew have been killed? I think not.Others could be ship’s counselors, like DS9’s entertainer-cum-life coach, singer Vic Fontaine. Vic was a timely addition to the DS9 community, running a mellow Las Vegas nightclub that served as a retreat to stressed-out personnel during the Dominion War. And yet despite being a hologram, he displayed the savvy and wisdom of a human. Remember him coaching Odo in the ways of winning the heart of Major Kira Nerys? And what I consider one of the best-ever DS9 episodes, “It’s Only a Paper Moon,” when Vic’s compassion rehabilitated Ensign Nog who had sunk into deep despondency after losing a leg in the war?Some could even be CGI characters representing (or even created by) non-humanoid races. Their holographic nature could do away with the need for tedious housekeeping requirements for environment, atmosphere, food, etc. Perhaps the hologram(s) could be a test, or a practice, to allow a group of humans to come to know a very different race of aliens and determine whether humans could get along with them on extended missions (or at all.)The comedic possibilities are obvious, as is a more general observation: AI is looming in our near future, and Star Trek can and should be a vehicle for exploring the potential problems and solutions, in this case by exploring a bit of inner space - the hologram. That is the opportunity Star Trek has seized since the beginning: to make a difference. I believe there are more holographic characters on the way.",55 followers,John Young,511,3.6K,19.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/In-Star-Trek-Voyager-the-doctor-is-a-hologram-Why-is-it-only-the-doctor-Could-they-not-replace-more-crew-members-by-holograms

He remarked that the station had a very expensive microscope but that everyone was afraid to use it because it was fragile and worth more than most people's salaries. He wanted to create a microscope that anyone could afford and that would be versatile and sturdy enough to work in field conditions. He developed the first prototype in 2014. Following the first generation of simple Foldscopes, twelve medical diagnostic Foldscope variants are being developed, each designed to aid the identification of a particular disease-causing organism. Each unit costs less than one US dollar to build, with estimates varying from 50 cents to 97 cents.In October 2015, India's Department of Biotechnology announced a program to make Foldscopes available across India at 80 approved colleges and programs. It will be used as a teaching tool for students in biology, chemistry and physics. After the pilot program, the Department hopes to work with Prakash to develop more low-cost science tools. Foldscope sets will also be produced and tested in Kenya and Uganda.But Prakash is most excited about amateurs just using the Foldscope to look at the world around them. “The biggest thing we’re trying to do is to make people curious,” he says. “Our ambition is that every kid should be able to carry a microscope in their pocket.” To make that happen, Prakash is now courting larger organizations that can take over the manufacturing and distribution. And he is convinced that once the scopes get in the hands of users, the rest will be easy.His Prakash lab is focused on innovative and easy to access products for all.Here is a picture of he and his lab membersSource:Stanford scientist Manu Prakash makes water based computer - Times of IndiaManu Prakash: A 50-cent microscope that folds like origamiStanford scientist Manu Prakash makes water based computer - Times of IndiaStanford engineers build a water-droplet based computer that runs like clockwork",0 followers,Shivam Rastogi,523,0,0,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-greatest-discoveries-inventions-made-by-Indians-in-the-last-200-years

So, here is a list of few greatest discoveries by Indians:This is a device which is used to identify different wavelengths, frequencies and wave numbers of different radiations and without this device, most of the advancements in modern physics and optics couldn't have been accomplished.2. Chandrasekhar limit (discovery by Sir Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar)This is a theory based on astronomy and cosmology. It states that: “Any celestial body which has less mass than 1.5x of sun, it becomes a white dwarf and on the other hand, the one with more mass than 1.5x of sun converts into a Blackhole be falling into its own gravity.” This theory helps to decide whether a light emitting body converts into a blackole or a white dwarf and can predict solar system’s future.3. Zero, Advancements in polynomials and equations (Discovered by Aryabhatta):Zero was first discovered by Aryabhatta and the advancements in equations and polynomials after the discovery of polynomials by Greeks was done by Aryabhatta.4. Trigonometry and calculation of value of pi (discovered by Budhayana)Trigonometry which is considered to be the most important branch in mathematics was first developed by Budhayana and also the value of the pi was calculated by Budhayana. It is said that Pythogorean Theorem was discovered by Pythogoras, but it was actually announced by Pythogoras which they learnt in east asia by Budhayana.5.

These things piggybacked off Mario’s success, and were so simple they could just be thrown into any other situation - racing, tennis, you name it.If you think about other popular, but less strictly “successful” characters like Sonic the Hedgehog and Megaman, they might have simple yet stylish concepts… but they were very specific.

Why are you doing this to me?And this kept on going with literally everyone i met.People were betraying me, and were talking behind by back.I once even got bullied and beaten up by a guy in college while those friends just stood and watch.What is happening????Everyone seemed to be an asshole in my college.I even hated my college and they just won’t stop taking tests.I asked myself “Why am i asked to work hard ? i have already proven to the world that i am intelligent by entering one of the best colleges in the country”.I was at the bottom of the class.

After many yearsHello, I am a Chinese student. I want to answer this question because my mother has had huge depression. When she was nearly about age of 30, she has under same conditions with you now. One day, she abruptly cried and shouted in front of me—quote from her original word— “I have done nothing in my life,I have nothing to show off, my life is so tragedy, my life is over.” I was so confused and didn’t know how to react. You know China is a developing country. People in the undeveloped inner province was lack of knowledge of psychology. So my mother was untreated and unmedicined . After many years later I go to collage and read so many books myself, I know now that she has had huge depression by then. During these years suffering, I want to offer you some advises:My mother was born an unhealthy family. My grandpa worked for Chinese army during 30 years. China has extremely ideology at that time. My grandpa moved back countryside after his service in army. He have no social life. Because he didn’t know how to communicate with other naturely. He didn’t know the importance of interpersonal relationship. He is an angry man, and he belittle education,marriage and health. He thinks being rich and knolegeable is dangerous. In the end, he forced my mother to marry my father. Developing in the isolation circumstance,my mother was ignorant . After years of living together,this marriage was becoming the resources of anguish.All of these years, she was being so greif.And still she lacks the courage to end this marriage in the conservative society. My father is not bad guy ,he don’t know how to care and love wife and daughter. He likes my grandpa, but didn’t know how to build intimate relationship , especially with female.But my mother eagers for love. So I think the priority is find your root of depression and try to overcome it.2.Self-improvement is never lateActually , my mother was never reach maturity. She never officially in a relationship. She didn’t know how to enlarge social circle , how to make new friends and how to maintain friendship. In these years she couldn’t find a realiable consultant or senior to ask for help,even for one time meaningful talk.But now there have internet. Why not just lower your expectations,just try to get some positive feedback currently. Find a way to build some healthy relationship. My mother was nearly 50. When she shakes my shudders crying to jumps from our third floor,she was mid-30. I wish she know that at that time it is not end of her world. Getting better at every stage of our age is the goal for which we should strive to achieve.3.always move onMany people didn’t realise that they stuck in the past. If you always thought about the wasted decades and missed opportunities,someday later you also will regret today. In the past,you just unprepared. What’s done is done. Some people is born with piano,baby doll and pink dress. I born with two depression parents. Sometimes one generation can’t overpass so many class. Sometimes some people just couldn’t find true love in their entire life ,but this does not mean we stop trying. Life is not one competition after another. Life should be a process of seeking love,learn and cope. Even if you do make mistakes in the past, you also shouldn’t let regret steal the present. You are a grow-up, no matter how hard life is ,don’t use more excuse to run away from reality. Take your responsibility and find someone to love.Maby there is another thing you didn’t realise, you came to Quora to ask for help instead of to make a end.That is the first change you already made. We may be never accomplish our daydreaming,but we all can make progress, do a little good to others.I wish my experience could do a little help.
