In simpler words, It is basically a preamble of your business on the internet that can let visitors know what your company is all about and what products/ services it offers. In recent times, the benefits of having a website have increased exponentially and here we will discuss 5 of the many reasons why having an official website can help your business grow1. Cost EffectiveCompany websites can be very helpful in cutting operating costs like rent, compensation of employed staff, and cost of other miscellaneous amenities. If you have a website, you can sell/offer your goods and services directly through it and gain an edge over your competitors.2. Enhances ReliabilityHaving an official company website makes you seem more reliable and increases your credibility as most reputable companies today have their own websites. If you have an impressive website, viewers are tempted to give you a chance because it is easier for them to have trust in your capabilities and it also accentuates your commitment to your business.3. Information ExchangeA website enables you to have smooth communication with your prospective clients as most of the important information is already listed on the website and they just have to reach out to you on it to seal the deal. Not only this, but receiving reviews and feedback from clients can also be made much simpler by having an official website.4. 24x7 AccessibilityYour website is accessible to people day and night, 24x7 and 365 days a year. Anyone can visit it and make a purchase/ sale offer anytime they want which makes it very beneficial as it is harder for you to be available to customers 24x7 but having a website makes it possible for you to do this.5. ConvenientPeople can visit countless websites in a day but they can’t visit too many offline stores in a day. This is due to the sheer convenience of having a website since they can make sales/ purchases even while sitting in the comfort of their homes. Not only is it convenient for your clients but also for you as you are able to allot sufficient time to each of their needs/likes and also it creates a more organized system of doing business.","135,501 followers",Hector Quintanilla,7.1K,1.2K,88.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-5-benefits-of-having-a-website-for-your-business

SalesIf the site has the opportunity to immediately order a product or service, and pay for it online, it becomes a real seller.4. Feedback from buyersThe “Ask a question” form on the site, chat bots or chats with a live manager - do you think this is only for visitors? No, it is much more important for the management of the company. Feedback will show the shortcomings of a product or service - when you know about the problem, you can quickly fix it. And that means ultimately increasing profits.5.

Plus, what other channel can give you a chance to interact with your customers directly? Through social media, you can ask for their ideas, thoughts, or comments and also use social media for customer support, and this way, build a relationship with them.And in case you wanted to say, “I don’t think I have enough time for social media as a small business owner,” don’t worry - there’s no need for you to sit and post every day, not when you can use social media management and scheduling tool such asHave a nice day!",40 followers,Aled Jenkins,1K,109,5.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-5-benefits-of-having-a-website-for-your-business

It may seem like that China got into too many conflicts to the foreigners, but the Chinese are focusing on their programs and projects to make their big plan of Made in China 2025 successful and great. For example, the Chinese are focusing on leading intelligent manufacturing companies with strong innovation capabilities, outstanding main businesses, good product market prospects, and a great role in leading the industry. They will step up their deployment of upstream and downstream enterprises, and will gradually build a full range of high-end intelligent manufacturing industry chains in China.Intelligent manufacturing not only promotes industrial upgrading, but also extends the industrial chain and promotes high-quality economic development. In making intelligent upgrade on the original basis, the Chinese now find that the current boundary between automation and informatization manufacturers has become increasingly blurred, which also indicates that the development of intelligence is effective in China.The Chinese transformation and upgrading is to realize the transformation from resource- and human-intensive to technological intelligence-intensive, from low-end low-quality to meet basic needs to high-end high-quality to meet high-quality needs. If the Chinese companies want to develop semiconductor technology completely independently of the United States, they must vigorously develop domestic substitution. From the background of the autonomy of the industrial chain and the needs of the domestic market, domestic substitution has reached the time to move forward.With the advent of the information age, very large scale integrated circuit chips are widely used in various electronic products and systems such as computers, mobile phones, home appliances, automobiles, high-speed rail, power grids, medical instruments, robots, and industrial control. The importance of the VLSE chips is evident. At present, the semiconductors in China are very dependent on imports. According to data released by the Chinese Customs, the imported integrated circuit chips cost a total of 305.5 billion US dollars in 2019, far exceeding crude oil as a strategic material.Shanghai Microelectronics Equipment (Group) Co., Ltd. currently can produce the most precise processing process of the 90nm lithography systems.

More people aren’t scared to explore new currencies and payment methods removing them from the stigma of these big corporations that just simply monopolizes and just limiting our options.One project which I think have made an impact as I was checking for alternatives when it comes to payment was NavCoin. I’m amazed how independent this platform imagine an open-source, blockchain based Proof of Stake cryptocurrency. Its design is public, nobody owns or controls it, and everyone can take part. The platform run by its users, for users like us - with an incentivised network of nodes verifying payments all around the world.Just a quickie history about it NavCoin, it is a community-run network that was started in 2014. It initially used Proof of Work, but quickly made the shift to Proof of Stake. With no ICO or premine, NavCoin has always been self-funded to ensure a fair distribution and that everyone has a chance to get involved.In short this platform are just one of the platforms that clearly provides solutions that many of us have been trying to resolved. We want cheap, fast and performance-driven tools and not just because we don’t have any other options.Imagine if there are more blockchain platforms that resolves such issues, I doubt people will forget it. Clearly blockchain will not be a trend but it will definitely be passed down as a marvelous discovery in today’s technology.","7,139 followers",Stephan Lindgren,755,178,8.7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-5-benefits-of-having-a-website-for-your-business
