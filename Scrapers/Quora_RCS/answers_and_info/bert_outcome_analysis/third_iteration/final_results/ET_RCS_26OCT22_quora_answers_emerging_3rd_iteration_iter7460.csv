It amounts to “the code is perfect, and the key stakeholders would never do anything to make it less than perfect.” Neither is necessarily true, but all is necessary for bitcoin to hold value is for a sufficient number of people to believe it.Investing in cryptocurrency in general is a good business if you are on the right path and with the right platform. After so many failed attempt on getting the right platform, I came across CryptoExchangeFx Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www.cryptoexchangefx,com) where i get 20% of every investment i made with cryptocurrency every 10 days. It looks to good to be true until i gave it a try and trust me it has been a smooth ride all the way. Don’t give up on cryptocurrency and join the platform. Trust me, you won’t care about the price fluctuation anymore. Thank me Later.Note:The code isn’t perfect, of course. If it were, it would never have been hard forked. But Fidelity Digital Assets has an answer to that one too. Bitcoin may not be immutable, but its community is: “While Bitcoin’s open-source software may be forked, its community and network effects cannot.”Many people have commented on Bitcoin’s cult-like nature, which appears to be a design feature – the pseudonymous leader who disappeared after three years, the refusal of those who know who Satoshi is to reveal his/her identity, the reverence with which followers treat the sayings of Satoshi and his/her close associates. Network effects are particularly strong in cults, and the incentives of cult members are not necessarily financial. True believers remain invested in bitcoin and actively trading even when the price is falling catastrophically, because of their faith bitcoin will eventually become the heart of a new world order. While they exist, there will always be an incentive to mine bitcoin – and while that remains the case, the price cannot fall to zero.So the faith of bitcoiners is what gives bitcoin its value. If they were to lose that faith, the currency’s value would fall to zero. But is their faith alone enough for bitcoin eventually to replace the U.S. dollar as global reserve currency?There are at present no indications whatsoever that the world is likely to ditch the dollar anytime soon. If anything, the present pandemic has increased reliance on the dollar, forcing the Federal Reserve to provide more liquidity to financial markets. Even in crypto markets, there is a growing need for greenbacks – after all, what are stablecoins but a means of tying cryptocurrencies ever more tightly to the dollar?A global switch to bitcoin would cause the mother of all financial crises, destabilizing not only conventional markets but crypto markets, too. However, a significant number of people, including but not limited to bitcoiners, think this is not only possible but inevitable. They believe that quantitative easing (QE) will eventually trigger uncontrollable hyperinflation of all major fiat currencies. This belief has proved persistent despite the failure of QE to generate significant price inflation anywhere in the world.In the early 2010s, people who believed in this hyper-inflationary Armageddon thought the inevitable result would be the return of the global gold standard. Some of them still believe this. But bitcoin’s true believers argue it is bitcoin, not gold, to which the world would turn when fiat currencies crashed and burned.Why bitcoin? Because it has both the advantages of gold and the convenience of digital currency. It is not issued or controlled by a government, and – unlike gold – its supply increases predictably and will eventually be permanently fixed. It can be subdivided into tiny amounts, making it more usable than gold as a medium of exchange. And as its value increases, the prices of real goods and services bought with it will fall. A digital currency independent of government and naturally deflationary would be just what would be needed to restore trust in money after the dollar’s hyper-inflationary collapse.",2 followers,Kelly Pearson,1.2K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Will-virtual-currency-ever-replace-physical-currency

Friends, family, and coworkers all seem to be sure that cryptocurrency is the way of the future. I can’t really tell if cryptocurrency will dominate the use of our regular money or credit cards in the future. But i can give you1. DecentralizationThe first thing to know about cryptocurrency is that it’s stored in a decentralized format on the web. This means that rather than being stored by a third party bank, transactions are carried out on public ledgers called Blockchains and are controlled and verified by the public.Why should you care?2. Increased SecurityI know what you’re thinking.If my cryptocurrency is stored and verified out in the public, how could it possibly be more secure than using my credit card through a bank? To understand that, we must first understand how credit cards work. Traditional credit cards work on a “pull” system, which allows any entity with your information to go in and pull money from your account. Any time you hand over your card information, there are increased opportunities for fraud, and for overcharges which can often go undetected.What’s the difference?3. International CurrencyInternational dealings with regular money can come with a slew of fees and frustrations. Whether you’re transferring money internationally or converting into foreign currencies, when it comes to money, everyone seems to speak a different language.How can this change?4. Minimal FeesThis brings us to our next point. We all know that traditional banking includes a lot of one particular four-letter word: fees. When banking in traditional systems, there are fees for opening new accounts, processing, using ATMs, international transfers, and fees that grow depending on how much money you’re dealing with. The list goes on and on!But what about cryptocurrency fees?5. Opportunity for Passive IncomeOne of the many opportunities available with cryptocurrency is the chance to earn passive income through mining. Mining allows the average joe to earn cryptocurrency by completing tasks on their computer and earning rewards in return. Mining Pools are especially ideal because they allow users to join a mining group, and let your computer do the work for you, unlike going to work every day for a paycheck.Why should I care about mining?Whether you’re looking for increased security, minimized fees, or opportunities for passive income, don’t write off cryptocurrency just yet. The rewards may be greater than you think. Also, there are several cryptocurrency investment companies surfacing in the cryptospace that believe in the future potential of cryptocurrencies. For example, the Coinstarhaven company (www.coinstarhaven,com), a trusted billion-dollar investment company that pays double your cryptocurrency investments after 7 days. This is done in the bid to increase the adoption of cryptocurrencies.","12,220 followers",Aashish Kumar Dimri,1.9K,2.9K,85.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Will-virtual-currency-ever-replace-physical-currency
3,"Although virtual currencies are currently having an impact on the world in a variety of ways, they cannot in any way take the place of traditional forms of money. Money in its physical form is something that will persist even after the world comes to an end. If there is no actual money in circulation, no nation can function effectively. And the only way to get your hands on some virtual currency is to actually part with some of your hard-earned cash. Therefore, the answer is that there is no possibility that virtual money will ever replace physical money in the future.","1,772 followers",Thomas Y Graham,639,55,4.5M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Will-virtual-currency-ever-replace-physical-currency

6,"Comparing the difficulty level of different financial markets is essential before entering any of them. For some, stocks have always been the way to go, others prefer fiat currencies, and modern-day traders look more and more towards digital currencies. The key to determine which market is “easier” for you lies within your trading personality and preferences.I remember how controversial Forex sounded back in the 70s. 50 years later, it’s a massive part of the financial universe. In a similar way, cryptocurrency trading stroke me as a huge risk when I first found out about it.Differences CryptoComparing the difficulty level of different financial markets is essential before entering any of them. For some, stocks have always been the way to go, others prefer fiat currencies, and modern-day traders look more and more towards digital currencies. The key to determine which market is “easier” for you lies within your trading personality and preferences.I remember how controversial Forex sounded back in the 70s. 50 years later, it’s a massive part of the financial universe. In a similar way, cryptocurrency trading stroke me as a huge risk when I first found out about it.Differences Crypto and Forex:Although both currencies and cryptocurrencies share some similarities, their designated exchanges are a lot different than one might imagine. let me share just a few differences:1.SupplyThe Forex market compiles global financial markets, so the supply here is unlimited. The FX can’t simply “run out” of USD, GBP, or any other traditional currency.Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, come with a limited supply. Every crypto has a cap of how many coins can be created and used in circulation. Such an approach makes demand more valuable for a digital asset compared to its fiat counterparts.2. VolatilityVolatility relates to asset safety – higher volatility means a riskier asset. It is also connected with more noticeable swings in both chart directions. With traditional currency, volatility varies between 0.5% and 1.0%. A 60- day estimate of Bitcoin Volatility shows rates of 2.81%, almost three times over the highest FX currency volatility.For many aspiring traders, such volatility is the gateway to massive profits, sometimes in a single ultimate trade. Nonetheless, volatility is a double-edged sword. An imbalanced crypto prediction can sink your account if the tides go the other way.3. LiquidityLiquidity describes the ease to enter or exit a designated asset or currency without affecting its overall price. For example, bonds, stocks, and currencies are liquid while real estate and art are considered illiquid. In fact, most privately traded assets are non-liquid. In the crypto camp, things stand a bit differently.At the moment, there are over 200 cryptocurrency exchanges, 21 centralized while the others are P2P-based. The increasing number of exchanges serves for better liquidity but even now, digital coins experience moments of illiquidity. Their capped nature deems them to never reach the liquidity level of Forex.4. AvailabilityForex truly has the most participants in a market, but often enough traders are restricted to take the optimal part in it. Be it government laws, geographical factors or central bank restrictions, not everyone on the planet can participate in the FX freely.Quite the opposite with cryptos, anyone can access a cryptocurrency exchange and join the party. Even if you are located at the ends of the world without a bank in sight, you can still join a crypto trading platform. Given you have an internet connection, of course.Profit Potential between Cryptocurrencies and ForexI will be short and leave the numbers speak for themselves. If someone invested $100 in Bitcoin back in 2009, their BTC would be worth $9.2 million at the beginning of December 2019. That’s a 9,150,088% return-of-investment rate over 10 years.I’ll let that sink in for a moment.Yes, following cryptocurrency trading algorithms is riskier and more complex, but let’s discuss one particular strategy that can land you enormous gains if executed properly, which is HODL. To HODL a cryptocurrency means to invest in it and hold your investment until you can cash out substantial value. No matter the swings in between, traders hold on to their desired cryptocurrency until they’re ready to gather the spoils. The good thing about cryptocurrency is that aside HODLING, i often recommend that foOf course, you need a thorough analysis before choosing which cryptos to HODL. But once you do, keeping them safe until they spark in value is way easier than reading charts all day, trying to scrape a pip or two to build up returns. The amazing profit potential of cryptos makes investing in crypto interest account with reliable companies make it a top crypto strategy for me. It doesn’t require much hustle after your initial research, it can be diversified, and its potential ROI is superior to any traditional form of investment.Thanks",0 followers,Glen Boston,1.5K,71,1.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Will-virtual-currency-ever-replace-physical-currency

Litecoin (LTC)Litecoin, launched in 2011, was among the initial cryptocurrencies following bitcoin and has often been referred to as “silver to bitcoin’s gold.” It was created by Charlie Lee, an MIT graduate, and former Google engineer. Litecoin is based on an open-source global payment network that is not controlled by any central authority and uses ""scrypt"" as a proof of work, which can be decoded with the help of CPUs of consumer-grade. Although Litecoin is like Bitcoin in many ways, it has a faster block generation rate and hence offers a faster transaction confirmation.1﻿ Other than developers, there are a growing number of merchants who accept Litecoin. As of Dec. 5, 2019, Litecoin had a market cap of $2.85 billion and a per token value of $44.71.2﻿2. Ethereum (ETH)Launched in 2015, Ethereum is a decentralized software platform that enables Smart Contracts and Decentralized Applications (DApps) to be built and run without any downtime, fraud, control, or interference from a third party. The applications on Ethereum are run on its platform-specific cryptographic token, ether. Ether is like a vehicle for moving around on the Ethereum platform and is sought by mostly developers looking to develop and run applications inside Ethereum, or now by investors looking to make purchases of other digital currencies using ether.3﻿During 2014, Ethereum launched a pre-sale for ether which received an overwhelming response; this helped to usher in the age of the initial coin offering (ICO). According to Ethereum, it can be used to “codify, decentralize, secure and trade just about anything.”4﻿ Following the attack on the DAO in 2016, Ethereum was split into Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).5﻿ As of Dec. 5, 2019, Ethereum (ETH) had a market cap of $16.11 billion and a per token value of $148.03.6﻿3. Zcash (ZEC)Zcash, a decentralized and open-source cryptocurrency launched in the latter part of 2016, looks promising. As one investor describes it, ""Bitcoin is HTTP for money; Zcash is HTTPS.""7﻿ Zcash offers privacy and selective transparency of transactions. Thus, like https, Zcash claims to provide extra security or privacy where all transactions are recorded and published on a blockchain, but details such as the sender, recipient, and amount remain private.Zcash offers its users the choice of “shielded” transactions, which allow for content to be encrypted using an advanced cryptographic technique or zero-knowledge proof construction called a zk-SNARK developed by its team.8﻿ As of Dec. 5, 2019, Zcash had a market cap of $226.45 million and a value per token of $28.31.9﻿4. Dash (DASH)Dash (originally known as Darkcoin) is a more secretive version of bitcoin. Dash offers more anonymity as it works on a decentralized master code network that makes transactions almost untraceable. Launched in Jan. 2014, Dash experienced an increasing fan following in a short span of time. This cryptocurrency was created and developed by Evan Duffield and can be mined using a CPU or GPU. In March 2015, ""Darkcoin"" was rebranded to Dash, which stands for “digital cash” and operates under the ticker DASH.10﻿ The rebranding didn't change the functionality of any of its technological features including DarkSend and InstantX. As of Dec. 5, 2019, Dash had a market cap of $468.51 million and a per token value of $50.96.11﻿5. Ripple (XRP)Ripple is a real-time global settlement network that offers instant, certain and low-cost international payments. Launched in 2012, Ripple “enables banks to settle cross-border payments in real-time, with end-to-end transparency, and at lower costs.”12﻿ Ripple’s consensus ledger (its method of conformation) is unique in that it doesn’t require mining. In this way, Ripple sets itself apart from Bitcoin and many other altcoins. Since Ripple’s structure doesn't require mining, it reduces the usage of computing power and minimizes network latency.13﻿So far, Ripple has seen success with its current business model; it remains one of the most enticing digital currencies among traditional financial institutions looking for ways to revolutionize cross-border payments. As of Dec. 5, 2019, Ripple had a market cap of $9.37 billion and a per token value of $0.216","1,404 followers",Joe Cartel,929,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Will-virtual-currency-ever-replace-physical-currency

But where Bitcoin’s answer to the question of scaling is the implementation of SegWit and the Lightning Network, Bitcoin Cash’s response is to increase its chain’s block size to 8MB.Bitcoin CashThe fundamental point to consider here is a superficial, or aesthetic, one. Bitcoin Cash has one major advantage if BTC were to ever fail for some reason: the “Bitcoin” name. That fact alone could be enough to power BCH into the top spot of the crypto top 10 per market capitalization if enough choppiness were to rock Bitcoin itself.Consider, for example, how the Bitcoin network recently experienced unprecedented congestion — high wait times and high fees. Some users jumped ship to Bitcoin Cash during this congestion because of BCH’s fast transactions and cheap fees. A sign of what’s to come? We’ll see.EthereumEthereumAccordingly, if Ether and the Ethereum Virtual Machine really do end up revolutionizing society from the ground up, they definitely can root out Bitcoin’s dominance. It could take many years, but it’s possible.In other words, think of Ethereum like Microsoft. Just like virtually everything is built on Microsoft software nowadays, so, too, could most of the world’s activities be moved onto Ethereum. As such, ETH may conceivably be the #1 crypto one day. It’s certainly not out of the realm of possibility.Another thing to consider is that Ethereum has the charismatic and prodigal Vitalik Buterin as its face and leader.

Created in October 2011 by Charlie Lee, an ex-Google employee, it is formed from Bitcoin, with similar features and characteristics, but, crucially, is lighter and faster.Think of Litecoin as the Rodney Dangerfield of crypto - it can’t get no respect. Created in October 2011 by Charlie Lee, an ex-Google employee, it is formed from Bitcoin, with similar features and characteristics, but, crucially, is lighter and faster.Please Note: This is me just telling you about my personal experience so far so good about investing on the only legit cryptocurrency investment platform i have seen online, I am in no way trying to advertise or give you a financial advise on how to spend your money. You can make your research and if you find the platform deem fit then you can go ahead just like i did.Litecoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and open-source software project released under the MIT/X11 license. From a technical standpoint, Litecoin is nearly identitcal to bitcoin, making it an early spinoff or altcoin of the popular cryptocurrency. And, just like its older brother bitcoin, the supply of Litecoin is capped at 84 million, with approximately 75% (or roughly 65 million) of it having been mined already.Many argue that Litecoin is one of the most undervalued cryptocurrencies in the world, despite being around for a decade. Whereas Bitcoin is often referred to as the gold of the crypto world, Litecoin is seen as the silver. Recently, Litecoin surged by more than 630% from its lowest level in 2020, which has brought its total market cap to more than $12 billion, making it the 9th largest cryptocurrency in the world, with forecasters predicting that its value could move beyond $200.However, it recently shed almost half of its gains without any rebound. But Litecoin enjoys widespread investor confidence and typically enjoys a solid value correlation with Bitcoin. . Despite the perception of it as “the lite version of bitcoin,” it has a lot to recommend itself.Litecoin ($LTC)After Bitcoin, there was Litecoin ($LTC) and because of that, this altcoin has many similarities to its older sibling. The network is way cheaper and easier to keep up, however, which means it’s also significantly less resource-intensive. Like Bitcoin, its supply is capped and there will only ever be 84 million Litecoins and as of November 2020 miners have mined approximately 65 million of those.Litecoin touts great usability and speed being 4x faster than Bitcoin which makes sending and receiving payments as quick as sending a Whatsapp message. Litecoin has very low fees too and is in many cases cheaper than what a credit card company would charge.The price as of November 2020 is $64 after rallying from a sluggish $46 in the overall Autumn crypto surge so it’s not the most bullish option but with a market cap of more than $3bn and big growth on the horizon, you should definitely consider adding this to your portfolio in 2021. If history is set to repeat itself in the next bull run then $LTC will perform well as in 2017, Litecoin showed an impressive performance and grew more than 8000%.Despite the fact some see Litecoin as Bitcoin Lite and some kind of spinoff, it should not be completely dismissed as such. As we mentioned before, not only is the cryptocurrency a lot quicker than Bitcoin - it has also revealed some pretty interesting news throughout 2020.The RPG ‘LiteBringer’ was launched which led to a massive wave of new transactions of $LTC. The Litecoin Foundation said that the launch of the game caused transactions to triple in less than a week and more than three-quarters of those were from the game. This movement was so encouraging to some investors that estimates for $LTC’s price in 2021 are as high as $600 according to CoinSwitch.",0 followers,Glen Boston,655,71,1.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-one-is-the-best-cryptocurrency-next-to-bitcoin
