Again, trying to get into the weeds of Tabu Search would be a lot, but fundamentally understanding it and trying to implement it could be a good project.More recently there has been a lot of work in machine learning concepts. Google has the famous paper of PageRank. This deals mainly with Graph Theory, Markov Chains and probability so I wouldn’t put understanding the power of this algorithm outside of the scope of an undergrad’s understanding.And Stanford’s NLP group came up with the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm. This is another one that may be difficult to understand at a deep level. But at a high level its simply a clustering algorithm for documents (and the words in those documents) that has shown to be better than many of the previous approaches.","2,673 followers",Jan M Savage,5.1K,274,3.4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/You-become-Commander-Shepard-in-Mass-Effect-trilogy-Which-12-videogame-characters-would-you-recruit-for-your-squad-if-you-can-choose-from-any-videogame-released-until-today

One of the biggest issues that I’ve noticed in my classmates and students that struggle with math is this: They view math as memorizing a bunch of formulas and applying them. This is often how they were taught, and it’s horrible! To show the difference, let me give an example of the two ways that a simple concept can be taught:Way 1:The teacher states area formulas for the following: equilateral triangles, squares, rectangles, right triangles, regular hexagons. These are all pretty basic shapes, but their area formulas are decently different at first glance.Way 2:The teacher shows visually why a rectangle’s area is equal to its width times its height, by showing a diagram like thisThe students can clearly see that there are 15 squares, which is the area. By doing a couple more examples, students will realize that the area can be found by multiplying the side lengths.From here, the teacher can have students come up with the formula for a square based on the rectangle area formula, since squares are just special rectangles.At this point, the students are also capable of finding the area formula for right triangles; by noticing that two of the same right triangle put together make a rectangle. Thus the area of the triangle is one half the area of the rectangle. That is, Area(right triangle)=(1/2)base*height.Next, let’s memorize one formula (the teacher could go more into depth explaining how to obtain this, but for now it may be easier to memorize).The area of an equilateral triangle (a triangle with all side lengths the same) isFrom here, the students can construct the area formula for regular hexagons (a 6 sided shape with every side the same length and angle the same), as a regular hexagon with side lengthThus the area of the regular hexagon is six times the area of each equilateral triangle, i.e.The difference between these lessons is that, in the first lesson, students are given 5 seemingly different equations to memorize. If they forget one of the equations, they will have NO way of doing related problems! This can be extremely frustrating, especially for younger students. Students who are taught like this get bored with math because there doesn’t seem to be any point to what they’re learning- each fact seems isolated and uninteresting.Students who learn from lessons like the second one, however, are learning to THINK not memorize. Students in the second lesson only have to memorize one formula! Any of the other formulas, they can recreate themselves during a test or on homework. They will also be able to come up with formulas for other shapes, such as octagons or parallelograms. Students in lessons like these will build connections between the seemingly different branches of math and learn to see some of the cool intricacies within math.Of course, it also helps if teachers connect math to the real world; simply learning the area formulas for different shapes may seem pointless to some students. But if the teacher explains how this could be used, it might stick in a kid’s head better! For example, students could consider what the perimeter (side lengths) of different shapes were with the same area (ie, if a square and a circle have the same area, what are the perimeters of each?). The teacher could then explain how this comes up in nature sometimes; for example, bubbles take on a sphere shape because it minimizes the surface area (analogous to perimeter) per volume (analogous to area). The teacher could bring in bubbles and a variety of tools (like hangers folded into different shapes) to show that, no matter what shape the bubble wand is, the bubbles always snap back into a sphere. This relates to what they’re learning in class because they’ll see that circles (the 2d versions of spheres) also minimize perimeters.Edit: In response to some of the comments, I wanted to point out that this method of teaching can work for non-visual problems as well. The point isn't to show pictures (though visualizing math is great!), but rather to explain the process used to obtain the formulas. This is something that can be done even for very algebraic problems!Edit 2: Thanks to whoever suggested the edits for the formulas! I didn’t know that Quora had a way to write formulas nicely. This looks so much better!Edit 3: Wow, 1.5K upvotes! Would never have expected my answer to reach such a wide audience!

I am not saying that all professors are bad, there are some really good ones but I can count them on my fingers. Most professors come to the lecture room with some slides, and start ""pouring down"" stuff expecting students to catch everything via this one-way interaction.2. IITs are famous not because of their research or teaching standards, but because they get the crème de la crème of students via rigorous entrance tests. I honestly think that these relatively high IQ students can get the same grades in IIT without attending classes if they learn on their own. The quality of teaching doesn't matter when you have such high IQ students who can anyway grasp concepts easily. Unfortunately I was not gifted with such a high IQ (I could only crack IIT in my second attempt), but I noticed how sharp my fellow students are and how easily they could understand things with even sub-standard teaching.So what happens when you have such brilliant students but no one to guide them into the vast and challenging fields of engineering? See my next point.3. Because of #1 and #2 above, most students do not develop genuine interest in engineering subjects despite having brilliant minds. They think getting an IIT degree is just a stepping stone and are lured by either the ""glamour and riches"" of MBA from IIMs, or the ""respect-and status"" of Civil Services. Those left want to emigrate to US or other developed countries by pursuing either MBA or M.Tech. from abroad. No one is interested to pursue hard core engineering because IITs simply failed to inculcate such interests.4. Socialist-era mindset: This is one issue which bugged me a lot during my life in IIT. After my first semester, I had to fill in the form for next semester fees and deposit it in the accounts section. But the ""uncle"" sitting at the counter kept delaying my deposit for weird reasons like:(a) ""Your form is not complete, put in your name in capitals and come back tomorrow."" I asked him why can't he take the corrected form today, he threw some weird rule to me.I was frustrated and went to the student-affairs dean to lodge a complaint against him, but the dean shocked me with his nonchalant words: ""Dear Vivek, here at IIT we also want to train you to deal with the outside world. This bureaucracy is something you should get accustomed to, so deal with it and do not come complaining for such small issues"".I was very disappointed seeing such attitude, and expected IITs at least to have modern (rather efficient) outlook towards such issues, and most of these professors/deans did their PhD from abroad. It pained me to see how they are making students accustomed to Indian bureaucracy instead of imbibing best practices from abroad.5. Even today, after more than 11 years of graduating from IIT Delhi, life has not changed there. As a part of our social initiative, we wanted to donate an intranet where students and professors can collaborate easily and make learning more interesting. But the professors at the IIT Delhi CS department downplayed us citing reasons like ""we cannot install your software on our servers because what if it gets hacked"", ""students don't need such advanced software, we are happy with Moodle"". When we asked them to let us know how many professors and students were using Moodle, he tried to change the subject.Anyways, my point being that unless premier colleges like IIT change their attitude, India will not and cannot succeed.

The problems of mathematics, physics and chemistry excited me. The first thought that came to my mind during those days was how to see through the problem by finding the underlying trick.

You can't complain against them as all IIT professors will then join hands to destroy your career.2. There are no channels through which you will ever get justice.Guides are more efficient in making an environment of favouritism and finding ways to make money through government grants.Most of the PhD scholars of IITs are suffering day in and day out due to unhelping nature of their guides.Irony is that they can't do anything about it as these so called guides control their careers.Irony does not stop here.1.

There are no channels through which you will ever get justice.Guides are more efficient in making an environment of favouritism and finding ways to make money through government grants.If you want to do something in research then my advice would beI wrote these things based on my experience.EDIT:1. Case 1: This boy is from very humble background. His parents are farmers. For last 3 years this person is doing everything for the guide which includes depositing money in post office to picking up dirty plates at his home after parties. With lots of hard work he got results and wrote a paper. When he showed it to his guide after reading 4 or 5 lines he scolded him as there were some mistakes in language. He is running after his guide for last 5 months to approve his paper till now his guide has not even tried to read his paper. This boy is not convent educated, you are a2. Case 2: This guide fell in love with her student and married him. Now his husband is running the lab. Every work from students has his name on it. From international conference to domestic, he gets the first preference on the expense of others.3. Case 3: Guide asked this girl to help a fellow scholar, who is apparently useless except carrying Guide's bag and filling his wife's water bottle, who was working on MHRD sanctioned project. The guide promised that results will be shown on her progress as well. After 2 years of hard work the guide secretly told that scholar to show all results in his progress seminar. When she requested him for different work he scolded her and after  3 or 4 months of request gave her different work, she is still suffering under the guide and he is hell bent to take revenge.4. Case 4: many a times fake interviews are called to select research scholars. Candidates are already decided, these interviews are just to show the system that they are following due process.5. Case 5: In one case the student can't talk to the guide as he is very rude. He won't bring any chemicals or let others order. One day he will give an instruction next day he will just deny that he has ever said it and will scold the scholar. Scholar can't even argue or complain or even drop mail to him as reminder as  Guide does not want anything in written.6. Case 6: This girl has spent 6 years doing her PhD. Completed all the works, published papers but the guide is not ready to let her complete her degree. She is married now and even her husband has requested the guide to let her submit her thesis.You can't change the guide, well you can but this process is too long and again all depends on luck i.e if anyone is willing to go against fellow colleague and take you under him/her.I can go on and on. Now question is why is this happening? Basic difference between Professors in India and abroad is this. In India they are in government job and nobody can remove them, they are answerable to no one, if the research is not going well they always know how to trick the system, as far as work of research scholars go if results are not coming its student's fault and again he is not answerable to no one for the student's performance . In abroad Professors work on tenure which is based on their work. Moreover if their students are not doing well, its Guide's fault as if the student has reached so far he must have some caliber so Guide needs to answer for bad work. Research has no importance in India.There are few good people but the question is,will you be so lucky because I certainly know that you will not get help from the system.",3 followers,Adarsh Srivastava,2K,157,2.7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-bitter-truths-about-life-at-IIT-BITS-Pilani

But after joining the institute you are proved totally wrong , you meet 90 % students who cleared JEE by cramming short-cut formulas and practising hard problems related to those formulas for hours at expensive coaching centres of KOTA. So, the truth is that most of the students are at IIT ,2. The way of teaching at IIT is nowhere as expected by us in our school days. In the first year , you study most of the things you have already studied in your school days like physics , chemistry , maths , c programming , environmental science , english or professional communication and attend physics , chemistry labs which have nothing to do with your branch. The work load is high in the first year as you have to submit various assignments , maintain lab files and you hardly get any time to study something related to real life problem or something innovative. In the next two years , you are taught all the subjects related to your branch , the study pressure is high , you have to attend classes from 8 to 5 and the students are mostly involved with what is taught in the class. So , for first three years  there is no scope of innovation considering the ruthless and time consuming schedule. In the fourth year , the students have to choose their final year project ,3. Teacher are bad , non co-operative , lack teaching skills and focus more on attendance , surprise quizzes , assignments rather than giving some challenging projects . Students are evaluated on the basis of their rattafication skills. Project work or innovative works carry very less weightage as compared to theory. So ,4. After joining IIT , everyone including our parents expect something like 8 digit salary package as is hyped by the media. But the truth is that it is true only for software branches like cse , mathematics and computing , information technology. Rest of the branches hardly see even more than 70% placements with an average salary of 6 to 7 lakhs.

Explain how you can be trusted and maybe have daily check-ins. If you can develop trust, you might be able to get more freedom. It also depends on how your dad sees your maturity level.
