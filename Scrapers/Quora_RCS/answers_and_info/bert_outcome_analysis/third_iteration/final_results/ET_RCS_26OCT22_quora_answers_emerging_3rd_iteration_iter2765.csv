1,"We would need to harness an enormous amount of hydrogen.The sun has approximately 1.4*10^30 kg of hydrogen which it uses as fuel.The total mass of the earth is considerably less at 6.0*10^24 kg.This is to say that the sun has 233,333 earth masses worth of hydrogen alone.In space there is said to be one hydrogen atom per cubic meter.1 kg of hydrogen contains 6.22*10^26 hydrogen atoms. Thus, we would need to conceivably harness the hydrogen from (1.4*10^30)*(6.22*10^26)=8.7*10^56 cubic meters of space.To put this in perspective: our solar system measures outward radially from the sun 122 AstronoWe would need to harness an enormous amount of hydrogen.The sun has approximately 1.4*10^30 kg of hydrogen which it uses as fuel.The total mass of the earth is considerably less at 6.0*10^24 kg.This is to say that the sun has 233,333 earth masses worth of hydrogen alone.In space there is said to be one hydrogen atom per cubic meter.1 kg of hydrogen contains 6.22*10^26 hydrogen atoms. Thus, we would need to conceivably harness the hydrogen from (1.4*10^30)*(6.22*10^26)=8.7*10^56 cubic meters of space.To put this in perspective: our solar system measures outward radially from the sun 122 Astronomical Units, which makes about 18.3*10^12 meters. If we consider our solar system to be a spherical entity (which it is not), it provides for a volume of 2.56*10^40 cubic meters. This means that we would need to harness the hydrogen from approximately 3.4*10^16 or 34 quadrillion solar system volumes. I imagine the energy required to harness the hydrogen from such a large volume would be difficult to produce - so we’d have to consider other options. And this says nothing about getting the hydrogen to condense and begin the fusion process… nor does it provide for a time table wherein the fusion process would stabilize - I imagine it would take a few million years at least…Seems like it would be far more efficient to locate other planets to inhabit, and then travel there. This is no easy task, either. A big difficulty will be the law of conservation of mass. We can only bring so much protein with us, after all. I imagine the protein that will be consumed will be protein from bugs… and in order to conserve energy, I don't anticipate making these bugs into any gourmet looking patties on a regular basis. But the bugs will need their own protein to feed on… perhaps this will be produced by humans, at least in part… but there will no doubt be a diminishing return here. So traveling a few light years out in search of a new planet will be very, very difficult if the only question to answer was a food question. But there are far more questions than food.Perhaps we will have to send a super intelligent computer with human DNA to another planet? One way or another - this question of interplanetary travel will have to be answered in given time. It’s like the long game of survivor that the universe is playing with us.I’m always fascinated by how the Polynesian people inhabited the island of Hawaii… out in the middle of nowhere, so far from anything. To make it to the island once had to be a lucky error. But then to return, and return, and build up a civilization there. These travelers were far more fearless than the sailors with Columbus. In a way, a similar journey is facing us in the future. And for the sake of humanity’s future - I hope these future travelers are able to reach their own private Hawaii in the sky…*Edit - there is one H atom per cubic cm in space (I had used on H per m^3), so doing quick math this reduces the quantity of solar system volumes needed for a sufficient supply of hydrogen to form the sun to 3.4*10^10 solar system volumes. Still, an enormous amount of space to be harnessed. Perhaps you’d be better off using a tractor beam to pull an already formed star away from its position in space???","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Given-enough-time-and-advanced-technology-could-we-create-an-artificial-solar-system-and-inhabit-it

The scientist ya TOLD Obediah that the technology DID NOT EVEN EXIST and Stain had that quick “wtf are you talking about… it’s right here!!” moment. (Classic). Tony has figured it out…and built a miniature version of the arc reactor in a cave… apparently with only a box of scraps. Tony has 3 months to sit there and planned out the Mark I version of the suit and made it out of whatever materials he could get his hands on. This goes back to what I said about planning. We are very intelligent beings but we unfortunately are our own worst enemy and we limit ourselves. There was also this meme that was made years ago that actually attests to what I said about being able to make anything we can imagine:There were also a few things added to this, such as Captain Kirk’s communicator watch, which of course was seen as the predecessor for the Apple Watch or the phasers (When set to ‘stun’) which led the way for tasers. If there were phases for the creation of an actual iron man suit, I would say that phase one (imagine it is pretty much in the bag and phase 2 (basic initial design) is already 1/2 done. Even tho most of this is plastic (no actual power source yet), it’s still MORE than what RBJ wore while filming the movie. As a matter of fact, they had the suit for him in Iron Man I, but he complained about the restrictiveness of the suit when it came to movement and so they kept removing parts piece by piece til there was damn near nothing left. ILM (Industrial Light & Magic) created a CGI suit and Jon Favreau was so impressed because he couldn’t tell the difference between the built version and the CGI version and that’s how most of the suit came to be CGI instead of an actual physical “High tech prosthesis.” But look ~~~>The real deal Holyfield. Fully functional (except for repulsors, of course). All the moving parts/control surfaces, just like in the movie, but minus the CGI. The helmet even flips open and closes shut. Built in a bedroom… with lots of plastics…The sky is the limit (along with the money) on ANYTHING we want to make.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-closest-game-to-Iron-man-regarding-advanced-technology

They can even do a fair amount of testing that is difficult and expensive to do with physical prototypes such as air flow analysis, heat dissipation characteristics, structural stresses under load, etc. While you will still need physical prototypes before you can go into production, having the virtually tested computer models can save a lot of time and trouble and failed prototypes.
