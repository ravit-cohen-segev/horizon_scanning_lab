I could speculate further, but I won’t, because my point is — the shocking changes will be the unknown-unknowns.

1,"I like the notion of commodity CRISPR - but suggest that implants will have the bigger impact on mankind in the next 50 years. Implants for memory - Brain Machine Interfaces and WiFi links direct to your frontal cortex from the Internet.Making things happen at the speed of thought - programming with your mind, expanding the human senses to include satellites, 4K Video feeds and sonic sensors sensitive to frequencies beyond those of Mark 1 Eyball and Ear. Or those will be displaced by contacts and implants that elevate sensory capabilities.","2,115 followers",Pavithran Subbiah,698,110,3.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-latest-biggest-invention-that-will-change-mankind-in-the-next-50-100-years

3,"Nuclear power.It really is that simple. You want an alternative to fossil fuels, I'm sadly the one to report the most viable option is a non renewable, yet carbon neutral, alternative known as 'uranium', and its cousin 'plutonium'.In the long term, yes, we need to learn to harness the power of the sun (which is, ironically, powered by nuclear fusion). Before that, however, we should just accept that the best bet is to smash some rocks together and watch them burn.Coal and oil are awful power sources in the modern day.

Their extraction is difficult and dangerous, their use is killing our planet, and their fumes end human life. Uranium and plutonium are (comparatively) easy to dig up, they don't cause global warming, and they only offer a risk to humans when handled improperly.We can power ourselves for centuries off of the miracle of nuclear power, and in doing so we will drastically reduce the amount of damage we are causing our world. That precious time will almost certainly allow us to convert smoothly and properly to powers from solar sources.","9,587 followers",Max Searle,2.1K,82,6.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-latest-biggest-invention-that-will-change-mankind-in-the-next-50-100-years
