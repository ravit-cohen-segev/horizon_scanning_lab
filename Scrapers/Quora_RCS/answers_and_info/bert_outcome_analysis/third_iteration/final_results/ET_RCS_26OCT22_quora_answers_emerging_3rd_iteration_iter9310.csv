We very often speak on child life, which emphasises the importance of freedom and happiness for the children, but suddenly take a ‘U’ turn, on the life of the adolescents, imposing many conditions, based on tradition and custom.

This is an attack on the nature’s dictum. Adolescent’s life is equally important as child life, once lost is lost for ever. We give too much importance to the traditional way of living, keeping aside, the natural feelings of the adolescent population. True, it may demand a major overhauling of the social system, but sacrificing the whole of adolescent life, for the sake of a better future, is equally disturbing. Nobody has taken up this issue, for the betterment of this young generation. Advanced countries, have clearly assessed the situation, and have maintained a balanced approach on this. Adolescents are incapable of fighting for their rights, and once they pass that stage, join the adult group, unconcerned about their own, non-fulfillment of their past life. Changes are required, debates and discussions should come up, in order to provide, a better life for the, in-between, generation.","1,001 followers",Ruben Kusi,3.1K,165,2.2M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-creative-solutions-to-maintaining-effective-communication-with-adolescents-particularly-in-following-up-with-sexual-health-issues

They need the right person whom they feel they can trust since they’re especially vulnerable to being misunderstood and or abused causing more anxiety and issues for them. Their right to privacy should still be protected and respected. Maybe they don’t feel they need to talk about it. Its their life, their choice.

6,"Because with whom? For example, I have the bunch of anxieties and problems, I have a bipolar disorder, when I’m down - I’m awfully apathetic, when I’m up - I’m anxious and stressed and it doesn’t help me with my work and it invokes the fear of losing a steady income as small as it is. When I’m being overwhelmed it triggers the switch of phase. Talking to other people is: a) suppress anxiety that caused by the fact that you making a sound, b) suppress anxiety that you taking other person’s time and bothering them, c) try and make you words comprehendible for them, d) deal with their emotions abBecause with whom?

Talking to people in general is overwhelming, for me at least.Talking to the other person doesn’t really help. It also could mess them up and mess up your relationship to them. It’s way too tricky, it’s not like in the movies when somebody accepts you at every aspect and you can talk about anything with that someone - this is a truly precious thing. Only a prepared professional can safely venture into the depths of other person’s emotional problems. Others are at risk. Doesn’t matter if they eager to help you or love you. It matters if they are experienced or/and trained, because they might hurt you and themselves and that’s not helping.Telling from my mum who always buries me under the weight of her problems in response for any simple issue - that risk is mutual. I once just reminded her how we had a huge fight more than ten years ago and she freaked out and started crying and talking about suicide and that freaked me out as well because it’s not really she often does and talks about. Did I resolve any of my issues or am I now even more messed up, and also skittish to talk to her, and guilty about being skittish, and suicidal because I only cause grief to my family and that I can’t just disappear or suppress my stupid issues and shut up and just wait until another switch to hypomania could take my mind away?Sorry for so worldly response - and it wasn’t easy to speak about for me either.",2 followers,Greg Easter,13.4K,4.1K,7.6M,1991,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-creative-solutions-to-maintaining-effective-communication-with-adolescents-particularly-in-following-up-with-sexual-health-issues

13,This is a somewhat circular question because a person has to have critical thinking skills to understand what you are trying to communicate.
