0,"It’s an arms race. Missiles vs Anti Missiles technology. Currently the Iron Dome, while not quite providing 100% protection (and never claimed to be) seems to have the upper hand. But things can change.For instance just to the north of Israel is a country that alas is busy utterly collapsing. It is called Lebanon.

While largely overseeing the disintegration of Lebanon, Iran has ALSO supplied Hezbollah with a reputed 140,0000 or more missiles- apparently with Israel’s name on each one of them. This is more than most militaries on planet Earth possess. In addition Iran is expending a lot of money and effort to convert many of the simpler missiles in this arsenal into more accurate ones. Just because the Iron Dome performed magnificently (over 90% effective) against the missiles fired by the terrorist groups in Gaza, doesn't necessarily mean it will do nearly as well in the next war with Hezbollah’s massed missiles fired over the Lebanese border.Israel is not exactly unaware of this threat. Quite the opposite.What it means is that like in any arms race the Iron Dome technology and implementation cannot remain static. It will likely be improved on and indeed be supplemented with other technology such as lasers as I described here:",3 followers,Nir Harpaz,2.2K,516,1.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Seth-Frantzman-discussing-the-Iron-Domes-vaunted-defenses-in-todays-Foreign-Policy-argue-that-even-though-Israel-wont-admit-this-there-is-a-strategic-peak-for-this-technology-What-did-he-mean
1,"Most other countries don’t feel that the thing to do if they’re attacked by missiles is to let the missiles keep coming and meanwhile destroy as many of them as possible in the air, at considerable expense and with damage on the ground. Most other countries feel that the thing to do is to counterattack and stop the missiles from ever being launched again. Only Israel would be pilloried for doing so.",1 follower,Michael Davison,1K,8.4K,26.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Seth-Frantzman-discussing-the-Iron-Domes-vaunted-defenses-in-todays-Foreign-Policy-argue-that-even-though-Israel-wont-admit-this-there-is-a-strategic-peak-for-this-technology-What-did-he-mean

3,"“Act as if”??? Each Iron Dome deflection costs around $40,000. They were severely depleted in May in the escalation with Gaza. We are expecting another escalation, possibly very soon, and need help in swift replacements.US aid to Israel is not because the US has such a kind heart, but because it’s in American interest to have a strong ally in a region where US enemies are trying to gain control. In addition, Iron Dome prevents massive casualties, because if there were none, and Gazan rockets did kill many Israeli civilians, Israel would launch a lethal counter offense and perhaps even send in“Act as if”???

5,"I wouldn’t say that any technology has reached it’s peak and stops improving, but one of the slowest to evolve and improve would be batteries. Battery technology still isn’t all that great, but many researchers are working on improving them. Other than that, I can’t think of any other technologies or even products that have peaked, mainly because everything can be improved, and it always will improve.","3,411 followers",Louis Vaught,708,1.2K,13.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Seth-Frantzman-discussing-the-Iron-Domes-vaunted-defenses-in-todays-Foreign-Policy-argue-that-even-though-Israel-wont-admit-this-there-is-a-strategic-peak-for-this-technology-What-did-he-mean

If walking up stairs becomes problematic I still want to get to my bedroom. I want to be warm and I don't want to shell out a lot for heating, so an air-source heat pump, underfloor heating and high levels of insulation are needed. I'm also going for wide doors (in case I need a wheel chair) and high sockets and easy switches. It will be a smart house so I will be able to control the heating and lighting etc from my phone.I like classic cars and currently have a 1958 Porsche 356 Speedster. I'd like to have a garage in the house with a glass wall so I can see the car. It's beautiful, so why not see it as sculpture?I go on long road trips every year and I admit that a convertible is not really appropriate to summer drives in increasingly hot countries. So I'm considering replacing it with either a Porsche 356 Coupé or a 1970's BMW E9 model. Both have roofs, are great for my kind of touring, more comfortable than my current car and absolutely not necessary. They are complete luxuries.Apart from the house and car, my other luxury is a 1980's Omega Seamaster watch inherited from my father. I don't like cheap clothes so I would prefer to buy better, less often.These things are all possessions. Very nice, but just materialistic things. The ultimate luxury though is to have health, happy children and grandchildren, and time to spend with them.

13,"Human evolution has been blunted by our technology, as we are able to compensate for more and more problems that in the past would have reduced survival and reproduction: from eyeglasses to assisted reproduction.The underlying mechanism will not stop, as new mutations occur in each baby and even if there is no selective advantage/cost, gene alleles can get established by random drift.

15,"There is no such abstract thing as a beneficial evolutionary mutation. There are mutations, which may be beneficial in some circumstances.Most mutations that do not kill at once have very small effect. Is a mutation that makes leg bones 1% longer on average beneficial or not? If the animal carrying it needs to run faster, it is beneficial.
