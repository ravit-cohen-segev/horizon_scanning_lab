Remember how in 2015 people were like “VR is going to be huge” and then predicted last year (2016) VR was ‘really going to take off’ and be a consumer product.How many people do you know that have an Oculus?Now how many people do you know that have an Alexa?Simply, this illustrates how people conflate tech trends. In most instances, virtual reality isn’t very useful. It’s a decent training tool in some environments. It’s a fun technology. It’s not particularly ‘useful’ for many businesses.I would say ‘VR has a ton of issues preventing it from being the ‘new tech’.

1,"Once upon a time…A technology was developed that everyone could use. It was intuitive, even for the elderly, it was immersive, and most people thought it was incredibly cool.This allowed for faster and more immersive learning. Just as simulation engines allowed for rapid development, this technology allowed for rapid and powerful learning.The technology was virtual reality.Virtual reality is a strange technology. So much can be done with it, yet it has been primarily confined to areas of gaming and movie watching.The most important thing about this new technology was how intuitive it was.

Just as simulation engines allowed for rapid development, this technology allowed for rapid and powerful learning.The technology was virtual reality.Virtual reality is a strange technology. So much can be done with it, yet it has been primarily confined to areas of gaming and movie watching.The most important thing about this new technology was how intuitive it was. Every benefit that came from it was intrinsically linked to human biology. Humans evolved in a real, physical world, looking at complex 3D environments instead of flat screens.Because of this, VR is best used for socializing or learning. A reader on Quora may be impressed by a high follower count, while a reader from google may not be. In VR, however, this is different. Seeing an imposing, strong looking character is impressive and has evolutionary roots in our biology.(20 dollars, guys. This skin costs 20 dollars. But is it worth it to players? I’d argue yes)Despite the intuitiveness, however, VR has several drawbacks. It isn’t faster at completing tasks, like one can do on a computer. Most VR programs use drag and drop options, as opposed to the extensive, quick functionality found on a keyboard.VR also can cause motion sickness. This is a problem that should be resolved entirely within the next few years, so it is not an existential threat to the technology.Ultimately, VR has an important niche in it’s intuitiveness. It will likely not become a massive piece of world technology the way phones have become, but it will provide important access to faster learning, intuitive design, and more immersive gameplay.I hope to see it grow.","135,532 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-VR-the-next-big-thing-in-new-technology
2,"Virtual Reality is the next big thing in new technology. Others might say it’s an overpriced gimmick or fad but that is far from the truth.Generally speaking, inventions, devices, etc withstand the test of time usually when they prove to be useful for a wide variety of people. Virtual Reality is the ultimate tool for humanity. It has been reported that Virtual Reality is the last computing platform. Nobody knows the full potential of VR down the road.

Virtual Reality is the ultimate tool for humanity. It has been reported that Virtual Reality is the last computing platform. Nobody knows the full potential of VR down the road. Oculus Executive Jason Rubin says that VR is the last computing platform. “There have been various computing platforms that have come over time and all of them have opened up opportunities that the previous computing platform did not. Mobile, certainly with GPS, being in your pocket and everything else that would be an example. The thing about VR is that if it really works it is a virtual reality. So anything we can imagine we can simulate in VR. We can simulate anything and because of that, it is unbounded by opportunity.”Rubin’s points are very precise and accurate of the future to come. There is a reason why companies are investing billions of dollars in creating an industry right now in 2017.

3,"Transfer learning in ML models.Humans are really good at generalizing. We only have to see a few dogs before we can recognize a dog when we see one.Machines are not. ML models require millions of examples before forming a reliable classifier, and that classifier is very specific to the data on which it was trained. If your training data doesn't include dogs with three legs, the model won't recognize them. A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one.

It's hypothesized that the reason humans learn so quickly is that we are fitting new examples into our existing knowledge rather than forming entirely new categories. If we could teach machines to do the same, they would learn exponentially faster and apply that learning more effectively.Transfer learning is a very hot topic in AI research right now, so I expect major breakthroughs in the next few years. I think this may be sufficient to achieve artificial general intelligence, but even if not, it will dramatically extend the range of tasks that machines can accomplish.","58,988 followers",Michael Wolfe,504,2K,17.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-VR-the-next-big-thing-in-new-technology

In San Francisco, there are four Amazon Go stores where customers buy snacks and lunches.During 2020 Amazon is planning to open a larger cashier-free supermarket outside of Los Angeles, and San Francisco is most likely also on the top of the list of attractive locations.A growing company that is already successfully using blockchain technology is 23andme, with headquarters in San Francisco. With the use of blockchain the company is able to send anonymous genetic information around the world in the blink of an eye.There is a growing need to infer more data and then make decisions without sending data to the cloud. With 5G and IoT, the amounts of data will be enormous, and it makes sense to process it closer to where it is collected and then send it to the cloud.Silicon Valley tech giants like Intel is working actively with edge computing, and it is sometimes called 5G edge computing.The ability to handle big data will be required for cancer treatment, nuclear energy control, and DNA analysis.Big tech corporations like IBM, Google, and Intel have already moved into the quantum computing era. Palo Alto-based startup QC Ware is carving out a role for itself as a “quantum computing-as-a-service” company today.Mankind will begin the return to space in 2020, largely driven by the private sector. Notable companies now making aerospace advancements include SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk.A company to look out for is Mountain View-based startup Made in Space, which has created a 3-D printer that builds materials in space and works closely with NASA.The evolution of AI will improve the quality of treatment. In 2020, many medical images were taken using MRI, CT scans, and X-rays will be diagnosed using AI.In the US, Silicon Valley startups 23andme and Color have taken the lead in genome analysis to learn about diseases and provide prevention methods.In agriculture, companies that offer products using computer vision, AI, and big data will stand out in 2020.Companies to look out for are Oakland-based Ceres Imaging and Farmwise in San Francisco.In San Francisco, you will also find startup Abundant Robotics, which has developed robots that harvest plants and fruits.Autonomous driving has been a hot topic for years. Some Tesla cars can be switched to autopilot mode on the highway, but this is only possible up to level 2 (driving support) or level 3 (operated by the driver in an emergency).To reach level 5 will continue to be the goal for the automotive industry during 2020, and the big auto companies are all present in Silicon Valley.Silicon Valley startups to look out for including Perceptive Automata, and Luminar, which works closely with auto companies like Volvo Cars.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,2.8K,5.6K,427.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-VR-the-next-big-thing-in-new-technology
