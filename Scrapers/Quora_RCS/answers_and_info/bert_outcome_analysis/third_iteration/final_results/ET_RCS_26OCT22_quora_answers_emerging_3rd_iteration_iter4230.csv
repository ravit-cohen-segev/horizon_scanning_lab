But the entire nature of the question is speculative, so why not get a bit more experimental in your solutions?Other people have evaluated the shape's design roughly and looked at bulk material properties, but have they looked closely enough at fabrication techniques and tactical concerns?Titanium's too soft and 420 steel's too brittle? Easy solution: build a core out of tough, impact-resistant, flexible-yet-stiff titanium alloys, then wrap it up in layers of progressively harder steels. You might be able to get nearly half the weight, twice the effective strength, and twice the hardness— twice the effectiveness on the battlefield, certainly.Get more creative and throw chunks of tungsten in blade, near the tip, possibly. With over twice the weight of most steels (and four times the weight your your titanium-steel composite), you've now got a blade that's light enough overall to move lightning-fast, but heavy enough where it counts to carry a heck of a lot of momentum.Now find a way to bind stressed UHMPE or carbon fibers inside your metallic matrix, and I wouldn't be surprised if you find your sword able to cut through (medieval-era, brass) gun barrels and shatter enemy blades.If you wanna go all-in on the mechanical design of your blade, then take advantage of the natural length of the sword and greater strength to embed a hollow tube inside it, with a tungsten slug sliding on springs or a pneumatic damper (and coat it with frictionless PTFE or UHMWPE, of course.) Most of the time, it's sitting at the base of your sword, perfectly balanced. When you swing, centripetal force brings it out to the very tip, doubling the momentum of your swing. (It won't even make it harder to swing, because that centripetal force only shows up after you've already built up your speed.) When you defensively pull back, g-force moves it to the front or middle of your blade, increasing your bulk and resistance in any upcoming parries. Shape it to briefly lock in place when experiencing a quick backwards acceleration followed by a rotation-free forwards acceleration, so your thrusts are supercharged by it transmitting all its inertia through the blade from the hilt.(Tweak it a lot, of course, to make it actually useful and reliable.)You've now got an ultra-light, ultra-strong, ultra-sharp blade that literally comes alive and naturally adjusts its own balance to suit your moves even while you fight. What more could you want from a sword? Well, nothing, traditionally speaking— but we're not bound to tradition, so we can go further.There's really only two parts that serve a purpose in a traditional sword: the handle, and the very edge of the blade. The rest of it is just there to keep it together, so we can use that space for whatever we want. So let's add a couple more passive and active tactical “force multipliers”.Carbides. Keep the edge of your blade clean and sharp, but line the flat faces and the crossguard with whetstone carbides. Use some special technique to make their grains as irregular and sharply polyhedral as possible too.Now, whenever anyone strikes their blade against yours, they'll not only lose all their momentum from the friction, they'll also be actively dulling their own weapon. Parry or block them a good eight or nine hard times in a fight, and they might as well keep beating with an unsharpened metal stick.Give everyone in your army one of these, and suddenly you've increased your enemies' industrial smithing requirements tenfold.And of course, no answer to a question about “technology” would be complete without a bunch of electronics and gimmicks thrown into it.Stick a big lithium battery in the hilt. Now you've got a power source.Add a bunch of forwards-pointing strobe LEDs (or lasers) to the hilt and blade, to bedazzle, disorient, and blind your enemies while you cut them down. Wear some tinted goggles to filter out those wavelengths and preserve your own vision, if you'd like.Insulate your own hilt and electrify your blade. Even if you're up against a master swordsman, they probably won't be able to parry a couple kilovolts of electricity.Coil some wire up in your blade to make it an electromagnet. Now steal a very confused enemy fighter's sword and toss it aside.Hook up an inverter to that coil to make it an induction heating element. It won't have much use on the battlefield, but the psychological shock's gotta be worth something when your sword literally melts their blade by sheer proximity during parleys.And slap a layer of electroluminescent (or fluorescent or phosphorescent) dye over the whole thing, to fly and flash your allegiance's colours on the field of battle.Most importantly: When you've got all this done, test it on the field of battle. Figure out what works and what doesn't, and speculate on what *could* work. Fix the first sword. Then build a second one, then a third one, then a fourth.All this will give you a glowing, ultra-light, ultra-strong, ultra-sharp, ultra-fast sword that comes alive when you swing it, blinds your enemies, and dulls, steals, or melts their weapons on contact.But you can have more.",842 followers,Dave Rickey,8.2K,534,6.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-would-a-sword-made-with-modern-science-and-technology-be-like
1,"There are a few blacksmiths that explore exactly that question. Some of the best results have been using tool steels, which are extremely hard and strong (generally because they are used to shape other metals including softer forms of steel).Traditional swords are a mix of the different molecular forms of steel, mostly martensite (extremely hard but inflexible and brittle) and austenite (more flexible, springy, but not hard enough to hold an edge well). The katana is mostly martensite along the cutting edge and austenite along the body core, formed at the same time during the tempering processThere are a few blacksmiths that explore exactly that question.

The katana is mostly martensite along the cutting edge and austenite along the body core, formed at the same time during the tempering process (the differences between these forms is why the katana has its characteristic curve; the cutting edge wants to be longer than the austenite it was formed from).About 10 years ago, a smith named Howard Clark who had been working on katanas made using traditional methods started working with L6 tool steel, and produced some really remarkable blades.Harder than traditional steels in martensite form, more flexible and durable than normal austenite (it makes an alternative crystalline form, bainite), it could take and hold a razor-sharp edge, be bent up to 150 degrees without permanent deformation, was pretty much immune to the chipping and cracking that are the bane of traditional swords, and incredibly resistant to corrosion and etching from environmental hazards (you literally can not touch a traditional blade with your fingers without starting a process of corrosion that can eventually destroy the blade). Arguments against it in the community of sword fanatics basically come down to ""it's not traditional"", it's better as a sword in every way, but many collectors are more interested in tradition than in utility.There are smiths out there that produce swords of all types starting from L6 or other extremely tough tool steels, any of which could probably break their traditional equivalents into fragments.",1 follower,Eric Lowe,784,4.1K,37.1M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-would-a-sword-made-with-modern-science-and-technology-be-like

Some of them are plain wrong, and some of them have just enough science to be dangerous. I can speak on this a bit as a bladesmith and a bit as a metallurgical engineer, so bear with me.I suppose the first thing to get out of they way is what would be defined as “…modern science and technology”. I suppose you might be referring to some super amazing modern materials or processing techniques. Maybe you are referring to a design, or maybe an improved shape. Maybe you just want to know how or if it will be different.First - Shape and purpose. A sword’s main job is to cut and stab. That means that it must be a wedge of some kind, and since the physics of how wedges split and cut hasnt changed since the dawn of time, the design likely wouldn’t be be any different from the vast number of swords seen throughout history. Sure, some are for stabbing, some are for cutting, some are bigger, smaller, curved, straight whatever. You have to remember that the evolution of a swords shape and design isnt just arbitrary, it is the product of thousands of years of invention and innovation and I would be hard pressed to find any “new” blade geometry that could out perform what history and thousands of years of human ingenuity have mustered. Same goes with properties. Is it sharp, does it stay sharp, and is it tough enough to handle the impacts and stress someone is going to put it through? Those criteria havent changed, and we have materials that do better than historical examples, but factors like corrosion resistance never played into how well you can kill something, and they dont now. Also, the properties that a knife needs, are not those of a sword. You cant really take what makes a great knife and just use that for a sword. For instance, I temper my chef’s knives on the pretty hard side - I want a very sharp durable edge for cutting veggies and soft tissue - but I surely wouldnt try and chop through a tree with one and expect it to be OK. With added hardness comes a decrease in toughness, and toughness really contributes to a swords performance.Materials. This is where people tend to get a bit edgy (no pun intended). Modern steels perform way better than their historical counterparts. Anything you hear about katanas chopping through gun barrels, or ancient damascus steels (and their properties) being unreplicatable in modern times is nonsense (I reference you to Wootz, and several decades of analysis onMany might bring up non-traditional materials, or extremely high-end stainless options. The truth of the matter is that the vast majority of stainless steels that work for cutlery are too brittle for swords. These steels get their wear resistance properties from precipitated carbides (and in the case of something like VG-10, a very popular cutlery stainless, or D2, a popular small blade steel) larger, super-hard precipitated carbides. These are things that would inevitably prove to be either detrimental to the toughness of a longer blade, or offer no real benefit over traditional steels. Most grades of titanium are tough as all Hell, but cant keep an edge (titanium is significantly softer than hardened and tempered steel).The one, very promising “new age” material are bulk metallic glasses (EDIT:Thanks for all the comments/upvotes/views. There are a couple things I wanted to summarize that were buried in both the comments and my answers.First, what I am trying to say is that I see no real difference in either materials or design for a modern sword as with a historical one. Our understanding of metallurgy is significantly more robust, but we are still talking about steel still being a superior option in their ability to excel in the sorts of conditions where a sword would be present. It seems I got a bit long winded and never flat out said it.Second, many of the reasons why you would choose other materials over steel are due to the conditions you are using that material under. There was a comment regarding nickel-based superalloys. Not only do they not hold an edge very well, but their primary function is in cyclic, high temperature applications where creep resistance and oxidation resistance are key. A sword isn’t going to be subject to the same sort of heat and atmosphere as an air/ground turbine is.Lastly, I wanted to emphasize the fact that a sword’s design is hinged on its purpose. AnIn the modern battlefield, I can’t really think of any “new” design constraints that might push swords into a never-before-seen design.","3,244 followers",Lim Kagen,703,2.1K,31M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-would-a-sword-made-with-modern-science-and-technology-be-like

With new inventions such as the steam engine and the cotton gin, factories could produce goods faster than ever before. This led to a rise in manufacturing and a decrease in prices for consumer goods. The industrial revolution also spurred on urbanization as people flocked to cities in search of work.The 20th century saw the rise of the automobile and the airplane. These new transportation methods allowed people to travel farther and faster than ever before. The invention of the telephone and the radio also helped to connect people across great distances. In the latter half of the century, computers were invented and they revolutionized the way we process information.Today, we are living in a digital age where technology is constantly evolving.

Initially, I ignored it because I thought it was another spammy blockchain project that didn’t bring anything to the community.Then I started hearing about it again. So I had to read about it: People are using blockchain projects as alternative banking products efficiently, placing real money on protocols such as Compound and seeing it grow every day. No need for banks, no need for intermediaries.That kinda surprised me. I didn’t expect to seeA new era just started. An era where blockchain technology is starting to make sense for the general public as not just a transfer of value, but a valid alternative to tranditionalJust take a second to understand the impact of that.Why?Most of our modern society is based on the internet.Which is a massive disadvatage in our current economy.On the other hand, here’s how banks affect your money when they generate more dollars:Every new dollar printed is increasing the total supply of money. If you own 10,000 dollars and the total supply is 1 million dollars, you’re quite rich because you have a 1% of the total supply of money.In fact you’d be the richest man in the planet if that supply existed.Printing money makes your dollars worth less and less when new money is created.Don’t believe me? Some sources say that the total supply of the US dollar is about $10.5 trillion dollars. Assuming Bill Gates has around $100 billion dollars in total, he’s owning the 1% of the total supply. Gates is quite rich don’t you think? He’s the richest man in the planet.That’s why your net worth isBanks didn’t agree with that premise so they went ahead and printed as much money as they wanted whenever they pleased and distributed it however they saw fit.Yes, they got rules and limitations but they can break them as easily as they can create them. Who rules the ruler? Nobody.That’s what we got for placing our trust in one single big institution that controls most of our society.The blockchain is here to change that. It’s already happening. People are using more and more decentralized finance products such as lending. With stablecoins as intermediaries to the current economy.At least until people use Bitcoin as the main currency for their purchases or until a currency is created to become the standard.

20,"Before the separation, Mukesh managed Petrochemicals. He also built the Telecom business single handedly. Anil was handling Finance and energy/electricity.Anil was the the public face of Reliance. He also interfaced with the investors. Mukesh kept himself busy building the assets and mostly stayed in the background.After both the brothers married, the usual things ( :) ) happened.

Finally they decided to separate the business.Initial idea was that allow the brothers to keep the business(es) they were handling. Anil did not agree. On request from Kokilaben, Mr Kamath of ICICI became the advisor.Anil wanted Telecom, though it was a Mukesh's baby, to maintain the parity. Mukesh was reluctant. Because he had grand plans for telecom.After a lot of heart burn, Mukesh handed over Telecom and more than 25000 crore ( the actual amount might vary but I remember it was in that magnitude) cash to Anil.[ The valuation of Reliance Telecom went UP and DOWN in just few weeks. Market manipulation ? That’s another story. :) ]So after separation, Anil had large cash, new fast growing Telecom, old finance and promising energy business.Mukesh had just one entity - RIL.Now Anil was more than happy. He had new found freedom, large cash. Now the brothers could decide the future course of their own business. Till then, Anil was known as the face of Reliance, more of a party hopping type and Mukesh a backroom type businessman.Now Mukesh started attending the public parties and Anil started investing in many businesses to prove that he too was a business builder.The initial days were great. Anil started flying high. Mukesh stayed busy with RIL.What was the difference between Mukesh and Anil?Their basic way of thinking.Anil loved to dabble with too many things. That gave him high. Mukesh loved doing one thing right. Anil looked for horizontal spread while Mukesh looked for the depth.If Mukesh was an Aircraft Carrier, then Anil was a frigate. If Mukesh was an elephant, Anil was a leopard.Mukesh would think of a businesses at a much larger scale. He could wait for years for the cash. But he always wanted his business to run at a certain scale. On the other hand, Anil always wanted the quick return of cash. In fact, he would collect cash from the public first then take years to build a business. Mukesh would take years to build a business and then go public much later.So Anil became the darling of quick return seeking investors and Mukesh became GOD for the project management professionals.Anil loved flashy lifestyles, rarely managed business at a micro level. It was said Mukesh could conduct a meeting for hours without taking a loo break. He was always the God of details. You must study him in depth to understand his personal contribution to any business.Their businesses are easily differentiated today because of their personal characteristics, not because one business was more profitable than the other or the luck factor.Study both brothers carefully and you would know this was to happen. I hate to say ""I told you so."", but I always maintained Mukesh would race ahead though many of my corporate friends disagreed at the time of the split of Reliance.Mukesh has 25X grand vision than Anil and he has patience to execute that vision.Look at the World's biggest startup -JIO.Who would invest and create a new telecom business after handing over the Reliance Telecom to his brother?A madman or Mukesh Ambani.Years back, Mukesh chose CDMA over GSM because he believed in DATA. Anil never understood that. To him telecom was just another business like the film production! That’s why Reliance Telecom failed after Anil took over. He didn’t have the passion for the business.To mukesh, telecom meant different thing altogether. That's why he is back with JIO.Mukesh creates business. Anil profits from the market trends.Is the difference obvious between the brothers?One more indicator :After the split, Mukesh said heDo you still need more explanations why one brother is more successful than the other?:)Message for the budding entrepreneurs :Both Mukesh and Anil sat quietly (in the same room) observing Dhirubhai conducting business for years. So practically, they were trained by the same man with the same input and in the same workshop. Yet, one guy couldn’t replicate the success of another.Why?Why both the brothers, with enough capital available at their disposal, looked at the business ( telecom ) so differently?Is it the CORE THOUGHT?Please think.==============UPDATE: 28/02/2020 -==============The Chinese connection:I was truly disgusted when Anil Ambani wanted to use the “cheap Chinese Capital” “to his advantage” and borrowed large money from a Chinese bank. In turn, he bought the Chinese telecom gears for RCOM ( he had to) and also indirectly helped ( due to his Chinese connection and his proximity to the Indian Govt ) all the Chinese telecom companies quickly establish their foot prints in India. The security threat to India was summarily “ignored” by the officials.I believe such “unidimensional and myopic thinking” of maximising the “Personal Capital” at the cost of the “Corporate Capital” [ here, the “National interest”], by a few individuals in every sphere, has cost our country a lot. For example, today, the Chinese telecom gears/routers are everywhere in India including all defence and scientific establishments.Anyone doubting the security threat to our country due to these Chinese telecom gears, must analyse and never forget “how the Americans could “inject” the “Or, must read the stories about Chinese embedding their own components ( to their advantage) in the old American missiles through the Taiwanese junk markets during the maintenance of those missiles when USA had stopped manufacturing the missiles and the components.Note : I raised these concerns as a common citizen without having access to the knowledge of how well prepared are we as a country to deal with such concerns. I hope the Govt has taken the adequate measures. Now, a quick cut to the analysis of the Ambani brothers.CUT TO 28/02/2020 :==============Today, I read a news report about Mukesh Ambani telling Donald Trump , during his visit to India, that JIO was perhaps the only company in the World, that didn’t use any Chinese equipment!!!How heartening to read that news!Mukesh Ambani, as a big business man, also, in a way, thought of our country while taking the the business decisions for his company!It reinforced my belief in Mukesh Ambani as a BIG and long-term visionary.Do you see the the difference between the two brothers and their basic thinking processes and the approach to business?Mukesh Ambani always thinks in the long term implications, thereby actually de-risking his business.Anil is myopic. His casual flirting with the “quick returns in every sphere” has cost him a lot today (as of Feb, 2020).Update : 30/03/2020 :Sad to see Mukesh Ambani losing faith in his basic traits and adopting populism. The exogenous factors finally have started to impact Mukesh Ambani. The spurious elements creeping into his thought process? If yes, the downward slide begins.UPDATE : 11/05.2020 :Earlier, Anil Ambani felt he was the face of Reliance as he used to do the presentations of the financial performances of Reliance to the investors. He always thought Mukesh Ambani was a boring, backroom boy.Fast forward to 2020. In just 3 weeks, Mukesh Amabani’s JIO has raised $8 Billions making it one of the most valued startup.Any lessons for the MBA’s ?UPDATE : 12/12/2020:Has Mukesh Ambani changed in the recent years:Yes.It wasn’t really that difficult to make an Anil Ambani out of Mukesh Ambani, after all!",289 followers,Deepak Mehta,2.2K,3.9K,105.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-has-technology-changed-our-lives
