1,"PhD theses tend to be specific, so I’ll first show my PhD project involved four different research groups and yielded four PhD theses over the course of the project, and then I’ll provide a link to the main areas of research in EE and the research labs.My PhD project was to design a UV laser diode for use in extremely precise and compact chip-scale atomic clocks.

Georgia Tech was only subcontracted for the laser development and another company was in charge of the actual clock development. Our laser development project involved four professors’ research groups—my adviser’s for the laser design and theory, another group to grow the material in reactors, a third to fabricate and process the laser devices (remove unnecessary material, make electrical contacts, deposit mirrors to form the optical cavity, etc.), and a fourth to analyze our material quality using advanced electron microscopy techniques (TEM).The design of the laser involved complex simulations and physical model development. The complexity of a laser simulation is shown in the image below from my PhD thesis:After I finish the design, the crystal growth group ‘grows’ the laser crystalline material in an MOCVD reactor, which is schematically represented in the image below. The image is from the PhD thesis of my collaborator from the crystal growth group.The third group checks the quality of our material, to test whether the thickness (in number of atoms!), material quality, and atomic concentrations are correct (ratios of Al to Ga), i.e. if what was really grown matches what we wanted to grow. Here is what an electron microscope image of our laser material looks like:Finally, after all the processing, this is what the final laser device looked like, with all the electrical contacts, mirrors, etc. The image is taken from another of my collaborator’s PhD thesis:To get an idea of the overall state-of-the-art research in all areas of EE, you can check out the various research groups on this webpage:",46 followers,Dan Ho,680,522,1.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-related-studies-about-the-A-Phenomenological-Study-of-Lived-Experiences-of-Middle-Adulthood-Age-Electrical-Engineers-Engages-in-Advanced-Technologies-and-Software
