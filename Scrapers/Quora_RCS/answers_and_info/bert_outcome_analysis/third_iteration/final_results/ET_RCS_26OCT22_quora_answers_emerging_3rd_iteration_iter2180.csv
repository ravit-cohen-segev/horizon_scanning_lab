I am not an expert in chip design but I know from my experience that with the advancement of tech today we are able to achieve small sized smartphones with so many features.

I’m here. I’m alive, not dead, not completely handicapped because of the 14 years I’ve lived without a phone.So, you know what? YouSo, 12, 13 year olds who don’t have a phone? It’s going to be fine! You’re not going to die! Look at me!

3,"The one innovation I anticipate will be the reduction of costly features that we don't need in a smartphone and bringing the reduction in pricing to the smartphone markets. We already see this with the Pocophone , Mi A2, Nokia 3.1 -5.1–6.1 , and now with Motorola Moto G7 Play . These all are great devices and all very reasonable for the average person on a budget. Just a few years ago a budget smartphone was trash pure and simple. They could get you by until you could throw it off a cliff but were a pain for what they offered .

Some even more recently like 1 and 2 years ago or like the Pocophone it has todays internals like the flagships. That is innovation. Good hardware with features you need or want without the expensive add ons to bring the price up. The flagships have their place and they truly are remarkable to behold but what is offered today and going into the future in the lower priced devices is remarkable too.",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,531,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-technologies-do-people-currently-need-in-upcoming-smartphones-How-can-we-include-some-innovative-and-beneficial-ideas-in-the-smartphone-world
4,"1. HTC Dream:Released in 2008, this was the world's first phone to run on Android. It featured a slide-out keyboard with physical buttons, a 3.17-inch (320 x 480) display, and a tracking ball. Within the first six months of its launch, more than a million units were sold.It ran on Android 1.6 Donut out of the box, featured 192MB of RAM, and 256MB ROM. Powering it was a 528 MHz Qualcomm MSM7201A processor and the phone also had a 3.15-megapixel camera. Even back in those days the phone shipped with apps like Gmail, Maps, and YouTube.2. Motorola Cliq:This was the first Android phone built by Mot1. HTC Dream:Released in 2008, this was the world's first phone to run on Android.

Motorola Cliq:This was the first Android phone built by Motorola and was launched in October 2009. It had a great design that consisted of a spacious keyboard and a tall 4.49-inch display. Keep in mind, that display size was unusually large back in those days when the iPhone was shipping with a 3.5-inch display.The phone ran on Android 1.5 Cupcake, had the same processor as the HTC Moment, and came with 256MB RAM. It had a 5-megapixel camera with autofocus and came with Motorola's Motoblur app that merged your phone contacts with your friends and colleagues from e-mail accounts and supported social-media networks.3. HTC Nexus One:This was the first phone under Google's Nexus phone lineup. It was launched in 2010 and marked the beginning of the massively successful Nexus series, an early successor of the Pixel. Back then, Android was heavily customised by OEM's and companies like Samsung just couldn't keep the software stable. Remember the days when TouchWiz was known for lagging?The Nexus One intended to provide users with a pure Android experience, straight from Google. The hardware was built by Google's licensed OEM's, and Google managed the software. It sported a 1GHz Qualcomm Scorpion processor along with 512MB RAM and shipped with Android 2.1 Eclair.4. Samsung Galaxy Note:After a raging success with the Galaxy S, Samsung ventured on to make a larger phone that also incorporated a stylus. The product was a huge hit, and this was the starting point for the infamous Note series. It was launched in October 2011 and featured a 5.3-inch display along with the S-Pen.The phone shipped with Android 2.3 Gingerbread and came with cool features like Quick Notes and S Memo. The phone proved that spreadsheets and text documents could be managed on the go and that mobile phones truly had the capability to replace bulky laptops. While many compared it to age-old PDAs, future iterations of the original Note consistently improved on the design.5. CAT S60:The phone is built by Caterpillar Inc- a company known for its heavy machinery and industrial tools. Released in 2016, it is the first smartphone to include an integrated thermal imaging camera and presently the world's most waterproof smartphone.It has a drop-to-concrete resistance up to 1.8 meters along with -810G certified waterproofing up to 5m for 60 mins. The phone is built to be used in a rugged environment. It's powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 processor along with 3GB RAM and a 4.7-inch display.6. LG G Flex:The LG G Flex was released in 2013 and is the first phone to incorporate a flexible display, along with a ""self-healing"" rear cover. The phone was pretty much a proof of concept and wasn't targeted towards the wider audience.Samsung and LG have been involved in a cut-throat race to push out the world's first bendable phone, and this can be considered an early prototype. It sported a 6-inch OLED display, a Snapdragon 800 processor, and 2GB RAM. The phone shipped with Android 4.4 KitKat out of the box.7. BlackBerry Priv:BlackBerry was once a giant in the mobile market, but with the introduction of the iPhone and increasing popularity of Android, the company lost the game in the longer run. It had a brief stint with BlackBerry 10 OS that was supposed to take on Android, but after a lukewarm response, the company ditched it and released its first Android phone, the Priv.The Priv had a sliding keyboard mechanism that appealed to the CrackBerry's, people who wanted the openness of Android and productivity of a BlackBerry. Though the phone got a mixed response from critics, it served as a stepping stone for the company's changing vision.8. Yotaphone:Yota is a Russian company that announced the Yotaphone at the end of 2012, it sported a unique double-display, meaning a display on the front as well as the back. A 4.3-inch LCD display was located on the front while an e-ink display was situated on the back.The primary objective of having two displays was easier visibility of notifications from the back. The company also announced a successor, the Yotaphone 2, but sales never picked up and the company was lost in a sea of OEM's.9. Xiaomi Mi MIX:This MIX series is very popular right now and the original phone was among the first in the world to sport an almost display. The design was and is still considered to be revolutionary. The frame is built of ceramic and the phone had an innovative earpiece speaker made of a cantilever piezoelectric ceramic.The phone was launched in 2016 and housed a Snapdragon 821 processor along with 4 or 6GB of RAM. The 6.4-inch display had an industry-leading screen-to-body ratio of 83.6 percent back then.10. ASUS ZenFone AR:Lastly, we have an Augmented Reality focused phone that was never intended to be sold to the masses. The device was a part of Google's Project Tango that aimed to give the developer's a medium to create and test various applications for Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality. However, this did not last very long, and from March of 2018, they discontinued support for Tango.The phone had a 23-megapixel primary camera along with a stunning 5.7-inch AMOLED display and a Snapdragon 821 processor.If liked then give it a upvote.Thankyou",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,1.8K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-technologies-do-people-currently-need-in-upcoming-smartphones-How-can-we-include-some-innovative-and-beneficial-ideas-in-the-smartphone-world
