The simple high level Agile Manifesto is something I think is close to the way Google engineers think about software development.However, once you get past these high level ideas into details, the agreement starts to fade. Agile has some good ideas but it also has problematic elements which are too centered around short-term thinking for working on revolutionary engineering projects done at companies like Google. Without getting buried in details, let’s look at the themes inLet’s start with the shared ideas. Google development style exemplifies the type ofThese principles are almost common sense for smart engineers. I argue Silicon Valley created the culture of empowerment and trusting individuals that these are centered around.However, there are other parts of the principles which are not a part of Google-style development culture. These are the parts which have led to the short-term focused Scrum process. They seem suited to particular types of development, most notably consulting or contract programming, where the customer is external to the organizations, runs the show because they are paying for development, and can change their mind at any time:This style of short-term planning, direct customer contact, and continuous iteration is well suited to software with a simple core and lots of customer visible features that are incrementally useful. It is not so well suited to software which has a very simple interface and tons of hidden internal complexity, software which isn’t useful until it’s fairly complete, or leapfrog solutions the customer can’t imagine.Companies like Google write revolutionary software which has never been written before, and which doesn’t work until complex subcomponents are written. Bigtable and Borg immediately come to mind. Bigtable is a widely copied design for a distributed database, and Borg was one of the first extremely large scale cluster/cloud managers. This type of innovation takes significant up-front design time, and working on components over longer than one week iterations. Because the projects have such simple external interfaces, and so much internal complexity, much of the work is not even visible to “customers”, so there is no way to write customer visible stories about it. This type of software takes 8–20 months to deliver the first working version to the customer.Projects like Bigtable and Borg are the anti-scrum. They represent extremely long term thinking on the part of the technical leaders. Instead of working on something that would meet a small need this week, they were laying a foundation for a fundamental shift in the way cluster software was developed. That investment has not only reaped incredible rewards at Google, but has influenced the entire industry.Other industries have similar analogs. From tax-accounting software to computer games, some software is not suited to give to end customers when partially finished.If I was asked to rewrite the above agile principles to be more in-line with Google style development, they might be more like:While the high level Agile Manifesto is flexible enough to work with these principles, these are very different than the short-iteration low documentation Agile/Scrum process which has become synonymous with the word Agile.","1,498 followers",David Jeske,3.6K,113,792.6K,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-difficult-is-to-move-from-a-testing-background-to-the-development-for-the-same-technology-Will-any-company-consider-such-profiles

Frankly, it’s a bit disappointing that we’re not close to something like that already.I think automation will play at least as important a role in making this a reality as the AI/ML.Adding to that, I think the way we interface with computers will change radically, lowering the entry barrier for developing software significantly.Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe we’ll still be churning out code in C-like programming languages 50 years from now, as we have done for the past 50.

It’s a mobile developer! It was trending, it was all everywhere. Everybody’s got a smartphone, so a lot of apps should be written for a market.One night I said to myself “I’m gonna develop for an android”. I worked 8am-5 pm as a sales manager and went home reading tutorials, studying java and Android sites till 3 a.m. I didn’t sleep more than 5 hours for more than 2 years.I remember calling a friend of a friend who was a programmer asking “Dude, I can’t understand what the f** is aMy friend made me an order to write an app for him for some money. We agreed on a month. I spent an year on that. During that I continued studying. Worked as a sales manager and got my wage delayed for 3 monthes. So I left a job.My wife was desperate. We’ve had 2 daughters, one of them was newborn so wife couldn’t work. I needed to provide for them. I still didn’t earn with programming as I was very bad at that. She asked me to go to work as a sales manager again. I said “Honey, you want me to clean the streets when I’ll be able to pump oil very soon. Just hold on a little”. It was in june, I learned android more, everything what was necessary, full day, taking 3–5 hours to sleep. And finally at november I’ve found an order for me on a freelance site where I wrote “Pleeeeease, take me, I need to feed my family! I’ll do it cheaper than everybody”. So I got my first order - a complex app which I wrote in a month. Right after that I’ve found some guy who said “Work for me. from home.” I said “ok” and he gave me a complex app to write in 11 days - so I had no time to sleep again. I was paid badly, but already more than at sales which inspired me.Then I got a mail from Moscow from a famous book issuing company - my 1st app somehow was noticed and they proposed a remote work for them.And then I got a better offer from other company - they bought me. and then other company bought me and other. in 2014 I changed 4 places of work as every other offered me more money.Of course, my skill grew with each month and project.Now I’m almost 40, I worked as a lead Android dev on a big (and useless) Social Network, also a lead Android dev at a state transport automatization system and recently I got a job for a research-and-developement of a Microsoft product.So, I hope, my story will inspire you and answer your question.","1,127 followers",Vlad Alexeev,9K,214,1.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-difficult-is-to-move-from-a-testing-background-to-the-development-for-the-same-technology-Will-any-company-consider-such-profiles

I was working at the Apple Store and I wanted a change. I wanted to start building the tech I was servicing.I started looking into Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).There’s so much going on in the field.Every week it seems like Google or Facebook are releasing a new kind of AI to make things faster or improve our experience.Don’t get me started on the number of self-driving car companies. This is a good thing though. I’m not a fan of driving and roads are dangerous.Even with all this happening, there’s still yet to be an agreed definition of what exactly artificial intelligence is.Some argue deep learning can be considered AI, others will say it’s not AI unless it passes the Turing Test.This lack of definition really stunted my progress in the beginning. It was hard to learn something which had so many different definitions.Enough with the definitions.How did I get started?My friends and I were building a web startup. It failed. We gave up due to a lack of meaning. But along the way, I was starting to hearing more and more about ML and AI.“The computer learns the things for you?” I couldn’t believe it.I stumbled across Udacity’s Deep Learning Nanodegree. A fun character called Siraj Raval was in one of the promo videos. His energy was contagious. Despite not meeting the basic requirements (I had never written a line of Python before), I signed up.Three weeks before the course start date I emailed Udacity support asking what the refund policy was. I was scared I wouldn’t be able to complete the course.I didn’t get a refund. I completed the course within the designated timeline. It was hard. Really hard at times. My first two projects were handed in four days late. But the excitement of being involved in one of the most important technologies in the world drove me forward.Finishing the Deep Learning Nanodegree, I had guaranteed acceptance into either Udacity’s AI Nanodegree, Self-Driving Car Nanodegree or Robotics Nanodegree. All great options. I was a little lost. “Where do I go next?”I needed a curriculum. I’d built a little foundation with the Deep Learning Nanodegree, now it was time to figure out where I’d head next.My Self-Created AI Masters DegreeI didn’t plan on going back to university anytime soon. I didn’t have $100,000 for a proper Masters Degree anyway.So I did what I did in the beginning. Asked my mentor, Google, for help.I’d jumped into deep learning without any prior knowledge of the field. Instead of climbing to the tip of the AI iceberg, a helicopter had dropped me off on the top.After researching a bunch of courses, I put a list of which ones interested me the most in Trello.Trello is my personal assistant/course coordinator.I knew online courses had a high drop out rate. I wasn’t going to let myself be a part of this number. I had a mission.To make myself accountable, I started sharing my learning journey online. I figured I could practice communicating what I learned plus find other people who were interested in the same things I was. My friends still think I’m an alien when I go on one of my AI escapades.I made the Trello board publicThe curriculum has changed slightly since I first wrote it but it’s still relevant and I visit the Trello board multiple times per week to track my progress.Getting a jobI bought a plane ticket to the US with no return flight. I’d been studying for a year and I figured it was about time I started putting my skills into practice.My plan was to rock up to the US and get hired.Then Ashlee messaged me on LinkedIn, “Hey I’ve seen your posts and they’re really cool, I think you should meet Mike.”I met Mike.I told him my story of learning online, how I loved healthtech and my plans to go to the US.“You may be better off staying here a year or so and seeing what you can find, I’ think you’d love to meet Cameron.”I met Cameron.We had a similar chat what Mike and I talked about. Health, tech, online learning, US.“We’re working on some health problems, why don’t you come in on Thursday?”Thursday came. I was nervous. But someone once told me being nervous is the same as being excited. I flipped to being excited.I spent the day meeting the Max Kelsen team and the problems they were working on.Two Thursday’s later, Nick, the CEO, Athon, lead machine learning engineer, and I went for coffee.“How would you like to join the team?” Asked Nick.“Sure.” I said.My US flight got pushed back a couple months, I’ve also got a return ticket.Sharing your workLearning online, I knew it was unconventional. All the roles I’d gone to apply for had Masters Degree requirements or at least some kind of technical degree.I didn’t have either of these. But I did have the skills I’d gathered from a plethora of online courses.Along the way, I was sharing my work online. My GitHub contained all the projects I’d done, my LinkedIn was stacked out and I’d practiced communicating what I learned through YouTube and articles on Medium.I never handed in a resume for Max Kelsen. “We checked you out on LinkedIn and we were impressed.” My body of work was my resume.Regardless if you’re learning online or through a Masters Degree, having a portfolio of what you’ve worked on is a great way to build skin in the game.ML and AI skills are in demand but that doesn’t mean you don’t have to showcase them. Even the best product won’t sell without any shelf space.Whether it be GitHub, Kaggle, LinkedIn or a blog, have somewhere where people can find you. Plus, having your own corner of the internet is great fun.How do you start?Where do you go to learn these skills? What courses are the best?There’s no best answer. Everyone’s path will be different. Some people learn better with books, others learn better through videos.What’s more important than how you start is why you start.Start with why.Again, no right reason. All are valid in their own way.Start with why because having a why is more important than how. Having a why means when it gets hard and itGot a why? Good. Time for some hard skills.I can only recommend what I’ve tried.I’ve completed courses from (in order):They’re all world class. I’m a visual learner. I learn better seeing things being done/explained to me on. So all of these courses reflect that.If you’re an absolute beginner, start with some introductory Python courses and when you’re a bit more confident, move into data science, machine learning and AI.How much math?The highest level of math education I’ve had was in high school. The rest I’ve learned through Khan Academy as I’ve needed it.There are many different opinions on how much math you need to know to get into machine learning and AI. I’ll share mine.If you want to apply machine learning and AI techniques to a problem, you don’t necessarily need an in-depth understanding of the math to get a good result. Libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch allow someone with a bit of Python experience to build state of the art models whilst the math is taken care of behind the scenes.If you’re looking to get deep into machine learning and AI research, through means of a PhD program or something similar, having an in-depth knowledge of the math is paramount.In my case, I’m not looking to dive deep into the math and improve an algorithm’s performance by 10%. I’ll leave that to people smarter than me. Instead, I’m more than happy to use the libraries available to me and manipulate them to help solve problems as I see fit.What does a machine learning engineer actually do?What a machine engineer does in practice might not be what you think.Despite the cover photos of many online articles, it doesn’t always involve working with robots that have red eyes.Here are a few questions an ML engineer has to ask themselves daily.I borrowed these from a great article by Rachel Thomas, one of the co-founders ofFor more, I made a video of what we usually get up to on Monday’s at Max KelsenNo set pathThere’s no right or wrong way to get into ML or AI.The beautiful thing about this field is we have access to some of the best technologies in the world, all we’ve got to do is learn how to use them.You could begin by learning Python code.You could begin by studying calculus and statistics.You could begin by learning about the philosophy of decision making.Machine learning and AI fascinates me because of this intersection of fields.The more I learn about it, the more I realise there’s plenty more to learn. And this hypes me up.Sometimes I get frustrated when my code doesn’t run. Or I don’t understand a concept. So I give up temporarily. I give up by letting myself walk away from the problem and take a nap. Or go for a walk. When I come back it feels like I’m looking at it with different eyes. The excitement comes back. I keep learning.There’s so much happening in the field it can be daunting to get started. Too many options lead to no options. Ignore this.Start wherever interests you most and follow it. If it leads to a dead end, great, you’ve figured out what you’re not interested in. Retrace your steps and take the other fork in the road instead.Computers are smart but they still can’t learn on their own.

16,It is never about technologies in good companies. If you knew basic Java and OOPs concepts then that should be enough. Now go and study a lot about data structures and algorithms. Try to code on a white paper for each of the algorithm you have solved. Learn about design patterns and their uses. You cannot learn a technology on your own. You always learn the technology on the job but you should have the problem solving skills and learning capabilities to do that. This is what good companies look for in a developer,179 followers,George Flanagin,599,167,900.4K,2015,https://www.quora.com/Developing-AI-technology-will-cost-a-lot-of-people-their-jobs-What-is-the-point-of-creating-something-that-will-favour-only-business-owners-etc

Good to have you.In comparison to other languages, the JavaScript community changes methodologies, frameworks, build systems and even their virtual machines like most people change their socks. It is therefore much more important to have a fundamental understanding of the language itself, rather than learning a specific framework idiom. If you invest heavily in a certain technology, you'll be in for a world of hurt.Luckily, JavaScript is also a very small language compared to other languages, so you'll be able to assimilate it quickly.
