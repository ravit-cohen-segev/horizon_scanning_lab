0,"Fusion power (and propulsion).This offers potentially clean abundant energy, the timeline is perhaps 30–50 years.The underlying technology could be repurposed for space propulsion, a straight-through tokamak with an unprecedented thrust using a tiny amount of propellant. In practice a single stage to Mars surface and back in a fortnight.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/In-likeness-to-metal-steam-power-gas-electricity-and-computers-what-could-be-the-next-technological-advancement-to-take-us-into-a-new-era

2,"Long term? No.SSDs store data in “floating gate transistors.” These transistors have a gate surrounded by insulator. A weird quirk of quantum physics means you can get electrons to “tunnel” onto the gate, passing onto the gate without crossing the space between, and then, since the gate is surrounded by insulator, the electrons remain trapped there.However, the same weird quirk of quantum physicsLong term?
