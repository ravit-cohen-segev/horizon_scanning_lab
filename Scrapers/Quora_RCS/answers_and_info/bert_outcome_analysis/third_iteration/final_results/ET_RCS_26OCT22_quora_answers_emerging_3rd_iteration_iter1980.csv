Talking about technology, technology has made a lot of changes in doing our day-to-day tasks. But there are a lot of things that are available on the internet that can be avoided. There are many companies that take benefit of innocent minds. Because of such companies, technology becomes the victim for everyone.Hence, We cannot avoid technology completely but we can definitely know how to live a healthy life while using technology side-by-side.","246,850 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-technology-ripe-to-transform-the-world-in-the-upcoming-decade-unlike-anytime-before-or-is-this-just-the-normal-progression-in-tech
2,"I am a 65-year-old software engineer who has worked for Apple, Adobe, eBay, Microsoft, VMware, Cisco, FileMaker, XO Communications, 2Wire, Egnyte, Nexsan, and two other start-ups. I have been laid off five times in my career. I always find another job within 3 to 4 weeks — even during a recession. I have had my job outsourced to India or China four times: especially in the last eight years. Nonetheless, there is always another employment opportunity waiting afterwards.I love what I do. I’m still doing it; and, I have no immediate plans to stop doing it. Moreover, I am good at it. That’s not soI am a 65-year-old software engineer who has worked for Apple, Adobe, eBay, Microsoft, VMware, Cisco, FileMaker, XO Communications, 2Wire, Egnyte, Nexsan, and two other start-ups. I have been laid off five times in my career. I always find another job within 3 to 4 weeks — even during a recession. I have had my job outsourced to India or China four times: especially in the last eight years. Nonetheless, there is always another employment opportunity waiting afterwards.I love what I do. I’m still doing it; and, I have no immediate plans to stop doing it. Moreover, I am good at it. That’s not so much because I am a genius but rather because I have been doing software development for a really long time and I learned from my mistakes. In fact, there is no wide-spread computer language I can’t program in. Nor is there any OS platform I am not comfortable working on. And, besides the U.S., I have also worked overseas in Apple’s factories in China and Ireland. Besides English, I’ve learned to speak (poorly) Spanish and Italian, and I can manage about a ten phrases in Mandarin.I have managed to do all this while successfully being married for 40 years, raised two adult children (one who is a Netflix software engineer), and I now have five grandchildren. According to the last Social Security report I receive annually from the government, my total lifetime income to date is: $3,042,040; and, I’m not done yet.Having said all this, it is very much true that age discrimination and outsourcing is rampant in the Silicon Valley. Before age 45, I had a better than average chance of getting a job after a single interview. Now, at age 64, it takes me about ten interviews before I get the next job. Even then I sometimes have to work as a contractor without benefits. And, I have even learned to tolerate being interviewed by arrogant and entitled young preppies, most whom think they are somehow better than me even though they haven’t accomplished one tenth of what I have, nor have my superb academic credentials. (I have a B.S. in Civil Engineering and a M.S. in Computer Science from Texas A&M University — the latter at the top of my class.)So, the answer to your question is: NO, software development is most certainly not a dead end job! It is a great job. Does it get tougher to get your next job as you get older? Oh hell yes. But, so what! If you love it as I do nothing but death or poor health can stop you. All it takes is a determination.Never give up!Follow up edit:—Steve Ussery","15,442 followers",Steven Ussery,25.9K,20.4K,29.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-technology-ripe-to-transform-the-world-in-the-upcoming-decade-unlike-anytime-before-or-is-this-just-the-normal-progression-in-tech

I tried arguing with him that I bring them more value than 10 of these kids but he was a new owner and pretty much just told me everyone has a ceiling and is easily replaceable.I was depressed for months as this company was all I knew since graduating high school…But I didn't let it hold me down.

My boss's exact words were “I can get three kids straight out of school for your salary"". I tried arguing with him that I bring them more value than 10 of these kids but he was a new owner and pretty much just told me everyone has a ceiling and is easily replaceable.I was depressed for months as this company was all I knew since graduating high school…But I didn't let it hold me down. I looked for competitors to this business and got a few consulting gigs. During these gigs, I picked up on a lot of business operations (I was at level zero when it came to being an entrepreneur). I observed what customers wanted and what they were willing to spend money on. Due to some bad decision making, this consulting company was going bankrupt. I saw an opportunity and decided to buy them out for everything I had in my bank plus 50k from my family. The owners of that company laughed at me as this business was down to making $500/mo and just me as the sole coder.8 years later, we now have 3 offices, a dev team of 20+ and on track to do 10m/yr.Don't let anyone tell you that it can't be done. However, as others have mentioned, it's not easy. When you're working for someone, you have a boss who is constantly breathing down your neck, which is a motivation like no other.When you're working for yourself, no one can push or motivate you besides yourself. It's probably the greatest challenge as well as your only path to success…You're the only one who can make this business take off or fail.To answer your underlying question- Through my 8 years experience going this very path, I can tell you the three core things you will need to prepare for something like this -I would even make #2 as #1…Ideas are a dime a dozen. Everyone has one but few succeed in getting them off the ground. Execution is everything…If you cannot answer how you will acquire customers for this idea, don't bother investing any money or effort into it.—————Update: I appreciate all the support for my answer…I can add a little more context to my story in hopes that it will help some people looking to follow a similar path.Some have asked me why I decided to acquire a dying business rather than just spend my money on starting a new one. This may or may not apply to your specific case but the thought process I used at the time was I didn't see it as a dying business.As I mentioned earlier, tech is easy to develop these days but acquiring customers is the most challenging task of any business. The tech company who I was consulting for at the time had a large list of clients that it sold products to over many years, they just couldn't figure out how to make a stable profit on them long term.They actually asked me what I thought of their business on my first day there and it didn't take long to notice a major issue. They had a relatively long history and a reasonable list of paying clients, however, once the customer purchased their product, I found that they did not reach back out to this company for a minimum of 3–5 years. So their entire model was built on the expectation that new customers will just keep coming.The idea I gave them on how to fix this was by switching to a recurring model rather than a one time purchase. They completely dismissed that idea and said it would never work. Two years later, new customers stopped coming, their company went to near zero and the owner had no choice but to sell.I went all in on this and never looked back. I can tell you from experience that regardless of whether you start your own company or buy out a business thats about to go under - the first 6 months of work will not be easy and will define how the next 5 years are going to go.You have to put in crazy hours, you have to hustle, you have to adapt and quickly learn from your mistakes. As soon as you get enough money to give yourself a nice bonus or a raise, don't. You hire someone instead. I hired at least 5 employees before giving myself a small raise. If you look at this in any other way, your business will never grow. Always think of expansion and taking your business to the next level. Your personal profits will grow much faster if you put the needs of your business ahead of your own.","15,442 followers",Steven Ussery,2.4K,20.4K,29.1M,2002,https://www.quora.com/As-a-QA-SDET-what-are-the-new-technologies-should-I-focus-which-will-help-me-to-build-a-better-career-graph-in-upcomming-years

7,"It is about half true.In most industries, you reach your peak responsibility and peak inflation-adjusted pay rate during the year you turn 41. After that, on average, you earn less, and may face layoffs.In the software biz, what happens is that most companies don’t last 50 years, or 30, or 20. There’s also a recession every 7 years or so, and if you’re not on a project, you can be laid off even if you’re great.

These in-house staff are graduates of a 25-year experiential cage-fight. They are pretty freakin’ good, and it’s what companies compare you against. Companies don’t like to hire senior staff because they are expensive. They expect an eye-popping degree of expertise from you.Eventually you realize that the field of software development isSo, get lucky and have a company that doesn’t get shot out from under you, and that doesn’t let you go to make the books look better for a single quarter, and you’re a god.

Numerous components of the arrangement are standard working techniques set up by the franchisor. Different parts of the arrangement are modified to the requirements of the franchisee. The most troublesome part of another business is its start-up. Scarcely any accomplished administrators think about how to set up another business since they just do it a couple of times. Be that as it may, a franchisor has a lot of experience collected from helping its franchisees with start-up. This experience will help diminish botches that are expensive in both cash and time. A franchisor ordinarily offers a few promoting points of interest. The franchisor can get ready and pay for the advancement of expert publicizing efforts. Local or national promoting done by the franchisor benefits all franchisees. What's more, the franchisor can give counsel about how to create compelling promoting programs for a neighborhood. This advantage for the most part has a cost in light of the fact that numerous franchisors require franchisees to contribute a level of their gross pay to a co-agent advertising store.It is conceivable to get help with financing another franchise through the franchisor. A franchisor will frequently make courses of action with a loaning foundation to loan cash to a franchisee. Loaning organizations locate that such plans can be very gainful and generally safe in light of the high achievement rate of establishment tasks. The franchisee should in any case acknowledge moral obligation regarding the advance, yet the franchisor's contribution as a rule improves the probability that an advance will be endorsed. An appealing component of most establishments is that they have a demonstrated arrangement of task. This framework has been created and refined by the franchisor. A franchisor with numerous franchisees will ordinarily have a very refined framework in light of the whole experience of every one of these activities.Franchise business is on fire these days, my ideas for best franchise as looking forward to this period of time is the company, who is achieving success day by day because of their working ethics and responsibility of fulfilling there customers needs at time.
