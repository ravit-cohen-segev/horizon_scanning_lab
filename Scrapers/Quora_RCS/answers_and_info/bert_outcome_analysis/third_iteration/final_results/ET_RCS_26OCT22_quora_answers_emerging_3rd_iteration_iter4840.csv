Marketing is - but the digital element depends on the business, the customer, marketplace and product/service.If you get the marketing strategy right you figure out whether digital is an important part for your business.

The key is to use it where it adds value - not rely on it as a default.",22 followers,Nishchal Arora,9.5K,131,3.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-digital-marketing-so-important-for-a-new-business-And-whats-the-role-for-a-business

It all depends on what your client's main business objectives are and how you translate that into a campaign.
