1,"There is a crude ability to recognize objects/phonemes/etc... from signals and there are some effective strategies for control in limited situations.   Altogether, I think it would be challenging, but perhaps feasible to plug together components to achieve high insect-level intelligence.  Maybe low mammal/bird?It's definitely heading towards more intelligence and there are many demonstrations out there which seem intelligent, but maybe are not such when you delve into the details.

3,"In simple terms artificial intelligence provides machines to perform tasks that help reduce human efforts. it is made possible through specific programming languages, tools, and techniques. Codes get implemented into the machines so they can perform tasks with minimal or no human intervention. Though AI has gained importance lately it is interesting to know that scientists started to think about this technology in the early years of the 20th century. In 1936 Alan Turing introduces a theoretical device that is based on the notion that the machine can imitate any other machine.From 1936 to 2022In simple terms artificial intelligence provides machines to perform tasks that help reduce human efforts. it is made possible through specific programming languages, tools, and techniques.

We are creating it, it is an extension of us as humans. so, we have to understand that the decisions that we made are going to shape our way forward with AI.How it’s going to be used, how it’s going to be designed and deployed.to know about this technology in detail I suggestThis blog will help you to gain deep knowledge about the world of artificial intelligence (AI).Thank You",UNKNOWN,T.

Chances are you would be in a similar position after your so called 5 years.Maybe you are not liking testing or the project or the company or the manager or the pay. Reasons are many.Remember whatever you opt for, it would need some level of testing.As a developer, you might have to do unit testing, or a data analyst might need some testing of the data model you create, a BA might need review revision of the requirements he/she creates.I would recommmend you evaluate-Now this is interesting.

Some tasks are challenging some are dumb.Magic lies in the way you approach your tasks. Make them interesting, find ways to do them smartly.Within the testing domain you could look into the followingEtcOutside testing you can look intoEtcBut trust me , there would be testing at every stage. Whether you do it or not its your call.Whatever you choose, make sure you understand it properly before you take the plunge. Strive to be an expert at what you do. People like talking, listening, dealing with experts.In the technology space 5 years is too long time. By the time you are an expert, you would be an amateur in one of the hot Sector at that time. Trick is to Never Stop learning. This would ensure longetivity in your chosen career path and prevent you from being irrelevant.The reason i answered this is to make you aware that testing is not an ordinary or simple job. It is as challenging as any other IT career. Maybe you havent explored it in detail or you are just busy passing test cases and logging bugs. There are many opportunities in testing and loads of challenges. So if you are taking this decision after good enough experience in testing, i would suggest you to rethink and refresh your career in testing. Become an expert and achieve more greatness.All the best.",3 followers,Nilesh Jain,630,92,397.2K,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-future-of-AI-in-coming-future

But they would have an abundance of material on Earth, especially of carbon, which would likely be the building blocks of such an assemblers. If you were carrying a jar of them and tripped and they spilled out, and they had no limit, they would quickly devour the entire earth with no way of stopping them.But here is where things get interesting: These tiny robots would have the ability to construct molecules from atoms, giving them the ability to produce amazing materials like graphene, cubes of apple, and even brain material.With advanced nanotechnology in the form of self-replicators, the entire world would experience a revolution. Think for a second about what wouldn’t change in the face of machines that can produceProduction jobs would cease. The price of every item ever created would be lowered massively. Supercomputers and experiments regarding brain material would become almost commonplace. Terraforming other planets would take years if not months.

10,"The internet of things is built around the idea that ordinary devices can be connected and controlled via the Internet... This usually means placing a small microcontroller in them.My recommendation would be to buy and learn about the Arduino, or one the the Arduino clones (I have a preference for the Teensy 3.1).

Many consumer focused companies, for instance, need people using their stuff to increase adoption and therefore revenues.The same goes for other industries too, how can VR or AR succeed in manufacturing if you require a two week course to learn just how to operate the headset. Who will buy into smart home products if they need complex configurations and have even 2 or 3 steps to access the system? If you can help take this complexity out of the whole thing, and make it visually appealing and a pleasure to use you will be a long way on the path to success. Look at companies like Slack in business, there are loads of companies doing the same thing, often with better feature sets, but Slack looks and feels better to use.I hope that helps.","8,706 followers",Mario Galindo Queralt,529,637,8.8M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-future-of-AI-in-coming-future
