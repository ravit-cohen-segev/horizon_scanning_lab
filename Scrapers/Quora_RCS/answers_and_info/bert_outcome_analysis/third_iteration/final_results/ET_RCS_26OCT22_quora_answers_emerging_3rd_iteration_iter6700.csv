3,"“What has been a simultaneous source of happiness and disappointment in your life?”My life’s work. Acting has made me the happiest and saddest of anything I’ve encompassed in my 5 decades,When I am working, it feels transcendent, like I understand more than I know and envision more than I see. I feel connected to humanity, and of service to the greater whole.When I’m not working, I often feel listless, disinterested and uninteresting, like Dorothy Gale returned to monochromatic Kansas.I have a love/hate relationship with it. I’ve tried to give it up before, but I was not successful.",366 followers,Brett Alder,1.1K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Are-you-happy-or-disappointed-to-see-how-technology-had-evolved
4,"Many people including technologists predicted for decades that we would have flying cars by the early 20XX’s and yet nearly 20 years in, there isn't really anything on the horizon in that regard. Conversely, few realized that everyone would be carrying around pocket-size supercomputers that also function as a telephone and are also connected to the largest collection of human information in existence.So the answer I am giving you is that there will be both surprise and disappointment of future technology.(Edited for clarity and better grammar)","1,770 followers",Hema Vidhya,25K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Are-you-happy-or-disappointed-to-see-how-technology-had-evolved
5,"When it was clear that my marriage was falling apart (three years sexless without so much as a kind word or even a hug), I did everything I could think of to stop the demise from happening. I loved this man. I wanted to fix things with him more than I wanted anything in the world. I talked with him about needing to address our issues (he never even told me what they were…he just wouldn’t talk at all, and was angry at me all the time, just silently seething). I offered to go to counseling, BEGGED him to go with me. I saw a doctor, and had myself checked out. I tried to be more attentive.FinallyWhen it was clear that my marriage was falling apart (three years sexless without so much as a kind word or even a hug), I did everything I could think of to stop the demise from happening.

I love you. I want to be with you. He said nothing, did nothing. He just let it end, did nothing to try to save it. After three children, after 15 years, after everything we had ever been through together. He did nothing to fight for us, to fight for me. Nothing has ever disappointed me so profoundly.In the end he didn’t have the courage to end the marriage himself. I had to leave because living like that was like death by a thousand small cuts, every day. I ended up having to leave my home and bear the entire brunt of the social fallout because I had left, when the fact was that he had totally checked out three years earlier. People rallied around him, demonized me, and he didn’t do much to stop it. I still have no idea what happened to us because he never really talked to me about it. He is also a Quora user and I’ve gotten more information from his Quora answers on the topic of divorce than I ever received, directly from him. That is hurtful and disappointing, too, as well as pretty passive-aggressive, but whatever.

8,"A thrown rock is in a way tech. Depending on what the intention of the thrower is. One theory I have heard says cooking our meat allowed evolution to reengineer us with smaller jaws, smaller more efficient digestion, and bigger brains. Coming down from the trees meant we were fighting gravity less. Walking, stalking and hunting with spears meant we could wound an animal from a safer distance and then walk them to death. More about stamina then mass and raw strength. So I think so, of course depending also on where we were and when we are talking about.

10,"No. Not as described, anyway.Human evolution [ https://humanorigins.si.edu/education/introduction-human-evolution ] is comparatively slow, after all.

[1]And we have only just invented most of our modern contrivances. Relatively speaking, I mean.So likely we lost much of our “ape-like” strength a long time ago. Maybe a million years or more ago, in fact. [2] [3]* Instead of possessing what may once have been around 1.5 to 2 times our current average peak muscular strength, we likely selected bipedal locomotion, endurance, sociality, and enhanced cognition—or perhaps language and toolmaking—instead [4] [5]A big part of that hypothesis is dropping out of the trees, of course. Much of our “primitive” strength was needed to hang around—literally—in trees. So yes, we lost much of the need for exceptional upper-body strength way back in the mists of time. Just look at our slender, spindly arms. That didn’t happen overnight.If we accept that we (as a line of descent) arose after a split from what we may call the Bonobo and Chimpanzee line between 6 and 8 million years ago, then genus Homo [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo ] (that’s us, plus our immediate relatives) only appears about 2.25 million years ago. And we—spindly arms and all—were almost “us” by about 300,000 years, or even earlier, with just a few important tweaks to come. [6] [7] [8]But by then we had lost that ancestral peak muscle strength.Whereas most of our relevant and widespread labour-saving “technological advancements” have only become accessible to a large proportion of people in the last few hundred years, if that. Indeed, perhaps just the last 50 to 70 years would put a blanket over most of that.* Which may have influenced natural selection over that time, sure, but not by a lotBut as I say, we lost around a third or more of our peak strength much earlier anyway.And not everyone lives an easy life in this “modern” world. We don’t all drive around in cars, fly between cities, or work from a home office on a laptop and a mobile phone.* Despite the ongoing and in many ways still developing agricultural revolution [ https://www.kaptest.com...","15,557 followers",Gary Meaney,663,758,23.6M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Are-you-happy-or-disappointed-to-see-how-technology-had-evolved

12,"So where did your delusion that human evolution stopped when humans started using tools and technology come from? The paleontological evidence shows early stone tools in layers associated with early hominids, a quick Google search will give you loads of detail on this. If we restrict ourselves to Homo Sapiens (modern man), genetic evidence shows adaptations to a high cereal diet and adults drinking milk, a response to the move from hunter/gatherer to agricultural or pastural societies.
