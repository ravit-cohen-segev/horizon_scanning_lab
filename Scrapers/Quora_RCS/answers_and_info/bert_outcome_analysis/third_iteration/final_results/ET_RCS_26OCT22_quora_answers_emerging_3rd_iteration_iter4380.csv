Boeing never tried to develop large turbine engines due to the earlier restraint of trade law suit.

2,"Here’s another angle to add to the excellent answers so far. Those answers have well established that Boeing or Airbus would face a steep and expensive learning curve to enter that business. It would take them decades to produce competitive engines. All true.So, why not just buy one of the engine companies? That could be done sort of overnight and they’d instantly have top-of-the-line engines.INTEHere’s another angle to add to the excellent answers so far.

Period! And one reason Boeing can still sell to some of the European airlines is that those airlines can select a European engine, saving face and satisfying voters.Clearly it works the same way in our country. If Airbus bought Rolls or Safran, their US sales would plummet. And there is no way in hell that Airbus would buy Pratt or GE. That would be insane, actually.The bottom line is that selling airliners is a complex art and the airframe/engine mix has deep political and economic implications.COMPETITIONThis has...",UNKNOWN,Nigel,503,8.4K,2.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-Boeing-Airbus-manufacture-engines

I do this in addition to attending to my day-to-day routine, diet, exercise, long walks, household chores and the few family commitments that remain at this stage in my life.Spending so much of my time on Quora should not be seen by anyone as a sign of person who is battling depression and using Quora like someone using alcohol to drown his sorrows.Rest assured, instead of battling depression, I am trying to control my euphoria when I see some of my answers becoming instant hits and earning thousands of upvotes.

Or they’ll just ask me if I want to be their girlfriend. Or if I can send pictures of my boobs.The answer to both of those things is always no.So if you intended to ask, there’s your answer.But Jordan,Yeah, okay.I’d still get it in the comments.“I don’t know how such a hot girl could be depressed!”“Mmh… I can imagine what you’d look like in the shower.”“How do you masturbate?”It’s endless.And it’s not a compliment. Because you know what happens when I don’t respond?“Fuck you. You’re a fucking ugly cunt. Go die.”If they really thought I was “beautiful,” then I’d be “beautiful” even after I ignored them, no?It’s not about me as a person. It never was.I know it’s not just popular Quorans who deal with this — but it’s a hell of a lot worse the more followers you get.It’s such a tough spot, too, because if I actively block potential troublemakers, people have a cow because I block too much.And if I don’t, I’m told I should be blocking more if I don’t want to be harassed.And when I talk about the harassment I face, I’m told I shouldn’t use my picture. I shouldn’t write about myself. I shouldn’t leave my messages open. I shouldn’t allow comments.I shouldn’t exist in the public sphere because men who use their dicks to control their trackpad can’t leave me the fuck alone.That’s not a solution.

30,"Simple straight answer:Do not look at GDP growth and unemployment figures. Those are figures for economic advisors to the Finance Minister of the country. You should worry about your own status. Investment strategy should not change as long as strategic long term financial goals are not met. The quantum of investment can change as per current earning situation.
