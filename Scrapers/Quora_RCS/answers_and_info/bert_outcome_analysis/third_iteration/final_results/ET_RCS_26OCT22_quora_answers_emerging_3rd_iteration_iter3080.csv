Their face would break into a smile, and we’d share this moment of electric joy that would never have happened between two strangers otherwise.It was amazing.They walked away with a little extra bounce in their step.And so did I.Who knows what such ripples of happiness can create?I realized that we’ve got a chronic deficit of kindness.And that working on it one high five a time—Is not a bad way of tipping the scales.","12,663 followers",Johnny Reinsch,25.3K,82,3.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-can-you-use-advanced-technology-to-make-the-world-a-better-place-to-live
2,"I lived for many years in a town with a large university. They had a Student Union building where students could gather and talk. In the 1970s I would walk through that hall and students from all over America and the world would be sitting, talking and sharing with each other.A few years ago I was back at the University. The Student Union was still full of students from all over America and the world.

No gain in the new groups. No tellly. Ooh, weren’t they overjoyed? Then they heard about widebands. These give you, as suggested, a gain over several groups. But the gain anywhere is lower than the gain for a specified group in that group by far. It won’t work too far away and you need an aerial for the group. You try telling ‘em.Maintaining aerials. One with all the directors blown off and no reflector, lying forty-fives degrees out of perpendicular is not going to perform well. Nor is one that’s fallen off the chimney and is blowing about on the roof.Indoor aerials. If it’s in the loft and you’re in a strong signal area, then perhaps. If it’s one of those set-top things and you live in a stone house, then no. If it’s a loop you might even get negative gain.Cabling. Good quality co-ax secured properly. The more splitting you do, the worse. I had one once that was working twelve (count ‘em) tellies off one aerial; splits were daisy-chained everywhere and they wondered why the one in the conservatory (!) kept breaking up.Cabling next to sources of interference. Got one complaining no BBC channels. Hmm. BBCA missing, but all the others are there. Noticed a computer humming away near the TV. Switched computer off. retuned. Oh look. works. Put computer back on. No BBC. Switched computer off again. BBC.Got one once where the coax was wrapped round an HDMI cable. Unwrapped it. Worked. Your guess is as good as mine.Faceplates and leads. Faceplates are bad. Unscreened faceplates are worse. If you’ve got an unscreened faceplate and one of those cheapo cables from Bodgitt’s then you’re not getting to watch much.700 MHz clearance. Oh for feck’s sake. How much more bloody mobile comms do we need? Ofcom. Just bloody stop it. Bathtubs.Finally the TV. Not all tuners are equal. You might have got a picture from a barely adequate signal on a whizz-bang expensive Sony. When you down-market and replace that Sony with an Itsabitchi Banzai, costing the princely sum of £67.40, then the tuner’s not likely to admit so much gain and your barely adequate signal becomes inadequate.Satellite:All of the above plus a bag of spanners of its own. The parabolic gathers in and focuses several signal paths in phase into one big, honkin’ signal focussed on the LNB. If anything gets disturbed, bye-bye Syfy, tata TLC and dosvydanya Dave. Ku band transmissions (Sky!) are subject to rain fade - heavy rain causes loss of signal.Orientation- if it’s the width of a gnat’s tallywhacker out of kilter at pointing at the bloody satellite, your dish will not do the job. That stupid American wrestling thing is history in that case, because you’ll struggle to do it yourself and will hand over a fat wodge of cash to a Sky installer to point the bloody thing at the Astra bank.Cable:because it’s impervious to any kind of interference fibre optic is probably the best bet here, but there is one major problem when some cack-handed twat in a JCB shoves his diggy thing through the cables and then wrenches them up, and yes, if you’re reading this, you know who you are and you won’t be allowed to forget it for many years yet. The trouble is the last bit. If you’re going to have a smart (haha!) TV then use an ethernet cable with it. I know you dont want wires everywhere, but clip it to the skirting boards or something because wifi, feck off. Seriously, it’s more trouble than it’s worth. Use ethernet cables.

Napoleon brought a printing press and Arabic type to Egypt to make government announcements as all governments made in Europe. That equipment stayed in Egypt and eventually ended up with Muhammad Ali, the governor. That was 1793. In fact Napoleon took a whole shipload of books and scientists and all the latest wonders of Europe. But the Egyptians found only one thing of interest and usefulness. That was how Europeans placed books in a library. The Arab libraries had tables with stacks of books on them. So a patron would have to shuffle down through the stack to find the book he wanted. But Europeans placed books upright with the title on the spine as well as on the front. So now the patron could find his book without going through the entire stack. And we all know the book one would wNt would somehow always be on the bottom.The point is that people in long term contact with Europe and who have Europe and then later borrowed back technology military technology rejected another technology that Westerners found helped military and government functions. There is no telling what a culture will adopt and what it will reject.
