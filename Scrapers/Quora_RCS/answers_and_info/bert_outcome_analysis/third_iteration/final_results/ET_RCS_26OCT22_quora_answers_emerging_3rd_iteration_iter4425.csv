0,"It is very intellectually stimulating and a bit like climbing mountains or free-diving newly-discovered ship wrecks. You get to push boundaries and explore new ideas/methods that no one has explored before. With applied math, you feel the joy of solving difficult problems in fields like engineering, sociology, or genomics and contributing to those fields, as well as your own. Reading a wide variety of papers from different subfields is stimulating and thought-provoking. Exploring the problem involves a lot of divergent thinking and brain-storming. There's a lot of creativity. And there's a hugIt is very intellectually stimulating and a bit like climbing mountains or free-diving newly-discovered ship wrecks.

1,"Laws are like sausages, it is better not to see them being made.There are few things (for me, anyway) more satisfying than getting a proof to work and getting out a nice result. There is something magical when things work out far more simply than what you were initially expecting. So, I think it is perfectly fair to say that the results of mathematical research are very beautiful.TheLaws are like sausages, it is better not to see them being made.There are few things (for me, anyway) more satisfying than getting a proof to work and getting out a nice result.

3,"This is (obviously, I hope) a complex and controversial question. It is also geographically diverse: whatever problems exist in math education in the US are very different from those in India, Mexico or Mongolia. I'll focus on the US.My understanding is based on the following:I have been regularly teaching in math circles around the SF Bay Area for the past 5 years, and through that I've gathered some knowledge of what those children who are really interested in math know and what their unfulfilled needs are.This is (obviously, I hope) a complex and controversial question.

I'll focus on the US.My understanding is based on the following:I have been regularly teaching in math circles around the SF Bay Area for the past 5 years, and through that I've gathered some knowledge of what those children who are really interested in math know and what their unfulfilled needs are.Those are my credentials, such as they are. I don't purport to understand the issues completely or even reasonably well; the following are my personal opinions based on my experience and observations.First, there are two ""meta""-problems.Lack of consensus around the goals of K-12 math education. Many people have strong opinions but they are often at odds with each other.Beyond these two higher-level issues, I think the following are true as well:The vast majority of the people who teach mathematics in schools know very, very little mathematics. They are not to blame - many are intelligent, caring, wonderful people - but they severely lack training and skills. This includes not just exposure to higher mathematical content; for the most part they're not even aware what mathematical problem solving *is*, let alone how to go about solving problems.Despite all of that, some people do become software engineers or physicists or mathematicians, having developed a taste for mathematical thinking, acquired problem solving skills and dived into deeper training. This is often done outside of the school system, but not entirely - there are certainly some great teachers and some useful resources within schools. Not all mathematical teaching in schools is broken; but much of it is, and many naturally talented and curious minds are turned off by the broken parts and face an uphill battle as they seek to nurture their talents and interests.Those are some of the problems as I see them; how to solve them is an even harder question (but I do have a few opinions on that, too).","29,977 followers",Senia Sheydvasser,972,2.3K,28.4M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Are-you-currently-engaged-in-research-in-mathematics-education-and-digital-technologies
4,"Mathematics is like literature, you don't run out of novels. It produces new methods, and then these methods produce new mathematics by application to new domains, and by extension. With repeated use, they become second nature in the next generation, and the next methods iterate those methods and use them like tinkertoys to build completely new next-generation methods, with new ideas, and the cumulative process is similar to the evolution of life.","84,238 followers",Igor Markov,504,3.9K,49.8M,2014,https://www.quora.com/Are-you-currently-engaged-in-research-in-mathematics-education-and-digital-technologies

6,"People are obviously more tuned to the technological trends happening now unlike the past. The adaption of iPad and other android gadgets that keep connected to the viral world will create a demand for customized widgets, apps, etc. Just like sms was replaced by tweets, magazines replaced by Blogs and now blogs will be replaced by micro blogs for instance tumblr - where messages are conveyed through words, images, podcasts or a combination of all, etc. Mostly, people's mode of accessing information and utilising it will matter more than ever.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2011,https://www.quora.com/Are-you-currently-engaged-in-research-in-mathematics-education-and-digital-technologies
