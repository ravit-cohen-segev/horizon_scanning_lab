0,Well it all depends upon what you mean by technology!Well it all depends upon what you mean by technology!Techical Sagar vs GurujiThe best thing about fight between guruji and sagar was that it brought to attention of public many deserving and underrated channels which are actually Technical.So here i start my list of best youtube channels for technology.TechchipsSidtalkTechnical SagarHacks and SecurityTechnical GupshupMy Smart SupportWe are still far behind. We should have channels that can show several tricks that can be done by using programming and clear out those tricks ( the concepts behind them). I always have been looking for such a channel but never got any. Will hope someone will rise to that level. Many things are not shown by youtuber because of policies of youtube ( which are essential topics) . Anyways i want more technical channels that actually want to make us technical rather than just having a motto of making money out of our views.Anyone who would like to suggest any kind of edit is welcome :) .,289 followers,Deepak Mehta,1.6K,3.9K,105.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-YouTube-Indian-Tech-Channel

2,"MKBHD is the best tech YouTuber. Unlike other top tech YouTuber, I have never seen Marquess do a promotion or plug in any of his videoes. He has taken the quality of YouTube videos to a whole new level, and most of the current popular YouTuber (not just tech) followed through.His videos are always for the viewers. Even though he could be making a fortune by doing more videos and promoting tech products/services, he’s clearly not worried about money.And that’s not even the half of it. His review videos are pure perfection. I feel like he answers everyone’s questions before we need to ask him. TMKBHD is the best tech YouTuber.

Well, unfortunately, those microbots are impossible, but there is a similar technology that’s being developed in real life.The idea is to build tiny replicators that can create more of themselves, like a sort of super bacteria that never stops replicating.

But they would have an abundance of material on Earth, especially of carbon, which would likely be the building blocks of such an assemblers. If you were carrying a jar of them and tripped and they spilled out, and they had no limit, they would quickly devour the entire earth with no way of stopping them.But here is where things get interesting: These tiny robots would have the ability to construct molecules from atoms, giving them the ability to produce amazing materials like graphene, cubes of apple, and even brain material.With advanced nanotechnology in the form of self-replicators, the entire world would experience a revolution. Think for a second about what wouldn’t change in the face of machines that can produceProduction jobs would cease. The price of every item ever created would be lowered massively. Supercomputers and experiments regarding brain material would become almost commonplace. Terraforming other planets would take years if not months.

Mathematically, we want to determineABCThe naive method of polynomial multiplication using the distributive property would takeThe first brilliant idea comes from the fact that there are two ways to represent a polynomialThis second representation comes from the fact that any polynomial of degreeWe already know that if we use representation (1) to multiply polynomials, it will takeProvided we haveTherefore, if we use representation (2), polynomial multiplication now only takesBut another problem immediately arises. If we are given a coefficient representation, how do we take the coefficient representation (1) and transform it into the value representation (2)? The naive method would be to takeThe next brilliant idea is that if we choose a special set of points to evaluate a polynomial at, there will be a lot of overlapping computation.To see this, let’s see what happens if we choose to evaluate our polynomial at positive-negative pairs:±Notice that for these set of points, the computations forThis is particularly important because every polynomial can be split into the following decomposition:AwithHere is an example of such a decomposition:3Because of the parity of the points chosen, for anyAASo let’s take a step back and analyze what we have just done.We’ve just taken the problem of evaluating a degreeThis is a helpful graphic that shows what we have just accomplished:If we could recurse, the recurrence relation would look like this:Twhich gives a running time ofBut how do we recurse?The big issue is that we need theTo figure out which set of complex numbers we need to include in our set ofWe can expand this process to any set ofAnd now because of these special set of pointsSo on a high level, within the context of multiplying polynomialsWe have one last piece of the puzzle now. We have a value based representation ofAnd truly one of the most amazing things about the FFT is thatIt turns out that we can solve the interpolation problem by simply calling the same FFT algorithm, but replacing everyThe underlying reason this works is due to the linear algebraic interpretation of the FFT. What we are really doing when we evaluate a polynomial is we are actually multiplying our coefficient representation by a special matrix called theAnd in the case of the FFT, with the choices of points as the complex roots of unity, the matrix used ends up being a special matrix called theAnd with this linear algebraic representation, with the properties that the DFT matrix is orthogonal and the inverse is thePut concisely:<values> = FFT(<coefficients>,<coefficients> =And so to summarize, to multiply two polynomialsThis entire algorithm isNow, it seems like we’ve done quite a lot to just multiply polynomials, but the FFT has applications way beyond just multiplying polynomials (which by the way is pretty useful as well). The algorithm basically created the entire field ofThe algorithm never fails to blow my mind in terms of all of the ingenious ideas it puts together. It’s really incredible that people were able to develop such an intricate algorithm that proved to be extremely useful.Here’s a cool visual of how the recursion in the FFT unravels:For more on the theory and implementation of the FFT algorithm, check out section 2.6 of Christos Papadimitriou, Sanjoy Dasgupta, and Umesh Vazirani’s algorithms textbook:",139 followers,Andrew Knudsen,520,134,722.1K,2017,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-YouTube-Indian-Tech-Channel

You can probably get one free or from a second-hand store. So it’s not an expensive requirement per se.You need to be able to program, search a hardcover textbook, and google COMFORTABLY. So maybe a chair that easily moves around the workstation.A lot of professors tell you that you need to make sure there are no distractions such as music, movies, noises etc.Make sure and make as many friends as possible unless you’re naturally brilliant. Because you will get stuck on a regular basis and will need help.Most top students have parents that are programmers unless they are super brilliant. Others have programming buddies that help. If you have none of these, you’ll need a tutor. 70% of people I’ve tutored have been B and higher grade students.If you get anxiety during homework assignments and start looking for google solutions, I’d drive to your university CS lab and do the homework there. Make friends with everybody at the lab in case you get stuck!!! Don’t be cheap, if people are helping you, make sure and order some pizza. Don’t build a reputation as a taker!!! If someone is super helpful and they really enjoy helping you, they just might be your tutor. Ask if they want to help for a fee!Your TA can be your friend or fail you if s/he thinks you are lost. So ask calculated questions and don’t blabber. Keep your tutor sessions short and try to keep dumb questions to a minimum. You can ask paid tutors if you have stupid questions.Program. Google. Study. Program, Google. Study and so on and so forth. Don’t battle the compiler with your own logic. Research and find solutions, code and then compile. Don’t get me wrong, there will be instances that you will need to battle the compiler so you see every instance of your code. But if you keep getting errors, then it’s time to try another solution.You did this and now you’re too good. Now what?Well, your classmates will not like you now. When you discuss things with your professor they think you guys are talking Greek or German. This means you’re in trouble. Your classmates are jealous. So what do you do? There are a few ways to handle this; 1- Stop asking questions during class. They won’t be jealous anymore. Email questions or ask a tutor or a top student. 2- offer to help your classmates, but don’t start drinking with them. In fact, see if you can stay away from partying until you graduate. CS is not history or sociology. It suddenly gets complicated. You’ve been doing amazing codes and high grades, and then suddenly you get stuck. That’s when you have to ask your professor’s help or others. Don’t let your pride fail you. Ask for help.You MUST get rest and stay healthyI personally know people that drove 100 miles to take a course at a particular college. Sometimes you have to do this to succeed. You might even have to switch universities. What else can you do if things are not going well?Learn a simple programming language before you start your program. Most universities try to weed people that waste everybody’s time. So if your background is not computer science, the chances are that you won’t do very well. These universities are not a place to learn. They are a place to get a degree! So I’d learn a simple language like python and then apply for a program. I’d also read ahead. Don’t even attend a class without fully knowing the chapters that are to be covered.Best","84,234 followers",Igor Markov,504,3.9K,49.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-custom-web-development-company-in-India
