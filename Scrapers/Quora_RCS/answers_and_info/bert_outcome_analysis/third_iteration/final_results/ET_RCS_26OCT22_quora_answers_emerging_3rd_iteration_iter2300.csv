Keep in mind that many of the advanced metal alloys and industrial ceramics we produce today are far more durable than any found in the archaeology of early humans and most substances found in nature. Some of our ceramics (e.g. zirconia, silicon nitride, silicon carbide) are so durable that they will be here for tens of millions of years to come. There has never been anything like what we do routinely today.",2 followers,Richard Muller,3.2K,2.3K,202.3M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-a-human-civilization-developed-advanced-technologies-tens-of-thousands-of-years-ago

When you consider that the age of some well-known mutations like the East Asian EDAR variant, the variant that leads to blue eyes, or the one for red hair, are all not much more than 10,000 years old, you can see that firm conclusions about our exact genetic makeup 100,000 years ago are hard to reach.But as to your followup question, I don't see why genetics comes in to it anyway.

It is also known, for example, that people had larger cranial capacity about 20,000 years ago; even if we accept genetic changes, it does not mean our ancestors would have been incapable of building a civilization or inventing some technology. It would not surprise me to learn that there were many isolated cases where something was invented, flourished locally, and then was lost and forgotten again. We are often surprised by what some prehistoric peoples were capable of; for example, there is evidence that people in Austronesia were deep sea fishing over 40,000 years ago.Suppose some stone age genius had invented writing, and had taught it to a few specialists in local tribes, so that they sent messages back and forth on hides and bark for a few generations, fifty thousand years ago - and that the secret was lost in some disaster. How would we know? It would require unusual luck for any remnant of their communication to be passed down to us.As for large lost civilizations, though, that would be harder to hide. If people had invented glass or gold ornaments or pottery or concrete, and produced it on a large scale tens of thousands of years ago, we would probably have found some of the leftovers.",UNKNOWN,Tomaž Vargazon,1.8K,7.7K,249.8M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-a-human-civilization-developed-advanced-technologies-tens-of-thousands-of-years-ago
2,"The answer, of course, depends on whether you are speaking of a single technology, or of technology in general. It also depends greatly on what time frame this effect is expected to occur over, and how long it would take to implement the changes.

Would other countries discover this advancement before it could be implemented fully? Would other countries steal it? Trade for it? Bomb it out of existence as a threat to national security (at the expense of global prosperity)? Just for fun, I’ll set out my own prediction with three assumptions made:a) the source of the technological advancement is benevolent, and not limited to a single technologyb) that there is a reason this advancement is tied to a single country.c) that this advancement is not a momentary thing, immediately stolen or obliterated by a rivalLet’s imagine that Sweden creates an AI, one that didn’t want to enslave or eliminate the human race. Said AI provides Sweden with the key to amazing longevity through better medicine, cloning facilities, or whatever else this genius machine can come up with. Let’s say it also proposed solutions such as cold fusion, better solar panels, tidal turbines, all sorts of renewable energy. Robotics helps ensure the most leisurely lifestyle on the planet, while allowing the people time and energy for a new pastime - proposing new ideas to this new entity. To top it all off, Sweden invents a new sport, just because they are awesome - 3-dimensional (Aerial) Hockey. You know, with jetpacks.We’d also have to assume in this scenario that this AI has a sense of patriotism - or it would presumably share this technology freely. To what degree would this affect the focus and goals of this AI entity? Would the benevolent AI only be benevolent towards the Swedes? If so, to what extent? There would HAVE to be military improvements among the AI’s discoveries…or at the least, very real deterrents, simply because there is little chance that Russia would sit by while Sweden prosperred on every front but did not defend these advancements. Nor would the US, or China. Assuming this AI subscribed to some sort of variation of the 3 laws of robotics proposed by Aasimov, it would follow the instructions of it’s relatively peaceful Swedish masters. But as anyone who has read Stieg Larsson’s books will know, the Swedes also have some racist elements in society, as well as some real paranoia (in other words, just like the rest of the world). So…bearing all this in mind, what do I think would happen?Substitute Sweden for any progressive country in the world that would love to see aerial hockey, and this is my prediction…The problem is this supposes that whatever patriotism is encoded into the AI is trumped by the benevolence, and tempered by a controlling influence - ie, no urge to become a machine overlord, and no desire for world dominance through conquest. In other words, even the most perfect scenario for any given country with this power gifted or thrust upon them is fraught with very real danger (possibility of complete disaster), and subject to an immense number of variables.Any one of these variables could completely change the outcome, especially the most important variables of all - human nature, and the nature of the source of advancement. Human nature can corrupt the most benevolent source, particularly if it is a mechanical one - an AI is likely to be susceptible to a great degree to that most basic computing principle - garbage in, garbage out.If the source is not benevolent at all, this technological advancement is likely a trap, designed to accelerate humanity’s obliteration. This could be accomplished by providing the wrong country military superiority, or to focus on areas of advancement they were ill-equipped to safe-guard, or any number of things. A malevolent AI or long-lived alien race could play a long game, or short. In other words, my above prediction is probably pretty useless…but hey…it might be entertaining.","2,052 followers",Aaron Jantzen,1.7K,3.4K,13.8M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-a-human-civilization-developed-advanced-technologies-tens-of-thousands-of-years-ago

Conspiracy theories would proliferate: aliens helped them would be the most popular. And it’s interesting to assume that is indeed what happened for a second, and try to reason THAT one out.So, let’s say that, oh, let’s say Panama, Morocco or some other place that’s presently considered Third World (and not much in the news here) suddenly develops 24th Century tech — like in Star Trek. It would be pretty obvious to the rest of the world that beings from another planet were the most likely source of this windfall, coming out of the blue as it did. In the short term, there would be lots of sudden interest in all things related to this country, and its people (and even more so its leaders) would be flattered by some of it, repulsed by the rest, saying in effect: “Why start liking us NOW?”For the next few decades, this country might well rule the world. But that’s not a guarantee because 1) the scientific community of this nation would need to be able to quickly and accurately get up to speed, and 2) so would the rest of society, which we already know is hard, given the rapid pace of change to which we are already accustomed.Another thing we have to worry about: what is the donor civilization like, and (even more so) how about the actual group which is the source of the new technology? What were the circumstances of this sudden transfer of technology? Did they give it up willingly, or did the military-industrial complex of the earthbound nation force it out of them? Or, were the aliens trying to observe the Prime Directive when a group of, let’s say Panamanians bright enough to figure it all out stumbled onto the alien ship? You may recall a couple episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation which had just this scenario. In each case, the Enterprise was studying a local population when they were outed as aliens. In both cases, leaders on the Enterprise and locally decided it was best to put a lid on knowledge of the fact that an alien race had paid a visit.For fun, I’m going to assume decent, peaceful aliens who, nevertheless, have their own version of the Prime Directive visit Panama. Some happenstance reveals their presence to the locals, and somehow at least one very accomplished scientist just happens to be among them (yeah, right). Assuming the ability to make people forget things is not among the advanced know-how brought by the alien ship, I predict its captain will consider permanently abducting all earthlings in the know. I just said they’re a decent people (the aliens), so let’s say this idea is promptly shot down, and it’s — very reluctantly — decided that the Panamanians must be “read in” or brought up to speed on everything from warp drive to whatever, then freely allowed to continue being a full part of their Central American society.If so, this is what will happen: The aliens will schedule official press conferences (first locally, then globally) to introduce themselves and explain their presence on our planet. (Perhaps they crashed here, a la “Alien Nation”.) The military-industrial complexes of the USA, Russia and China try to mount campaigns to appropriate even more extraterrestrial swag, and are easily defeated.Now is when it gets interesting, and when we truly learn the character of the people from off-Earth. Again, just for variety’s sake, let’s assume they are kind and understanding: they will STILL be pissed at being attacked! And again, I ask you: Why are they here: is their situation more like Alien Nation or Star Trek? Let’s imagine that they have some sort of Achilles Heel we can exploit to somewhat level the playing field (like they are much smaller and weaker than we are): in that case, much of what happens next will be a study in what happens when a mighty warrior with that one little chink in his armor gets mad. If, on the other hand, they are just way beyond us in every way, I’m afraid the Earth will become a colonial setting. That is, we can look to our own history on this planet to predict that enough of the aliens will show us no mercy that it will be several hundred years — if at all — before we humans regain the upper hand.I’ll close by saying I think I know why you might have asked this question, and I hope I’m right: You may well be thinking about writing a novel with this scenario at its heart. If so, I’d urge you to try to make a real STORY of it, rather than trying to concoct a hypothetical sociological study. The usual way I’ve seen a story like this go well is: it becomes a story about its central characters, how THEY, specifically experience the events as they unfold. Pick one narrator, and you’ll be stuck with his or her perspective and sensory limits; choose to have your readers in the Godlike position of being all-knowing, and you can perhaps reveal more of the action, but you risk drifting off into utopian (or dystopian) space opera, which has been done before, and is VERY hard to pull ...",167 followers,Tim Brown,806,1.4K,1.7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-a-country-on-Earth-suddenly-gained-extremely-advanced-technology-hundreds-of-years-ahead-of-USA

For going between cities and provinces, China has a high speed rail system in place that is more extensive than the American highway system! For example: I lived in a city called Nanjing in China - about 200 miles/300 km from Shanghai. I could take a high speed train from Nanjing to Shanghai in about 1.5 hours!In contrast, I took an Amtrak train from Detroit to Chicago (about 300 miles/480 km) and it took over 8 hours!Another area China wins at is public utilities. They provide electricity, water, and gas for billions of people for very affordable prices! I paid maybe a total of $20 (US) per month for all utility bills, whereas it cost me over $100 in America! Atop of that is wireless technology (which is considered a public utility in China). I paid 100 rmb ($15) monthly for 16 GB of 4G data, with 1000 texts and 500 minutes of talk (which pretty much meant unlimited everything for me). In America I pay $50 a month for my unlimited plan. Yes, the 4G is a little faster, but that may just be because I’m not trying to access the foreign web here…A third area (kinda related to the second) is how the CCP controls markets and prices so everyone can live a comfortable life.

Sure it goes faster and is more comfortable, etc. It is still however an engine transmission body and 4 wheels powered by either gasoline or diesel (I dont count the electric car because there were also electrics around the time of the model T). The reality is that right now with a hybrid drivetrain and the simple need for basic transportation, the car should be a gas turbine engine powering a generator and three wheel reverse tryke chassis. The gas turbine can be made to run on any combustible fuel, and the tryke is light and can comfortably carry 2 people and pull a trailer for cargo. Too “revolutionary” however for widespread adoption.Then there are other technologies that are reliant on many other technologies to build it. You could hand an atomic bomb to Napoleon, but all he would have is one atomic bomb. He would not have the supporting technology to create another, the means to deliver it, or the strategic thought of how to employ it.Lastly is the airplane. Man was “flying” since at least the 1880’s in gliders. He has had the engine in one form or another since the late 1700’s. The REAL achievement of the Wright brothers was not the airplane but developing an engine with an acceptable power to weight ratio.The bottom line is that there has really not been anything “revolutionary” in the history of man. If something did come along it was dismissed because of either short sightedness or lack of “need”.

One time we were required to corrupt product that had been shipped to China and it started a major debate about our fiduciary responsibility to the country or to the customer. The issue was that if you sell a security product that you know is corrupted, you are knowingly committing fraud and are liable. As the Product Manager at the time I asked the NSA if they would stand behind us (and me as I might be personally liable) in court if we were discovered. Of course the answer from the NSA was “Hell no.”We were on our own. We then entered into a long debate about how to detect Easter eggs and other corruption introduced into security products unknowingly through another vendor’s corrupted hardware. The issue was never resolved but it should be known that our security source code HAD to be provided to the NSA in order to get FIPS certification and they made certain changes to it.So to answer your question, USA military technology is advanced far beyond anyone’s knowledge to describe the extent.On the other hand, the Chinese probably know more about our technology than we do since they perpetrated the greatest security breach in history by compromising the RSA key technology used by almost everyone in the world.

The US is already more conservative than the rest of the western world, so the philosophical shift in the US will always seem more extreme when compared to France or Australia.

It isn’t the three great killers of populations as in the past (famine, plagues, war), those have largely been reined in. No, they’re not completely removed, but deaths from famine, plagues and war are nothing compared to what they used to be. More people die from complications of surfeit than from starvation; a first for all of human history.But something is wrong.The problem has to do with our very prosperity. People think jobs are fleeing the US for China. It doesn’t help that politicians feed on this lie. But it’s not true. The US’s industrial output today is double what it was in 1985. The problem is that output is double, but it has happened with 1/3 fewer workers while the population has increased by 42%. That is really a big problem.Double the output | 33% fewer employees | 42% more people.Someone smarter at math than me (see: anybody with >5 grade math skills) can run those numbers for the true disparity. That’s the underlying problem. People with good jobs don’t give a shit about much else. Sure, they pay lip service, but give people good jobs and creature comforts, and they generally don’t give a shit. But remove those creature comforts and like any other people in the past, they look for people to blame and someone to be their hero. (Never mind that the “problem” is much more efficient production models + automation — how would they know? Nobody’s bought hours of air time each night to explain this!)This has ALWAYS been the case. Always. Period. End of discussion.Yes, people are racist, homophobic, selfish, bigoted bastards. That’s true. But people were way more selfish and bigoted in the past 100 years even while we made social progress. (And a lot has been made in 100 years). But now so much social change has happened in the past four decades + treaties that promised prosperity “just around the corner” and that never happened.That’s it. The economy. It’s always been the economy. It isn’t bigotry. It isn’t homophobia. It isn’t sexism. It isn’t dirty MexicansIt’s the economy. Fix the economy and people go back to their daily lives, complacent in how politicians behave. They won’t care so much about China or Mexicans. But remove those creature comforts, take their jobs, take their new car, take their kids’ “right” to a Disney vacation every other year, and the baser “blame everybody not like me” instinct takes over.So while I’m not denying that people are innately dick-holes, more than that, they’re desperate. They want their lives back. They want the good ol’ days where things weren’t so hard, where the factory was still in town and where the schools were decent. A lot of that is gone, and someone needs to be blamed.",17 followers,Fabius Fairchild,1.8K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-a-country-on-Earth-suddenly-gained-extremely-advanced-technology-hundreds-of-years-ahead-of-USA

With the enemy not having the ability to shoot back, guess who can concentrate SOLELY on firing and not getting shot at in return.What about this guy?Falcon is shooting Steyr SPPs, they’re shooting 9mm pistol rounds and they were pretty darn effective, not to mention that him flying means he wasn’t able to really get hit til he flew too low. You know what would be even better than one of him in the air?How about a few of these bad boys which has a standard load of up to 8 hellfire missiles and 38 70mm rockets with 1,200 rounds of 30mm ammo that would absolutely shred anything a 9mm could touch. Also since they hover, they can safely sit above their own forces and rain down hell WITHOUT flying over the enemy and risking them jumping up and getting them.Remember this guy as well?Rhodes in this image is about to drop a bunch of small cluster bombs on the enemy line, a tactic that is shown to be VERY effective in this type of close contact fight. Since he’s also in the sky the enemy is pretty much unable to attack him, since they don’t have range. Now I’m not going to say that he isn’t better armed than most weapons platforms, because I think he is, but you know what comes close?Designed to kill tanks, this thing has a 30mm gatling gun, designed for low speeds, and can drop bombs in close air support. Throw 5 of those in the air and you have some pretty nice air coverage over a small enemy line.Ok but the spears are close combat weapons, that gives them an advantage in close combat. Yea modern militaries have those they’re these things.Meet the modern day bayonet. Fun fact spears/pikes were discontinued from militaries because as soon as the bayonet was developed every rifleman became a spear man. That also meant that every range troop became a melee troop.Now Wakanda did have some cool things that would have made them more effective than modern military such as this.But you know what makes that no longer worthwhile? When you order your troops to do this.The shield wall shown above looks pretty Roman inspired (makes sense Romans did invade parts of Africa), it’s designed for you to attack the person to your right and the guy to the left to attack the man in front of you. Leading towards enemies being attacked by someone they aren’t facing. You also know why it works so well? Because the formation and everyone acting as one unit can stop a charging force dead in their tracks and essentially it’s just enemies beating against a wall. You know what makes it worthless and how Romans lost battles, when they lose the shield wall and did what you see above.The wall is so effective guess who still uses it today!Modern SWAT teams for riot control!This also doesn’t take into account modern armies using things like theseOr theseOr how about theseNow I’m not saying that battle wasn’t entertaining, because it definitely was. But what I am saying is that rushing into a group of monsters with spears that shoot FREAKING ENERGY instead of standing back behind your shield wall and shooting them til they actually get close enough to engage in melee is so dumb that Black Panther should have his crown taken away, all of his generals should lose their positions, and USAF Colonel Rhodes, and USAF Pararescue Trooper Sam Wilson, and Captain Steve Rodgers who fought in World War 2 with ground combat experience should be ashamed and feel responsible for a LOT of Wakandan deaths.The Wakanda Sonic Spear is a great idea, and is a call back to weapons that Africa is most recognized for, shields and spears. For cinematic purposes it also looks neat, but practically it’s not that great considering that aiming a spear from 100 yards away is going to be a HELL of a lot harder than aiming a rifle with a scope. It was also shown that the power wasn’t necessary against their opponents, so that didn’t really make it worthwhile either.End of the day it’s a movie and it does look cool. Reality is that an energy spear isn’t practical at all and that even if they took them throughout the world a modern army would mop the floor with them with what we’ve seen them use. We’ve seen no artillery, air support, or armored units really and quite frankly a modern military could kill their troops without Wakanda even seeing them before the bombs or artillery started dropping. This doesn’t mention at all that seeing a freaking energy blast travel through the air gives away your position pretty easily!So there’s the answer, they look cool but in reality they’re dumb. You don’t need an energy spear to kill someone when a bullet will do the job just as well.*****EDIT 1: Thank you to to everyone, this is my largest Quora answer to date and hats off to the great and respectful comments all around thank you guys.Special shoutout to Jonathan Lausch for his edit suggestions as well.EDIT 2: 1.8k upvotes wow thank you everyone!

But I believe there is a line of dialogue in Black Panther that illustrates why the Wakandan spears are actually a very good idea.In Black Panther, Killmonger is walking among some Wakandan weapons. He picks up one of their spears and says “Look at this. A spear that can stop a tank…”. These spears are powerful because they are essentially ray guns and forcefield projectors. You know the “kinetic energy redirection” blasts that Black Panther can emitAll of these answers either fall into the “there’s no good reason, it’s dumb” category or the “they are proud of their primitive roots” category.

He picks up one of their spears and says “Look at this. A spear that can stop a tank…”. These spears are powerful because they are essentially ray guns and forcefield projectors. You know the “kinetic energy redirection” blasts that Black Panther can emit? They can do that. An M1 Abrams tank weighs about 62 metric tons. It can travel at up to 45 miles per hour. If a Wakandan spear can stop a tank in, say 1/4 of a second, then that means that a Wakandan spear can exert (at least) a force of 4,990,000 newtons. That’s 1,120,000 pounds of force. You could probably crash your car at 1000 miles per hour and you wouldn’t be experiencing the same force as getting hit by this spear. This spear has 5.5x more thrust than all of a commercial airliner’s individual engines COMBINED. It has almost half the thrust of a space shuttle engine. The airplane stat implies that you could strap one of these bad boys onto a massively overloaded airplane and have absolutely no problems.This is what makes Wakanda so interesting for me. This spear is OP. If you point it downwards you could possibly blast yourself into space with one shot. In real life, a weapon like this is impossible. Newton’s Laws tell you that if someone shot a weapon this powerful, it would throw them back with an equal force. Use this to stop a tank, and you’ll get thrown back with enough force to literally catapult you miles away. Not to mention what kind of energy source this spear must be packing? And how much collateral damage it would do? But in the MCU you just say “vibranium”: and it’s all solved. Newton’s Laws? Vibranium gets to twist them so that they don’t ruin everything. A power source with unholy levels of energy density? Vibranium. As a physics student, I find this SO INCREDIBLY interesting. Vibranium doesn’t break any laws of physics, but it PERFECTLY utilizes them to seemingly do the impossible. And Wakanda has an entire mountain of it.And bringing it back to the spear: keep in mind 1) The spear might be even more powerful than this. 2) This spear is a petty low-powered weapon meant for individual soldiers on a battlefield. It is probably as powerful to Wakanda’s top weaponry as a machine gun is compared to a missile.Of course, the main advantage of this spear is its use as a long-range directed-energy weapon. Fighting in close quarters negates this, so T’Challa’s command to charge at the Outriders seems puzzling. However, given that the spears can only fire once every half second or so, it seems likely that if the Wakandan army hadn’t charged, the massive swarm of Outriders would have swarmed them immediately.But wouldn’t a gun casing be more effective? Perhaps, but keeping the weapons as spears could have more advantages. The spears still are deadly in close-quarters (they’re made of vibranium, so they can pierce almost anything and they won’t break).

The Wakandans standing behind their shield wall, repelling the alien monsters with energy rifles just isn’t as cool as them charging the monsters with energy spears.In universe the Wakandans probably aren’t very good at war. Wakanda is a small, technologically advanced, isolationist country. They’re kept safe mostly through secrecy and subterfuge. No one with a real army would attack Wakanda because (they think) there’s nothing there. Anyone with a “fake army”, such as a local warlord, can be taken out with the energy spears. Or more likely can be destroyed before they get anywhere near Wakanda.Most likely the last time the Wakandans had to get into a real war with anyone it was at a time when the spear an shield ruled the world. And they just never needed to adapt their military doctrine.This actually ties into one of the subtler themes in Black Panther and Infinity War. Wakanda’s isolationism is stifling their innovation and keeping them from using their technology to it’s full potential. Look at the Black Panther suit. It’s made from nanotechnology far more advanced then anything Iron Man has access too. It’s made of an indestructible miracle material that Tony Stark can only dream of getting his hands on.

Hitler had so much more superiority than that. We’re all gonna be so comfortable having that super-weak country right there, especially since it’s ruled by a king. A dictator.

We will probably all send great forces there to make use of all their wealth and learn from their rich culture! We shall find out all their secrets.All jokes aside, I think this is a very big reason. Wakanda is unknown to the world, right?Another reason may be their traditions. They were traditionally poor and uncivilized. Stark helped them build hi-tech weapons. They’re still honoring their tradition.(Which is a good thing.)Of course cinematic effect is also a very important issue to consider, and others have put it quite well.EDIT: Thanks for the comment! I was a bit too vague on that part about Stark. First, it’s Howard Stark, not Tony. Howard Stark once visited Wakanda, that’s where he got the Vibranium for Cap’s shield.Wakanda at that time was using very out-of-date weapons like the ax shown in the Wakanda Museum. Howard Stark helped Wakanda develop a lot of tech. It is true though, that most of the newer tech, like Black Panther’s suit, is developed by Shuri. I just wish to say that they transitioned pretty quickly, so the tradition is still vibrant with many of the Wakanda people. They have a perfect opportunity to preserve it, which is what they did.EDIT 2:I just thought of another important point. Wakanda was not designed to fight Thanos and his army. They don’t know about the Outriders. Their function is not to fight the alien army. Their function is to settle disputes they usually face and can think of. With their current equipment, they’re more than enough.(Outriders are tougher and fiercer than you might think.

Think about it for a second. Why would the Wakandans actually need machine gun emplacements or mortar launchers? They live in a kingdom that has been hidden from the world for centuries. Their culture is very traditional and they have been peacefully ruled by a long line of kings who have each had superhuman abilities. Their nation is generally prosperous and safe. They have never needed to build cluster bombs and machine guns to defend themselves, and they certainly wouldn’t buy them from the outside world, since it might draw unwanted attention to them.So I think the Wakandans were caught unprepared. Think about it, and you should realize that they are using their traditional tactics and traditional weapons because they’ve never actually lost a battle within the lifetime of any living Wakandan, I’m not sure if they’ve actually fought a battle, other than the one in Black Panther. Also, because they’ve been a peaceful society for generations, and they were generally considered too poor to be a worthwhile target, and they used assassination and espionage to distract or disable opponents before they could even begin an invasion, they have had virtually no need for an army at all, and they never prepared to face an actual invasion. So the Wakandan warriors are using Vibranium spears because they have trained in the use of Vibranium spears, it’s what they know and what they have.In the end, the Wakandans had more interest in ceremonial combats than they had in mass destruction, so it should be no surprise that their tactics and weapons reflect their interests and history.Also, as many people pointed, even though I think it’s entirely plausible that they would fight this way, anyway, the choice to have them use these weapons and these tactics would be heavily influenced by the expected visual appeal of the action sequences.

Patience, math and pissing yourself isn’t exactly what I would consider skill based. To hit a target you need to be able to see, control your breathing—yadda yadda, you get my point.

The Wakandans also had those shields which meant that they couldn't be easily harmed by enemies that were far away. As a result, unless someone like Thor showed up that the battle would be won or lost based on hand to hand combat. And in this case, energy spears were effective weapons.I don't know why people are willing to buy into so many things that don't seem logical but are cool and then decide that the strategy and tactics of the Wakanda army require some advanced level of scrutiny.The context of the battle is that Wakanda was the safest place on earth and that their army and whatever tactics they used would be the earth's best bet. There are a ton of things that are true in the MCU that are not true in real life.

Also I never really like these questions as it fails to take into account the affects it will have on present day, such effecting what happened in the past, which will change everything, but just for fun.There is a lot missing in this question, so let’s set some of our own rules.*We will ignore all the problems this has with pretty Much every time travel theory, I.e. the win In ww2 with modern military results in nuclear war, thus killing the planet, thus making the said time Travel impossible because no one survived until then, we will ignore all that.*The entire military and leadership from 1940 still remains, they aren’t replaced and killed, I.e. we still have Roosevelt present and all military commanders there, with the addition of of present day military leaders.*The past military still remains, as was, if they all disappeared this would cause many problems I’d rather not delve into, bases are still there ships Troops everything.*The millinery doesn’t have time to prepare, but know what’s gonna happen, if they had time to prepare this would be totally different.Alright that’s enough rules let’s get into this.2019 U.S. Military is transported to 1940Alright, so assuming the U.S. military is as is today is magically sent over, there, let’s first go over some issues we would have.Issues*You said military, I’d assume this means military personnel only, not any civilian contractors or workers, that is an issue but it can be solved fairly fast*We don’t have the industry we have in modern times, I.e. certain things we need would not even exist yet, or would need to be ranked up massively, this would take ALOT of time but could be sped up when you define entire military more.*Weapons and munitions and parts production for literally everything they use is not there,*Theres a plethora of more problems but let’s continue for the sake of funWhat would immediately happenSo as soon as the world sees this massive force suddenly appear, literally the largest and most powerful military coming out of nowhere everyone would be scared and confused, even America themselves. So communication was not so far advanced then and would have compatibility issues with modern stuff but immediately the navy, that’s the way I’ll assume they all got there, I.e. the navy sails in through some magical Quora Portal with literally thousands of transport ships containing the Army, Marines, Navy, Airforce, coast guard, national guard, reserves, everything and all that is involved with it[Alright, so now these thousands of ships are here through this portal and spend 3 years in a traffic jam trying to figure out where the fuck they all are going to port at and unload….oh okay fine some more magic at play and they are unloaded around the U.S.In the U.S.At first the president is briefed on a possible Alien invasion or Nazi super project, but then it turns into a discussion of American ships asking to speak to him, the military leaders of each branch marines, navy, Air Force, etc all are led to have a meeting with him, they are there in hours as they take a helicopter to get there (runways and airports weren’t exactly trustworthy especially for jet planes or larger aircraft) there they brief him on, well, everything, who they are what the future entails how the war ends up, but he’s just confused as is the rest of the world. Finally they get to the discussion to end this war as soon as possible so they can go home. They send a fighter group containing F-22s and transport aircraft, a tanker, and F-35S in case of ground resistance to Germany, there they ask for a diplomatic meeting either in a neutral area or in Germany, but most likely an Aircraft Carrier will be put into position and helicopters will take Hitler or other German leadership to it to discuss things. Hitler would usually refuse but the fact that the Americans apparently have an advanced alien race on there side, he sure as shit agrees, here it is layed out that he is to surrender under the listed terms, or face literal annihilation. He would certainly agree, Hitler wasn’t a complete idiot. However he is stubborn, let’s say he doesn’t agree and true to diplomatic relations he is taken back to Germany. While the rest of the military is still setting up, the navy and Air Force gets to work, being careful to use resources carefully as the Army and civilian market is setting up factory’s to produce important things needed for the new military, this will take awhile but as they brought thousands of ships the have a lot of resources in storage. Quite simply they start by eradicating all of the German navy, this doesn’t take long there out of date AA system stands no chance of doing much of anything against the jet fighters and certainly nothing against missiles and torpedoes. The navy is destroyed within a week and some stragglers are all the remains, much of the air force was destroyed at this point and Germany’s military is mass surrendering to the Allys as they realize they are at the biggest disadvantage literally in history. They still get lucky and end up doing some small damage to the modern military some lucky submarines could still do a lot of damage and low flying aircraft could be harmed by AA fire. At this point they start there bobbing runs, they Bonn virtually anything military related in Germany and try or avoid civilian targets, there’s no need for it in this timeline, also there is precision munitions at this point. At this point if they didn’t already surrender, there would undoubtedly be a Coup and Hitler would be out of power and the new government would immediately ask for the privilege to surrender, the US would accept and that’s be the war. Japan would be a similar situation if Pearl Harbor happened already or not, if not there would be no war if so it would go the same way. The us would most likely help China against Japan. At that point there’s no telling what In he’ll could happen, either the military could disappear back to the modern time or through some weird events the US declares war on Russia and avoid the Cold War entirely. Or under a ridiculous scenario the US could declare war on the whole damn world after a few years of development of industry and would quite likely have a fair damn chance of taking over the world, but I doubt that would happen.AlrightCertainly my most unrealistic question answered but it seemed like a fun question and it gives me something to link when I see more of these",0 followers,Michael Wardell,705,9.7K,3.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-a-human-civilization-developed-advanced-technologies-tens-of-thousands-of-years-ago

39,"Maya technology was not drastically out of step with the development of comparable cultures elsewhere — that is to say, while the Maya shone in certain areas such as architecture, writing, mathematics, and the calendar, I don’t think we could characterize their civilization as atypically advanced in most respects.

They were essentially a late-Neolithic people (though that term is not normally applied to the indigenous cultures of the Americas).The Maya employed neither the wheel nor pack animals, relying entirely on human labor and transport. The coastal Maya were adept sailors, however, and this was a lucrative enterprise as coastal sea-lanes facilitated the trade of goods throughout the region, being far easier than overland routes through the mountainous jungles and fetid swamps. They also produced and distributed sea salt, described by one Spaniard as the finest he’d ever seen, and of course fish, which were caught in nets, speared, or even shot with arrows. (Inland, a common and interesting method of river fishing involved damming up creeks and then drugging the fish with soporifics.)Agriculture was conducted largely according to a slash-and-burn routine; this incredibly destructive practice likely contributed to the Postclassic decline of Maya urbanity. Likewise the production of the plaster used to coat and treat the great stone temples of cities like Calakmul, Palenque, or Mayapan was resource-intensive and, in a word, wasteful. The considerable technological and social achievements of the culture were paired with a relatively poor understanding of ecology. The concern was continual expansion, not sustainability at scale.Maya weaponry for hunting and warfare consisted mostly of stone, obsidian, and copper knives and projectiles. Iron working is documented only after the arrival of European colonists. Metallurgy came late to the Maya and was primarily concerned with the manufacture of jewelry and trinkets rather than tools.They were practiced stonemasons and potters, of course, and made use of tree resins like copal and rubber. They also grew and dealt in cotton, which they wove into cloth and dyed. Woodcarving was a common pastime and an art form.The great Maya cities were not meticulously planned, but rather grew in a somewhat haphazard fashion over time. Most commonly they were located on elevated ground for visibility and defense, but they were seldom walled. A central great plaza was dominated by massive, brightly painted and richly carved step-pyramid temples, which were funerary monuments (as in Egypt) but were also used for important public rituals, especially human and animal sacrifice. This space was the territory of the city’s ruling family. The central plaza might be surrounded by other smaller plazas belonging to lesser nobility, and then the residential sprawl expanded outward from there. Most common dwellings in the cities and villages were of thatch construction, with spontaneous combustion an occasional concern in the intense Mesoamerican sunshine. Middle-class homes usually featured their own private fruit and vegetable gardens, though large-scale crop cultivation was done on a communal basis outside of town. At least one city, Palenque, boasted rudimentary plumbing through which the flow and pressure of water could be controlled via a network of conduits and cisterns.One notable technological development was the use of a null marker and thus a positional numeral system far more elegant than that of, say, the Romans; it is still debated whether this was a Maya invention or an inheritance from an earlier culture like the Olmec, though the former is considered more likely by modern scholarship. The number system was vigesimal (base-20), with the places increasing in value vertically from bottom to top rather than horizontally from right to left as is our custom. Numbers were written with lines and dots, which may represent tally sticks and stones, while zero was notated with a shell symbol. Winik, the Maya word for twenty, was also the word for “person,” probably a reference to the twenty digits of the hands and feet.The Maya calendar is notoriously exacting and complex, capable of recording and analyzing dates across a very wide range. They were fine astrologers and proto-astronomers, understanding the 365-day solar year and the lunar cycle as well as the precise per...","62,882 followers",Jay Bazzinotti,3.9K,22.2K,179.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-a-human-civilization-developed-advanced-technologies-tens-of-thousands-of-years-ago
