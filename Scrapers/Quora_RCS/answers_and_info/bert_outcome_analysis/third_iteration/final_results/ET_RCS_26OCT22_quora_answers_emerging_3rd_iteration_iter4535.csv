0,"Which country threatens to disturb American foreign policy most severely?With their wild swings from rationality and pragmatism to flights of fantasy and dictator hero worshipping, I would have to say that the biggest threat to American foreign policy is the USA.","17,165 followers",Pascal Morimacil,700,4.3K,34.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-can-American-foreign-policy-address-the-need-for-technology-transfer-to-African-countries-to-enhance-their-engagement-with-the-US-in-global-value-chains
1,"The problem is Africa is dysfunctional. Transferring technology will not help. Anyone in Africa who has an opportunity leaves Africa for the western world where there is law and order and opportunity. None of which Africa possesses. Thousands of Africans are trained or educated in European and American universities to become Doctors, Nurses, engineers in Africa but most choose not to return to Africa but to stay in the west because life in Africa is a dead end.",UNKNOWN,Ke'Aun,518,1K,21.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-can-American-foreign-policy-address-the-need-for-technology-transfer-to-African-countries-to-enhance-their-engagement-with-the-US-in-global-value-chains
2,"Like the vast majority of “Why” questions on Quora, this one is complete nonsense because it is based on a false premise. This question is the same as asking “Why isn’t water wet” or “Why are all cars green” — when your premise is false, there is simply no “why” to it.Anyone who thinks that drones are somehow “worse” than other methods of warfare can probably provide some nonsense reason based on their own misunderstanding of the technology and some imagined moral superiority that they know better than anyone else.","2,320 followers",Akram Odaily,1.7K,889,16M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-can-American-foreign-policy-address-the-need-for-technology-transfer-to-African-countries-to-enhance-their-engagement-with-the-US-in-global-value-chains
3,"“Drone” is here being used as shorthand for Remotely Piloted Vehicle. The history of RPV’s is almost as old as flight, the first ones being made during WW1. The term “drone” probably derives from the use of the De Havilland Queen Bee as an aerial target in the mid-30’s, to train AA gun crews.So, “The recent rise in the use of small drone rotorcraft is due to the availability of releatively high energy density batteries, able to give an acceptable flight duration without the noise, weight and smell of an IC engine. Their VTOL capability means they need no gr“Drone” is here being used as shorthand for Remotely Piloted Vehicle. The history of RPV’s is almost as old as flight, the first ones being made during WW1.

Their VTOL capability means they need no ground facilities such as a runway or a catapult that drone aircraft do.Given a certain amount of fuel, and aeroplane can stay airborne a lot longer than a rotorcraft, lift more weight and go further.","1,628 followers",Jack Spektor,1.7K,2K,6.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-can-American-foreign-policy-address-the-need-for-technology-transfer-to-African-countries-to-enhance-their-engagement-with-the-US-in-global-value-chains
4,"That’s counterproductive.You should work in a way that is sustainable.The problem is… you can’t know till it is done exactly how long a software development task will take. Sometimes they take months or years.So, when you’ve done your time for the day… go do something else, and come back to it the next day.Otherwise, you’ll burn yourself out.","8,323 followers",Jeff Meyerson,682,340,2.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-can-American-foreign-policy-address-the-need-for-technology-transfer-to-African-countries-to-enhance-their-engagement-with-the-US-in-global-value-chains
5,"Eric Drexler looked into this in his famous PhD thesis at MIT and found that it sucks.Biological life reproduces itself on a cellular level. For a human technology this is an insane requirement, and achieving it has a high price -weaker mechanical strength, and lower speed.Drexler lays down the physical limits of nanomachines in terms of strength and throughput and finds they are all orders of magnitude higher than biological life.This was 1985, and since then Nanotechnology has become a top research priority, but the results are underwhelming, in particular when research is factored out thatEric Drexler looked into this in his famous PhD thesis at MIT and found that it sucks.Biological life reproduces itself on a cellular level.
