2,"Chinese factories produce goods based on their clients’ specifications. Each order of a certain item come with its own quality specifications which defined by client. Higher quality goods are more costly to make, which in turn increase the retail price. Lower quality goods are cheaper to make, which in turn (sometimes) reduce retail price.The impression that “Made in China"" means cheap stuff because Chinese can't make good stuff is very unfair to us.

If you go to a Chinese factory you tell them what you want and they build it.If you want stuff that works, they will build stuff that works but they will charge you more. If you want cheap crap they will quote you a price for cheap crap.It turns out that if you want to make high quality goods you have to brand it as high quality. So Apple goes to a Chinese factory, pays a little extra for quality and then makes a ton of money with branding.It turns out that Chinese companies looked at thus and said heeeeeyyyy we want to make the extra cash from hiBecause Chinese factories make things to spec.

Huawei tried this. It was wildly successful, but then the US got annoyed and put sanctions on Huawei.So yeah, China wants to get out of the cheap crap business. However the moment it goes into the high quality business (because China is already making the stuff anyway) the US freaks out and imposes sanctions.The trouble is that if you can build high quality toasters and smart phones then you can build high quality hypersonic missiles and unmanned fighter jets. So the US is trying its hardest to keep China in the cheap crap business but China is pushing back.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-technology-products-produced-in-China

While we can go quite deep quite briefly, we can’t easily get down to the deep ocean floor, let alone the bottom of the Marianas Trench, nor stay there for weeks or years. Underwater habitats, mining colonies, research labs etc. looked like we were going to have in the 1960’s and rapidly advancing from that point to thousands of people living underwater by now so lots of frontier left there.Going really small on anything continues to open new frontiers (nanomaterials, nanotechnologies, biomimicry of insects, subatomic particles, anti-matter, genome analysis, molecular biology, genetic engineering, computer coding, tissue printing, quantum computing, etc.).Going really large we still have very partial understandings of ecosystems, hydrogeology, geology…especially miles deep or in space, weather systems and climates both micro and macro, satellite imagery and new sensors surprise more than they confirm old guesses, all of the other planets and moons in our solar system continue to surprise us while we’ve barely been there at all, much of the insect and sealife is mostly unknown to us as are how plants interact with each other and their environments, what our galaxy is really like let alone what the neighboring galaxies are like or what the nearest stars’ planets are like.How much we know about how the human brain works has been estimated to be doubling ever 5 years since the 1960’s while new tools like MRI’s, CT Scanners, etc. keep opening up new frontiers and destroying old models.There are a lot of frontiers that seem pretty thoroughly explored in entertainment, maybe that’s why it often seems we’re at “the end of history”.","135,506 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.5M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-technology-products-produced-in-China
