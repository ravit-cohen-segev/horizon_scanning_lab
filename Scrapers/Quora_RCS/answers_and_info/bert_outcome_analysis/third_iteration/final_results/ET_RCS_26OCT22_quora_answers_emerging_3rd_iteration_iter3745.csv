We went to doctor after doctor telling them this but blood pressure was fine, no diabetes, etc so they wouldn’t do anything for us. Finally found a doctor who would listen and had some mold and parasite tests done and we are off the charts infected. We went from not having the energy to walk more than a mile to being able to go on ten mile long hikes in less than a year.Modern healthcare was designed to keep us from dying, not to help us live.

We're a tiny, insignificant part of the blue dot, which is a tiny insignificant part of our galaxy.Oh, and there areSome people aren't good at comprehending how big a billion is, so try this: If you have just $1, you are much closer to Bill Gates' net worth ($50 billion) than this galaxy is to the number of total galaxies. Or: if you go on a diet and a lose 10 lbs, then your weight loss has impacted the world population's total weight (the sum of everyone's weight) more than this galaxy impacts the total number of galaxies [3].Did you get all that? Our solar system is 0.01% of the area of the blue dot. The blue dot is 0.0004% of the area of our galaxy. And there are 100+ billion galaxies out there.That is a staggeringly large number, and our solar system is staggeringly insignificant.What's this got to do with life on other planets?If you think some deities created life on Earth, then that's fine for you to believe that. In that case, anything could have happened. These deities could have chosen to not create life elsewhere. I'm not sure why they would have done that but, hey, who am I to judge what gods do?If you think that deities did not play a part in life on Earth, then read on.Life happened once, at least, by pure random chance. We know that. The only question is: did it happen a second, or a third, or more times?Consider what it would mean for there to beIt just doesn't make sense for life to happen, but to only happen once. The universe is too big -- and we haven't even ruled out other life in ourIf creating life were ""easy"" enough to happen once by random chance, then, in all likelihood, it is probable enough to happen many, many times. Because the universe is just that big.What would life on other planets look like?Remember that, even here on earth, life takes on many forms. We have life that is totally underwater. Life that flies. Life that is intelligent. Life that isn't. Life that lives on top of mountains. Life that lives with virtually no water.A planet might well need a star to support life, but it does not need to look quite like earth. Its lifeforms, therefore, may look quite a bit different.There are likely lifeforms a great deal more advanced than us and a great deal less advanced. Remember that the universe has been around for 13.8 billion years, the earth for 4.6 billion years, and life on earth for 3.6 billion years. Humans have been around for 200,000 years, but it was only 10,000 years ago that agriculture -- arguably the start of ""modern civilization"" -- began. 10,000 years isWith all that said, we might never discover those other lifeforms. Yes, there is almost certainly other life out there. But close enough to reach? We don't know. Look at that picture and remember that traveling at the speed of light (something humans can't do) for hundreds of years would only allow us to explore a tiny, tiny portion of our galaxy -- and that might not be enough to find life.Frankly, if you ask me, we're probably best off not encountering other intelligent life. The benefits are intellectual, maybe some science advancement, and other ""neat"" things. But the risks if the life we find is more advanced than us? Massive -- just ask any civilization on earth that encountered more advanced cultures. Would any say that they're the better for it?Of course, we have little choice in the matter. It's the more advanced cultures that tend to discover the less advanced cultures, since it's advancement that offers the ability for exploration. If we encounter other lifeforms that are more advanced, they likely found us. Let's just hope it goes well.[1] The equation of the area of a circle is pi * r^2. The(And, yes, our galaxy is closer to a disk-shape than a sphere.)[2] The radius of the blue dot is 100 light years and the radius of the Milky Way is 50,000. So the ratio of areas is: (pi * 100^2) / (pi * 50000^2) =[3] Assume an average weight of 150 lbs / person and 6 billion people, then the world's population weighs 150 lbs * 6 billion. 10 lbs / (150 * 6 billion) > 1 / (100 billion).[4] By ""head start"", I don't mean that life beginning 50,000 years earlier literally puts you 50,000 years ahead of earth. Evolution is not that linear and direct. The point is that what's a ""rounding error"" in the lifespan of a planet makes a world of difference in the development of its lifeforms.",0 followers,Jeff Mwangi,1.7K,182,4.2M,2014,https://www.quora.com/How-long-do-you-think-it-will-take-at-the-rate-of-advancing-technology-to-stop-human-aging
