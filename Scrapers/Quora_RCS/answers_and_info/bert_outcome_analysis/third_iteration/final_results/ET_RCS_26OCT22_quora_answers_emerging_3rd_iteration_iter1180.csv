0,"If we are talking in the world of computer technology, this may be sooner than we think. As computer resistors become smaller, we begin to run into the issue of quantum tunneling. Im not going to act like I understand this concept super thoroughly, but essentially this issue seems to arise smaller than the 3nm range. In the best consumer computer processors we have already hit 5nm and smaller. So we are quickly approaching this threshold. Computer technology won’t stop progressing, but unconventional solutions may need to be used to fix this problem.If we can’t have smaller transistors, then hIf we are talking in the world of computer technology, this may be sooner than we think.

In the best consumer computer processors we have already hit 5nm and smaller. So we are quickly approaching this threshold. Computer technology won’t stop progressing, but unconventional solutions may need to be used to fix this problem.If we can’t have smaller transistors, then have more transistors, but that means bigger processor sizes and with that more power draw, and better cooling requirements.At the very least this may mean that in the very near future, instead of computer devices getting smaller, they may actually become bigger, to accommodate for more power and cooling needs. We may even reach a point where consumer computers become extremely large like it was during the dawn of computer technology. Only time will tell though.I encourage you if you are interested in the computer technology space to do some research on quantum tunneling its a very interesting concept!",4 followers,Leon Brennan,24.9K,693,21.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-reach-its-peak-in-the-next-century

7,"SearchI think it's clear that search is poised for major change.  Call it semantic web, call it the next Facebook, call it whatever you want; what's changed is that content is now more meaningful and given greater context -- local, deeply individualized context.Google has attempted this to some degree by licensing content from providers of niche sites, but that still caters to Google's algorithmic way of determining what's right for you.  What GroupOn and similar sites have shown is that there is not only a huge appetite for deep discounts on everyday things, but that there's a huge appetiteSearchI think it's clear that search is poised for major change.

What GroupOn and similar sites have shown is that there is not only a huge appetite for deep discounts on everyday things, but that there's a huge appetite for the long tail of the market to reach their audiences.The early innovations of the internet allowed everyone to have a voice.  Whether it was Geocities or similar, everyone had an outlet.  The trouble was, on one could find it.  Google made sure that everyone that had a voice also had a path to having it heard, but that begins to break down because of one simple reason: Content.With so many silos of data, there's still a huge opportunity to bring this information online and make it accessible.  GroupOn has shown how to Healthcare has huge swaths of data in a silo that still remains largely offline.Perhaps search is the wrong word.  Perhaps search as we know it is out the door and will make way for the next manner in which we think about search.  I think one thing is certain though: As more of the long tail becomes accessible, there will be a greater need to provide guidance for users to find this information, shaped by an increasingly more personal context.

8,"Three letters and two words : N.F.C and Augmented Reality : Either this year or the following you will see a deeper convergence of the digital world and the real world. NFC allowing mobile devices to seamlessly exchange data will give rise to various innovative applications that will effect everything from LBS apps to payment methods. As for Augmented Reality, the gamification potential or value added content aspects may drive a gold rush to innovate in the space... thats all that came to my mind but then again none of us have crystal balls so who knows","118,717 followers",Kalpit Veerwal,920,357,22.6M,2012,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-exciting-technology-presently-being-developed-that-we-can-expect-to-become-widely-available-in-the-next-ten-years
9,"The first obvious observation is consolidation. As the industry peaks and smaller daily deals websites find it difficult to find sustainability they will no doubt be acquired by larger players.Second, I envisage these larger players such as Groupon and LivingSocial will seek to reduce their huge sales forces – ultimately pushing the responsibility of deal sourcing onto the vendors themselves through a self submission service. This will increase their longevity – the sales force is very expensive and simply not needed.Third (and perhaps most interesting) I think the industry is heading toward aThe first obvious observation is consolidation.

This will increase their longevity – the sales force is very expensive and simply not needed.Third (and perhaps most interesting) I think the industry is heading toward an environment in which deals are pushed to users through locational services and paid for via NFC technology/Smartphones. No other player is better placed for this than Google, it has all of its pawns placed excellently. Firstly, it has its own deals offering. Secondly, it has the locational service. Third, it is starting to roll out its NFC powered digital wallet for the payments. Fourth, it has Google+ through which it can leverage friend recommendations.The last prediction actually brings Square into the equation – in response to the strategy that I foresee Google rolling out, Groupon will seek to equip itself with the needed technology to compete. Thus, perhaps Groupon will try to acquire Square.Source (blog post I wrote about this a while ago):  http://scotttaylor.eu/grpn-daily-deals-whats-next/","49,867 followers",Dave McClure,7.7K,226,2M,2012,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-exciting-technology-presently-being-developed-that-we-can-expect-to-become-widely-available-in-the-next-ten-years
