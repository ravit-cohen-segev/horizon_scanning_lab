Think about what people will want in future. We all know right now EVs renewable energy is the future but we still are not investing in it. It doesn't matter if you buy 1stock or 10. What's important is that you're thinking, what can actually happen in future and then selecting those particular stocks. It doesn't matter if you're wrong or right just keep your stock selection that way and work in small quantity if it's a penny stock.P.s.2- I will still suggest to avoid penny stocks. Go with the market leaders when they are available at lower prices. You can easily get 20‚Äì40% returns in a year which is more than enough. Don't be greedy, good things take time. Also you can always check my profile and see the performance of the stocks I recommended in past.

I am only writing the basic rules that will help you to mine crypto-currencies successfully. Let discuss it with the help of Bitcoin.Bitcoin Mining Profitability FactorsHardware CostsThe most obvious expense in Bitcoin mining is mining hardware. Better, newer miners will cost more, so if you‚Äôre serious about investing in Bitcoin mining then aim for efficiency (more below). In addition to a Bitcoin miner, you may need extra cables, power supplies, software, and cooling fans.EfficiencyA bitcMining crypto-currency is not profitable at all. There are more than 1300 plus crypto-currencies present. I am only writing the basic rules that will help you to mine crypto-currencies successfully. Let discuss it with the help of Bitcoin.Bitcoin Mining Profitability FactorsHardware CostsThe most obvious expense in Bitcoin mining is mining hardware. Better, newer miners will cost more, so if you‚Äôre serious about investing in Bitcoin mining then aim for efficiency (more below). In addition to a Bitcoin miner, you may need extra cables, power supplies, software, and cooling fans.EfficiencyA bitcoin miner‚Äôs job is to convert electricity into hash power. Miners that do this using the least amount of electricity per hash are the most efficient. The Antminer S9, Antminer S7, for example, converts electricity to hash power at 0.25 W/Gh. The SP20 Jackson, a popular miner by Spondoolies Tech, converts at 0.65 w/Gh.Electricity costs vary by location, but this means that an Antminer S7 run in the same place as an SP20 converts electricity nearly three times more efficiently. It‚Äôs important to compare both hardware prices and efficiency when purchasing a miner.ElectricityMiners with low electricity costs have an advantage, as monthly costs are much lower. Venezuela‚Äôs government has implemented price controls, which has created some of the lowest electricity prices in the world. According to an article from Bitcoin Magazine, a 320 kw electric bill cost just 6 cents. About 1,000 people mine Bitcoin full time in Venezuela.The situation in Venezuela is an extreme example, but shows how cheap electricity effects mining profitability.DifficultyBitcoin mining difficulty measures how difficult it is to find a new block. Assuming a stable Bitcoin price and no change in your hash rate, expect your earnings to decrease as difficulty increases. If difficulty were to decrease with a stable Bitcoin price, your profitability would increase.When taking difficulty into account, note that:To understand Bitcoin difficulty in details see my blog :Bitcoin PriceEarly Bitcoin miners were able to gather thousands of Bitcoin. At the time, however, one bitcoin wasn‚Äôt worth one penny. Bitcoin‚Äôs price, or the purchasing power of one bitcoin, must be considered. A sharp drop in price can turn slightly profitable miners unprofitable very quickly. Price changes are factor, but it often makes more sense to simply purchase bitcoins if your goal is Bitcoin price speculation.Block RewardBitcoin‚Äôs block reward halves every 210,000 blocks. Assuming the Bitcoin price remains the same, each block halving cuts miners‚Äô profits in half. Even though block reward halvings are known events with expected dates, it can still have effects on the market and price of Bitcoin.Location and WeatherMining farms in hot areas will overheat and require large amounts of cooling fans. There have been fires at mining warehouses created by the excess heat. It is much easier to run a mining farm in cool areas. The heat generated from miners can even be used in place of regular heating to cut costs.DowntimeLarge mining operations have employees working 24/7 to ensure that all hardware is working properly. A few hours offline could be the difference between thousands of dollars in profits.Now that you understand the many factors that will affect your mining profitability, plug in some numbers to any Bitcoin mining calculator. Multiple calculators should be used to get the most accurate data.

A solid example is the Coinstarhaven company (www.coinstarhaven,com), a company i invest my cryptocurrencies with that pays me double my invested amounts in 7 days of investmentThe early days of Bitcoin mining are often described as a gold rush.Satoshi Nakomoto‚Äôs invention of Bitcoin, ‚Äúa peer-to-peer electronic cash system,‚Äù opened up an entirely new frontier, not just of freedom but of occasionally outrageous profits.Those with a strong interest in such things, namely cypherpunks, cryptographers, technically-minded libertarians and assorted hackers, were first to stake their claim.But is there still gold in them thar hills?The fact is:Bitcoin mining has grown from a handful of early enthusiasts into a cottage industry, into a specialized industrial-level venture. The easy money was scooped out a long time ago and what remains is buried under the cryptographic equivalent of tons of hard rock.The sad truth is:Only those with specialised, high-powered machinery are able to profitably extract bitcoins nowadays. While mining is still technicallyIn other words, mining won‚Äôt beWe‚Äôll explain this situation in depth but first, you need to know a few basic technical terms from the world of Bitcoin mining:Block:A group of Bitcoin transactions, chosen fromA new block is created on average every ten minutes.Proof of Work Hashing:This is the cryptographic work which miners perform in order to find the solution which allows them to define a new block.PoW hashing ensures the proper function of the Bitcoin blockchain. Miners compete to solve a cryptographic ‚Äúpuzzle,‚Äù known as aThere are no shortcuts in this process, which can only be solved with raw computational power.By correctly hashing the current block, minersBlock Reward:The number of newly-created bitcoins, awarded to whichever miner creates a block.This number was initially set to 50, halved to 25 in late-2012, and halved again to 12.5 in mid-2016. The next halving event expected is around mid-2020.This halving process will continue in this fashion, halving the block reward approximately every four years / 210,000 blocks, until all 21 million bitcoins are created.Achieving the block reward is the only valid way in which new bitcoins can be created; by miners according to the code‚Äôs rate and limit.Hashrate:Hashrate is the measure of a miner‚Äôs computational power.The higher their relative power, the more solutions (and hence, block rewards) a miner is likely to find.Initially measured in hash per second (In early 2017, Bitcoin‚Äôs collective hashrate reached nearly 4 Exahash. This represents a tremendous investment into mining hardware, the R&D of such hardware, and electrical expenditure.Difficulty:With hashrate shooting up over the years, it would seem blocks would be found by miners ever more rapidly.Bitcoin‚Äôs Difficulty measure is what prevents this from happening. It adjusts to hashrate to ensure that blocks are found roughly every 10 minutes.Note how closely Difficulty matches Hashrate in the 2 charts above.When total hashrate rises, the Difficulty of POW hashing adjusts upwards ‚Äì and the inverse also applies.Difficulty auto-adjusts every two weeks (or 2016 blocks).BTC / XBT exchange rate:The current fiat price of Bitcoin is critical for calculating profitabilityW/xHash/s:Watts per hashrate per second. Electricity is the major on-going cost of Bitcoin mining. The price paid per Watt will greatly influence profitability.Mining Pool:Unless you command a tremendous hashrate, your odds of solving a block by yourself (i.e. ‚Äúsolo-mining‚Äù) are extremely low.By banding together with other miners in a so-called pool, your combined odds of solving a block rise proportional to the pool‚Äôs total hashrate.Whenever they solve blocks, pools reward individual miners according to their contributed hashrate (minus commissions and the like).Calculating Mining ProfitabilityWith these terms in mind, it‚Äôs possible to calculate the current profitability (circa March 2017) of Bitcoin mining for your circumstances.Note:TheThis is due to the ever-changing nature of the Difficulty modifier and the BTC price, in particular.To begin, we must select a suitable ASIC mining rig. To aid in selection, the Bitcoin Wiki provides a handy mining hardware comparison:Although Bitcoin Wiki doesn‚Äôt list many models as currently shipping on from their manufacturers, all these mining rigs (and more) are available for resale as new or used.The Bitmain AntMiner S9 is a modern mining rig which offers a good hashrate for its power consumption.It‚Äôs pretty much the cutting edge of mining tech so we‚Äôll select it for our example.The S9 is available for roughly $1800 up to $2400 from Amazon, or about $1365 from BitMain, shipping excluded. Power supply units will add another $120 or so to the price.Next, we need to enter the S9‚Äôs specs and cost, as well as other info such as power cost and pool fees, into a suitable number-cruncher.Cryptocurrency Mining vs. Bitcoin Mining Profitability offers a good mining profitability calculator, which automatically fills in the currentScenario 1: Big Chinese MinersWe are using the defaultTo determine your own power cost, check worldwide electricity prices or your utility bill for the exact price.The 0%Once all the necessary info is entered, hitAn excellent result! At this rate, the S9 unit would pay for itself within a year as well as make about $600 in profit! As a large miner would be able to negotiate a lower unit price on each S9, we can assume they‚Äôll research profit even sooner.Scenario 2: An American Hobby MinerBefore getting too excited about your potential mining profits, let‚Äôs recalculate them using the average residential power cost per kWh in the USA (~12.5c) and a typical pool fee of 1%.The result:It‚Äôs not looking so great now.At a Bitcoin price around $1150, it appears that the average American home miner makes only $1348 a year, assuming difficulty and price hold steady. In other words, the unit will pay for itself within a year.However:This is a dangerous assumption! Bitcoin‚Äôs total hashrate ‚Äì and thus its difficulty, has been consistently rising since the early years, sometimes jumping by double digit percentages within a month!Therefore, any calculations should be regarded skeptically, as likely best-case scenarios.Sources ofDifficulty Spikes, Price Crashes, Equipment Failures, Power Cuts, Shipping Delays & More!Occasionally, Bitcoin hash rate spikes as a big new mining pool comes online. This happened in early 2016:It‚Äôs quite possible that even some big, corporate miners found their profit margins under threat from the resulting steep spike in competition. Indeed, in mid-2016, Swedish Bitcoin mining firm KnCMiner declares BankruptcyThe home miner really has no chance to compete in such a challenging environment, unless they have access to free or extremely low-cost electricity‚Ä¶Also bear in mind that the rate of obsolescence in Bitcoin mining hardware is quite fast! New, more efficient mining hardware may be released at any time, although we are reaching the technological limits of improved efficiencies.If pre-ordering any such equipment, be aware that potential manufacturing, shipping, customs or other delays could end up being very costly as difficulty rises or price falls during the interim.There are plenty of other things which can wrong, for example:Such downside risks must always be factored into any sound business plan.ConclusionThe average home miner will struggle to be profitable or recoup the cost of mining hardware and electricity, especially with the Bitcoin downward price trendProfitability is highly unlikely given the current circumstances.The situation may improve in future once ASIC mining hardware innovation reaches the point of diminishing returns.That, coupled with cheap, hopefully sustainable power solutions may once again make Bitcoin mining profitable to small individual miners around the world.This would also greatly improve the decentralization of the Bitcoin network, hardening it against legislative risk.",2 followers,Kelly Pearson,1.7K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-penny-stocks-to-invest-in-before-2021
