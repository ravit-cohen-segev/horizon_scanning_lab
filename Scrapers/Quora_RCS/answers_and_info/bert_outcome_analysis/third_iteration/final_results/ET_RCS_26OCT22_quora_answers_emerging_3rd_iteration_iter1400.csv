We don’t need a “rapture” like technological singularity, indeed I have see this described as a “mundane singularity”. Rather than intelligent countertops (to use a silly example), we will have a system in place which quickly gathers market information, uses it to purchase supplies and an advance technology or technologies to create unique custom countertops of hard wearing but inexpensive composite material when you order it.This can be extended to all kinds of areas, including drugs, pharmaceutical products, agriculture, light and heavy industry…the uses are endless. And since the underpinning of a lot of industries lies in logistics and production, then you begin to see the possibilities. Imagine if Lockheed had an Amazon like logistics chain to build F-35’s. Rather than $80 million a piece, they might be only $30 million each. Auto makers would have the possibility of getting the same sorts of savings when building cars, and so on.This sort of logistical savings could be reinvested into more flexibility. Perhaps instead of having a few separate lines of vehicles, an automaker could literally build a unique car or light truck just for you, for about the price of a current vehicle. Once again, taken down to the lowest levels, virtually every product you own would be “bespoke”, and quite possibly built in tiny “factories” using 3D printers close to where you live. (I doubt that ubiquitous 3D printing will be a home thing simply because many items might need to be made out of specialty materials which would be too expensive or dangerous to handle at the home). These sorts of local factories could be built with small amounts of capital, leading to a flowering of small and medium sized business, overturning a century of concentration of industry.I may have only scratched the surface, but an order of magnitude increase in productivity is likely to be the next new technology for America.",UNKNOWN,Bessie J.

What follows is the full text of his trenchant remarks as printed in the Congressional Record:This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans as most generous and possibly the least appreciated people on all the earth.Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy were lifted out of the debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of dollars and forgave other billions in debts. None of these countries is today paying even the interest on its remaining debts to the United States.When the franc was in danger of collapsing in 1956, it was the Americans who propped it up, and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the streets of Paris. I was there. I saw it. When distant cities are hit by earthquakes, it is the United States that hurries in to help. This spring,59 American communities were flattened by tornadoes. Nobody helped.The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped billions of dollars into discouraged countries. Now newspapers in those countries are writing about the decadent, warmongering Americans. I’d like to see just one of those countries that is gloating over the erosion of the United States Dollar build its own airplane. Does any other country in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing Jumbo Jet, the Lockheed Tristar, or the Douglas DC-10?If so, why don’t they fly them? Why do all the International lines except Russia fly American planes?Why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or woman on the moon? You talk about Japanese technocracy, and you get radios. You talk about German technocracy, and you get automobiles. You talk about American technocracy, and you find men on the moon— notonce, but several times— andsafely home again.You talk about scandals, and the Americans put theirs right in the store window for everybody to look at. Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued and hounded. They are here on our streets, and most of them, unless they are breaking Canadian laws, are getting American dollars from ma and pa at home to spend here.When the railways of France, Germany and India were breaking down through age, it was the American who rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an old caboose. Both are still broke.I can name you 5,000 times when the Americans raced to the help of other people in trouble. Can you name me even one time when someone else raced to the Americans in trouble? I don’t think there was outside help even during the San Francisco earthquake.Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I’m one Canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get kicked around. They will come out of this thing with their flag high. And when they do, they are entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating over their present troubles. I hope Canada is not one of those.”Dinesh DeSouza who came to the US as an exchange student from India wrote this in 2002… and it still hold true.“America has become an empire, a fact that Americans are reluctant to admit and that critics of the United States regard with great alarm.Since the end of the cold war, the US has exercised an unparalleled and largely unrivaled influence throughout the world  economically, politically, culturally, and militarily. Critics of America, at home and abroad, are right to worry about how US power is being used.The critics charge that America is no different from other rapacious empires that have trampled the continents in previous centuries. Within the universities, intellectuals speak of American policies as “neo-imperialist,” because they promote the goals of empire while eschewing the term.America talks about lofty ideals, the critics say, but in reality it pursues its naked self-interest. In the Gulf War, for example, America’s leaders asserted they were fighting for human rights, but in truth they were fighting to protect US access to oil. The critics point to past US support for dictators like Anastasio Somoza in Nicaragua, Augusto Pinochet in Chile, Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines, and the Shah of Iran as evidence that Americans don’t really care about democratic ideals.Even now the US supports unelected regimes in Pakistan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia. No wonder, the critics say, so many people around the world are anti-American and some even resort to terrorism to lash out.Are the critics right? They are correct to note the extent of American influence, but wrong to suggest that the US is no different from such colonial powers as the British, French, and Spanish that once dominated the world. Those empires  like the Islamic, Mongol, and Chinese empires  were sustained primarily by force. The British ruled my native country of India with some 100,000 troops.US domination is not sustained primarily by force. True, America has bases in the Middle East and Far East, and it can intervene militarily just about anywhere in the world.But the real power of America extends far beyond its military capabilities. Walk into a hotel in Barbados or Bombay and the bellhop is whistling the theme from “Titanic.” African boys in remote villages wear baseball caps. Millions of people around the globe want to move to America. Countless people are drawn to America’s technology, freedom, and way of life.Some critics sneer that these aspirations are short-sighted. Perhaps they are right. People may be wrong to want the American lifestyle, and may not foresee its disadvantages, but at least they are seeking it voluntarily.What about the occasions, though, when America does exercise military power? Here we can hardly deny the critics’ allegation that the US acts to promote its self-interest. Even so, Americans can feel immensely proud of how often their country has served their interests while simultaneously promoting noble ideals and the welfare of others. Yes, America fought the Gulf War in part to protect its oil interests, but it also fought to liberate the Kuwaitis from Iraqi invasion.But what about long-lasting US backing for dictators, like Somoza, Pinochet, Marcos, and the shah? It should be noted that, in each case, the US eventually turned against their regimes and aided in their ouster.In Chile and the Philippines, the outcome was favorable: The Pinochet and Marcos regimes were replaced by democratic governments that endure. In Nicaragua and Iran, however, one form of tyranny gave way to another.These outcomes highlight a foreign- policy staple, the principle of the lesser evil. This means that one should not pursue a thing that seems good if it is likely to result in something worse. A second implication is that one is usually justified in allying with a bad guy to oppose a regime that is worse. A classic example was the American alliance with Stalin to defeat Hitler.Thus, many US actions that support tin-pot dictators become defensible. Remember, America was fighting a cold war. If one accepts that the Soviet Union was indeed an “evil empire,” then the US was right to attach more importance to Marcos and Pinochet’s anti-Soviet position than to their autocratic thuggery.NOW the cold war is over, so why does America support despotic regimes like those of Pervez Musharraf in Pakistan, Hosni Mubarak in Egypt, and the royal family in Saudi Arabia? Again, examine the practical alternative to those regimes.Unfortunately there do not seem to be viable liberal, democratic parties in the Middle East. The alternative to Mr. Mubarak and the Saudi royal family appears to be Islamic fundamentalists of the bin Laden stripe. Faced with the choice between “uncompromising medievals” and “corrupt moderns,” America must side with the corrupt.Remember, also, the larger context. America is the most magnanimous imperial power ever. After leveling Japan and Germany during World War II, the US rebuilt them. For the most part, America is an abstaining superpower. It shows no real interest in conquering the rest of the world, even though it can. On occasion, the US intervenes in Grenada or Haiti or Bosnia, but it never stays to rule them.Moreover, when America does get into a war, it is supremely careful to avoid targeting civilians. Even as US bombs destroyed the infrastructure of the Taliban, American planes dropped rations of food to avert hardship and starvation of Afghan civilians. What other country does such things?Jeane Kirkpatrick once said that “Americans need to face the truth about themselves, no matter how pleasant it is.” The reason many Americans don’t feel this way is that they judge themselves by a higher standard. Thus if the Chinese, the Arabs, or the sub-Saharan Africans slaughter 10,000 of their own people, the world utters a collective sigh and resumes normal business.By contrast, if America, in the middle of a war, accidentally bombs a school and kills 200 civilians, there is an uproar and an investigation. All of this demonstrates America’s evident moral superiority.If this be the workings of empire, let us have more of it.”I think the answer is that while America makes mistakes… in general and in comparison to any other country in the world the country can hold it’s head high and is able to claim they have taken the moral high ground in making the majority of their policy decisions over the past 300 years. All in all the scale is tipped far in favor of the USA being the greatest country in the world.","135,529 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-will-America-have-over-other-nations-in-the-next-5-years

That ability will make everything with software much more valuable.
