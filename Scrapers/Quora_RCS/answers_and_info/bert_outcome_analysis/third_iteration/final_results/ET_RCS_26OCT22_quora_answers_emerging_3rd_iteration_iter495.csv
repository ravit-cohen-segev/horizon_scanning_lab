You could buy freaking anything- clothes, tools, tractors, even houses off of the Sears catalog. Just wait 6–8 weeks for it to ship and it will come to your door, or you can come pick it up in your semi-retired conveniently located local store.K-Mart came in and ate a large slice of their pie by selling a smaller selection of fast moving goods at a discount (purchasing economy) and locating closer to customers.Then Wal-Mart came in with a superior supply chain strategy and was able to undercut k-Mart prices and offer more selection to boot.Then Amazon revolutionized the shopping world with free two day shipping and a selection of just about everything in the world.So what's next in retail? If Amazon keeps its eyes open, they have the talent and horsepower to stay King of the Hill. But if they get complacent, some other company will change the rules right out from under them and win the advantage. That's why at Amazon we talk a lot about how ""It's always day 1"" and we stay relentlessly focused on doing better for our customers.What about the others?Well Facebook bought some time by acquiring Instagram and copying the best parts of Snapchat (stories), but their core product isn't all that cool anymore.Apple hasn't done anything new in a while, and eventually people will stop getting so e...",179 followers,Shahaab Sherwani,1.6K,100,2.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-are-the-most-powerful-technology-brands-in-the-world

Toyota has one infront if their headoffice with over a million miles. And there are many more examples of insanely high mileage ones.Also, one of these guysA MANUAL, NON TURBO, Honda Civic. You see, Honda was originally a motorbike company, and 99% of a bike is its engine. Honda’s know how to make an engine better than anyone. However, their automatic transmissions aren’t the greatest. Their manuals however, well, have you ever heard the expression “it shifts like a Honda”. Which means you can bang it into gear, and abuse the transmission all day long, and nothing will happen to it.

This amounts to $8.19 billion for the U.S. technology giant.Apple has the highest profit margins in the smartphone industry thanks to a loyal brand following and the ability to price its iPhones at a premium.Apple accounted for around 103.6 percent of profits in the smartphone market.

He had started the largest war in history, nearly conquered Europe, build a grand German Empire, and now it was collapsing around him.Imagine that stress. We’ve all been in situations where we’ve seen our carefully laid plans get ruined. We’ve all failed at one point in life and clung to hope for some miracleDownfall- 100% DownfallTo me, nothing is more interesting than Hitler in his final days. He had started the largest war in history, nearly conquered Europe, build a grand German Empire, and now it was collapsing around him.Imagine that stress. We’ve all been in situations where we’ve seen our carefully laid plans get ruined. We’ve all failed at one point in life and clung to hope for some miracle turnaround.Imagine watching your once “unbeatable” nation crumble to dust thanks to your decisions and actions all while the most powerful people look to you to solve this mess.That was Hitler in these final days. The war is over, Germany has lost. In fact, Germany lost months ago but has stubbornly refused to surrender. At this point, children are fighting the Russians in the streets of Berlin- literally kids. Meanwhile, Hitler clings to hope that one of his purely fictional “Army Groups” is going to come rescue Berlin.Downfall perfectly portrays Hitler not as some evil mustache-twirling villain but as a human. This is perhaps what is most frightening about Hitler. He wasn’t some devil, he was a normal man. It’s not demons that caused the Holocaust, it was normal people like you and me.* In my humble opinion, Bruno Gantz’s acting job portraying Hitler is perhaps the best acting in any movie ever. I mean it just blows me away how well he did. He got every little mannerism right- even the manner of speaking.Additionally, the movie perfectly shows the breakdown of order in Berlin. It shows how desperate and chaotic the Germans became and how weak the German Army was by this point.There is 1 scene where a German General is relieved of duty and to be executed for abandoning the front. He gets this news while on the frontline. He decides to talk to Hitler and explain things. Then we get a tracking shot showing the General walk from the front to Hitler’s bunker- and it’s like a 2-minute walk. This German General could get from the combat zones to Hitler in a few minutes by walking.Once he enters the bunker is quiet. Things go from violent chaos to eerie silence, symbolizing the ignorance of those in the bunker to the realities of the front.This perfectly encapsulates this battle. Parts of Berlin were held by the Russians and parts of Berlin were held by the Germans. Nobody knew anything or had any idea what to do.

They walk around dazed addicts, some with needles still In their arms. Needles left on the ground are common. At Van Ness my son heads to SOMA on foot. HIs wife could walk down Van Ness to her office near Aquatic Park but does not feel safe. She takes the bus. She has had her wallet stolen and twice attempts were made to snatch her purse. Around her office, it is not safe. Her company has hired private security, and guards accompany employees to their cars in the parking garage, because of previous incidents.Has SF declined? Yes! And it IS very expensive, based on higher tech salaries. BUT over thirty years, in an area known for innovation, you would think the city government and local business would have come up with a number of effective approaches and solutions that would address homelessness, addiction and mental illness. Revolutionary approaches that could be applied in any city.The problem is worse, WAY worse. It's not just about high rents, or high salaries. It's also a belief that ensuring public safety for all entails an evil implementation of law and order, forced care or even institutional housing. Here is the lack of innovative thinking, and a stubborn adherence to a permissive, over-tolerant ideal that is touted as compassion.",36 followers,Patty Coz,3.8K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-are-the-most-powerful-technology-brands-in-the-world
27,"The reason that real estate prices in San Francisco respond so vigorously to relatively minor changes in demand is because the supply is so inelastic. I realize full well that so far I have just restated the definition of supply elasticity, but bear with me.Some people would say that real estate in a geographically contained space like San Francisco is inherently in inelastic supply. And those people would be wrong. The binding constraint on San Francisco real estate is regulation.

I realize full well that so far I have just restated the definition of supply elasticity, but bear with me.Some people would say that real estate in a geographically contained space like San Francisco is inherently in inelastic supply. And those people would be wrong. The binding constraint on San Francisco real estate is regulation. There are plenty of areas of San Francisco that are relatively low-density, but it is ridiculously hard to develop or redevelop anything.You may counter that here and there you see enormous over-the-top development and re-development projects going on. But that is precisely the problem.Try to buy up four adjacent townhouses in the Sunset and convert them to a 10-unit apartment building. I would argue that is precisely the kind of human-scale gradual redevelopment that can be done without disturbing the social structure of neighborhoods and other such intangibles that development opponents complain about.You will soon find there is no way. The only way to do any sort of development in San Francisco is to amass such enormous resources that you can lobby your way into a mega-project.These real big mega-projects then proceed to antagonize the electorate, stir up anti-development sentiment, and cause people to vote for even more restrictive land use regulations next time around.And that makes it harder for anyone to do the sort of gradual, organically driven, small-scale density-increasing redevelopment of lower-density residential and industrial areas that San Francisco could easily absorb and that existing residents wouldn't generally be all that upset by.As a consequence, supply is very inelastic. When new units become available, it's often in big chunks (see e.g. the big luxury apartment projects around AT&T park), but the total volume of development is nothing like what it could be.The problem is by no means unique to San Francisco, but I do have the impression that San Francisco suffers from this problem worse than other cities in the area.And don't get me started about rent control.",256 followers,Priyal Gupta,9.7K,0,0,2012,https://www.quora.com/Which-are-the-most-powerful-technology-brands-in-the-world

After all, we also have UC Berkely which isn’t surrounded by tech companies and you have Cal Poly which isn’t either. Similarly, UCLA and USC are close together but this hasn’t caused a boom of high-tech companies.It is incorrect to say “because of the Internet.” The original precursor to the Internet was actually established between LA andWhy are a lot of technology companies based in the San Francisco/San Jose area of California?As a lifelong resident of the Bay Area, I have often asked myself the same question.You will doubtless see the answer “because Stanford” but that’s not really true. After all, we also have UC Berkely which isn’t surrounded by tech companies and you have Cal Poly which isn’t either. Similarly, UCLA and USC are close together but this hasn’t caused a boom of high-tech companies.It is incorrect to say “because of the Internet.” The original precursor to the Internet was actually established between LA and Palo Alto so why not a high-tech boom in LA? Similarly, other technology firms like Microsoft, Compaq or DEC could have easily driven this wave, but they didn’t.No, these are not the real reasons.I would argue that there were actually three factors that caused silicon valley to happen:As someone who grew up in the Bay Area and specifically in San Francisco in the ‘70’s I can assure you that “Silicon Valley” does not include San Francisco. While many people have started to just include SF, this is a relatively new thing. When I was a kid, technology companies were in the valley and up to about the mid-peninsula There were none in San Francisco.When WWII started, San Francisco and the Bay Area was a relatively small metropolitan area with a great harbor. The Bay Area had grown rapidly in the 1800’s because of the gold rush and becoming a US state but by 1940, population growth had slowed to about 10% per decade. However, from 1940 to 1950, the population of the Bay Area grew by 54%. Massive investments in shipbuilding and the creation of dozens of military bases made the Bay Area a focus for military personnel.It also meant that when NACA was formed, the Naval Air Station later named Moffet Field was the perfect place to put a west coast research center. Moffett is a NASA facility to this day even though the Navy left years ago. This, in turn, meant that aviation and space firms like Lockheed and Space Systems Loral have major operations in the bay area. Of this means that we have jobs for college-educated workers.So, in the 1950’s you had a large population with a relatively high number of college degrees and a fair number of ex-military types.Enter Hewlett Packard which was founded in 1939 in a Palo Alto garage:While many site HP as the grandfathers of silicon valley, it was really the “traitorous eight” who literally put the silicon in silicon valley:Traitorous eight - WikipediaWhen they left Shockley to form Fairchild Semiconductor, the Silicon Valley we know was born. Founded in 1957, Fairchild was the company that really put Silicon Valley on the map. They continued as an independent company until 2015 when they were acquired.Fairchild led DIRECTLY to Intel corporation which was founded in 1969 by two former Fairchild employees (Moore and Noyce). Most of the innovation you see today in computers can be directly traced back to Intel which was a direct descendant of Fairchild. When we think about “silicon valley” we think about the great hardware companies like Intel, Cisco, and Apple. All of them trace back to Fairchild because of Intel. Even HP became a computer company largely because of Fairchild and Intel. HP uses Intel chips to this day.Intel was so pervasive they’re often referred to as part of a “duopoly” with Microsoft back in the ‘90’s. Today, they have a less dominant position, but the majority of cloud computing today runs on Intel processors.All of this leads to the Bay Area of today which is dominated by software companies like Google and Facebook.Without early government investment and the rise of the hardware companies in Silicon Valley, none of these software companies would exist. This is especially true for Intel who basically created the concept of commodity hardware. Before Intel, most hardware companies made their own proprietary operating systems and you had to write your own software.San Francisco is a bit of a Johnny Come Lately to this whole party.In the 1980’s the largest employers in San Francisco were financial companies. We had three major banks headquartered in San Francisco (BofA, Crocker and Wells Fargo). BofA got bought, Crocker got bought (by Wells) only Wells Fargo survives.Today, the largest employer in San Francisco is Salesforce:That large building to the right is the salesforce tower, the tallest building in SF, it opened in 2017. An interesting side note is that you can also see the Bank of America building on the far left (the ugly black one) which used to be the HIGHEST building and the Transamerica Pyramid (the pointy one) which was the tallest (the BofA building is on a hill so it looks down on the pyramid even though the pyramid is taller). Symbolic that those two buildings represented financial firms but now the largest building represents a software company.TL;DR: The Bay Area has a long history of high tech going back to the 1930’s but really took off after WWII because of NACA, Fairchild and Intel.",39 followers,Tom Taber,772,3.2K,8.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-are-the-most-powerful-technology-brands-in-the-world

Bob would nowIf you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.I would try to explain Blockchain in the most simple way I can.Let us assume that there are two people Alice and Bob. Alice borrows some money from Bob and Bob writes it on a piece of paper signed by Alice. After some days Alice denies the existence of such document and claims that Bob has forged that piece of paper. Bob would now find it difficult to prove that Alice actually owes him Money.In this example Alice and Bob are two nodes.Now assume the same scenario, but among a society. So there are ’k’ pair of people transacting with each other. And the only proof that each pair has, is that piece of paper. Looking at this scenario, one person, Kate comes up with a solution. She suggests maintaining a common notebook of transaction for entire society. She designates town hall to be the place where every exchange takes place. In the common notebook, every pair writes the transaction and then the notebook is kept safely. People rejoice and accept Kate as their leader.That notebook can be called a database.But one day, somebody spills wine on the notebook. This makes the notebook illegible. Taking the advantage of this situation, Alice again denies taking money from Bob.This is the problem databases face - single point of failure.Irritated by this problem, Kate comes up with another solution. She suggests maintaining multiple notebooks. She chooses some trustworthy people from the society and gives them a notebook each. Now every time a transaction or exchange takes place between two people, Kate instructs some of those trustworthy people to mention the transaction in their notebooks. So the data is repeated in the notebooks. Now, even if one notebook is destroyed, chances are that all the data regarding transactions are still present in the combination of other notebooks.This is a distributed database and multiple notebooks are the multiple nodes.But next day, another problem arises. Kate has a friend named Bert who owes a lot of money to some people in the society. He asks Kate for help and she agrees to help him. She instructs all the people with the notebooks to remove the entries where Bert received money. Now Bert doesn’t owe any money based on the notebooks.This is the problem with distributed databases - they are centralized. That means one single entity owns all the nodes/resources and can make changes as they deem fit.When the people from the society come to know of it, they remove Kate from the leadership.* They decide to keep a notebook each. Every time a transaction is made between any two people , all the people from the town come together and mention it in their respective notebooks. So if there are n people in the society, then there are n notebooks and no one person controls the overall representation of the transactions. This is decentralization.","31,157 followers",Phillip Remaker,1.7K,11K,78.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-are-the-most-powerful-technology-brands-in-the-world
