2,It is incorrect because the IRA followed principles that are as old as the hills.To begin your education on urban guerrilla warfare you have to start as far back as the Roman period and their many occupations.

For those who are saying “oh the Norths artillery is a massive threat” it is not really a massive one. Many assume all of its artillery guns can hit seoul when in reality only 200 of its artillery guns can reach seoul. Ik thats enough to kill tens of thousands of South Koreans that is if they are not in an underground artillery shelter. Those artillery guns would immediately be destroyed by counter battery fire, air strikes and special forces attacks.

Even in the most difficult times when the army goes hungry, soldiers have weapons and if theft of food from locals is tollerated, if not encouraged. While you serve in the army, you are guaranteed food and shelter as a result, so these young men (and sometimes women) are unlikely to rise up in a rebellion.Furthermore, North Korea has enormous special forces, some 120,000 strong. I think these aren’t special forces like the SAS or SEALs, but instead actual professional soldiers, competently trained and reasonably well equipped, chosen for their loyalty to the Kim regime. If the army does act up these guys put the rebellion down with relative ease, because they are actual soldiers and go against armed farmers in uniforms that form up the bulk of North Korean army.A typical North Korean army unit",UNKNOWN,"Raymond K.

In one of the ‘short stories’ titled ‘Looking Back’, he says: Today, I interviewed my grandmother for part of a research paper I’m working on for my Psychology class. When I asked her to define success in her own words, she said, “Success is when you look back at your life and the memories make you smile.""Very true, indeed!",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,31.6K,996,156M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-someone-invented-a-revolutionary-military-technology-and-tried-to-sell-it-to-an-enemy-nation-like-North-Korea-or-Iran

He died too young. Burned out.When we were raising our children I took stock of my life. I didn’t want to end up like so many I knew who accomplished much yet lost everything that truly matters.So over a weekend, I wrote out what a successful life would look like in all the important areas.Sure career and wealth were there.But also health, marriage, family, friends, fun and spirituality.I fleshed out each one, painting a picture of my dream.I also realized they all revolved around people I cared about. And wanting all of these goals out of love for them.Through the years I’ve refined this vision many times.In the beginning I reread it constantly to infuse my subconscious with it.It became the beacon that guided me through life. And one day I woke up and realized I wasn’t dreaming any longer. I’d arrived safely in port.So I hope you discover the difference between achievement and success. And arrive safely in port too.I’ll have a glass of wine waiting for you to cheer your success.Bon voyage!True success comes only as you first picture what it looks like for you.","78,458 followers",Shovan Chowdhury,11.3K,505,37.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-technology-that-everybody-is-saying-is-revolutionary-and-can-be-really-successful-but-you-think-wont-be-as-successful
31,"It may be a cliche to say this but I think it may be Jesus Christ.All you have to do to see how monumental his contribution was is to look at Greek and Roman literature. In their culture there is no sense of universal equality; no idea of universal rights, no idea that everyone, no matter how rich or how poor, has a place and a role to play. What we call human rights are completely absent from their conception of reality. And then Christianity shows up and rewrites our entire cultural DNA, to the point where we now assume these ideas are innately human.",147 followers,Vishal Jaybhaye,20.8K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-technology-that-everybody-is-saying-is-revolutionary-and-can-be-really-successful-but-you-think-wont-be-as-successful
