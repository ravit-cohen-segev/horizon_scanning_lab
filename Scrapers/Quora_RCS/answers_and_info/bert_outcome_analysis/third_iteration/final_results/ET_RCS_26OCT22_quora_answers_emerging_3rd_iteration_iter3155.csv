0,"The device itself has some internal resistance, and so does the power supply. The amount of current that flows is determined by the voltage available divided by the total resistance. So when you increase voltage, the current also increases. Or, looking at it the other way around, the only available way to increase the current (without rebuilding the device) is to increase the voltage.However, you would have to measure the actual voltage reaching your device, or the actual current flowing in the device, to know which of the two power supplies you used actually provides more power.

On one hand, the 4 AA batteries start out slightly above 6 V, but drop to 4 V when discharged. They have some internal resistance, but it’s low enough that fresh alkalines will provide more than 1 A of current. When you connect the battery pack to your device, you will get some value of voltage and current that depends on the resistance of the device.The 6 VDC power supply also supplies about 6 V, and that voltage will not drop with time, unlike the batteries. On the other hand, it’s only rated for 600 mA output, and if your device tries to draw more current than that, the power supply may fail, or it may limit the current to not much more than 600 mA. (Power supplies are complex devices that you can’t model with just Ohm’s law).If the internal resistance of your device is 10 ohms or more, then it will draw 600 mA or less from the DC power supply, which is within its rating, so the output voltage will probably still be about 6 V. With a 600 mA load, the AA battery pack will drop in voltage somewhat, so the DC power supply will probably deliver more power to the device. On the other hand, if the device internal resistance is below 10 ohms, the device will try to draw more than 600 mA from the power supply, which might cause the power supply output voltage to dropThe other thing to keep in mind that electromechanical devices are designed to provide a certain amount of mechanical power at a certain electrical input, and then operate either indefinitely or with a particular duty cycle without overheating. The standard way of increasing he mechanical output of an electromechanical device beyond its rating is to use two of them in parallel - or switch to a larger device. Supplying more power than the device is designed for can cause it to overheat and fail.If it is a device that turns electricity into magnetism, its output is also limited by the size of its magnetic structures. Magnetic steel saturates at a certain magnetic flux level, and above that point more electricity in doesn’t produce significantly more magnetism out.PS: If you want help from someone with real world applications, you should describe","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advanced-technology-and-power-supply-in-SolidWorks

Though earlier the Chinese had fielded very significant numbers of handgunners in battle.Fortifications are difficult to compare since the Europe and China differed so much in design options and needs. Though by the middle 15th century Europeans were actively experimenting with fortifications specifically designed with cannons in mind.Plate armour is not really something i’d compare to Chinese armour of the time. Plate armour was superior to much of what the Chinese had in terms of metallurgy and construction but the Ming dynasty simply didn’t need specialised armour for their conscripts and professional soldiers.In terms of ship development we’d really have to look at it on a decade to decade basis. The ships that sailed across the channel in 1300 are simply incomparable to those who sailed in the year 1500. Dramatic would be an understatement when we look at ship development during this period which also coincided with Zheng He’s voyages. By the second half of the 15th century after his fleet had rotten away Europeans had something of an advantage. Their navigational techniques and instruments were more advanced and their ships acquired good sailing capabilities. When cannons started being added to ships in the last decades of the 15th century the balance really shifted, even ships larger than those of say Vasco da Gama were shot to bits by smaller carracks shooting broadside after broadside into the opposition.The topic really deserves more attention and there is much on which I can’t make a statement with any degree of certainty. However I reckon that Europe as a whole was somewhat on par with China during the Late Middle Ages.

Many of the technologies, inventions, and manufacturing processes of antiquity have simply disappeared with the passage of time, while others are still not fully understood by modern day scientists. Some have since been rediscovered (indoor plumbing,Stradivari ViolinsOne lost technology of the 1700s is the process through which the famed Stradivari violins and other stringed instruments were built. The violins, along with assorted violas, cellos, and guitars, were constructed by the Stradivari family in Italy from roughly 1650-1750. TheHow was it Lost?The technique for building Stradivari instruments was a family secret known only by patriarch Antonio Stradivari and his sons, Omobono and Francesco. Once they died, the process died with them, but this hasn’t stopped some from trying to reproduce it. Researchers have studied everything fromDamascus SteelDamascus steel hunting knifeDamascus steel was an impossibly strong type of metal that was widely used in the Middle East from 1100-1700 AD. It is most famously associated with swords and knives. Blades forged with Damascus steel were known for their amazing strength and cutting ability, and were said to be able to slice rocks and other metals—including the blades of weaker swords—cleanly in half. The blades are believed to have been created using wootz steel, which was most likely imported from India and Sri Lanka and molded and blended to create a patterned blade. The special quality of the swords is thought to have derived from this process, which weaved together tough cementite and soft iron to form a metal that was as strong as it was flexible.How was it Lost?The particular process for forging Damascus steel appears to have disappeared sometime around 1750 AD. The exact cause for the loss of the technique is unknown, but there are several theories. The most popular is that the supply of ores needed for the special recipe for Damascus steel started running low, and sword makers were forced to develop other techniques. Another is that the whole recipe for Damascus steel—specifically the presence of carbon nanotubes—was only discovered by accident, and that sword smiths didn’t actually know the technique by heart. Instead, they would simply forge the swords en masse, and test them to determine which met the standards of Damascus steel. Whatever the technique, Damascus steel is one technology that modern experimenters have been unable to fully reproduce. There are pattern welded knives that are marketed as being made from “Damascened steel”, but while usually well made, they are only approximations of the lost technique for real Damascus steel.3. SilphiumLost technologies aren’t always the result of too much secrecy or poor record keeping—sometimes nature just doesn’t cooperate. This was the case with Silphium, an herbal wonder drug that the Romans used as one of the earliest forms of birth control. It was based on the fruit of a particular genus of the fennel plant, a flowering herb that only grew along a certain shoreline in modern day Libya. The heart-shaped fruit of the Silphium plant was known to be something of a cure-all, and was used to treat warts, fever, indigestion and a whole host of other ailments. But it was Silphium’s powers as a contraceptive that made it one of the most valuable substances in the Roman world, to the point that the plant appears on several different pieces of ancient Roman currency. Women would drink Silphium juice every few weeks, and this would be enough to prevent pregnancy. Using the herb would even terminate an existing pregnancy if used correctly, which would make Silphium one of the earliest methods of abortion.How was it Lost?Silphium was one of the most sought after drugs of the ancient world, and its use spread rapidly across Europe and into Asia. But despite its remarkable effects, the particular genus of plant needed would only grow in one area along the Mediterranean in North Africa. Its scarcity, combined with an overwhelming demand, more than likely led to over harvesting, which drove the plant into extinction. Because the particular species no longer exists, modern scientists are unable to examine Silphium to see if its powers of contraception were really as effective as Roman historians and poets would lead one to believe, or if there were any adverse side effects. Still, it is worth noting that other herbs that are chemically similar to Silphium have been proven to have a fairly high rate of preventing pregnancyRoman CementAncient Roman concrete vault in Rome.Modern concrete was developed in the 1700s, and today the simple mixture of cement, water, sand, and rocks is the most widely used building material in the world. But the recipe developed in the 18th century wasn’t the first time concrete was invented. In fact, concrete was widely used throughout antiquity by the Persians, Egyptians, Assyrians, and Romans. The Romans in particular made extensive use of concrete, and they were responsible for first perfecting the recipe by mixing burnt lime with crushed rocks and water. Their mastery of its use allowed them to build many of their most famous structures, among them the Pantheon, the Colosseum, the aqueducts, and the Roman Baths.How was it Lost?Like so many technologies of the Greeks and Romans, the recipe for concrete was lost during the descent into the Dark Ages, but just why remains a mystery. The most popular theory is that the recipe was something of a trade secret among stonemasons, and that the method for making cement and concrete died along with those who knew it. Perhaps even more interesting than the disappearance of Roman cement are the particular qualities that separate it from more modern Portland cement, which is the most common type of cement used today. Structures built with Roman cement, like the Colosseum, have managed to weather thousands of years of punishment from the elements and remain standing, but buildings constructed with Portland cement have been known to wear down much faster. This has been theorized to be the result of different chemicals that the Romans added to their cement, among them milk and even blood. These were said to create air bubbles within the concrete that helped the material to expand and contract in the heat and cold without damaging itself.Greek FireImage from an illuminated manuscript, the Madrid Skylitzes, showing Greek fire in use against the fleet of the rebel the Slav. The caption above the left ship reads i.e. “the fleet of the Romans setting ablaze the fleet of the enemies”.Perhaps the most famous of all lost technologies is what is known as Greek Fire, an incendiary weapon that was used by the military of the Byzantine Empire. A primitive form of napalm, Greek Fire was a kind of “sticky fire” that would continue burning even in water. The Byzantines most famously used it during the 11th century, when it was credited with helping to repel two sieges of Constantinople by Arab invaders. Greek Fire could be deployed in many different ways. In its earliest form it was poured into jars and thrown at enemies like a grenade or a Molotov cocktail. Later, giant bronze tubes were mounted on warships, and siphons were used spray the weapon at enemy vessels. There was even a kind of portable siphon that could be operated by hand in the style of a modern flamethrower.How was it Lost?The technology behind Greek Fire certainly isn’t completely alien. After all, modern militaries have now been using similar weapons for years. Still, the closest counterpart to Greek Fire, napalm, wasn’t perfected until the early 1940s, which would mean the technology was lost for several hundred years. The weapon’s use seems to disappear after the decline of the Byzantine Empire, but just why still isn’t known. Meanwhile, the possible chemical composition of Greek Fire has been widely studied by historians and scientists. An early theory was that the mixture included a heavy dose of saltpeter, which would make it chemically similar to gunpowder. This idea has since been rejected, because saltpeter wouldn’t burn in water. Instead, modern theories propose that the weapon was more likely a cocktail of petroleum and other chemicals, possibly including quicklime, niter, or sulfur",UNKNOWN,Michael B.,1.3K,6.4K,76.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-disruptive-rapidly-advancing-technology-is-taking-us-to-a-dystopian-society-where-nobody-can-even-take-care-of-themselves

They like to compare their country with countries like America and Japan.Images source:",286 followers,Michael Pothoven,3.6K,179,1.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-disruptive-rapidly-advancing-technology-is-taking-us-to-a-dystopian-society-where-nobody-can-even-take-care-of-themselves

22,"The printing press.Copyright laws were created specifically because printers would just duplicate any book that was selling decently and enter into direct competition with the author. It was a free-for-all and destroyed any incentive to publicly release work of your own.Before this books had to be duplicated by hand.
