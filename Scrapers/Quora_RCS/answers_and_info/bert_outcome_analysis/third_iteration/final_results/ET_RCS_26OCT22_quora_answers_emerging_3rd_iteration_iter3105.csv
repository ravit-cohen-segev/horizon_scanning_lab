2,"There was a quote I once read, not sure from whom, that basically said,” Any technology, sufficiently advanced, is indistinguishable from magic “.

Its like saying – “India invented the wheel! lets go back into the ancient books and remake the wheel the way they did!” “India had flying machines called vimānas - let’s go and make one and get commercial!” Why not just hop down to the travel agent and buy a ticket on a ready made Boeing?Sushruta pioneered cosmetic/surgery 500 BCE - the India surgeons were the first to do nose-reconstructions due to the common punishment of cutting off the noses of criminals. The question to ask is - if you need cosmetic surgery would you go to a native surgeon using Sushruta’s manual from 500 BCE or would you go to an America trained surgeon at the Apollo Hospital?The most effective and useful machine that was ever invented is the bicycle - there is nothing in the entire corpus of the Vedas or allied scriptures which would enable you to build even this most simple machine let alone vimānas or time-travel machines.“Western” Science is serving us very well - in fact far too well!

But with British we lost that grace in winning Independence.The Reason is Asoka. He made all Ksatriyas as Brahmins. And all Brahmins as Bhuddists. The Brahmins today practice a Psuedo Buddhism (Vegetarian, Shaving head, Temple rituals, Mutt following, following a spritual leader ,making Vishnu as a Sleeping Vishnu like Sleeping Buddha so on)And After Chandragupta Maurya, Asoka converted everyone into peace loving Budhist. But again Adi Sankara reinstated Hinduism in South India, and Hari Hara and Bukka formed and that Vijaya nagar Empire successfully kept Muslim Rule only up to Deccan. Later it came up to Mysore and Tipu Sultan is the end point.The deep south India which was ruled by Cholas and Pandyas were never invaded by antyone. They stopped all the invasion. Pandyas stopped Alauddin Khilji at Madurai. Beyond Madurai not a single Village is ruled by Muslim invaders.The British captured that first, with a new tactics called Treachery. Robert Clive started a new style of war in India. He was running a Extortion racket in England. He did the same to collect tax here. Hired Bouncers for East India company.The Muslims rule created a deep hatred among Hindus in Deccan region and this made the job of British easy to capture India. So losing to British is Back stabbing. But losing to Muslims only was a Battle. But the real Ancient Kingdom of India that is Chola, Chera and Pandyas never got defeated. They reinstated their Kingdom with Pallavas after Kalabras, that was the only period they lost but soon regained. The victory of Foreign forces is not complete, it just a victory for collection of Tax and Money looting.The Thieves cannot be said as owner of the House in Midnight. They will go after the loot. What happened in India is Theft, not Invasion. So Indians are advanced only. Otherwise Hinduism would have been wiped out.In Persia, the Chandra gupta equivalent Cyrus Kingdom or Ghenghis khan kingdom never left any legacy. But Mauryan Empire has left a legacy called Chankya in India which will never allow any Invasion on India. India still got lot of Chankyas even after thousands of year. That is why unlike Persia or Iran, Hinduism is not wiped out from this country.The Artifact from Indus Valley Civilization, the artifact taken from that resembles Modi , what a co-incidence!Hinduism started before all the religions of the world. Still continuing and it will remain even all the religions fades away. And this Hinduism is a proof that India is advanced only and even if we cannot stop invasions in the land of Indians, we have successfully stopped the invasion of India in the hearts of Indians.",0 followers,Marta Maszkiewicz,587,56,288.4K,2018,https://www.quora.com/Would-it-be-better-to-have-advanced-technology-or-magic

The Japanese still had a major tactical advantage in that they were mounted.The Yuan forces had an ace up their sleeve though: black powder grenades, the Japanese (and, more importantly, their horses) were scared off with little resistance, and retreated into a nearby fort. Fortunately for the Japanese, the Yuan forces had no horses to mount up on (due to poor logistical planning). And so they had to abandon their hard won beachhead by withdrawing to their ships in the night.This turned out to be a bad call since they lost a portion (how many is a matter of debate) to a storm, and decided to return to Korea for reinforcements before making another attempt.

Largely as a result of massive family ties within that group. Sweden not only sold steel, ball bearings and Bofors armaments to Germany (and England on a limited scale) but they also permitted the Germans to move massive amounts of troops through the country by train. Iron ore from the far north of Sweden is normally shipped by railroad over the mountains on the border to Norway down to the ice-free harbor at Narvik. During the war British submarines lurking off the west coast of Norway made that a bad idea. Instead, the Swedish mines started shipping their iron ore on German and Swedish ships down the Swedish east coast. They tried to stay close to the shore and screened behind the island chains that line the coast. The Swedish Navy escorted these convoys as far as they could so that British submarines lurking in the Baltic didn’t come after them. Then they had to make a quick dash straight down to a German Harbor on the German Baltic coast.That all changed after the relief of Stalingrad in 1943. By then, the Americans were so emboldened that they walked right in and informed the Swedish government that they had picked one of the Crown estates south of Stockholm (Tullinge, I think) as an advanced air force base from which to continue pounding Germany. They got exactly as they wanted but the war ended before they got going on that project.Sweden, neutral in World War II?

Each of these solar systems contains stars and planets.See that tiny, tiny dot? So tiny you can’t even see it? That is our Solar Interstellar System. From here, we can’t even make out our solar system let alone individual planets. The galaxy is enormous. We are rotating what is believed to be a black hole. Current scientific estimates conclude that there are approximately 100 billion stars in our galaxy alone with planets orbiting them.As we travel further into space, the entire galaxy becomes just a dot of light. Each of those other dots are other galaxies.Further away, it is possible to see the Virgo Supercluster. That red notation represents our local galactic group, containing all of the galaxies near us. In that is the Milky Way galaxy. In that is the solar interstellar neighborhood. In that is our solar system. In that is planet Earth.The local supercluster group contains the virgo supercluster, where we are located, as well as the other superclusters near us.That tiny dot that you can hardly make out on the screen is the Virgo Supercluster. All of those other dots are superclusters. And this is just the observable universe that we can estimate. It is believed that there are countless, perhaps even infinite, other dimensions. Theoretically, planet Earth could have entire civilizations that exist in other dimensions we can’t access or interact with at the present time. Then there is the issue of time and gravity. If time travel is possible, all of these universes would be occurring at the same time everywhere in all dimensions.Multiverse?The multiverse is a hypothetical group of multiple universes.Together, these universes comprise everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, energy, information, and the physical laws and constants that describe them.Do you still think we are alone in the Universe?","20,148 followers",Aitijya Sarkar,5.8K,209,11.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Would-it-be-better-to-have-advanced-technology-or-magic

Learn to grow better quality vegetables. Learn improved farming methods & mechanization. Learn how to increase yields. Learn to grow high value crops. And learn about their livestock management. Once contact is established, facilitate the ease of entry of these Taiwanese farming experts in entering Vietnam to assess the ground situation and maximize land utilization etc. In time to come, Vietnamese farmers will benefit from such interaction.There's actually no lack of assistance on offer. Countries like Japan and China are facing farmland shortages. Japan has already out sourced its lucrative unagi production to Taiwan and Malaysia, its short grain Japonica rice to Vietnam, and is starting out its famed strawberries to Thailand. As long as Vietnam is willing to open its arms, I'm sure Japan is willing to let Vietnam grow more of its crops too. By growing export quality goods, Vietnamese farmers can get better prices for their produce and hence elevate poverty.Last but not least, Vietnam is sitting on a potential gold mine : the Dong Tao chickenThese thunder thighs chickens, native to Vietnam, are said to be prized for their meat. If Vietnam wants to monetise this asset, Vietnam should seek the advice of poultry experts on increasing the supply etc of these birds. And learn to guard the secrets well so that they will become the Wagyu chickens of Vietnam. This way, Vietnam too may have produce that command a premium. Do this and you would shed the image of a low cost low quality producer and once your reputation improves, you can get better profit margins for your products.","1,273 followers",Andre Lieven,6.9K,4.2K,12.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Would-it-be-better-to-have-advanced-technology-or-magic

The person quoted World Happiness Index figures and how Pakistan was way ahead than India. He told me to go and build toilets and then f*** myself. My current answer is very sincerely meant. To that misguided person my only answer is that if you are happy with the state of affairs in Pakistan, the state of the economy, the crashing PKR, then what can I say? Be happy and let things run its course.Land Reforms:Education:Women Education:Infrastructure Development:But ports, roads and bridges are not the only infra. Pakistan has to focus on power including renewable sources, irrigation, housing development, development of new cities, etc. India lags here too.Give up on Terror; hug peace:Forget Kashmir. Increase Trade with India:There are a few more options. Not all are simple. Not all may bring immediate benefits but in the long run they will. It is a matter of setting aside the ego.Edit 2 (30-May-2019):The whole thing has been misunderstood. The rhetoric lies in the minds of the Establishment and not general populace (maybe). The survival of the Army Generals depends upon the anti India stance. Let me also explain how India rhetoric, the unbalanced arms race, terror funding, etc., have crippled Pakistan.In 1985, the Per Capita GDP of Pakistan was about 27.7% higher than India’s (Pak US$350 : Ind US$274). Today, the Pakistan per capita GDP is some US$ 1222.50 and forecasted to grow to US$ 1400 in 2020 while India’s PCGDP is US$ 1963.55 and forecasted to grow to US$ 2350 in 2020. India is 60.1% ahead. How did Pakistan lose out by about 88%?Pakistan, while a smaller nation, is a much blessed nation. Almost whole land is fertile, it has a unique geographic advantageous location, it is rich in minerals, its population is lower (but growing at an alarming rate 2.5 times of India), the problems are lower, etc. Smaller nations grow much more than larger nations. The growth rate till 1985 was about 6% and exceeded India’s measly 2.75%.It was around this time (1985) that Pakistan started funding terrorism against India and started the Kashmiri insurgency heavily. They also started heavy military purchases including the F-16s. Pakistan's general thought that we won the war in Afghanistan by attrition. We can do the same to India. The US was funding Pakistan to fight against Afghans. Some of the heavy funding was to take care of the huge Afghan refugees. But a lot of these funds were misused and ended in terror funding or the corrupt. Pakistan still had to shelter the refugees. The money came from the exchequer.This is what I mean by India rhetoric and it is deeply coupled with Kashmir.People have also questioned on terror and how IK is sincere and wanting to talk and Modi isn't. There are reasons for this. Why did the bus to Lahore in 1999 end up in Kargil? The Kashmir problem was almost solved at that time. Who helped the attack on J&K assembly and later the Indian Parliament? Who sent terrorists to Mumbai on 26/11/2008? Modi invited Nawaz Sharif and he gracefully agreed. Yet pretty soon there were Uri, Pathankot incidents and later Pulwama. Pakistan can’t honestly say that they were ‘freedom fighters’ fighting alone. JeM have taken responsibility of these events. Pakistan can’t hide behind excuses such as ‘give us the proofs’. Where do all these people get the training and logistics support? How is 240+ kg of RDX, detonators, timing devices obtained and where does the training to assemble it come from?Pakistan is always in denial mode. They denied whereabouts of Osama Bin Laden. What happened exactly?All this not only creates mistrust but that logistics support to “freedom fighters” is costing huge amount of money. The army/ISI can’t provide their own arms to the terrorists; they provide funds. The terrorists buy their arms and ammunition from global arms dealers at open market (much higher) price. Hence they require more money - the same money that could be used to build better roads, dams, canals, higher educational institutes, etc.Just a fortnight ago, Pakistan got some $6 billion from IMF and the first result was deep PKR devaluation. What is $6 billion? It is loose change for tea/coffee. A similar sum was spent by Laxmi Mittal to purchase the bankrupt Essar Steel of India. And yet, this money was direly needed. It has come with deep consequences. We went thru same crisis in 1991 and I know what happened. How long will this money last. Without fresh global investments, Pakistan will have to back to IMF in a year. The world views Pakistan as an unsafe place. Reality may be different but perceptions matter.Just imagine ... if peace accord had been signed in 1999. The Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline would have been complete - bringing huge revenues for Pakistan. A road transit would have been created from New Delhi to Central Asia bringing customs duty, cess and road tolls to Pakistan. These two would have earned more than $6b per annum. This is the benefit of bilateral trade.I have told to forget Kashmir and India. Cut down on (useless) defence spending.I could go on. My answer and advice is to take good things. India is not perfect; in fact, it is very far from perfect.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-didnt-ancient-North-Indians-use-Brahmastra-or-any-of-their-advanced-technological-weapons-against-the-Muslim-invaders
