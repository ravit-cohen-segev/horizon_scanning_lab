You could buy freaking anything- clothes, tools, tractors, even houses off of the Sears catalog. Just wait 6–8 weeks for it to ship and it will come to your door, or you can come pick it up in your semi-retired conveniently located local store.K-Mart came in and ate a large slice of their pie by selling a smaller selection of fast moving goods at a discount (purchasing economy) and locating closer to customers.Then Wal-Mart came in with a superior supply chain strategy and was able to undercut k-Mart prices and offer more selection to boot.Then Amazon revolutionized the shopping world with free two day shipping and a selection of just about everything in the world.So what's next in retail? If Amazon keeps its eyes open, they have the talent and horsepower to stay King of the Hill. But if they get complacent, some other company will change the rules right out from under them and win the advantage.

23,"Absolutely.Here’s roughly how it looks like. A few sets of axioms first.Axiom set one:Basically, “authoritarian” systems:However, authoritarian systems:“Democratic” systems, on the other hand:Absolutely.Here’s roughly how it looks like. A few sets of axioms first.Axiom set one:Basically, “authoritarian” systems:However, authoritarian systems:“Democratic” systems, on the other hand:Their downsides include:Don’t get me wrong: there’s no “best” system. In fact, nearly 100% of companies start in a truly authoritarian way — a few, sometimes even one, founder decide they are up to something, they have the vision, some resources, and tremendous passion for this idea to make it live.First hires are generally not only far less motivated by the idea (because then they join as partners, not as hires), but also fully respect the authority of the people who were there first, simply because most arguments at this, early, stage are pretty much a waste of time: it’s not worth it to slow down the process by some 25% in order to make 10% fewer suboptimal decisions.On the other end of the spectrum, after the company is some 500+ people, it is virtually impossible for it to stay truly authoritarian. Military organizational structures aside, some form of the M-team fostering cross-team collaboration emerges, and, much as the founder(s) may want to retain “full” control, the system evolves towards something a lot more fluid and agile.in a nutshell, at some point of the company’s growth, the key members of respective teams would begin to deliberately share their responsibility, reducing their own possible influence from “it’s going to happen as I say” to “I merely am one of the people whose opinion matters”. That’s why companies like Google have multi-level hiring committees and various diversity and inclusion counsels. Each such system is, by definition, capping the top speed at which the company can move forward; but they are consciously introduced nonetheless, in order to keep the system resilient with respect to the forthcoming landscape changes.Axiom set two:Much like in the dichotomy above, when the company is just starting, it’s hard to distinguish what is being done in the best interest of the company, and what is just the way the founder(s) want to happen. Much like in the dichotomy above, as the organization grows, it is impossible to not observe discrepancies between what would be best for the company and what its partners and employees do.In a way, I could go as far as saying that aligning incentives in a multi-agent environment comprised of imperfect humans is probably the most difficult task that the humankind is facing today. (Accurate risk assessment would be the close second, by the way, but that would be quite a detour).In a nutshell, a team of both ultra-talented and ultra-loyal professionals would be ideal. Loyalty, by the way, is truly an underrated trait, and more and more organizations these days seem to understand that keeping someone loyal yet low-performing is at times better then hiring someone more professional but less loyal. Still, most companies settle for professionalism, while being fully aware that the majority of their workforce can and will be persuaded to look elsewhere for better prospects.Now, consider an average mid-level person. Take a wide band, from a senior-ish engineer making technical decisions that would last for a few years at least, to a new-ish board member who is invited from some investor’s side to oversee how is the business doing.Virtually no one in this role would be 100% committed to the interest of the company, even if they understood it precisely. In fact, I would go as far as saying that the capacity to understand what is the right thing to be done for the business correlates significantly with one prioritizing their own goals over the goals of the company. In other words:Looking bottom up, an engineer may decide to use a stack they always wanted to learn. It may or may not prove to be the best decision for the company looking back from the future, but the desire for this particular engineer to try out certain framework would clearly play a major role; no thorough analysis will be performed to justify or override such a decision.Top down, maybe a board member has never been on the board of a company that scaled to $10M ARR, in which case they are way more likely to greenlight a risky gamble that may get the company there. Not to mention that while the founders would want to work on their mission, which may well cost the company cash and valuation, the investors would much prefer to see their investment flourish, and, in order to accomplish this goal, they may well go as far as blocking certain decisions, which may have later been proven to be the game changers.Will modern tech giants Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook ever die out?Well, you see where am I going with this, right?Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook are the examples of extremely successful, extremely cash-positive, and extremely large companies. They operate within sustainable business models with little risks in the next few years to come.At the same time they are:So, yes. It looks obvious to me that these large companies will inevitably fail.How would that happen? They would fall victim to the changing consumer landscape, and would have no time to adjust. That’s it.What could be that change of landscape? I would loosely cluster the possibilities into two groups.Customer-based risks:Externalities:The truth is: the world does get faster. It has been the case since pretty much the Humans emerged, but today we are entering the stage whereIn other words, the idea of “I’m going to build this company that my grandkids would work for”, as well as the idea of “I am looking forward to joining the company that would pay me decent money until I retire”, are almost extinct already, and will be completely gone in the next few dozen years.Seen in this light, some “this company would sure last for another few hundred years” manifest is practically indistinguishable from “this company should be in good enough shape to last another five to ten years”. And, once this mindset is adopted widely, it would only be a matter of which move is locally optimal: keep a giant alive for another several years, or grab its best people to work on something else, effectively tanking the ship.What a fascinating time to be alive.",121 followers,Owen Keat,622,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-can-a-candidate-with-2-years-of-experience-switch-to-a-new-technology-in-IT-What-are-the-top-technologies-to-learn

So maybe a chair that easily moves around the workstation.A lot of professors tell you that you need to make sure there are no distractions such as music, movies, noises etc.Make sure and make as many friends as possible unless you’re naturally brilliant. Because you will get stuck on a regular basis and will need help.Most top students have parents that are programmers unless they are super brilliant. Others have programming buddies that help. If you have none of these, you’ll need a tutor. 70% of people I’ve tutored have been B and higher grade students.If you get anxiety during homework assignments and start looking for google solutions, I’d drive to your university CS lab and do the homework there. Make friends with everybody at the lab in case you get stuck!!! Don’t be cheap, if people are helping you, make sure and order some pizza. Don’t build a reputation as a taker!!! If someone is super helpful and they really enjoy helping you, they just might be your tutor. Ask if they want to help for a fee!Your TA can be your friend or fail you if s/he thinks you are lost. So ask calculated questions and don’t blabber. Keep your tutor sessions short and try to keep dumb questions to a minimum. You can ask paid tutors if you have stupid questions.Program. Google. Study. Program, Google. Study and so on and so forth. Don’t battle the compiler with your own logic. Research and find solutions, code and then compile. Don’t get me wrong, there will be instances that you will need to battle the compiler so you see every instance of your code. But if you keep getting errors, then it’s time to try another solution.You did this and now you’re too good. Now what?Well, your classmates will not like you now. When you discuss things with your professor they think you guys are talking Greek or German. This means you’re in trouble. Your classmates are jealous. So what do you do? There are a few ways to handle this; 1- Stop asking questions during class. They won’t be jealous anymore. Email questions or ask a tutor or a top student. 2- offer to help your classmates, but don’t start drinking with them. In fact, see if you can stay away from partying until you graduate. CS is not history or sociology. It suddenly gets complicated. You’ve been doing amazing codes and high grades, and then suddenly you get stuck. That’s when you have to ask your professor’s help or others. Don’t let your pride fail you. Ask for help.You MUST get rest and stay healthyI personally know people that drove 100 miles to take a course at a particular college. Sometimes you have to do this to succeed. You might even have to switch universities. What else can you do if things are not going well?Learn a simple programming language before you start your program. Most universities try to weed people that waste everybody’s time. So if your background is not computer science, the chances are that you won’t do very well. These universities are not a place to learn. They are a place to get a degree! So I’d learn a simple language like python and then apply for a program. I’d also read ahead. Don’t even attend a class without fully knowing the chapters that are to be covered.Best","3,705 followers",Nipun Ramakrishnan,1.6K,276,4.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-can-a-candidate-with-2-years-of-experience-switch-to-a-new-technology-in-IT-What-are-the-top-technologies-to-learn

Literally every aspect of their infrastructure is designed in-house and built by contractors in Asia.Here are two photos of yours truly showing off servers at Facebook’s datacenter in Prineville, Oregon as I was giving a tour to the press in 2013:The top photo is from a web server cluster. The bottom photo is from a “cold storage” cluster. In a web configuration they pack as many servers as possible in a rack. The cold storage racks only have two servers, with the rest of the rack being filled with storage devices, and some backup batteries.The server designs have evolvedThey build their own.

They don’t support video out for example. They’ll never be plugged into a monitor, so why bother?OEMs have to build machines that satisfy a wide audience, and have to be deployed in a wide range of facilities. Hyperscale operators like Google & Facebook have near 100% control over the deployment environments, so they can reduce the complexity of their servers drastically compared to everyone else.","100,241 followers",Marc Bodnick,730,8K,51.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-can-a-candidate-with-2-years-of-experience-switch-to-a-new-technology-in-IT-What-are-the-top-technologies-to-learn

So,Accepting new ideas.I agree with some parts of Joydeep's answer, but disagree on the education system and for not taking into account of Valley's unique culture. Fwiw, Indian educated workforce form a sizable chunk of the valley and that would invalidate the assertion that Indian startup ecosystem is weak because our education system is hostile. We need just 1000 strong iconoclasts to have a vibrant startup scene.",139 followers,Andrew Knudsen,520,134,722.1K,2013,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-source-that-has-statistics-about-number-of-developers-top-technology-companies-currently-have
