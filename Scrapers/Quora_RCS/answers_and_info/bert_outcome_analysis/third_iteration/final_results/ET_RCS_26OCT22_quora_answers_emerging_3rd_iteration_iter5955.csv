However, I never had the guts to talk to her.My “reaching out to her” was limited to my playing kabaddi while she played badminton about yards away.One day, during break, one of my classmates cracked a dirty joke about her and I felt unduly offended. I warned him not to do that again.Triggered by my reaction, he made a more provocative statement about her.SNAP.In a few seconds, he and I were rolling on the ground, grappling each other. A pretty decent crowd started gathering around, but no one bothered to stop us.He was bigger and stronger than me. It was totally a rush of adrenaline. Somehow, I managed to break one of his teeth. He was bleeding profusely.A day later, the two families were summoned to the school for a meeting. After an hour of discussion, he and I were made to apologize to each other.Somehow, we reached a middle ground. The drama was over, I thought.But my mother had other plans.The next day, she accompanied me to the school. While we were on the way, I kept asking her why she was coming with me. She would not answer.She was waiting at the reception area. The classes started and when the break arrived, she marched into my class pretty aggressively.It would be an understatement if I said I was scared. What now? What next?As the whole class was watching, she pulled me toward herself and demanded that I apologize to him right there.I groaned in hesitation, but her eyes were fixed on me and those were stern. I could see righteous anger in her eyes.I mustered all the strength in me and mumbled “I am sorry” as he smiled a little, looking confused. “Say that louder,” my mom roared.“I am sorry,” I said a little louder and in a more shaky voice. I almost cried. In my head, I had killed him a thousand times within those few seconds.I felt insulted, humiliated and I was definitively convinced that my mother was wrong and stupid. That night, during dinner, I asked her why she shamed me in front of so many students and teachers.“You shamed him in public and apologized within four walls. How is that fair?” she said, as she served me food.Though I felt some logic in her words, I did not buy that totally. I was young, immature.Ten years later.I was invigilating an exam and I disqualified a student’s work because I was sure he was copying. Every symptom persuaded me to believe that.He did not argue because it was a rule there; whatever the invigilator says goes. I grabbed his papers and asked him to exit the class. He did.The next day, in a bit of uncertainty, I checked the camera footages and heck, I found that he had not been copying, but merely looking toward the other side.I checked the footage for all the instances that I had assumed to be suspicious.I was wrong. He was right. It hit me hard.The next week, in a similar test, before I could hand over the question papers, I stood in front of everyone and said this:“Uh..hmm..guys, a minute please. I guess …uh….I owe an apology to Rohan. He was not copying in his test last week. It was …uh…..my error in judgement. I am ….uh……sorry, Rohan. You will write the test again.”Every word wrestled me and crept out of my mouth begrudgingly.Trust me, it took a lot of courage and power to say that. Everyone beamed. Rohan stood up and said thanks.He was given a re-test later that week.That night, while I was talking to my mother over the phone, I told her this. We also spoke of what had happened ten years ago.She said “Ben…”And, after a short pause, she continued “…seems like you have matured, darling.”There was a brief silence. I could hear her wiping off her tears and adjusting her slightly-trembling voice.“I am glad that I raised you, Ben.”That is when I realized I finally matured.Nothing like being raised by a Lioness :)","2,556 followers",Sarvpriya Srivastava,3.9K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-past-technology-has-over-time-become-used-in-a-more-mature-manner-in-comparison-to-its-first-emergence

Created during the Great Depression, the TVA, along with the Rural Electrification Act, brought cheap, reliable electricity to areas of the United States that had never seen a lightbulb.  The TVA dammed rivers, built giant power plants, supplied the enormous amounts of energy needed for the Manhattan Project and created one of the first reliable, centrally controlled electric grids in the world.

7,"In my opinion, there are two reasons for extended response times in EMS. I’ve only ever worked EMS in large cities, so these responses will be from that point of view. Rural EMS has its own problems that are separate and unique.The first reason for long response times is simple, traffic. When you work in a city and you need to get somewhere at rush hour, sirens and flashing lights are not going to help because there’s simply no place for the cars to move to so the ambulance can pass. Related to this is funding, when stations are closed and people are laid off, there are fewer ambulances and crIn my opinion, there are two reasons for extended response times in EMS. I’ve only ever worked EMS in large cities, so these responses will be from that point of view. Rural EMS has its own problems that are separate and unique.The first reason for long response times is simple, traffic. When you work in a city and you need to get somewhere at rush hour, sirens and flashing lights are not going to help because there’s simply no place for the cars to move to so the ambulance can pass. Related to this is funding, when stations are closed and people are laid off, there are fewer ambulances and crews must drive further to reach the calls. To solve this problem would require more funding for more ambulance stations strategically placed around cities and massive changes to city planning efforts to reduce traffic congestion or add emergency traffic lanes (maybe like bus lanes?). Until someone invents flying ambulances this will remain a major problem.The second is more complicated and has to do with the number of non-Emergency 911 calls that EMS must respond to. The ambulance has to respond to every call, regardless of whether the dispatcher actually thinks it’s an emergency. Ambulance crews get tied up helping people with minor toe pain or a cough and cannot respond to calls of a higher priority. Sometimes, when you work in a large city, you can pass these calls on to one of the private services, but not always, they’re very busy too for different reasons. You cannot simply leave a patient once you have started to treat them, that’s abandonment and you’ll be fired, have your license revoked or be sent to prison in the worst case. Solving this problem would require a massive public education campaign on what qualifies as an emergency. Related to this problem is the issue of people using the Emergency Room as their primary care physician because they do not have insurance. Fixing that problem would require true and affordable universal healthcare.

Progress is bred from necessity, of course, as growing global concerns about global warming and ecological damage caused by pollution call for cleaner, sustainable energy.2. Solar EnergyMuch like wind energy, solar energy has seen an increase in efficiency and a decrease in price in recent years, making solar power a $3-billion industry. New legislation and regulations which make it affordable for businesses and homeowners to convert to solar are responsible for solar energy’s growth over the past 5 y1.

Progress is bred from necessity, of course, as growing global concerns about global warming and ecological damage caused by pollution call for cleaner, sustainable energy.2. Solar EnergyMuch like wind energy, solar energy has seen an increase in efficiency and a decrease in price in recent years, making solar power a $3-billion industry. New legislation and regulations which make it affordable for businesses and homeowners to convert to solar are responsible for solar energy’s growth over the past 5 years, and 2016 will be no different.While only a third of the solar energy available in the US is currently harnessed in the west, this area is geographically superior for solar power generation, and improved government incentives in California indicate this will be the fastest-growing market.3. 3D PrintingThe new millennium has brought us some mind-blowing technology, but none has more potential for impacting the entire world quite like 3D printing.If you’re not familiar with the concept, 3D printers are loaded with additives which can be used like ink to create 3-dimensional objects. That’s4. Legal MarijuanaLegal marijuana sales have grown exponentially since 2012, when Colorado legalized the drug and created the world’s first fully regulated market for recreational marijuana use. In addition to selling the raw plant, it is also being sold as concentrates, edibles, and even beauty products in order to expand the market.Marijuana sales are expected to surpass $20 billion between now and 2020, and that’s if the market stays its course. If other states legalize recreational marijuana use in that time, the industry could experience even greater success.5. Video GamesOver the years, video game developers have been expanding their appeal to reach new markets, including adults and females. This effort has been paid back many times, as the video game industry commands healthy growth year after year. Consumer confidence continues to improve, and there is speculative excitement regarding new virtual reality (VR) technology.While VR will certainly have an effect on the gaming industry, it also has potential in other markets. Whether or not other industries will adopt VR for practical purposes, such as training medical professionals, remains to be seen.6. Artificial IntelligenceFor having come so far, artificial intelligence still has a long way to go. With hopes that AI will one day be able to help solve humanity’s most pressing concerns, billions of dollars fund the research of artificial intelligence every year. Major players include IT companies like Google and Apple, who are already leaders in the field, providing us with such AI amenities as voice-recognition software and self-driving cars.Experts expect the global demand for “smart” machines will increase 20% every year until at least 2020.7. Sustainable Construction MaterialsIn the wake of an international recession, many countries, including the United States, are creating an initiative to boost construction jobs. There are plenty of post-industrial sites around the developed world which need to be rebuilt, and much like the call for sustainable energy sources, governments and consumers alike are calling for greener building materials.Green construction is currently a $36-billion industry, and it is expected to grow an additional 10% by 2020.This industry depends heavily on consumer demand, and may have an even greater outlook with increased government regulations and successful marketing.8. Cyber Fraud DetectionWhere there’s an opportunity to make a quick buck, be sure that there are criminals out there concocting a plan. The trend of doing business and keeping sensitive information on computers will increase, and so will the demand for protection against cyber criminals.Businesses and individuals alike will require protection from cyber fraud for the foreseeable future, but in the next 5 years, this industry is expected to grow over 12% annually.9. DronesDrone technology is new, but the potential for application in a variety of other industries including agriculture, the military, and parcel delivery have already caught the attention of investors. This creates an excellent opportunity in the market to expand research and development of drones, making them more viable with each in iteration. With a projected annual growth of almost 17% annually until 2022, very little is likely to stifle the growth of this industry.10. SiliconRelated to the demand for solar panels, silicon has also been a slowly but steadily growing market in the past decades. In addition to solar panels, silicon is also required to make electronics and building materials, which you may notice are also on this list. For this reason, experts expect to see silicon’s demand increase in the coming years as other industries take hold.These 10 industries show tremendous potential in 2016 and beyond, indicating a future of environmental consciousness and an even greater focus on electronics and AI.","10,419 followers",Nathan Ketsdever,657,48.3K,22.2M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-past-technology-has-over-time-become-used-in-a-more-mature-manner-in-comparison-to-its-first-emergence

The biggest deals on the table (at the time of writing this answer) are the sale of Mistral helicopter-carriers (along with submarines) to Russia and Brazil.Furthermore, and unlike most countries, France is able to project its forces far from its homeland. That is thanks to military bases in United Arab Emirates (another client for French-made weapons), the French Carribeans, South Pacific (Wallis and Futuna) and many others (notably in Africa).GeopoliticsAlong with Germany, France is a founding member of the European Union and, as such, wields enormous influence over European affairs. For example, it is after the French refusal of the 2005 proposal for a European Constitution that the project was amended into the Lisbon Treaty (now in force).For better or for worse, France has been a driving force of African politics for the better part of the 20th century. Obviously, that was due in large part to France's colonial past. However, there are remnants of that colonial past to this day. Fourteen African countries use what is called the CFA Franc. It is an artificial currency pegged to euro. Its value is fixed by the French Public Treasury and backed by deposits of gold from these African countries to the Bank of France. Since the CFA Franc is not directly convertible in any other currency but the Euro, France effectively has the levers of macroeconomic policy of 14 African countries (the better part of the countries surrounding the Gulf of Guinea).Let's also add that since the founding of the UN, France has had a permanent seat at the Security Council (with a veto right). French is also one of the official languages of the UN.There is also what could be called a tradition of having a French at the head of the International Monetary Fund (Michel Camdessus, Dominique Strauss-Kahn et Christine Lagarde are the most memorable).EconomyFrance is an economic powerhouse (roughly the size of California). It is a world leader in Energy (Total, Alstom, Areva), Construction (Vinci, Bouygues), Telecommunications (Orange), Automobile (Renault-Nissan), Pharmaceutics (Sanofi-Aventis), Telecommunications (Alcatel-Lucent), Chemistry (Air Liquide) and many others.A CapGemini World Wealth Report recently showed that France is tied with the UK when it comes to number a millionaires in USD (at 430 000 on a population of 65 million).Eurostat (the EU's statistics agency) has establish that French workers have the highest hourly productivity in Europe (beating the Germans and Swedes). France has, in the last decades, consistently ranked among the most productive nations in the world.AgricultureFrom times immemorial, France was the granary of Europe (which made it self-sufficient long before many other European countries). In his Commentaries on the Gallic Wars (Commentarii de Bello Gallico), Julius Ceasar recounts how tribes coming from today's Germany tried to conquer Gaul to seize its fertile soils.Nowadays, it is still an agricultural powerhouse. As of 2008, it received a fifth of the annual 130 billion euros invested annually by the EU in agriculture (Common Agricultural Policy).Cultural influenceThe French language is an important element of France's soft power. It is spoken by anywhere between 220 and 292 million people. A study by Natixis Bank (cited by Forbes) even goes as far as predicting that French will be the most widely spoken language in the coming decades. In any event, with the use of French, comes enormous cultural influence. That influence also has an institutional basis. Since 1637, the Académie Française has standardized, organised and rationalised the French language thus setting the rules followed by tens of millions of people across the globe.Since the 1990s, France sits on top of world tourism rankings (Paris being the most visited city in the world) thus spreading its culture and history. Actually, Paris's aura is such that during WWII Hitler specifically prohibited the LuftWaffe from bombing the city in order to preserve its beauty.Is it even necessary to mention its literature, its philosophers, its gastronomy (which has been declared to be part of the world's intangible heritage)? Those cultural attributes draws over 260 000 foreign students each year who leave the country with a head of French values and art de vivre.ConclusionOne could go on and on about France. The bottom line is that it is a country that draws its power from a rich and ancient history, a long tradition of innovation and intellectual pursuit.","3,432 followers",Ziaddinè Chahoudi,817,3.4K,10.1M,2014,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-examples-of-technological-achievements-during-times-of-emergency

The market isn’t just for export however: by 2050 Nigeria is expected to be the third most populous nation on the planet and hundreds of millions of autos will carpet the land, each needing gasoline every day.I live in the rapidly expanding capital, Abuja, but Nigeria’s combination of religious fervor (both Christians and Muslims here agree on having lots of kids), a relatively young median age, and the constant mixing of some of the most confident, fast talking, and aggressive individuals guarantees the obvious: traffic is going to get heavier, and the country more crowded.Nigerians are a rightly upbeat lot; in spite of rampant poverty they’ve been named the happiest people in more than few online surveys. Faith runs deep here, in church, mosque, and street alike. Luck and good news is just around the corner, the pastor promising a year without wahalla.So why? Because one in six Africans are Nigerians, because Job never gave up and neither will they, because, Inshallah, life will get better no matter the value of the Naira.God bless Nigeria.",0 followers,Chris Mackay,1.3K,147,1.7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-examples-of-technological-achievements-during-times-of-emergency

They're excelling in their financial reforms, India's current government is focusing more on exporting rather than importing which will eventually establish India as a manufacturing hub.As per InternatIt would beMany might say “but what about China?” Well, I consider China somewhat of a superpower already.But let's try to know why India could be the answer to this question.Economic Strength and Rise —India is currently the 3rd largest economy by GDP Purchasing Power and the 5th largest economy at current exchange rates ($3.5 trillion).India is growing at a very fast pace. They're excelling in their financial reforms, India's current government is focusing more on exporting rather than importing which will eventually establish India as a manufacturing hub.As per International monetory fund, below are the average growth rate the major countries will be having in 2022 —India — 8.2%China — 4.4%USA — 3.7%Russia — - 8.5%India's Economic Diversity —India's diversification of it's economy is also a big reason for India's huge rise. As our world is moving towards the new age, the world is relying on softwares and IT now. India's huge software and IT industry is almost invincible in that regard.So much that even the Mega Super Developed USA is dependent on India for IT services today.India's stock market is also changing rapidly. Just last year, Indian stock market surpassed French stock market to become the 5th most valued stock market upon beating UK, Canada and Saudi Arabia.Latest Edit —IndiaIndia's Foreign Relations —We have also observed India's sudden change in reaction towards global matters.From my understanding of geopolitical changes, India has adopted an aggressive stance over a defensive one for now.In the past 3 years, India has made it's presence known all over the world. From doing humanitarian activities across the globe to influencing their neighbours who were once their enemies.The Colossal Connection (India-US bond) —India-US relations have also changed drastically where USA who now sees India as a major strategical partner and is supporting India's rise in Asia for the moment, once was anti-India.According to USA's Indo-Pacific strategy, it considersOver the past decade, the closeness between India and USA has grown a lot. They've signed multiple Military and Information sharing pacts with each other as well and I'm sure many more are coming in near future.According to America's own diplomats “USA needs India more than India needs USA ”.But USA has it's own motives. China will surpass USA in almost everything by the end of this decade which will eventually end the Western Hegemony.India is the only country which can counter China in the current scenario. A strong and powerful India is in USA's best interests for now and America will do everything possible to keep things that way.So the West will keep supporting India as long as they see a threat in China and Russia.India's Masterpiece of a Foreign Policy —India is among the few countries in the world which can play both Russia and USA at the same time.India is nearly immune to Western sanctions and also gets to trade with sanctioned countries like Russia and Iran and I can't think of any other country which can do the same.I can write a lot more but I believe these are enough points.","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,631,1.5K,2.9M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-examples-of-technological-achievements-during-times-of-emergency
