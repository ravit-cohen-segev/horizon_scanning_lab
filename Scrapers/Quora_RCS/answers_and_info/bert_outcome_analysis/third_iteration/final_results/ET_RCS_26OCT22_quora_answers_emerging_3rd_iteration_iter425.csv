Bluetooth with 'insecure connections' (like Firechat on Android) could work in theory, but doesn't perform very well in practice. Multi-peer connectivity framework works perfectly with iOS devices but nothing else.In terms of API/SDKs for P2P, the closest I could find is AllJoyn (now AllSeenAlliance).

It's designed for IoT and it only works fine if the devices are connected to the internet and on the same wifi network (which is bullshit). Another one could be OpenPeer SDK for iOS and Android which is just P2P communications over the internet.The Serval project have a daemon for WiFi P2P communications on Android (called ServalDNA; multi-hop if device is rooted) but it's pretty fucking complicated to understand and integrate into an app.For protocols and other tech, you have WiFi ad-hoc networking which works on tinkered and rooted Android devices, OLSR, SPAN and BATMAN (nanananana).","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,632,1.5K,2.9M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-alternatives-to-an-Open-Garden-mesh-routing-P2P-technology-that-offer-an-API-SDK-for-others-to-develop-on-top-of-it
1,"If I were you, I would have ignored the importance of that ranking issue. To get one, and top one, paper work should be done, digits/numbers talk about material capabilities. But the core of the university’s role is just one item in many. The core is the quality of education given in the classroom, who provides/how he/she provides and who receive, and also the achievements of the research labs.As long as you are content that the core of the university’s mission is being done, ranking is just like the medals the top military men and women wear at celebrations. A surface decoration.","30,688 followers",Noam Kaiser,1.3K,3.5K,29.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-alternatives-to-an-Open-Garden-mesh-routing-P2P-technology-that-offer-an-API-SDK-for-others-to-develop-on-top-of-it
2,"I’m not sure why you care about this question. Israeli universities are definitely excellent, but these ranking systems are flawed and frankly rather silly. They create some kind of false impression of quality being tied to their own ranking. This is patently false. Every school has strengths and weaknesses. The ranking systems tend to be biased in favor of research universities where undergraduatI’m not sure why you care about this question.

3,"There are nearly 200 states in the world. Most of them have multiple universities. Perhaps there are at least 100 universities in the world ahead of the Israeli schools. Like you, I would have expected some Israeli schools to be at or near the top.If we were privy to the sorting criteria, it might go a long way to explaining the order of the results.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,14.3K,5.6K,427M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-there-no-universities-in-the-top-100-despite-Israel-being-so-advanced-in-technology

5,"Depends on the filed. In nanotechnology? Yes. In terms of high tech? Yes. In innovation? Yes The Global Competitiveness Report of 2016 to 2017 ranked Israel as having the world's second most innovative economy on the globe. In solar energy? Yes[1]. In cyber? Yes. In medecine? In medical research Israel is by far better than both and it is best in the world per capita[2]. In practical medcine IsraeDepends on the filed. In nanotechnology? Yes. In terms of high tech? Yes. In innovation? Yes The Global Competitiveness Report of 2016 to 2017 ranked Israel as having the world's second most innovative economy on the globe. In solar energy? Yes[1]. In cyber? Yes. In medecine? In medical research Israel is by far better than both and it is best in the world per capita[2]. In practical medcine Israel is about the same as Japan and better than Germany. For example in all major cancers survival ranking rates Israel is placed far higher than Germany and usually in top 3 or 5 in the world. In male life expectancy Israel is ranked higher than both, if you factor out war related deaths and terroist attacks Israel takes the first place in the world with ease [3]. In air force[4] and intelligence? Yes . I would argue that israel is even more advanced than the USA in Cyber and intelligence[5]. It's just that Israel does much more classified work which is desperately kept discreet. Israel is more advanced than both in agriculture and farming related science and inventions. Israel is more advanced than both in terms of patents and creative scientific publications per capita. Israel has more academic educated people than both of them per capita. In the modern era Israel has put out more world first-class mathematicians, computer scientists, musicians and chess players than both[6] . Israel has many top class computer scientists and is a superpower in computer science [7]. Israel has won more Turing awards for computer science than both of them combined not even per capita ( per capita Israel is no. 1 in the world). The list goes on and on. The problem is that mostly these things are not so prominent to the average people because they are just good on measures of ‘per capita ‘ and ‘average ‘. But the fact that these countries are at least ten times Israel’s size confuse us and make them in some sense more prominent . For example, there are more academic degree holders in Israel per capita than in Germany , but there are probably more degree holders in Germany in terms of absolute numbers than Israel so eventually it should make Germany stronger and more advanced but only due to the bulk got me??? Israel is almost the best in academic publications , inventions and stuff. And Israel has the highest number of scientists and technicians per capita in the whole world, but it is also very very very VERY small which lets other countries catch up with it in absolute numbers.Now imagine how would Israel have looked like if it was 10 times bigger (80000000 ppl) ? Scarry , isn't it? Too strong to compete with.[1] From Wikipedia “Israeli engineers have been at the cutting edge of solar energy technology” it doesn't specify what it means. But it does provide a hint that Israel was a pioneer in solar energy since 1950. And Wikipedia states that “Israel is now the world leader in the use of solar energy per capita”[2] From Wikipedia “Israel is a world leader in medical and paramedical research, and bioengineering capabilities. Biotechnology, medical, and clinical research account for over half of Israel's scientific publications, and the industrial sector uses this extensive knowledge to develop new pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, and treatment therapies.[67] Among other areas of medicine, Israel is a leader in stem cell research, with the largest number of articles, patents and research studies per capita,[68] as well as research into regenerative medicine and medical marijuana.”[3] Israel is ranked no. 2 in the world for male life expectancy. Wars in Israel are far more common than in Germany and Japan. Wars take the average down pretty significantly due to the re...","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,632,1.5K,2.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-there-no-universities-in-the-top-100-despite-Israel-being-so-advanced-in-technology
