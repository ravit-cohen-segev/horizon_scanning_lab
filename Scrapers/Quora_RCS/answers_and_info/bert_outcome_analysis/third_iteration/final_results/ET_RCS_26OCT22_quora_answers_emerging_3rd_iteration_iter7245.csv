Also been to France a lot, and speak fluent French.And I now live in the UK, in London.All of that to say this much: I've been exposed to a lot, both living and touring, and as far as I am concerned,I lived in Ireland for nearly 4 years, and let me tell you... you won't find a people so eager to get to know you, help you out, and drink you under the table, as the Irish.And they all seem to know each other, even in a city like Dublin. There's no ""six degrees of separation"" here; it's more like ""2 degrees"", because it seems there's always ""a friend of mine who does know 'yer man' Paddy.""In rural Ireland, it's even more marked. If you're going around looking for an address, and stop to ask someone, they'll most likely tell you, ""Nevermind that - who ye lookin' fer?""... and they'll point you in the right direction. Personal experience, and not just mine.Here's another personal experience. My first night in Dublin, after moving there, I went to the local pub next to the hotel where I was staying. The Six Nations Rugby tournament was going on. As much as I liked watching it, I couldn't understand why it was being played the way it was.This must have been obvious on my face, as one fella turned to me and said, ""Yer not makin' any sense o' this, are ya? Sure, look... see yer man with the ball?… now, he has to…"" and explained everything... amidst I can't remember HOW many pints of Guinness which I was never asked to order or pay for (and I did offer to)!And how about this one? My wife and I were on vacation in Galway, visiting as tourists; this was about 2 years before we actually moved to Ireland. We hadn't booked any hotels, we'd just come in by train from Dublin, and we were trying to get our bearings on the map. An elderly lady well into her 70's (if not early 80’s), carrying shopping bags came up to us, asking if we were lost.We told her we were just trying to figure out in which directions the hotels were, on the map. She looked at us, and said, ""Look, my son's away for the week-end, and I'm by myself in the house. If the two of ye want a room, you're welcome to keep me company!""And we did! Her name was Carmel, bless her... and she even made us breakfast the next morning. Wonder if she’s even still alive? This was over 15 years ago; I never did go back to check, though I remember exactly where her house is.That said, even today - more than 10 years after I’ve left Ireland - the closest, dearest friends I have kept in my circle are the Irish ones I made in my time living there… still today. Anyhow, all this to tell you… the nicest and friendliest people you'll ever meet are in","1,728 followers",Alex Neuenfeld,1.1K,2.8K,4.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-most-developed-European-country

When I heard the doctor tell her “six months”, it felt likeI met my wife, Jess, twenty-one years ago when she was nineteen.Our parents owned side-by-side cabins in the northern part of New York and we both happened to be along for the week-long hunting trip our fathers planned that year.Jess' father was a skilled hunter and could hit a headshot from a mile away — same as my dad.Jess and I didn't hunt with them — we hung out by the lake.The moment I saw Jess I fell in love. We've been together ever since.But now, now that she has an expiration date, I just don't know what to do — I'm scared and lost.Monday morning at work I was telling my best friend and supervisor, Timmy, about my wife's condition. Timmy told me that I.T. or Intelligent Terrestrial just came out with their latest models.These models are different than those of yesteryear because they are 52% mechanical and 48% biological.Timmy said all you have to do is mail a sample of DNA to I.T. and upload a digital copy of your consciousness through an app. You can then purchase a custom made clone at an age of your choice. When the clone arrives it will turn on, study it's surroundings and await a consciousness download.“Oh my God Timmy, what's the catch?”“The price, Leon.”When I got home from work, Jess and I plugged in and uploaded a digital copy of our entire conscious catalog to I.T. and then mailed off DNA samples.Jess asked me what age I wanted her to be. It felt awkward to say “twenty”, but I did it — I was honest. I miss her smooth, youthful skin and I want her to be young and healthy — especially if I have to cash my entire 401K in to afford it.We told her parents that we were going to basically bring her back from the dead and her father threatened to shoot any abomination that we brought into this world.One month later, on a day that Jess was particularly ill, the doorbell rang.Jess and I dragged the box through the door and laid it on the living room floor. I gently cut along the lines and when I opened the flaps, there,she,was.The last time my heart fluttered like this was the day I met her.Jess helped me lift I.T. out of the box and sit I.T. up.I.T. was warm and soft. I.T. was mine. I paid for I.T. I own I.T.Machines like this don't have rights — even though they are part biological, the governments recognize them in the same way they would a lawnmower — so, as I said, I.T. is my possession.The science behind uploading a digital consciousness is so cutting edge, that the laws just haven't caught up yet.Jess turned I.T. on and I.T. looked right into my eyes. I was in love — with two women, but, it was the same woman. We hadn't uploaded Jess' consciousness yet, so, I.T. was running on basic programming, but I.T. was gorgeous.Jess asked me what I wanted to do, and for the first time in a very long time — I lied to her.I told her we should go shopping and buy I.T. some clothes.I.T. doesn't seem to have a personality yet.“Hello…. Smile…”Jess picked outfits for both of them and we went for a walk through the park together. It was amazing — I was so happy.We walked down a cozy little trail and found a tuck away to sit and talk.I.T. watched and studied every move Jess and I made. I.T. was learning and adapting.I.T. was becoming aware.At one point Jess and I got distracted and I.T. wandered off. When we found I.T., I.T. was gazing at the sky.I asked I.T. what it was doing. I.T. said, “Where do I come from?”“You come from Heaven. You are my angel.”That answer seemed to work for I.T. We all walked back to the car and headed home.When we got home, Jess immediately started coughing. She fell to the ground and I tried to help her, but I didn't know what to do.Jess passed away right then. It was finally over.I called her family and the police. It took an hour for them to remove the body. I had Jess 2.0 sitting in my back room waiting for them to leave.After the police left, I plugged I.T. into my laptop and downloaded Jess' consciousness.After the download was complete, we walked outside and I looked into her gigantic brown eyes. I asked her, “Is it you, Jess?”She smiled and said, “It is, silly — now kiss me.”Her head slammed back. I didn't know if she was glitching or what and then I heard a bang and saw a hole above her left eye.My beautiful Jessica died twice today. I was crushed.Over the next two decades, I fell into a deep, dark, alcohol-fueled depression. Although I had developed a serious alcohol problem, I was able to work and save every single penny I earned.After twenty years of saving, I decided I wanted both of them back — the twenty-year-old Jess and the forty-year-old Jess.I sent my entire life savings off to I.T. and in one month, my doorbell rang.I cut the box open and wept when I saw my angel(s).I turned them on.I also clothed them. The younger version of me may have left them in the nude, but at this age, I just want my companion(s) back.The ladies helped me back to my room to lay down. I was so tired from all the excitement.I've waited and worked an entire lifetime to be with the woman I love. And now, at long last — she is beside me.I died, on that very night as a happy man.One day later, the doorbell rang. It seems my beautiful Jessicas used my direct deposit life insurance benefit to make a purchase.They gently cut the box open.And turned me on.You ask where technology will be in 2050?We will be everywhere.LeonSpecial thanks:Cameron — Dear friend.

The Martian terraforming project is a sticking point for me, as it's not just a question of bringing in material.  Mars just isn't capable of supporting a thick atmosphere anymore, and no amount of surface renovation will change that.  I'm hoping that when they talk about terraforming what they really mean is massive enclosed domes that can support an earth-like atmosphere, but I'll give them that if I have to.  Their ships work and fight pretty much exactly like they should (though the idea of a ""stealth ship"" in space is a wee bit iffy) and their astroid stations rely on rotational gravity as opposed to some exotic tech.The language... eh, that does seem a little far out for me to have happened naturally given that languages seem to be becoming more stable, not less, but I can conceive of a new language being deliberately created and fostered as a means of establishing a new social and cultural identity.Really the only areas that I think it fails the technological realism test is in the consumer electronics.  Those little holographic displays they have that project an image in the air? Yeah, that just doesn't work.  You just can't do a volumentric projection onto a transparent medium like that.
