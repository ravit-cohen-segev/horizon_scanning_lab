I would like to highlight that this is the same technology that the United States has been working on but has no breakthrough, not even close.As I stressed in my other replies, United States wants to contain Huawei, but global companies including US companies are not interested in obeying United States commands, and will always find ways around it.On June 15, Liu Yunjie, academician of the Chinese Academy of engineering, said that Nanjing Zijinshan Laboratory of network communication and security had developed a CMOS millimeter wave fully integrated 4-channel phased array chip, and completed chip packaging and testing, with the cost per channel reduced from 1000 yuan to 20 yuan. At the same time, they package millimeter wave large-scale active antenna array with 1024 channel antenna unit. Chips and antenna arrays are expected to be commercially used in 5g systems in 2022.Huachuang Securities pointed out that in order to establish a broadband communication network covering every corner of the world and eliminate signal blind spots, it is necessary to promote the commercial implementation of broadband satellite communication and 5G millimeter wave communication. Millimeter wave communication spectrum resources are rich. In 5G era, millimeter wave frequency band is chosen, and the speed is like upgrading a single lane to a ten Lane. Broadband satellite communication technology can cover all corners of the world.At present, the level of T / R module of submicron optical technology is in the leading position in China. The millimeter wave power amplifier for 5G communication has been developed successfully.After years of investment, the millimeter wave RF front-end chip has achieved a technological breakthrough from 24GHz to 43GHZ.Chengchang technology, a subsidiary of Hetai, is mainly engaged in the R & D, production and sales of microwave and millimeter wave RF chips. It is the only private enterprise in the field of microwave and millimeter wave RF chips in China that has mastered the core technology.Xi'an Hengda, a defense subsidiary of rec, has a practical business contract with Huawei in the field of millimeter wave 5G communication this year.",196 followers,Gordon Styles,1.1K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Can-you-trust-PragerU-I-watched-many-of-their-videos-and-while-I-found-some-things-educational-everything-else-seems-to-be-misinformation-or-them-contradicting-themselves

They don't feel pain, they obey orders without question, they can examine new information in a much shorter span of time, they can relay said information instantaneously, and they're cheap. Very cheap.Let's keep in mind here that, due in part to the Iron Men turning on humanity, the Imperium heavily dislikes almost any form of automated work, to the point that they'd rather use lobotomized human brains to run their stuff than computer networks, and the development of AI is considered tech-heresy. Humanity in the DAoT had no such inclinations; therefore, they see no need to create expensive gene-soldiers when they can just use the infinitely more reliable Men of Iron, whose only actual expense comes from the administrative AI, not the robots themselves.Oh sure, a Space Marine will be able to take down a single one of these drones, but it doesn't matter since you can make a whole lot of them for only the fraction of the cost of a Space Marine. These things can be made on an assembly line by the local AI and sent into combat as soon as they're ready, as opposed to a Space Marine which requires YEARS of training just to become a scout.Of course, we do know that the Iron Men didn't exactly work out as intended, but that in fact only bolsters the proof of their reliability: they didn't just fight the galaxy to a standstill, they came close to WINNING.However, I imagine in the years of the Iron War, Space Marine lookalikes became a lot more common, as normal, squishy, weak humans don't fare so well against such polished war machines of steel.",11 followers,Afendi Hamat,548,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Can-you-trust-PragerU-I-watched-many-of-their-videos-and-while-I-found-some-things-educational-everything-else-seems-to-be-misinformation-or-them-contradicting-themselves

14,"TLDR — it is likely humans were augmented to higher levels than Astartes during the DAoT anyway, though in a more elegant manner.

Astartes are a crude and brutish imitation of their Primarchs, and very much lesser than the Custodes, the Emperor's greatest work. You also have to keep in mind that The Emperor had to essentially learn huge amounts of knowledge in a short time, in a post-apocalyptic scenario, with limited technology/science at his disposal, to create the Primarchs, which were his primary focus, and the Astartes were a side project, essentially a bastardization of the Custodes and Primarchs that was designed for mass production. It is EXTREMELY likely that they are inferior to anything the DAoT scientist's could come up with in regards to a transhuman force, and the level of DAoT science was such that they didn't need such a force, because it would be inefficient and far less effective than what they did have. An Astartes would likely be killed extremely quickly by a basic MoI drone (equipped with weaponry likely superior to Volkite pattern firearms which can slice through ceramite and vaporise flesh instantly) which is itself slaved to a vastly intelligent overseer AI that would instantly recieve and analyse combat data to make the drone more effective. The whole point of 30/40 K is that all the civilizations are degraded, and the Astartes are simply the best hand left to a decaying humanity, they were never meant to be a permanent solution even in that setting.Full discussion below:Other's have rightly mentioned the Men of Iron/Steel, who essentially performed as the standing military force of DAoT civilization/s. They likely did have some human component, but like any automated process that involves up-skilling of labour, the human equivalent of a soldier would have very likely been a field engineer tasked to the overseer AI in charge of the division to ensure everything went smoothly. We know that humans still had something akin to a navy, where larger ships were captained by humans linked to AI, but smaller vessels were likely automated like the ground forces. We know that predator tanks were essentially used as a cheap automated method of pest (Ork) control on frontier worlds, this is a civilization that fielded one of the most powerful battle tanks in the Imperium, which are fairly difficult for Astartes Chapters to replace, as a mass-produced automated garbage (Ork) disposal that was so effective the Ork species, one of the biggest threats to the current Imperium, which are basically impossible to eradicate unless you spend decades burning every inch of infestation and of whom a huge WAAAAGH can spread out of pretty much nothing if given even a brief repose, became nothing more than a backwater pest that was essentially forced into peace with humanity through force of arms (because they had no hope of actually winning an engagement and it wasn't even a fight).This is a civilization with weaponry so advanced that it can drag you BACKWARDS through space-time to ensure shots hit you, that could essentially control the warp through technological means, and whom had advanced to such a degree that they faced little to no threat from anything in the Galaxy, they essentially had full mastery over the space they inhabited. They automated many aspects of their society, including warfare, because it was simply more efficient to do so, and because their weapons were so advanced that they were never pushed past the limits of their machines. If even the Tyranids had attacked the DAoT human civilization/s the hive fleets would have been quickly exterminated, I imagine more would come, but between them and the Eldar (who were even more advanced) they likely could have beaten off the expeditionary forces of the hive mind with relatively little trouble. They frankly did not need human soldiers at this period of time, they weren't necessary, and if anything would have simply gotten in the way of the far superior AI warmachines.Onto the Space Marines before this becomes a fully fledged essay. The Astartes were a stop-gap measure implemented by the Emperor because he needed a large, and largely expendable, force to retake the galaxy. They were a simplification of the process he used to make the Custodes, his finest work (in light of the fact they are both incredibly effective AND still entirely loyal), and the Primarchs, who were his greatest piece of genetic engineering combined with his mighty space-magic (and deals with space-hell). The Emperor used these methods for two reasons, firstly the entirety of humanity had just been rent asunder by the AI revolution, and secondly the technological level of his ward-species had just dropped by several millenia. He could not use machines, if he had the choice, and hadn't just come out of an AI apocalypse, he certainly would have. The Astartes are simply his morr modern version of the Thunder Warriors, he cobbled them together from bits and pieces of various remnant DAoT science and technology, and he intended them to be used to fulfill a specific goal. In regards to the Astartes he had to speed up their development after the loss of the Primarchs, and the urgent need for the Great Crusade, and he likely would have come back to finish them off at a later date. The Primaris project is very likely descended from The Emperor's original aims for a more compelte Astartes. The Custodes themselves are perhaps the pinnacle of engineered humans in the Imperium, the finest warriors bar the Primarchs, but even the Custodes pale in comparison to the effectiveness and efficiency of the DAoT warmachines. You have to keep in mind that the entirety of the Emperor's work has been done in what is essentially a futuristic Mad Max environment. Almost all knowledge was lost relative to the DAoT datasphere, and even The Man himself still had to search out DAoT caches and information to complete his work. From what we know The Emperor also became a scientist because he HAD TO, everyone from the age of enlightenment with the knowledge he needed was dead, the galaxy was crumbling, and he had to take charge.From this fact I suggest that even though the Emperor is perhaps the finest genetic engineer in the Galaxy during his days as the physical figurehead of humanity, that even his science pales in comparison to the DAoT. The science available to these people allowed them to create Psykers at will, to live indefinite life-spans, and I think any given person could have EASILY become an equal of a space marine through somatic cell gene therapy in combination with advanced transhuman augmentations. It would likely not be uncommon for people to be both genetically and cybernetically enhanced (with nanotechnology not the Imperium's horrific analogue) to a point that they were certainly transhuman, and in a much more elegant manner than the crude and brutish (by their standards) Astartes.When you think of the Astartes in regards to DAoT humanity, you have to keep in mind that this isn't the pinnacle of warfare throughout all human history. This is a post-apocalyptic scenario where an incredibly intelligent man, who was extremely limited on resources, had to rapidly find a way to stabilize humanity in his eyes. The Astartes are a cobbled together fighting force of mass-produced transhumans, even in the 40K setting (compared to Custodes), who only recently finished their basic development schedule with the Primaris Procedure. The Astartes are useful now, and rightly revered within the Imperium, but they would likely have been treated as unnecessary and highly ineffective (compared to the standards of warfare) by the standards of DAoT humanity. The Men of Iron are to Astartes what an Astartes (or perhaps even a Custodes) is to a human, but also in numbers far exceeding the IG with a virtually unkillable super-intelligence behind it. They make anything that isn't anywhere near them irrelevant, as the great crusade Astartes made the IG irrelevant (though the latter was still useful for rearguard operations and mopping up afterwards, the MoI could do all of that themselves).",UNKNOWN,Michael B.,1K,6.4K,76.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-US-Government-allow-US-companies-to-work-with-Huawei-again-on-standards-Is-this-acknowledging-Huaweis-strength-and-influence-globally

Bethesda actually has some great statistical models on this but Tell-Tale Games found similar results. The vast majority (around 73% on average) of players will choose to play the “good guy” or make the choice they subjectively feel is the “good” choice. In a video game you have an AI to play the bad guy but in a table top game that doesn’t work so how do you get the most potential customers? You might think it would be to make all sides the “good guys” then everybody can feel good about the faction they choose - but it doesn’t actually work that way. Most people don’t want to fight against a faction they think of as being a good guy - they would rather ally with them. Since that would defeat the basic purpose of a war game - the correct (and easiest) solution is to make every faction a bad guy with a couple of positive traits. That way players can feel subconsciously comfortable slaughtering all of the other factions while justifying the negative aspects of their own faction.

I would argue that their technology are not unquestionably more advanced than that of humanity or even Orks. At the end of the day - the tech of both men and mushrooms gets the job done. For example, a gun needs to kill and all three races possess devastatingly lethal weaponry. Eldar tech emphasizes different priorities than either the Imperium or the Orks but (overall) it isn’t significantly more or less effective overall. In the real world, think of the old M-16 vs Ak-47 comparisons. Many people will tell you the M-16 was the better weapon because it was more accurate at longer ranges. Other will tell you the AK was the better weapon because it was more reliable and easier to mass-produce. The reality is that it was an apples and oranges comparison. The weapons had different priorities that informed their design. Both had strengths and weaknesses. which one was the better weapon depended on which strength you thought was more important.In game, I would say the Eldar feel superior mostly because of inertia. They were objectively superior for a really long time but that was a long time ago. Their culture became isolated and complacent. As a result, their advancement slowed to a crawl. Meanwhile, humanity continued to adapt and evolve. Quite simply they caught up and many Eldar are simply unwilling to accept that times have changed. This happens in older cultures and even older people. Think about your grandparents. Think about that old boxer who used to be a contender and doesn’t want to admit he just isn’t any more. Time and injury takes a toll whether we want to admit it or not.","2,522 followers",Martin Vratny,1.4K,2.9K,9.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-DAoT-humans-were-more-advanced-than-the-imperium-why-didn-t-they-invent-space-marines

23,"I’ve always said that Facebook is good for connecting with your friends, family and community but Twitter is good for connecting with the world. If your current/potential customers are in your local community then using Twitter probably won’t make much difference but if your business is primarily online or you’re targeting customers across the country then Twitter might work better.

26,"First you need to be sure that your customers use (or would use) twitter. Having said that, service businesses are ideally suited. Food vans tweeting that they are ""running late"" have had some great successes. This is because their customers will dash out for a coffee or a hot dog if they know ""when"" the van will be there, but not ""just in case"" the van turns up. There is a food van in the US that tweets this sort of information. Prior to tweeting they used to get a few sales outside night clubs. When they started tweeting they had queues of customers.","135,539 followers",Hector Quintanilla,2.5K,1.2K,88.6M,2011,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-US-Government-allow-US-companies-to-work-with-Huawei-again-on-standards-Is-this-acknowledging-Huaweis-strength-and-influence-globally
