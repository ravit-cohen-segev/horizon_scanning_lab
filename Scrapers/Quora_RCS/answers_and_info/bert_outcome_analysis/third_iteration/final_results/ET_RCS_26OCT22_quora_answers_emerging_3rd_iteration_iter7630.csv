1,"The reason why Bitcoin mining requires so much power is because it’s highly profitable with 12.6 million $ USD being mined dayly at current Bitcoin price. And that doesn’t include transaction fees which are probably and other million $ USD.If you could find a coin that can be mined for profit on a laptop, millions of other miners with laptops would join in to get a piece of that cheddar.So no, not really. There aren’t really other coins that can be mined efficiently.Let’s say for a second that you could mine Bitcoin on your smartphone, and you could only mine on your smartphone.

There aren’t really other coins that can be mined efficiently.Let’s say for a second that you could mine Bitcoin on your smartphone, and you could only mine on your smartphone. Million and millions of others would start mining. And I would probably buy 100 or 1000 phones to mine it. Thus it would no longer be very profitable.The electricity here in Canada is too expensive to actually make money with Bitcoin mining. But I still do it at list because I prefer mining than buying from an exchange. And I want to support the network because I believe in Bitcoin.Also I stay hopeful that the price will go up and I will turn a profit eventually.But right now, I make about 200$ per month with 3 miners after electricit costs. When you price in the cost of the ASICs, I’m actually loosing money.",639 followers,Said Nusir,572,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Will-cryptocurrencies-initiate-a-new-transition-to-green-energy

Anything can make you good profit daily if you just learn how to trade.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,7.4K,5.6K,427.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Will-cryptocurrencies-initiate-a-new-transition-to-green-energy
3,"Nobody knows! Many people might guess, but the only way to know is to be able to accurately predict the future.If you could actually do that, making $500 in cryptocurrencies would be utterly trivial compared to what you could do.So you pick one that’s highly volatile, and hope it goes up. If it does not, you lose money. Good luck.","3,034 followers",Yuvraj Wadhwani,5.7K,226,1.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Will-cryptocurrencies-initiate-a-new-transition-to-green-energy
