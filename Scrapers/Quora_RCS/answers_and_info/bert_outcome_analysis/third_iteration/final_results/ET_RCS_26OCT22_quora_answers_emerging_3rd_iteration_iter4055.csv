0,"I guess you could say I’m a space buff. Yeah, I’ll cop to that. I was pleased, but TTTT big news events don’t usually really emotionally affect me that profoundly, even though I might think the same things about them as most everyone else. There were a bunch of major events around that time that surely traumatized, or cheered, a lot of people a lot. The Apollo 1 fire. The Apollo 8 Christmas Eve broadcast from lunar orbit, and the iconic Earthrise photo. Apollo 13. The assassinations of King and Robert Kennedy. Kent State. My Lai (which we didn’t know the real truth of for a long time BTW). AndI guess you could say I’m a space buff. Yeah, I’ll cop to that.

My Lai (which we didn’t know the real truth of for a long time BTW). And many others.To a great extent I think I just figured the Apollo flights were predictable next steps. Only with time have I come to realize just how much danger was involved, and even now may still not know a lot of it.More widely, not only did most of these events not affect me as much as you might think, but many of them didn’t even seem that surprising. I remember, in particular, when in March 1968, LBJ made a speech, and I saw it the next morning (Sunday) on TV, and I didn’t know what he had said when it was recorded the night before, but I just had a funny feeling, as the end of the speech approached, that he was going to announce that we would not run. And voila, there it was.However, in the fall of 1968, there was one thing that I was really happy about, at the end of such a tumultuous year. I don’t really follow sports at all, but as a resident of southern Michigan one event made me quite happy. The Tigers won the World Series. A year before, people were out in the streets rioting. Now, at least for the moment, they were out in celebration. That was pretty cool.",677 followers,John Anderson,1.5K,611,3.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/To-those-who-remember-Apollo-11-how-did-it-feel-waking-up-the-day-after-it-knowing-that-humanity-had-just-made-a-massive-advancement-Did-you-wake-up-feeling-like-humanity-have-finally-began-reaching-its

As is so often the case in war, the US was willing to spend whatever it took to meet the objective, but war footing economics and real world economics are very different things.In the cold war, we were happy to have the SR-71, a spy plane that could fly to the edge of space at over 3.5 times the speed of sound—even though it operated under such extreme conditions with such primitive technology that is leaked fuel all over the runway and over its service life lost 1/3 of the fleet to crashes. This technology was a highly successful Cold War asset, but would not make a practical consumer product.The same holds for Apollo. All the assets built for Apollo (and the Space Shuttle) were paid for under cost-plus government contracts that are useful for getting things done but not at all effective for controlling costs.Today, NASA funded development projects (along with the X-Prize and a few other factors) have fostered a renaissance in commercial space development, and NASA is shifting to buying space services instead of cost-plus space hardware. As a result, the cost to launch payloads into space has plummeted, and as it does, interest in commercial investment in space is exploding.There are now over 2,000 companies in the US alone that are privately investing in what are considered “foundational” space technologies, from launching experiments into space to engines, to habitats, to in-situ resource development, you name it.Only now is is becoming close to feasible to consider lunar missions for anything other than reasons of national prestige or security. This is why we haven’t been back since 1972, be we will be back soon.",10 followers,Sushmita Gupta,945,220,1.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/To-those-who-remember-Apollo-11-how-did-it-feel-waking-up-the-day-after-it-knowing-that-humanity-had-just-made-a-massive-advancement-Did-you-wake-up-feeling-like-humanity-have-finally-began-reaching-its
4,"While I did not work on the systems that were on the Apollo, my friends did. I was test manager on the rendezvous radar that was used on Gemini to prove that rendezvous in space was practical. The equipment and systems on Apollo was not archaic at the time. It was of conservative design in some cases, but not archaic. It was indeed adequate to get the job done. Personal friends of mine developed the master computer for Apollo and the Lunar Low Light Level TV that provided video for Neil Armstrong’s first steps on the Moon.

5,"We are still not speaking of persons as people with unique talents and strengths, as well as areas that need improvement. The reasons why, is that language did not come with a users manual, and people are learning on the fly. Using language prudently is something the human race knows so little about. When speaking of people who do not have a livable income, that allows them to pay for housing, or to eat nutritious food, so they can live happy and successful lives, it is important to include the solutions into the articulation.

7,"No. Hunger and poverty are lower in percentage terms than at any time in history. The world produces enough food for everyone, so the issue there has to do with fairness of distribution. Lack of water is primarily caused by climate change. Climate change is caused by the emission of greenhouse gases particularly carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels. Countries with the highest per capita emissions have low birth rates and vice versa, so it is clear that over consumption is the cause of high emissions, not population.","16,660 followers",Lee Thé,699,10.1K,80.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/To-those-who-remember-Apollo-11-how-did-it-feel-waking-up-the-day-after-it-knowing-that-humanity-had-just-made-a-massive-advancement-Did-you-wake-up-feeling-like-humanity-have-finally-began-reaching-its
8,I always go back to the basics on this type of question.And the basics say that if you improve living standards of impoverished people they will have fewer children. And fewer children means less overall load in the future.That's why the Gro Brundtland UN report decades ago recommended that the best way to reduce population growth was to make people wealthy.Poverty leads to too ...,0 followers,Paul Noel,1.9K,14.2K,22M,2016,https://www.quora.com/To-those-who-remember-Apollo-11-how-did-it-feel-waking-up-the-day-after-it-knowing-that-humanity-had-just-made-a-massive-advancement-Did-you-wake-up-feeling-like-humanity-have-finally-began-reaching-its
