1,"As an American citizen, I can assure you that, at least on Quora, you will find people from every country making suggestions about how the US should be run. Who should run it. And why we should follow their lead. Then we have half of this very country telling the world and anyone willing to listen that the US is the worse thing since WWII with all its bad guys.So if you don’t like it, sue us.","23,886 followers",Robin Daverman,11.8K,2.3K,40.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/As-a-millennial-born-in-the-era-of-emerging-technologies-what-are-the-significant-impacts-of-innovation-to-your-daily-living
2,"You keep pushing this notion across multiple questions which suggests that your questions aren’t really legitimate.Again, your examples are terrible and don’t support your point. The U.S. in fact has been the leader in developing vaccines and doing vaccine research. Most of the vaccines used around the world for different diseases were developed in the U.S., or the techniques used to develop them were discovered in the U.S. The U.S. also has had a well-defined process for emergency use authorizations for drugs and vaccines that has been in place for decades.

The U.S. in fact has been the leader in developing vaccines and doing vaccine research. Most of the vaccines used around the world for different diseases were developed in the U.S., or the techniques used to develop them were discovered in the U.S. The U.S. also has had a well-defined process for emergency use authorizations for drugs and vaccines that has been in place for decades. The rest of the world copied our process, though bad-actor countries like Russia and China tend to “cheat” the process as they are more willing to put their citizens’ lives at risk to serve the state’s leaders. 5G technology research was also done in the U.S., though China has been faster to market with it.The U.S. of course does not invest in high-speed rail and is unlikely to do so. That’s because such an investment doesn’t make much economic sense in a country like ours that is very large geographically and that has the world’s best air transport infrastructure. The fixed capital costs of building high speed rail are enormous, and would be wasted. What the U.S. does have is a very extensive and highly used shipping rail network. People like to get places quickly, as do individual packages. Manufacturing parts and bulk shipments are fine going slower by regular rail.Speaking more generally, some of what you describe does happen. People do sometimes criticize something and then later turn around and adopt it. That is the nature of capitalism and democracy. If you miss the boat on something at first or your guess of the best way to proceed is wrong, capitalism guarantees that other individuals and companies will try different things and some will succeed. Democracy allows the people to see the failure of one approach and then make corrections. That’s part of what keeps the U.S. healthy and strong, compared to China or Russia where everything depends on one party or one person to get things right every time.",0 followers,Charlie Buffett,4.9K,575,4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/The-US-has-the-habit-of-attacking-other-countries-policy-methodologies-technologies-first-etc-then-follow-copy-and-even-steal-these-things-to-become-their-own-Examples-vaccine-emergency-use-of-the-vaccines-5G-high
3,"5G was basically invented by NASA, High Speed Rail started in Japan I believe, I am not sure what the hell your talking about.. since the US really doesn't have much high speed rail due to the expenses related to it in the US.Vaccines? Didn't 2 US companies just create these? Followed by a UK one? This question seems very biased or can someone point me to the facts..",UNKNOWN,Francis,2.8K,8K,33.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/The-US-has-the-habit-of-attacking-other-countries-policy-methodologies-technologies-first-etc-then-follow-copy-and-even-steal-these-things-to-become-their-own-Examples-vaccine-emergency-use-of-the-vaccines-5G-high
4,You do know that's completely false right?you're probably suffering from the delusion that 5G is somehow Chinese or Huawei technology. It isn't. And I'm not sure what vaccine you're suggesting the United States somehow stole. Not sure what High-Speed rail you're suggesting they stole either. I mean by your standards the rest of the world stole things like airplanes.,1 follower,Dawei Chen,633,141,2.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/The-US-has-the-habit-of-attacking-other-countries-policy-methodologies-technologies-first-etc-then-follow-copy-and-even-steal-these-things-to-become-their-own-Examples-vaccine-emergency-use-of-the-vaccines-5G-high

7,"Oh hell yes. There are so many people with a stake in presenting it as more that it currently is. So many ambitious overachievers out there spinning BS to get money.Look, we do not have the ability to create an AI controlling a robot that can peel an orange. We lack ability to do many things a human does. And yet morons like an ex-exec from Google excite the press with claims that AI will replace humans all over in industry.I say the Emperor’s New Clothes are baloney. The ability of NNs to be trained to classify images is just a small part of real AI. So what if there’s a lot of success thereOh hell yes.

The ability of NNs to be trained to classify images is just a small part of real AI. So what if there’s a lot of success there identifying a truck in an image? That hardly translates into an AI that can think like a human and solve problems. There are no AIs currently that can reason about why your girlfriend suddenly got sullen and quiet with you, or why Billy down the street beat up a cat.Then there’s Ray Kurzweil. I’d like to get him on stage and beat him over the head with a mop for the terrible hype he generates regarding the ‘Singularity’. His time frame is wrong, his view is only an opinion, not fact nor provable fact. He angers me for conning the public into thinking humans are going to be threatened by AI overlords any time soon. Not going to happen. Making AIs as smart as people is exceedingly hard and it’s not soon in the cards. I say this as an AI researcher who works on these problems and I see how truly difficult they are. We can, and will solve some of the problems but we are a long way from AIs that can match human minds. An AI that plays Go better than humans is buildable because the game is a closed small universe. What humans have to work with is an enormous complicated world, and much harder to deal with.So, yes, AI is way hyped, and the promoters may be leading us to the next AI winter if they keep up the crap and eventually burn out expectations.","45,636 followers",David Seidman,790,3.6K,85.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/The-US-has-the-habit-of-attacking-other-countries-policy-methodologies-technologies-first-etc-then-follow-copy-and-even-steal-these-things-to-become-their-own-Examples-vaccine-emergency-use-of-the-vaccines-5G-high
