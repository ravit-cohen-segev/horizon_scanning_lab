3,"Which is the most used physics law that is likely to be broken in the near future?Here’s the thing: Laws of physics that are heavily used are very unlikely to be broken in the near future, simply because they’ve already been heavily tested.At best, you’ll find out that the law works just fine over the vast majority of cases, and you need a really extreme condition like a neutron star to have a situation that the law in question doesn’t work totally accurately.For example… Newton came up with his law of gravity.

And several centuries later, Einstein came out with general relativity, which handled a bunch of extreme situations.Let’s look at how “broken” Newton’s law of gravity was. It predicted that planets would orbit the sun in elliptical orbits. It also predicted that these orbits could precess slightly due to gravitational pulls from other planets.So that orbit is precessing by close to 15 degrees per orbit.And astronomers measure the precession of Mercury’s orbit, added in the gravities of all the other planets - and came up 43 arc second short. How big is that?Pick up a pencil or pen, hold it up at arm’s length. Its width is (roughly) a half degree or 30 arc minutes (60 minutes to the degree). So imagine 1/30th of that width for 1 arc minute. We’re going to split that 60 ways to make arc seconds. We’ll round 43 to 45, so Newton’s law was wrong by 3/4th of 1/30th of the width of a pencil at arm’s length.Oh, did I mention that’s not per orbit, but *per century*, or 400+ orbits? So per orbit it’s 1/400th of 3/4th of 1/30th of the width of a pencil at arm’s length.So does that mean that Newton’s law of gravity was broken by Einstein? No, it was simply amended for certain extreme situations.",78 followers,Rajan Singh,1.5K,360,25.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Can-we-manipulate-physics-laws-in-the-future-with-our-advanced-technology

It was yours.Before 2010, the web was indeed a space, but a special pseudo space for sharing silly things, playing games, downloading free media and communicating frivolously. There was a clear disconnect between the web, which was not real, and say, cable news or the cafeteria, which was real. Communication and activity online felt closer to the diagetic world of a video game or movie. If bad things happened there, bad things didn’t “really” happen, anymore than killing an NPC in an RPG was really a murder. You chatted to other people or read about whatever, with virtually no filter or sense of broader consequence.Even the concept of people outside your closest circles reading your messages wasn’t taken seriously. Interpreting your social media posts as some sort of official opinion or statement wasn’t even conceptualized. The internet was a tool for entertainment and reference with quirky communication channels built in. It was a playpen for nonsense… lawless and abstract. Major cultural players like governments and corporations simply weren’t involved very much. Do you even recall the fact that there were no ads on Youtube outside of the banners on the bottom 6th of the frame?On the contrary, the flow of political revolution and international scandal online has now become a routine part of our daily lives. People are held accountable for a Facebook post as if it’s a personal press release. The president does a non-zero amount of his official communication on Twitter. If you’re old enough to remember, try and imagine George Bush’s Myspace posts threatening war with the Persians… I can’t either.Around 2010, the mainstream consolidation started happening.

If you dont fake it extremely well, a human being not only can discern the difference, it makes the human feel uncomfortable or lied to about its true nature.Then we have the stuff that comes out of Boston Dynamics which is genuinely insanely creative and breakthrough.They work on four feet for stability but they are able to navigate all sorts of terrain and make graded judgements on territory and establish new paths when the current path is unsatisfactory. Sure they dont have a human representation but they are functionally stable, work in multiple areas and have enough sensor data crunched that they can accurately work their landscape.These are all different aspects of the current field of robotics, where one specialises in realism another specialises in sensitivity, another specialises on interaction, another works on environment and traction on multiple surfaces.The pieces are all being built in parallel but have yet to unite as a single unit.What will bring them together?Eventually a medium and a set of standards will be created to unite all robot parts for usage and create a series of interlinkable protocols that can be used to build separate robot parts that work together.It may take a single company making such a breakthrough that not only does the robot outpace its opponents, it outsells them in relation to demand.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Can-we-manipulate-physics-laws-in-the-future-with-our-advanced-technology

Iron smelting likely derives from accidentally using iron ores to construct ovens for refining other metals.Contrary to popular belief the First Nations were quite aware of the wheel, they simply lacked draft animals to make using it for transportation worth while. Llamas were the closest thing to a draft animal in the Americas, and they cannot carry significantly more than a man, and you need a man to supervise them. Also, a Human porter is much better at following directions and can use narrow footpaths and climb stairs. A cart requires wide roads and gentle slopes. Building a road over a mountain means moving a lot of dirt, getting the same load over with a bunch of porters requires, at most, a native guide. Large objects like building stones were moved in the Egyptian manner, with ropes, levers, rollers, and lots of muscle.Mayan and Aztec astronomy and calendars were superior to those of the conquistadors, in that they accounted for leap years and precession of the equinox more elegantly. Canoes and kayaks are faster, more maneuverable, of shallower draft and lighter to portage than the clinker built small boats of the invaders.

(and alpacas and dogs too)They were a major reason for the Incan civilisation as they can travel throughout the mountains. Though riding Llamas is impossible and can only carry materials via caravan.Second, regarding agriculture, the Incans and Aztecs had created terraces for potatoes and chiampas for corn respectively.But outside of these areas, most agriculture was small scale, similar to non-Roman Europe.The lack of useful animals also created less diseases native to the Americas.Even if there were major viruses, the less enclosed housing of the Native Americans meant that viruses could never reach plague levels, and usually died out.The only disease to have its origins in the Western hemisphere is Syphilis.It was these factors that gave Europe and Asia the advantage when it came to the age of exploration.",0 followers,Nor Reza,5.5K,8.6K,50.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Can-we-manipulate-physics-laws-in-the-future-with-our-advanced-technology
