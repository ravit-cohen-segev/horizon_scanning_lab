It’s just another invention of Hollywood, the Emperor of Japan never requested the advices nor support of American soldiers to train and modernize the Japanese military during the Meiji era.

The second French military mission to Japan being the one that was sent further to Emperor Meiji’s request to France in 1872 and which lasted until 1880 (i.e. the period into which the movie is placed).Reception by the Meiji Emperor of the Second French Military Mission to Japan, 1872:There was no such thing like hiring individual retired soldiers for projects of this scale and strategic importance : the ruler of a country would officially request the technical assistance of another country and this country (France in this case) would send a military mission composed of active professional soldiers and officers (who are paid by the country requesting the assistance during their mission).The character portrayed by Tom Cruise in The Last Samurai was probably partly inspired byShogunate’s French style Cavalry, 1867:French Military Mission before its departure to Japan, 1866:Training of Japanese Bakufu troops by the French Military Mission to Japan, 1867:More details about the first French Military Mission to Japan here:The Last Samurai movie is placed in a later period which is closer to the Satsuma rebellion which took place in 1877 and that was indeed the last run of Samurais vs the Imperial power. But even then, Japan in this period never sollicitated a US Military Mission to train and modernize their army. There never was anything like what is described in the movie i.e. US officers hired to train, supervise and even command Japanese troops. In fact these were French officers instead.The truth and real History is that despite the fact that France had suffered a severe defeat against the German Confederation in 1870, and even if the first French military mission had helped the Shogunate troops before the Boshin war, as soon as 1872 Emperor Meiji solliciated the French Republic for a second French Military Mission to Japan in order to continue training and modernizing the Imperial Japanese Army. And this French Military mission lasted until 1880, which covers entirely the period depicted in The Last Samurai.The second French Military Mission to Japan (1872–1880):Colonel Munier, second commander of the Second French Military Mission to Japan. 1874 photograph:Imperial Japanese Army Academy at Ichigaya, Tokyo. It was built by the second French Military Mission to Japan, on the ground of today's Japan Ministry of Defense (1874 photograph):More details about the Second French Military Mission to Japan here:There was also a Third French Military Mission to Japan between 1884 and 1889 which involved only 5 officers, as Japan this time also involved Germany for military advice from 1886 to 1889. However around that time France gained considerable influence over the Imperial Japanese Navy, with the despatch of the engineer Louis-Emile Bertin, who directed the design and construction of Japan's first large-scale modern Navy from 1886 (source: Wiki).Of course in an American movie I suppose that it would have been disturbing for the American public to see that at this time the French military and navy were more praised by Japan than the American ones so I guess that it was easier for Hollywood to invent something that never existed even though it required to re-write History at the same time.Whilst it is indeed true that the Imperial Japanese Army in this period was partly equipped with various US weapons including Gatlings, it wasn’t an exclusivity and the Japanese army was also equipped with British rifles and guns, as well as with German ones too.But well that’s Hollywood. Personally I liked the movie and still like it, it’s even one of my all times favorites. The only thing that disturbs me is that along the time many people will believe that it is based on historical facts, and because of that progressively the real history is completely overlooked and will end up replaced by a fictional scenario in the mind of most of the people. But hey, we French can blame our own movie industry for not making any. Ovid on these many French military characters in history that would make a good subject of action/war movie.In the same vein in another Hollywood movie, although not based on a real history but on a book, in",0 followers,David Farnsworth,2.1K,4K,2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Did-the-Emperor-of-Japan-really-hire-American-Soldiers-to-train-and-modernize-the-Japanese-Military-as-depicted-in-the-movie-The-Last-Samurai

This guard, like so many people in Japan, could read something printed in English, but they could not understand when it was read back to them.…As room chief my name was at the top of the roster and when he saw it, his eyes liked to have popped out and he pointed to my name and said: ‘Fujita Fujita Nippon no namai!’ (Fujita is a Japanese name!’) And then he asked me where Fujita was, and I told him that he had gone to the benjo [toilet]. He said that he would wait and I moved towards the back of the room with my heart in my mouth and shaking like a leaf. I was as close to being scared to death as I will ever come. The guard remained at the front of the room and asked everyone that came into the room, where Fujita was.Almost everyone in the room was as keyed up as I was, for they had sweated my being found out, too, and now that the time had come they all stood around with bated breath to see what would happen next.Another man came into the room and the guard asked him where Fujita was and he looked around and saw me, and before anyone could caution him, he pointed to me and said ‘There he is!’The guard looked surprised and also a little put out with me for having told him that Fujita had gone to the benjo. Any other time I would have been beaten up on the spot, but this time he was much too excited over his discovery to think of bashing me about.He called me back up to the front of the room and looked me up and down, sucking his teeth and muttering something incredulously about Fujita being a POW. He tried to carry on a conversation with me, about me, and finally decided that I really could not speak the language. He would feel of my skin and then put his arm next to mine and compare them, and like the guard at the wash rack, he said ‘Somma, Somma! He would turn to the other guys in the room and then point to me and then to himself and tell them that we were somma, somma.Finally he could not stand it any longer, that he was the only Japanese to know this so he took off for the guard house.I really became frightened then and felt very strongly that my untimely demise could be forthcoming posthaste! Even though I felt like this, I still felt hope way down deep that I would survive the war in one piece.In a little while he brought another guard with him to look me over, only to have the lights go out, for it was bedtime and all room lights were turned out at 10:00 PM.Well, there was no sleep for me this night and Sgts. Heleman and Lucas were trying to comfort me and convince me that maybe they would not kill me after all.

Occasionally, there were engagements that got a bit too close for comfort for all involved (especially at night before the invention and widespread use of radar), but those were the exception rather than the rule, and no one planned to fight that close due to the ever growing lethality of the weapons mounted on warships. In fact, the sheer destructive power of naval armaments led to engagement ranges growing longer and longer. For example, at the start of WWI, the British and German navies expected their battle Fleets to open an engagement at ranges in excess of 8,000 yards (more than 4 miles), and over the course of WWI, as gunnery techniques and technology improved, that range nearly doubled.

Rather the Imperial Japanese navy mission was to interdict the US resupply missions and resupply Imperial Army troops fighting on Guadalcanal, and the US/Allied Navy’s mission was to prevent the IJN resupply effort from succeeding. So the USN/allies badly lose the Battle of Savo Island — The battle has often been cited as the worst defeat in a fair fight in the history of the United States Navy — but despite losing the battle they prevent the IJN mission which is to attack US transports unloading supplies (yes, some of the supply ships were already gone…).In these battles you frequently do get ship on ship actions, but winning that action is not the primary mission. Another example might be WWII convoys with ASW escorts. The U-boats mission is to sink merchant ships not necessarily escort vessels unless that directly helps accomplish the mission, and the ASW escorts mission is to get as many merchant ships to the destination as possible, not necessarily sinking U-boats unless that directly helps accomplish the mission.Bismarck’s mission was to find convoys and sink merchant ships. She wasn’t supposed to fight RN capital ships. She was forced to fight when HMS Hood and Prince of Wales found her and had her mostly pinned against the Greenland ice sheet. Sure Bismarck destroyed Hood, but Bismarck was “mission killed” by hits from Prince of Wales. Then Prinz Eugen discovered propeller damage (not caused by battle damage) and returned to base.

And for most of history *that* was really hard as well, because you can see them all the way to the horizon (and a bit further, with the height of masts and sails), but the ships sail at roughly the same speed so catching up to something that’s 25 miles away takes *forever*, and may not happen at all unless the wind is particularly favorable.Just this morning I was reading about the Battle of Cape Vincent, where Admiral Jervis spotted a Spanish force, and then as he got closer he realized he was outnumbered. And he just went ahead and attacked. Probably sheer boredom had a lot to do with it.The difficulty of finding and catching up to the enemy continued definitely through WW1, when the High Seas Fleet managed to slip away to safety even with the whole Grand Fleet trying to pin them down. And even well into WW2: it seems most of the naval battles in the Pacific involved complete confusion in the minds of both commanders - for example, Adm Halsey’s blunder in sending all his major units on a wild goose chase, leaving the weak Taffy 3 group alone in the Battle of Leyte Gulf. A mistake which was then matched by Kurita’s confusion about the strong (but near suicidal) resistance of Taffy 3, which led to him turning his strong force back just when there was hardly anything left to stop it.So there you have it - apart from a few set-piece naval battles with Horatio Nelson posing on the quarterdeck and uttering inspiring quotes, it’s people blundering around with no idea what’s happening until long afterwards.","358,949 followers",Sean Kernan,4.8K,5.6K,726.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Did-the-Emperor-of-Japan-really-hire-American-Soldiers-to-train-and-modernize-the-Japanese-Military-as-depicted-in-the-movie-The-Last-Samurai

The US lost about 0.32% of its population while the UK lost 0.94% of its population, basically three times as much as the US on a per capita basis.Lastly, the peak size of the US military in WWII was 12,000,000; while the UK reached 4,600,000. Based on the size of the military, the US lost 0.03% of its forces; while the UK lost 0.08% of its military. Again almost 3 times as much.This is silly argument and disrespectful to all those who served and died in the WWII from both countries.",3 followers,David Wallace,663,5.2K,29.3M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Did-the-Emperor-of-Japan-really-hire-American-Soldiers-to-train-and-modernize-the-Japanese-Military-as-depicted-in-the-movie-The-Last-Samurai

21,It doesn’t matter who lost most soldiers between Allie’s. The root of the problem is that the Germans were extremely good on land. They were almost non existent on sea except U boats til 1943. They were good in the air until 1941 and then outnumbered. But the formidable Wehrmacht was excellent on land til the very end.

In Asia, after the fall of Singapore, they were fighting a desperate holding action against the Japanese in Burma and India. Only in North Africa did the British fight with significant forces, and they surely fought well - first defeating a significant Italian army and then against successive, well-led German offenses toward Egypt. Before WWII, the US had the 18th largest army in the world but quickly mustered and trained over 16 million by war’s end. This remarkable build-up of forces was because the US was primarily responsible for pushing the Japanese back through the Pacific, as well as taking on the greater role in western Europe. Every UK war planner knew, as well as American planners, that its would be the US forces that would bear the preponderance of the burden against the Germans after North Africa. This was the case through the Sicily and Italian campaigns, as well as against Germany’s Fortress Europe at Normandy and beyond through France and the low countries, as well as through southern France and ultimately into Germany and central Europe. This is not to diminish the substantial roles played by the British and the Canadians, especially, as well as the Poles and Free French. But, the US carried the greater load in the west - and almost all the load in the Pacific. The British had stood alone for a year with remarkable tenacity. the US made the ultimate victory against Japan and Germany possible.

By the close of 1944, the British Army was a spent force, no longer able to replace combat losses, incapable of offensive operations in the CBI (SEAC) or along the Malay Barrier, and only barely able to muster the Army of the Rhine (BAOR) for occupation duties in Germany.By contrast, the Americans fought the war in Europe under a self-imposed headcount limit—based mostly on logistical concerns, but also on force and political calculations.I have written before that our job—Great Britain’s role—was to take it and keep swinging.

And if you added in deaths by Commonwealth forces, you get a different set of numbers.All of those points made, why should it matter that the US lost more soldiers than the UK during WWII? That’s simply a function of two factors: the US (with a bigger population) had more troops on the ground in combat and thus you’d expect them to suffer more deaths and then after the Fall of Singapore, the British didn’t have significant ground assets in the Pacific (though India and Burma was a different matter).

Lord knows the Soyuz and Progress rockets were both designed in the 1960’s, based on modified R7 rockets initial built from the captured V2 rockets built by the Third Reich in the mid-40’s.To this day, the Soyuz is still launchedThat’s not what I’d call “space-age technology.”The U.S. government, with the end of the shuttle, pushed for the reuse of all the parts used to make the shuttle for the new replacement Constellation program. A program that even the most optimistic estimates put at launching in the 2020’s at a cost of over $40So, Constellation was canceled, except for the Orion capsule. And then they pushed the SLS instead, still re-using the parts of the 1960’s designed Space Shuttle (along with updates from the 90’s and early 2000’s).SLS has now burned through at least $12So, China started developing space flight, and they’ve successfully put astronauts and even two space stations into orbit. But calling them advanced would ignore the fact that they have, almost bolt for bolt, copied the Russian Soyuz capsule and the Progress rocket with its horribly poisonous UDMH and N2O4 hypergolic fuel. Even Russia is retiring that sad old dinosaur.In fact, a lot of the current batch of decades-old rockets are being retired.Why?Because of two corporations. One of them is very public, and one is very secretive, but both of them have taken the Aerospace industry and shaken it to its absolute core.The public one is SpaceX, the private one is Blue Origin. Both of them went out and did what everyone said was impossible. They built new engines from scratch with new technology, put them into new rockets built from scratch with new technology, and launched them.But, more importantly, they landed them.You see, other than one part of one rocket, the shuttle orbiter, no other rocket has ever landed before. (Yes, they re-used the boosters too, but the price of refurbishing them after a dip in the ocean was arguably higher than just building them over every time, and they had to be shipped back to Utah to be refurbished anyway. If you have to take something apart down to parts, swap out half the parts, and then rebuild it — is itSo, this has scared the entire launch industry, worldwide, out of their socks.SpaceX is talking about reusing a Block 5 booster within 24 hours. They’re working on BFR, which they claim can be reused as quickly as you can refuel it.Blue Origins’ New Shepard is a bit of a hobby rocket for sightseers, but it proved out BO’s ability to land a rocket and reuse it. New Glenn is a super-heavy lifter that has yet to fly, but will have the same reusability as a SpaceX Falcon 9.And they’re not stopping there. SpaceX is already on the brink of recovering cargo fairings, which would save them $6M per flight, and they’re about to test second stage recovery, which would mean the entire consumables from a flight would basically reduce to the fuel, and a few plastic covers, a compression ring on the second stage engine bell, and a small amount of ablative heat shielding.We already know that the cost per flight for those goods is under a million dollars.We know the full cost of a Falcon 9 flown in expendable mode, is $63 million.If SpaceX can really refly a rocket 100 times, then your amortized cost per flight drops under $2M. To put 30 tons into orbit. That’s $66 per kilogram to orbit.Current spaceflight averages are in the $20,000 per kilogram to orbit. That means a 300x difference in cost.That’s not just a “leader” in space technology, that’s utterly disruptive to the whole industry.Spending $66 a kilo to put something into orbit is about three times the cost FedEx charges to ship a package overnight. Now you can get to orbit for three times the cost of sending cookies across the country as a care package. That’s going to open whole new industries in space.And no other country is close. Russia is claiming their new Angara rocket will be reusable, but they have yet to build even one.The traditional US companies are claiming Vulcan will be reusable, but they have yet to build even one, and they’re asking for $5 billion in research funding from the Air Force to build it.China is making noise about a fully reusable craft, but as I pointed out, their launch vehicle is based around the same technology that Russia has been using since the 1960’s, and they’ve taken to dropping first stages onto populated cities, which is not exactly going to be helping with national pride.The only competition for SpaceX right now is New Glenn, and that has yet to fly.In fact, their closest competitor might very well be……SpaceX.Their next rocket, the BFR (BigNo one else, no government, no nation, is even close to that.So, yeah, the leader in space right now — it’s a corporation, not a company.Honorable mentions: Rocket Lab is getting ready to send “It’s Business Time” — their latest Electron rocket — into space carrying several hundred kilos of cube-sats into orbit. They’re doing this for $7M a launch (estimated) which is still in line with the $20,000 per kilo launch price, but very few other services cater to micro-sat launches yet, so this is a way to get your own, personal cube-sat into orbit for less than the price of a new car.There’s also about a dozen other companies that are following in Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos’ footsteps and starting private launch companies. The whole industry has been re-invigorated.","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,631,1.5K,2.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Did-the-Emperor-of-Japan-really-hire-American-Soldiers-to-train-and-modernize-the-Japanese-Military-as-depicted-in-the-movie-The-Last-Samurai
42,"In what respect? There are many different areas of naval technology, with different states having different emphasis on these areas.For example, Russia has a long history of excellence in metallurgy which led to them using titanium (infamously difficult to weld) in the hulls of the Alfa and Akula class SSNs, giving them exceptional strength and allowing very deep dives, to a depth not attainable by US or British attack boats.

That said, they are not known for the quality of their sensor fits (passive sonar, in particular - it was legendarily poor) and the Alfa was known for being fast (40+ knots submerged) but noisy.Carrier technology is dominated by the US Navy carrier fleet; *each* Nimitz-class carrier has an air wing larger than many national air forces. Put together two or three carriers as part of a battle group and you have a tremendous amount of firepower. The American Aegis system is a command and control system unparalleled as far as I know in the field of air defence; maybe the Russians and Chinese have similar systems allowing delegation of air threats to ships most able to deal with them and to subsequently engage them with swarms of SAMs but I couldn't say. The Russian naval SAM systems alone are highly effective, let it never be said otherwise, but do they have the ability to coordinate SAM response in the same way as a US Navy surface action group with Ticonderoga-class cruisers and Arleigh Burke-class destroyers? I have no idea.It is very tough to say whether one Navy or another has the superior technology for one main reason - they have not been tested in all-out warfare. We can look at individual systems that have been used in small-scale conflicts to get an idea of their effectiveness (Sea Wolf, Sea Dart, Standard, Exocet, Harpoon, Phalanx and Goalkeeper CIWS, to name but a few) but this ultimately only gives a limited view of the situation as just as many have not been used in combat (most of the more recent Russian surface to surface missiles, most surface-based ASW systems such as Asroc). With this in mind we have to be careful in judging whose technology is better.Deficiencies in various areas - naval air power, close-in defence and effective radar surveillance - are quickly shown up in conflict (see the Falklands conflict for some fairly egregious examples of how *not* to do it courtesy of the Royal Navy) and often are problems that should never have arisen in the first place (various defence White Papers were responsible for the RN carrier force being eliminated on the spurious notion that the RN wouldn't be involved in operations without the US Navy; no RN ship of the Falklands Task Force had any CIWS capability; the RN's amphibious capability had been gutted, meaning civilian ships like Atlantic Conveyor had to be pressed into service carrying supplies and vehicles to the islands; the main SAM on RN ships at the time was Sea Cat, thoroughly obsolete in the world of supersonic fighters and missiles - only a couple used Sea Wolf or Sea Dart and these systems exhibited significant limitations in service due to their radar systems not being up to snuff, often failing to track crossing targets properly).","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Did-the-Emperor-of-Japan-really-hire-American-Soldiers-to-train-and-modernize-the-Japanese-Military-as-depicted-in-the-movie-The-Last-Samurai

Here we go.This quote comes from a Nobel Prize acceptance speech written by Nobel Peace Prize winner Christian Lange in the 1920s, and no, it has nothing to do with people overusing their smartphones.He had an extremely narrow and specific point in mind, which you can see in the paragraph where the quote appears:It is against this concept of the sovereign state, a state isolated by protectionism and militarism, that internationalism must now engage in decisive battle. The sovereign state has in our times become a lethal danger to human civilization because technical developments enable it to employ an infinite number and variety of means of destruction.Christian Lange was an internationalist in the runup to World War II. He saw militarized, isolationist, xenophobic nations as a tremendous threat to human peace (I wonder why a person living on the eve of WWII might have that idea?) and he was particularly concerned about isolationist, militarized governments that spent a lot of money on military technology.He was being literal, not metaphorical.When he talked about technology as a master, he didn’t mean people using technology like smartphones or computers instead of going outside to smell the flowers or something.He was talking about military technology being used by governments as a tool to oppress their own citizens.Every time economic and technical development takes a step forward, forces emerge which attempt to create political forms for what, on the economic-technical plane, has already more or less become reality. This never comes about without a struggle. The past dies hard because the contemporary political organizations or holders of power seldom bend themselves willingly to the needs of the new age, and because past glories and traditions generally become transformed into poetic or religious symbols, emotional images, which must be repudiated by the practical and prosaic demands of the new age. […]Today we stand on a bridge leading from the territorial state to the world community. Politically, we are still governed by the concept of the territorial state; economically and technically, we live under the auspices of worldwide communications and worldwide markets. […]Moreover, if the territorial state is to continue as the last word in the development of society, then war is inevitable. For the state by its nature claimsLange was not a Luddite. He embraced technological change in all its forms; his speech talks about the new technologies of the telegraph and telephone as forces for peace.He was speaking specifically about old-school nationalist, isolationist governments using technology to reinforce what he saw as a dangerous and outdated ideology, one that must inevitably lead to oppression and war.Technology is a wonderful tool when it’s used to empower individual citizens and promote international understanding. Technology is a dangerous master in the hands of totalitarian governments who use it as a tool of oppression.If you Google this quote you’ll see a ton of Web think pieces spouting deepitudes like “it means we need to know when to put away our gadgets” and “it means we need to step away from the Internet.” Neo-Luddite use this quote to blather about going back to nature and blah blah blah no modern society.Nope. These folks have clearly never read the quote in context.","220,610 followers",Franklin Veaux,942,47.3K,782.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Did-the-Emperor-of-Japan-really-hire-American-Soldiers-to-train-and-modernize-the-Japanese-Military-as-depicted-in-the-movie-The-Last-Samurai

People who were alive before the internet and cellular technology remember things like newspapers, and going to the library to look things up, receiving and paying bills by snail-mail, banking in person at an actual bank building, land-line telephones and actual phone-booths that were the only way to make phone calls if you were away from your home or office, and a time when “photos don’t lie”.Now, you can exchange greetings, trivia, cat videos, videos of Darwin-Award winners and nominees, etc.On the other hand, you can pretend to be somebody else, cheat people out of their life savings from the other side of the world. You can be tracked by giant organizations that feed you more of what you want to hear/see and less of what you don’t want to see — even if it might be important for your wellbeing.Think of China and their recent handling of the Covid-19 outbreak. It was looking to be a massive event threatening more than a billion people in just their country. Then the government cracked down and made everybody separate, stay home, and so on, to thwart the further spread of the viral contagion. It looks like they might have succeeded. But, aside from having the laws in place to accomplish that, how did they do it? Phones and social media.The government controls the apps and options on all their citizens’ phones and devices, so they can and do track the location and movements of everybody. Did you break curfew or quarantine? Well, if you had your phone with you, they know about it.That’s all very fine when it’s short-term and is saving millions of lives.But once a power is available, nobody can restrain themselves from using it. So that genie is not going back in the bottle. Every citizen will be tracked every moment of their lives. Even if they go out without a phone, or with the battery removed, automated surveillance will match the numbers of people in every situation with the numbers of phones that are being tracked at that location - and since GPS can be accurate to a very precise degree, they can quickly pick out the location and movement of everybody in a crowd who has a phone… and by simple observation (automated… it doesn’t take a person to figure out “there are 22 faces in the lobby of this building but only 19 phones”) they can see who is not carrying a live phone, too. Cops surround the people trying to evade the all-seeing eye, and either coerce them to turn on their phone (put the battery back in - phones can be tracked without being “turned on”) or arrested or sent/taken back home to retrieve their tracking-tag/phone.They don’t even need the visual area-surveillance to make that calculation. The phone is your ticket to get on the bus or train, your entry to a bar, your payment method at every shop, and so on.In China, even before the Covid-19 problem, there were something like 15 million citizens who were black-listed for not keeping to proper social practices and constraints (as defined by the government) determined by their “Social credit” scores. They can’t get on flights. They can’t get on high-speed trains. They are barred from other activities until further notice. All of that is organized through the tech and enforced by law… and the interconnected technology.You probably think that isn’t coming to your country.Think again. All it takes is some bad situation that lets government officials plausibly deploy “emergency powers”. If the “emergency” is allowed to end, you can bet that another one will come along (even if it has to be concocted for the purpose) before long. The “emergencies” will get closer together and last longer, until soon, what were “emergency powers” will be the everyday reality for everybody.Have you ever done a FaceTime or video Skype or other video call, and heard how much sound is picked up from other rooms, not just the one where you and your device are connecting? If somebody farts at the other end of the house, it’s clearly heard by the mic on your phone or tablet. Yes, voice calls on your phone digitally screen out extraneous sounds. But the same is usually not done for videos, because you might want the ambient sound recorded with your video. It’s easy for somebody in control of your phone to hear every sound in your house; they just have toYou know how many people keep a piece of tape over the camera lens on their laptops, tablets, etc.? They know that that camera can be remotely switched on with no telltale light or sound to alert you, or your children. But nobody thinks about the camera and the mic on your phone.You say: “That’s not a problem for me. I’m law abiding. I have nothing to hide.”Sure. And the only people who can hack a phone or tablet or laptop are government functionaries. Sure.But think for a minute. It’s more than just nosy government and nasty criminals who might make use of the signal from your devices.Do you have a smart watch? Do you use it for sleep tracking. Or even exercise tracking with heart-rate, calories burned etc., where you go on your run/walk/bike-ride? Do you want your insurance company surveilling that info? Do you leave the phone on as it charges overnight? Or use it for that sleep tracking? Either way, it can tell if you snore. It can tell if you suffer sleep apnea, it can tell a bunch of other things, just from your motions and noises during the night, or the intensity of your workouts and stress on your heart.“So what?” you say. Well, so you might find that your insurance rates are going up or your coverage is diminishing, because you are a liability. That snoring and possible apnea signals serious health issues ahead, but it also means disturbed sleep most days so you are more likely to nod off at the wheel of your car. Now you know why your car insurance is getting more expensive even though you haven’t had an accident.Surely, you’ve seen the stories about baby monitors being hacked, and distraught parents hearing a strange male voice coming from the speaker in their child’s room.THAT is what is meant by technology being the master and not you.Are you feeling masterful?","99,916 followers",Alcatraz Dey,9K,1.4K,68.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Did-the-Emperor-of-Japan-really-hire-American-Soldiers-to-train-and-modernize-the-Japanese-Military-as-depicted-in-the-movie-The-Last-Samurai
