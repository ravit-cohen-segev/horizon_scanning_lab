Before you point to wind, hydro or solar I remind you that humans are using the secondary energy resources of that big old fusion ball in the sky (Sun) which is burning hydrogen into helium.Direct forms of burning stuff is fuels like wood, coal and oil. The next level of our ability to burn things is burning individuals atoms by splitting them, fission reactors can, theoretically, produce vast quantities of energy, far more than chemical burning of stuff (oil coal/natural gas).TheOther than figuring out how to make a warp bubble, which there is interesting work being done in that line, See:What prevents massive space ships from being launched from Earth’s surface at this time is we have to overcome the 9.8 m/s^2 or 32 feet/s^2 gravitational pull of earth. Since we are only burning chemicals with tiny amounts of energy conversion we rely on Space-X and Saturn V giant rockets that are mostly fuel tanks and engines, with a few hundred tons of pay load.Fission has been proposed with little in the way of what do we do with the radioactive crater left behind when the ship launches. Fusion has been proposed but frankly other than hydrogen bombs (Both Fusion and Fission would enable humans to travel within days and weeks inside the inner solar system (inside Jupiter’s orbit) and within months to as far away as the Pluto formally known as planet.While proposals for building super sized interstellar crossing ships have been put out there, the closest star system,The most efficient fuel source we can think of is the conversion of 100% matter into energy. The only way we know how this can be done with 100% certainty is the annihilation of matter with equal amounts of antimatter.AntimatterWithout the ability to warp space travel between the stars would still take long periods of time. The best we could hope to achieve is around 80% the speed of light. By that speed the crew are reaping the rewards of time dilation with the fuel/energy expenditure falling within acceptable levels.This is called “Relativistic Speeds” where time slows down, distances decrease and mass grows larger. Mind to the crew the rest of the universe is going faster while to them all is tick-tocking away at a steady tick per second as a second onboard the vessel will be a second. To those outside looking at the craft, the crew members are slowing down and aging slowly.This comes in handy if we are sending one way missions to far away exo-planets where we plan to colonize. The colonists would be able to get there in a reasonable ship board time. Although the longer they travel at those speeds the more time passes on earth.Now we know that Relativistic Speeds are a non-issue on Star Trek. Time on board ships and on planets is the same. IDK how they managed it.Perhaps a property of warping space? If so then we have to wait a wee bit longer until we can harvest and use dark energy.We are at the manipulate nuclear energy stage. We have already created and captured tiny amounts of anti-matter. During the rest of this century we will most likely fine tune our ability to use anti-matter. Mind TPTB want to store anti-matter and make bombs out of it. Typical? Yeah. However creating and immediately using anti-particles may become a way for space engines to effectively convert fusion into ‘rockets’.Estimated time of arrival on Antimatter propulsion 2100 to 2150.

We have had fusion for the past 63 years.http://aviationweek.com/technology/skunk-works-reveals-compact-fusion-reactor-detailsThe first fusion ‘super’ bomb was built and tested March 1, 1954 in the Pacific Range.This used the Jetter Cycle, a nuclear fuel cycle discovered by Ulrich Jetter in the late 40s. Fission normally takes place by the absorption of a neutron by a fissile material which causes the material to break down and release more neutrons. So, controlling neutron flux by absorption or reflecting lost neutrons back into the pile, controls the power output. That’s because materials heavier than Iron-56 release energy when they break apart.Fusion of course occurs when nuclei lighter than Iron 56 join together to create heavier materials. This is easily seen in the energy per nucleon chart of all isotopes of elements.Jetter looked carefully at the energy per nucleon data accumulated across the periodic table and noticed that Lithium-6 and to a lesser extent Beryllium and Boron, drop in energy dramatically - leaving Helium-4 to form a sort of spike that interrupts the smooth curve.Well, Jetter understood that Lithium-6 readily absorbs a neutron to form a Triton and an Alpha particle - releasing 4.8 MeV. 77.17 TJ/kg of Lithium-6! Of course you need 1/6th kg of neutrons to make that happen. However, Jetter also knew that the Triton had way more energy than needed to fuse with a Deuteron releasing another 17.6 MeV. Another 339.6 TJ/kg of D+T. When Tritium combines with Deuterium you get another Alpha aka Helium-4 and you get your neutron back.Given the way energy and momentum add, most of the energy ends up in the neutron. That can be a good thing because you can put something in that absorbs energetic neutrons and produces more less energetic neutrons - allowing a sort of fission to take place.The net reaction is Lithium-6 plus Deuterium produce 2 Helium-4 plus 22.4 MeV. The net reaction 270.2 TJ/kg of Lithium6Deuteride. a White Powder that’s 0.82 g/cc.Now, the material you put in the mix to manage the production of many low energy neutrons from a single high energy neutron determines how fast the reaction can grow.More on Jetter Cycle here.https://ieer.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/1998/07/DangerousThermonuclearQuest.pdfSo, if you want to make a hydrogen bomb like Castle Bravo, you need a prompt source of a lot of neutrons, which a fission device provides (the heat and pressure have nothing to do with it).Yet, by 1956 researchers had developed a fission free bomblet that they called “The Humanitarian H-Bomb” and folks began talking about nuclear pulse spaceships.

Project Sherwood (still classified) was the nuclear fusion reactor program. The success was so great that Lewis Strauss the chair of the AEC at the time (AEC preceded DoE) when asked about the coming peak oil situation predicted for 1970, said to reporters that by 1970 energy would be ‘too cheap to meter’. Shortly after Strauss was embroiled in a controversy, Fake News of the day, and removed from power. Other enthusiasts scheduled to testify before Congress about commercialising the results of Project Sherwood died in an unfortunate helicopter accident in the Pacific Range during a nuclear test. So, the testimony never took place. The Join Chiefs re-classified the data following the departure of Strauss, and the congressional committee on nuclear fusion began the hot fusion research program we have today.Lewis Strauss after his ‘too cheap to meter’ statement - accused of corruption.Lewis Strauss before his ‘too cheap to meter’ statement - hero who would bring us the ‘super’ bomb.The world today produces 600,000 tonnes of lithium per year and 45,000 tonnes (7.5%) is lithium-6. Lithium-6 is easily separated from Lithium-7 (which acts as a poison to the Jetter cycle).Deuterium is easily separated from heavy water, which is easily made from sea water. So, humanity can make 60,000 tonnes of Lithium-6 Deuteride at a cost of $480 million - $8 per kg. - $0.48 billion.Humanity spend $6,400 billion on coal, natural gas and crude oil each year. Another $2,000 billion per year is spent by the world’s military to secure supplies of oil.At 270.2 TJ/kg the cost of course is too cheap to meter. The reaction products are 1 kg of Helium-4 for each kg of Li6D. 60,000 tonnes produces 1.621 *10^22 Joules per year. 514.08 TW.Humanity, burning coal, natural gas, and crude oil, produces 17.6 TW of power. So, we produce 29.21x the energy we need from Lithium-6 Deuteride. So, actual cost of fuel is $16.4 million per year.Herman Kahn, futurist for RAND Corporation said of this process that Capitalism would defeat Communism because Capitalism will make all proletariats millionaires by 1990.

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",0 followers,Ashok Bishnoi,12.8K,314,7.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Can-anyone-provide-a-time-estimate-on-when-humanity-will-be-able-to-achieve-intergalactic-travel

Unless the costs of producing electricity from a nuclear fusion power plant can be at least as low as the cost of electricity from existing nuclear fission power plants and probably more like lower than the cost of electricity from renewables, no one is going to build these things.","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Can-anyone-provide-a-time-estimate-on-when-humanity-will-be-able-to-achieve-intergalactic-travel

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but it really isn’t. Even in the core of the sun, fusion generates only a small amount of net heat. A cubic metre of the sun’s fusing core only generates around 275 watts. That’s less energy output than we give off as body heat for an equivalent volume. The reason why the sun is so hot is because there are hundreds of thousands of miles of insulation (in the form of hot gas contained by gravity) around this heating centre.There’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), and then we have to extract sensible energy without causing the whole reaction to stall and still end up with enough energy to outweigh the inevitable energy losses.I hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be.

Still, many people, including Congress, would like to know for certain if inertial confinement fusion will ultimately work and actually produce net energy from fusion. To answer this question, in the final few years of cold war underground nuclear testing, both LANL and LLNL designed a series of test shots called Halite-Centurion. Halite-Centurion series shots were fusion related add on shots piggy-backed onto shots already on the test schedule. These shots were designed to utilize a small portion of the X-rays produced from the primary of an experimental device through a line of sight to a remote fusion experiment housed some tens of meters away in the underground experimental test canister. Lasers and Ion-beam fusion drivers such as were available at that time (1980 - 1992) could not provide the driver energy required to produce full fusion ignition - but X-rays from a remotely ignited fission device could provide the driver energy needed to make full ICF fusion ignition with energy gain work (driver energy >20 MJ energy delivered into a spot of about 2 mm in a time of less than 3 nanoseconds) .Halite-Centurion fusion experiments in the Nevada desert worked reliably and repeatedly producing full fusion ignition of small sub-gram samples of DT fuel. These experiments were once classified but DOE declassified about half of Hailte-Centurion fusion related information and allowed senior scientist Dr. John Lindl reveal the declassified material.During the cold war LANL and LLNL did preliminary pure fusion device designs but were not successful with 1970s fusion driver technology. In the year 2001 DOE permitted disclosure of the fact that the US had a well organized and well funded sustained effort to produce ultra-clean pure fusion devices.RESTRICTED DATA DECLASSIFICATION DECISIONS 1946 TO THE PRESENThttp://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/rdd-7.html(see section C of this document)NIF is currently only capable of delivering about 2.15 MJ of energy to the windows of the fusion hohlraum (and about 26 kJ of X-ray energy to the actual fusion capsule holding the fusion fuel). NIF produces short bright powerful light pulses on the order of about 100 femtoseconds in width but delivers only 1/1000th the energy to the fusion capsule as was deposited in successful practical cold war Halite-Centurion experimental field tests that produced full ICF fusion ignition and burning plasma.Losses inside the hohlraum reduce delivered laser energy to the actual fusion capsule to around 26 kilojoules of energy. NIF is currently not capable of producing full fusion ignition but succeeds in operating in a ""alpha-heating"" regime that occurs just prior to full fusion ignition.Graph showing contributions of Alpha Heating at NIFWhat is lacking in current ICF fusion experiments to support building of practical ICF fusion power plants is a fusion driver with characteristics close enough to the driver employed by LANL and LLNL in Halite-Centurion tests to permit full fusion ignition with energy gain. The needed driver should be capable of delivering greater than 20 MJ into a focused spot less than a 2 mm in diameter in time of less than 3 nanoseconds. The current NIF laser driver is capable of delivering about 2 MJ total energy and is only able to achieve ""alpha heating"" phase of fusion operation - a stage that immediately precedes fusion ignition. LASNEX and HYDRA computer simulations of the mid-1990s on which LLNL based the engineering design of the NIF laser were overly optimistic in predicting the required fusion driver characteristics to produce ignition. Failure of the mid-1990s LASNEX and HYDRA simulations resulted in NIF being built too small to achieve the goal of fusion ignition and for NIF to serve as the technical basis of the LIFE ICF fusion power plant. It must also however be admitted that beside driver energy and power, there are other slightly lower priority (but still important) unsolved engineering issues for ICF including implosion symmetry and plasma instabilities (Rayleigh-Taylor) that rob energy from ICF plasma when it nears fusion conditions. Use of a more robust fusion driver such as was employed in cold war Halite-Centurion X-ray initiated DT fusion experiments permitted slightly less than optimum symmetry and mild plasma instabilities and still work under slightly sub-optimum conditions and produce DT fusion ignition with production of energy gain.While ICF pure fusion is being held back by inadequate fusion driver technology (lasers or particle accelerators) - the four decade sustained progress in the field of High Power Pulsed Lasers has been phenomenal. Fast Pulse lasers are rapidly improving relative to other possible ICF fusion drivers. While lasers are getting more powerful - they are also getting physically smaller and cheaper to build and operate.Progress in the power of Fast Pulse Lasers exceeds sustained progress in any other technical field (including semiconductors - Moore’s Law) -High Power Pulsed LasersIt is however the case that in the current environment of sustained rapid technical progress, laser drivers are still too small to reliably produce ICF DT fusion ignition. Successful ICF fusion ignition requires both high delivered power combined with sufficient total energy to produce full fusion conditions in the ICF fusion capsule.Practical Commercial Molten Salt Fusion Power Plants that actually make commercial electricity (and in a time frame that makes a difference) -Dr. Ralph Moir has designed several Molten Salt Fusion Power Plants. His ideas are very good and should be given greater attention and study.
