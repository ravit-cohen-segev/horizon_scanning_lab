2,"AI will offer everyone personal assistance…all the time. Did you see the movie “Her”? While I don’t think the “fall in love with machine” aspect will be true, many of the ways that the robot helps the main character (Theodore) will be in reach.But that’s one of the thousands of ways that AI will impact us in 10 years. Self-driving cars, autonomous warehouses and factories, medical AI advice and much, much more.Your question is akin to me asking someone in 1998 how the internet would affect them over the next 10 years.

In 1998 Amazon was just an online bookstore, there was no youtube (and video was far too bandwidth-intensive to use), there was no Wikipedia, there was no Netflix. The changes wrought by AI (the Deep Learning algorithms already in place and their descendants) will be of a magnitude and variety that is comparable to the creation of the internet.","284,850 followers",James Altucher,991,878,91.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-will-artificial-intelligence-shape-the-way-we-live-and-work-in-the-next-10-years
3,"I’m not sure I’m the target user, because I mostly use my assistants for amusement and to tell them to play music. I did find the conversational ‘bots kind of interesting (just tell Alexa ‘let’s chat’ for some entertainment).But I do think those assistants and chatbots are largely where AI comes into play in our lives and that will grow in the next decade. Soon enough we’ll tell our cars where we want them to take us, our phones will do even more things by plain language voice commands, and our computers will pull up movies and games and such likewise.",36 followers,Adam Ambrozy,579,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-will-artificial-intelligence-shape-the-way-we-live-and-work-in-the-next-10-years
4,"I can answer this question from perspective of healthcare.AI in next ten years would have a very little effect on the way healthcare is delivered. The reason for this is that healthcare is too complex for AI to be utilized safely/effectively and existing inflation in healthcare is prohibitory for a costly technology such as AI.Whatever little impact it will have will be on patients who require high end medical devices, and such patients are very few in numbers. So general population would remain isolated from effect of AI in the way healthcare is delivered.","8,706 followers",Mario Galindo Queralt,529,637,8.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-will-artificial-intelligence-shape-the-way-we-live-and-work-in-the-next-10-years
5,"The development of two dimensional integrated circuits is nearing it’s physical limits. We have nanotechnology as advanced material science. But, we have no nanotechnology as atomically precise molecular assembly.I think these are the pointers for that “next step”, I would also recommend familiarizing yourself with Eric Drexler’s work (watch youtube video first, then read his books) and the curly haired guy in the video’s material (he’s Neil Gershenfeld:",UNKNOWN,J.
