We wait for it to go up. It does.Now we start to get afraid.The stock has moved from Rs. 100 to Rs. 150.It is a gain of 50%.We exit half the position with this gain afraid that we may lose the profit.After few months it is at Rs. 200.We exit the balance position.We made our profit and invest the money in some other popular stock of the day again say at Rs. 100.Five Years Later…..The stock which we exited is trading at Rs. 2000.But we had exited at 150 and 200.The stock we bought as a new investment is down to Rs. 10.Where is the profit?Nowhere.We restricted our profit to 75% ( average of 50 and 100 ) but did not get out of a losing investment while it went down by 90%.This is fear which makes us do it.One can never get rich by such approach to investment.Being a passive investor and letting the power of compounding work for you is wonderful.Being a passive investor andOne needs to take action in such cases.You have to get rid of such stocks at the sign of declines. One can wait for a rebound once or twice, but not forever.NIFTY/ SENSEX do not tell the true story of Markets:NIFTY and SENSEX represent Indian markets.When I say that they do not tell the true story, there is bound to be some disagreement.I accept that.I write from the viewpoint of a common investor who invests in stocks believing n the compounding, believing that NIFTY 50 stocks are good enough for long term perspective and hope that economy of the country will be doing well over a period of time.But getting rich from the markets is never that easy.I will show it by examples over two different time spans.(a)and(b)This is a screen shot from myIt can be seen that NIFTY 8500 PUT was bought which ended in a loss, so NIFTY was above 8500 .Currently it is above 10300, a gain of 1800 points ( over 20% ) in less than 3 years.Canara Bank traded above Rs. 440 on February 04, 2015.Now it is at Rs. 390 after the booster news of recapitalization.SBI was near Rs. 300.It is presently at 332.Reliance Communication was near Rs. 75.It is down to Rs. 13.55 presently having gone below Rs. 10.00 a few days ago.ONGC was at Rs. 350 level.It is at Rs. 181 now.BHEL was near Rs. 270.The present price is near Rs. 92. There was a 2:1 split so the comparing price would be 138.So it s down to 138 from 270.Only DLF and VOLTAS have made significant gains from my list of stocks traded in February 2015.And SBI has gained 10% when the market gained 20%.A person holding such portfolio would surely have lost money while hearing the news of new market highs every few days on the business channels.And these were not bad stocks.Now we can call them bad as they did not go up when there has been an all time high for the indices.It establishes the fact that it is not easy to make money through passive investments.And I have not pointed out the low points of these stocks which they went to when the markets were at the low point in Jan/Feb 2016.Many investors would have got nervous at that point and got out missing the upward journey from that time.The wealth destroyers:Now we come to the wealth destroyers over the period 2008 to 2017.NIFTY was at around 6000 levels in January 2008, fell to near 2500 levels by October 2008 and has crossed 10300 in November 2017.Apparently all good.But these stocks ( they were constituents of NIFTY in 2008 ) which were the darlings of the market in 2008 are down in dumps today.Few of the examples to illustrate the point:This is the quote forIt was at a high of Rs. 844 in January 2008.Today it languishes at Rs. 13.55.Nifty has moved up from 6000 to above 10000.This stock is at less than 2% of the high price.What could be a better example of wealth destruction.Then there isWhile the markets have been bullish, UNITECH has been on a down spiral.It was at Rs. 546 in January 2008.Now it is traded at Rs. 6.20.A big public sector capital goods companyThe decline is not as sharp as the earlier two cases.But the high in 2007 was Rs. 390.67 ( adjusted for recent split) while it currently trades for Rs. 92.This is 75% decline in 10 years while the market has gained by about 75%.And till very recently it was a permanent constituent of NIFTY 50.The example will not be completed without the much talked about stocks today where big investors made purchases this year and last year.Suzlon Energy was the media darling in 2008.From a high of Rs. 412, it is now at Rs. 14 levels.In 10 years, it has lost 97% value.Is it not plain disaster?Jaiprakash Associates was in Power Projects, Highways, Cement , all the sunrise industries in 2008.The stock was at a high of Rs. 339 in January 2008.Exactly eight years later in January 2016, it was at an all time low of Rs. 5.30.Currently it trades at Rs. 19 levels.The fall has been almost one way.There are many horror stories similar to these.And people are stuck with these investments.They never knew when to get out of bad investments.Unless and until one learns to get out of bad investments, there would be no profits to see.There would be no compounding and multiplication of value.Experts on TV will keep on talking about the new highs, while these investments will keep on touching new lows.To Summarize:To make money is never easy.To become rich by stock market investments is possible, desirable but not easy.You have to let your good investments run.Do not exit by taking small profits.You have to get out of bad investments fast.Otherwise you will find yourself in the situation described in above examples.To do this requires overcoming fear and greed.To do this requires patience.To do this requires some luck as well.Hence, we conclude that getting rich through stock market is not easy though it may appear to be so.Thanks for reading.Enjoy your Sunday.Images:",6 followers,Ryan Burner,1.6K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Who-can-top-Shuris-advanced-technology-designs-or-at-least-come-close

You'll notice that the sophistication of Batman's devices has slowly increased over the 50+ years since he was invented, and pretty much mirror technological progress.Iron Man, on the other hand, is pure Science Fiction. The technology to produces a man-sized suit, self-powered, capable of flight, force projection (in the form of his repulsors), a wide variety of advanced sensors, very powerful weaponry, and extreme physical protection from ""ordinary"" weapons is very far outside the modern realm of possibility.  Iron Man's suit and capabilities are also pretty static since his creation, which is another hallmark of a SciFi setting - the technology is so far advanced beyond what is capable, that even after 50 years of advancement, the tech being shown is STILL well out of reach.It's highly unlikely that even a small portion of the technologies shown to be possessed by Iron Man will be practical in the 21st century.

With the enemy not having the ability to shoot back, guess who can concentrate SOLELY on firing and not getting shot at in return.What about this guy?Falcon is shooting Steyr SPPs, they’re shooting 9mm pistol rounds and they were pretty darn effective, not to mention that him flying means he wasn’t able to really get hit til he flew too low. You know what would be even better than one of him in the air?How about a few of these bad boys which has a standard load of up to 8 hellfire missiles and 38 70mm rockets with 1,200 rounds of 30mm ammo that would absolutely shred anything a 9mm could touch. Also since they hover, they can safely sit above their own forces and rain down hell WITHOUT flying over the enemy and risking them jumping up and getting them.Remember this guy as well?Rhodes in this image is about to drop a bunch of small cluster bombs on the enemy line, a tactic that is shown to be VERY effective in this type of close contact fight. Since he’s also in the sky the enemy is pretty much unable to attack him, since they don’t have range. Now I’m not going to say that he isn’t better armed than most weapons platforms, because I think he is, but you know what comes close?Designed to kill tanks, this thing has a 30mm gatling gun, designed for low speeds, and can drop bombs in close air support. Throw 5 of those in the air and you have some pretty nice air coverage over a small enemy line.Ok but the spears are close combat weapons, that gives them an advantage in close combat. Yea modern militaries have those they’re these things.Meet the modern day bayonet. Fun fact spears/pikes were discontinued from militaries because as soon as the bayonet was developed every rifleman became a spear man. That also meant that every range troop became a melee troop.Now Wakanda did have some cool things that would have made them more effective than modern military such as this.But you know what makes that no longer worthwhile? When you order your troops to do this.The shield wall shown above looks pretty Roman inspired (makes sense Romans did invade parts of Africa), it’s designed for you to attack the person to your right and the guy to the left to attack the man in front of you. Leading towards enemies being attacked by someone they aren’t facing. You also know why it works so well? Because the formation and everyone acting as one unit can stop a charging force dead in their tracks and essentially it’s just enemies beating against a wall. You know what makes it worthless and how Romans lost battles, when they lose the shield wall and did what you see above.The wall is so effective guess who still uses it today!Modern SWAT teams for riot control!This also doesn’t take into account modern armies using things like theseOr theseOr how about theseNow I’m not saying that battle wasn’t entertaining, because it definitely was. But what I am saying is that rushing into a group of monsters with spears that shoot FREAKING ENERGY instead of standing back behind your shield wall and shooting them til they actually get close enough to engage in melee is so dumb that Black Panther should have his crown taken away, all of his generals should lose their positions, and USAF Colonel Rhodes, and USAF Pararescue Trooper Sam Wilson, and Captain Steve Rodgers who fought in World War 2 with ground combat experience should be ashamed and feel responsible for a LOT of Wakandan deaths.The Wakanda Sonic Spear is a great idea, and is a call back to weapons that Africa is most recognized for, shields and spears. For cinematic purposes it also looks neat, but practically it’s not that great considering that aiming a spear from 100 yards away is going to be a HELL of a lot harder than aiming a rifle with a scope. It was also shown that the power wasn’t necessary against their opponents, so that didn’t really make it worthwhile either.End of the day it’s a movie and it does look cool. Reality is that an energy spear isn’t practical at all and that even if they took them throughout the world a modern army would mop the floor with them with what we’ve seen them use. We’ve seen no artillery, air support, or armored units really and quite frankly a modern military could kill their troops without Wakanda even seeing them before the bombs or artillery started dropping. This doesn’t mention at all that seeing a freaking energy blast travel through the air gives away your position pretty easily!So there’s the answer, they look cool but in reality they’re dumb. You don’t need an energy spear to kill someone when a bullet will do the job just as well.*****EDIT 1: Thank you to to everyone, this is my largest Quora answer to date and hats off to the great and respectful comments all around thank you guys.Special shoutout to Jonathan Lausch for his edit suggestions as well.EDIT 2: 1.8k upvotes wow thank you everyone!

I’m guessing Thanos didn’t send Corvus specifically after Vision just because he thought it would be a fun match-up. Pretty much all the Children of Thanos have some sort of advantage during their initial showing. Maw can hold his own against Strange. Corvus can overpower Vision.Towards the end of the movie, Vision seems like he still hasn’t fully recovered from Corvus’s attack on him. He acts like he’s injured pretty consistently. It’s also possible, too, that whatever Shuri was doing to attempt to remove the stone from him was also weakening him, as it effectively would involve slowly cutting off his access to the source of his powers.The out-of-universe reason is that Vision and Wanda needed to be in danger, and Thanos and the Children of Thanos needed to seem like a credible threat. Hard to threaten a guy who can make himself intangible at will. So give Corvus the ability to cancel out that power.Problem solved.",108 followers,Richard Mason,811,1.3K,20M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Can-you-still-become-a-rich-stock-broker-like-Will-Smith-s-Chris-Gardner-story-with-today-s-advance-technology

Maria Hill is an employee of Stark Industries as far as we know. S.H.I.E.L.D. appears to no longer exist at least in the movie continuity.Also, the Avengers went to Wakanda to have the mind stone removed from Vision assuming Thanos was on his way to collect it. They were not aware that he was sending the Outriders or to attack the location before he arrived. The Avengers did appear to be ready to defend Vision but they did not know exactly what to expect. They should have known that the Black Order would be able to track the mind stone to Wakanda but it’s not clear that they anticipated this.I agree that military assistance would have been helpful. I don’t recall seeing any Wakandan soldiers die in the battle with Thanos’ forces but some probably did. The whole battle lasted no more than 30 minutes though so it would have been difficult for anyone to mobilize fast enough to be effective.

We know a great deal about classical techniques for quarrying and moving stone and constructing buildings both through archaeological investigation and through texts which have come down to us, and there are no techniques the Greeks used which would have been unavailable the Egyptians and Babylonians. We have, in short, a very good idea of how they were built, which boils down to carefully and laboriously carving stone with hand tools and stacking up the blocks, just like every other Greek temple or other such fancy building. Contrary to what video games may have taught you, they were not, for the most part, next-level technological achievements, but rather aesthetic ones. They were pretty place to go see, not anachronistic artifacts. They were made by purely human labor with the tools of the time. No giants, no aliens, no lasers, no antigravity.And we’ve known this for decades, if not centuries. While the works of the great classical architects were lost to the west through most of the Middle Ages, they were recovered by the Renaissance. There are, in short, no profound secrets or mysteries. There are ignorant people who assume their lack of knowledge means it’s unknown, and particularly in the case of the Great Pyramid, people who actively reject scientific findings in favor of romantic imagination, but the information is available to anyone who cares to undertake a bit of study.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Can-you-still-become-a-rich-stock-broker-like-Will-Smith-s-Chris-Gardner-story-with-today-s-advance-technology
