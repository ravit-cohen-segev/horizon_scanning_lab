1,"In some cases, yes.When teachers are forced to use technology that they didn‚Äôt ask for, but the administrators purchased for them, it can actually be detrimental to the students‚Äô education.Administrators sometimes treat technology like it‚Äôs a bonfire on a cold evening; the students need only sit near it while it‚Äôs on, and magically they will learn more. For some administrators, any tech will do, regardless of whether the teachers requested it.Enter the educational technology salespeople. They‚Äôre like used car salesmen with less integrity.

For some administrators, any tech will do, regardless of whether the teachers requested it.Enter the educational technology salespeople. They‚Äôre like used car salesmen with less integrity. Imagine if your all-too-trusting grandmother went to the shadiest used car lot in town to buy you a new used car, and began by making sure the salespeople knew that she didn‚Äôt know a thing about cars, but she had plenty of money to spend on one.That‚Äôs what some administrators are like to educational technology salespeople.‚ÄúSo, Mrs. Smith‚Ä¶ I see here that the students at your school aren‚Äôt scoring so well on standardized tests‚Ä¶ Well, I have just the thing for you: a subscription to a math program for all of your students. It‚Äôs just $20 per month per student, one-year minimum contract, 300 students minimum. We‚Äôll even throw in a one-hour training course for all of the teachers who will use it, right in the middle of their summer vacations. Whaddaya say?‚ÄùMany years ago, I taught at a school that had six different online, third-party, pay-per-student programs. Each student was enrolled in no fewer than three programs, which, of course, the teachers were expected to use consistently‚Ä¶ their own lesson plans and best practices be damned. I had two days per week when I could teach what I thought the students needed to learn. The other three days were online instruction via different, expensive-so-you-must-use-them programs. Not surprisingly, the students didn‚Äôt do as well that year as they‚Äôd done in previous years. I was able to convince my administrator to scale back two of the programs that I thought were not worth the money.And don‚Äôt even get me started on hardware that teachers are expected to use because the administrators were suckered into buying them. I once wrote about my experience with an administrator who was swindled into spending the entire tech budget on Smartboards for all of the teachers, but wasn‚Äôt told that those Smartboards would also need to be hooked up to computers and projectors:Matthew Bates's answer to What is the most ‚Äútechnologically illiterate‚Äù thing you‚Äôve ever seen someone do?Then there are the administrators who spend small fortunes on laptops for the students, because that‚Äôs what the students in all of the educational magazines have, but they forget to invest in servers, routers, high-speed internet, or charging stations for those new laptops, thus making them essentially useless.My advice is this:If you are an administrator, ASK THE TEACHERS what technology they‚Äôd like for their students and in their classrooms, and be prepared for teachers who say ‚Äúnone, thank you.‚ÄùIf you insist on going with one-to-one student tech, make sure your think about all of the behind-the-scenes stuff that makes that tech run smoothly. And, for God‚Äôs sake, be consistent with the tech you purchase each year. If you‚Äôre going with iPads, stick with iPads. Don‚Äôt just buy whatever is cheapest at any given time.","246,855 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-fun-and-innovative-ways-you-use-technology-to-engage-your-students-and-supplement-your-classroom-curriculum
2,"I have a comic book/graphic novel library in my classroom.I just got some new graphic novels for it today, actually.In the early days of the pandemic lockdowns I, like so many other people, took the extra time to go through my old collectables in my basement. I got out my single box of comic books from when I was in middle school in the early 1990s, catalogued them, then started going to comic book stores in the area to finish some of the series that I started collecting back then. Once in the stores, I noticed new series that interested me, so I started collecting those, too.For over a year,I have a comic book/graphic novel library in my classroom.I just got some new graphic novels for it today, actually.In the early days of the pandemic lockdowns I, like so many other people, took the extra time to go through my old collectables in my basement.

Once in the stores, I noticed new series that interested me, so I started collecting those, too.For over a year, I took frequent trips to comic book stores in the area. I was enjoying collecting them again, but I felt like they were just wasting space in my basement after I read them. Then I remembered that I am an English teacher, and these fall under the umbrella of ‚Äúbooks,‚Äù so I took two shelves I already had in my classroom, and started putting comic books and graphic novels on them for my students to check out when they have extra time.‚ÄúCheck out‚Äù as in ‚Äúlook at,‚Äù not like ‚Äúcheck out of a library.‚Äù It‚Äôs on the honor system. If they want to, they can take them home to read them, as long as they bring them back.They always do. Nothing has walked away and not returned yet. That‚Äôs one of the benefits of teaching at a Catholic school. Nothing has ever been stolen from my classroom before.About a dozen students, all boys, use the library. I like knowing that my comic books are getting read by more people than just me, and I like that some of those boys wouldn‚Äôt pick up a book to read ‚Äújust for fun‚Äù otherwise. I‚Äôve tried getting titles that were specifically targeted towards girls, but with no luck so far. I‚Äôm not giving up yet, though.According to the app I use to track my collection, it‚Äôs grown from fewer than 100 books when the lockdowns began, to over 900 books now. About 25% of them are in my classroom at any given time. The rest are no longer in my basement, but in my reading room, next to the fireplace and recliner, where I do most of my reading. My goal this summer is to build custom boxes for them.",0 followers,Hemanth BK,506,61,99.1K,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-fun-and-innovative-ways-you-use-technology-to-engage-your-students-and-supplement-your-classroom-curriculum
