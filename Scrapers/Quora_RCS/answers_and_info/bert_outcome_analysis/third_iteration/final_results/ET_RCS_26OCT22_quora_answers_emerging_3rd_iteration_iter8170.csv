A country where the women are prayed became the blood stained graveyard of a young woman.1987 was a year when print media was more pronounced than the electronic media. The news regarding her immolation grabbed the headlines 13 days later on September 17,1987. An event called as Chunri Mahotsava was held to celebrate 13 days of her death.The print media then drew its attention to this horrific incident and it strongly criticized an abolished archaic practise already made illegal 150 years ago.This inhumane act became a topic of nationwide debate and it brought the plight of widows before the nation.The media described how a black sheet was put around a widow in Rajasthan so that no men or married women can see her. She must sit on the floor all day, her knees drawn close to her chest, in a dark cubicle. Only at night can she step out to wash, go to the toilet and eat one meal – consisting of food without any salt.This inhumane act became a topic of nationwide debate and it brought the plight of widows before the nation.The media described how a black sheet was put around a widow in Rajasthan so that no men or married women can see her.

Here are few personalities whose sacrifice has impacted modern India.Kalpana Chawla -In later sixties while watching a little girl at the age of around  6-8 staring at the flying planes for hours and hours from the roof top in a small town of Haryana in India perhaps nobody in the surroundings might have thought that one day this little girl would make them proud by creating a history in the world through her glorious contribution to space inventions.'Kalpana  Chawla' ( July 1,1961 - February 1,2003 ) was an astronaut and  space shuttle mission specialist of STS-107 ( Columbia ) who was  killed when the craft disintegrated after reentry into the Earth's  atmosphere .Kalpana Chawla was India's first women aeronautical engineer to travel into space.Kalpana is said to be  second India born astronaut. But very few persons know  that there is a big difference between Rakesh Sharma, the first Indian who traveled in to space and Kalpana who explored the space. Rakesh Sharma was just an international passenger without any responsibility on Soviet space flight. Whereas Kalpana was selected by NASA as an astronaut on the basis of her strong academic career and experience and she had to perform crucial duties on board. In her both visits to space she was roped in with the responsibilities of handling of the space shuttle and experimenting in space.She has been a role model to several women in terms of  achievement and contributions to the field of aeronautics. Growing up in  a male dominant society, Kalpana never let her dreams of flying be  affected in any way. In fact she was the first woman to study  aeronautical engineering in her batch.Achievements and AccoladesDespite living in America, Kalpana Chawla was considered the pride of  India. She was the first Indian woman to travel in a space shuttle for  372 hours and complete 252 rotations around the Earth's atmosphere. Her  achievements have been an inspiration to many others in India and  abroad. There are many science institutions named after her.During her lifetime, Kalpana Chawla was awarded with three awards namely  the Congressional Space Medal of Honor, NASA Space Flight Medal and the  NASA Distinguished Service Medal.Some Facts about Dr. Kalpana ChawlaFirst and only Indian-American in space (she was born in India and became a naturalized U.S. citizen)MEMORIAOn February 5, 2003, India's Prime Minister announced that the  meteorological series of satellites, ""METSAT"", will be renamed as  ""KALPANA"". The first satellite of the series, ""METSAT-1"", launched by  India on September 12, 2002 will be now known as ""KALPANA-1"".Generally people die unsung and are forgotten even before their last rites are over. There are a few lucky ones like Kalpana Chawla who live in everyone’s heart forever. Well, to give tribute to the daughter of India various news stories are still flooding in media, awards and trophies in her name are being introduced at various level of education and space research activities, one satellite is being named after her. But the real tribute to Kalpana Chawla will be to provide more and more knowledge and information to ignite the hunger for the achievement, virtue and capabilities that she had and to struggle with the hardship as she faced, to the future generation. This will facilitate them their best role model and make them firm determined to turn up their dream in to reality.

In far too many cases they gave everything they had including their lives so that future generations could live in societies which were free of fascism. brutality, racial oppression. Yet, one of the largest forces to fight against the Axis is hardly remembered, it was India. At the peak of World War II, India had 2.5 million men in arms fighting the Axis Powers. Nearly 6 million, Indian Civilians perished as a result of the World War II. The Bengal Famine was the end result of intentional British Policy directed in India. Winston Churchill would refuse to allow food assistance and continued to export food from India for the war effort. Eastern India would see its fishing boats burnt and largescale manipulation of food prices. Winston Churchill called this an action to “Starve” the Indian Freedom Fighters. In North Africa, Europe and Asia, India would lose 90,000 soldiers and hundreds of thousands would return home with lifelong injuries. These men were not taken care of or provided for like their counterparts in other parts of the Empire. Instead, they would be forgotten. India’s incredible financial contribution and supply of manufactured as well raw materials were never shown to be critical factors in the allied victory. The fact that India emerged in 1945 as the fourth largest industrial power in the world was a fact concealed desperately by the British Empire which hardly could govern India let alone lead it to prosperity which it had long ago stolen from it.Female Indian Army Personnel, 1939–1945Indians did not just fight as combat soldiers in World War II. There were pilots, navy men, doctors, nurses and a considerable portion of India’s population toiled more than 12 hours a day producing armaments, steel, and other materials for the war effort. India contributed more to the war effort than nations which are named routinely for their efforts in winning over fascism. Many Indians were recruited by force to join the army, others were pressed to shift production in their companies to support the war effort without choice such as my Great Grand Father Baba Shib Dayal Bedi. Princely states were forced to provide land and capital to support industrial output, along with Indian Industrialists who also dedicated production to the war effort.40% of all clothing made in India went to war production during World War II.All told, India factors in the upper portion of the list of nations which contributed to the Allied Victory in World War II. The fact that many Indians such as Subhas Chandra Bose attempted to use the war to bring freedom to India, does not in any way change the fact of India’s contribution. The fact that India was partitioned by the British Empire for its own geopolitical interests, and Pakistan was created as a result took away from the recognition that United India had given. In great measure more than 66% of that India geographically survives as India today. When Independence came, the shear chaos of partition would create an atmosphere where the idea of analyzing India’s role of World War II would not be a priority in comparison to ensuring the survival of a bankrupt India which had been handed back to Indians after 190 years of colonial rule.Japanese Posters at the time pushed Indians to rise against the British Empire. It was stated “Show the Devil a stick and save India.”Only three weeks of currency reserves were at hand for a nation of 350 million people, food shortages became rampant after the partition of Pakistan, and the struggle would be to feed this population somehow for the first three decades of Independence. When food production finally climbed to self-sufficient levels and export levels in the 1970s, World War II felt like someone else’s war to most Indians.August 15, 1947, India regains independence.Congress led governments had little interest in looking at World War II objectively. They had not supported the war effort in 1940s and instead allowed the Muslim League to gain political advantage as most Congress Leaders were jailed by the Colonial Government for this period. When they reemerged, the world had fundamentally changed. The British Empire was on its final wind, and the disconnect of its inability to remain in place until Congress came into grips with how to deal with the Muslim League was gone. Less than two years later India was being partitioned and the British Empire was leaving. Independence should have come after World War I, but the British Empire felt no need at that point to do so, though it had been promised by Parliament for India’s contribution of 1.5 million men in arms.The stories of India’s soldiers in World War II should not be forgotten.World War II, in all reality has a lot to do with how India received Independence and its partition. Analysis of the facts reveal that even those who fought against the British Empire by using support from the Empire of Japan, only did so for the goal of Indian Freedom, and not because of sympathies to fascism. The assistance they received was never enough to change the course of history, and in reality, had they been more successful it is likely they would have found themselves with alliances they would have to break. The War Indians fought in, may not have been their own, but their sacrifice was nothing but their own.

He was a very jovial guy, and a good Badminton player.One evening, after playing the game, he said we should play the next morning as well. Since we usually played only in the evenings, I was surprised that he wanted to wake up early in the morning to play, especially since we would have to rush for classes after the game. He jovially said, “Why? You’re afraid you might lose if we play in the morning?”And so we played the next morning as well. That afternoon, he committed suicide by hanging himself in his room.It turned out he was depressed because of the increased academic pressure, and because of not being able to score well in his first semester. He decided to quit rather than be labelled as a failure. Surprisingly, that depression never showed up on his face ever. He always seemed happy.Sushant Singh Rajput’s loss has struck a chord with so many people because it is another indicator that depression is real. There are hundreds of theories revolving around on the cause of his depression. Maybe some of them are true. Maybe not. We would never really know for sure what was troubling him.You never know what a person is suffering through, as in most of the cases, depression never shows up on the face. Depression does not look at success or money. It just happens. It can happen to anybody.However, suicide is still never the solution. And you have the power to prevent that around you.Look out for your friends and family, for any early signs of depression. If you yourself are feeling sad about anything, talk to someone close to you. Vent it out - it always helps.If you see someone around you getting bullied or ill treated, stop that person. This applies not just to physical bullying, but also to online bullying. In a lot of scenarios, bullying is so subtle that it goes unnoticed. Stop that.If you see someone feeling depressed because of academic failures, relationships or any other failures, step up and support them in their phase. However tough the situation might look like, suicide is still never the solution.If someone around you does a good job, appreciate them. Even a small token of appreciation can lighten up someone’s mood.Stop comparing children on the basis of academic success. Stop comparing people on the basis of salaries.

I started feeling restless.What I also came to know that Bollywood was just an iota in his life. His interests were something else. Being an engineer I could relate to all those topics which he was so much intrigued in. He was so generous that he donated for Nagaland and Kerala floods, donated for a cancer patient kid and sent young talents to NASA.He once quoted James Dean at an award show,“Being a good actor isn't easy, being a man is even harder. I want to be both before I am done.He was both of them. A good actor and a good human being. He was also a bibliophile. He had a Twitter account by the name “The Book Club"" where he recommended some really good books.We lost a true gem and a legend.Rest in peace theI am also posting some of my favourite photos of him.❤🦋🌪💫🌈",186 followers,Abinash Mishra,550,483,27.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Who-are-the-Indians-whose-sacrifice-changed-the-course-of-modern-history-of-India

Have no shame in that.Let go, be it anything, better being poor and fighting things out than ending any hope in life.Don't forget that there is a life beyond the biggest of miseries. Life goes on and time knows how to heal the biggest of wounds.Also, get some courage and tell your doctor that you feel suicidal, they will design an appropriate treatment to cure you.Most importantly, if you observe any change in behaviour or hopelessness in your loved ones, never ignore it.Whenever I feel stressed or broken, I remember my father’s lines which he repeats whenever he is miserable-‘Marenge thodi naa.’And then he calms down and moves on.",31 followers,Paresh Pratik,1.2K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Who-are-the-Indians-whose-sacrifice-changed-the-course-of-modern-history-of-India
16,"Suicide doesn’tI really admired Sushant Singh. After watchingSuicide doesn’tI really admired Sushant Singh. After watchingInInSushant came across as a very grounded, intelligent and hardworking man. He was originally suppose to be an engineer but decided to transition to becoming an actor. He doesn’t have any connections in the industry. So he had to work from square one, to get his feet into the door. He is a magnificent dancer. I’ve watched one interview of his and was astounded with the answer he gave to the reporter. He told the reporter, (I’m paraphrasing) “if you keep chasing after something, when you achieve it, momentarily you will be happy. Then you will sink into depression. So you keep trying to chase that high. But, if you love what you do, you will have those moments of high, while still enjoying day after day what you do.” I was speechless. These were such profound words, coming from a celebrity who has achieved so much success in his career. I was not expecting this level of wisdom from him.What makes this tragic was that it was merely a mask. You Google Sushant and you will find tons of pictures of him, dressed exceptionally and smiling. During his interviews he appears so proud of his achievement and hard work. His movies have been a success. Sushant transitioned from engineering student, to TV show actor to a full fledged movie star. There was an article that stated, Sushant refused a lucrative deal for a commercial that advertised skin whiting creams in order to enhance beauty. How many celebrities you know, sell out for money and promote a product that is damaging and cruel to their audience? Sushant couldn’t be bought. He understood the impact of these commercials and the message it sends to their audience, especially those who do not have fair skin. (Fair skin=beautiful. Dark skin=ugly.) He gave tons of his fans hope. Everyone loves to root for the underdog. What happens when the underdog gives up?Sushant lost his mother in 2003. He had four older sisters and he was the youngest child. He was in a six year relationship with his ex girlfriend, before the relationship ended. There has been speculation regarding the reasons why he committed suicide. He was given the cold shoulder by people in the industry. There would be elaborate parties and he would be intentionally excluded. His agent passed away on the 9th. Others say, maybe it was murder. What are the odds both he and his agent commit suicide so close to each other?I don’t know what happened. I saw an image circulating of the scene of his death. That’s an insult to his memory. The man died. His dying moment shouldn’t be publicly shared for the world to see. It’s an insult to his family who is hurting, seeking answers and suffering. I heard after his father heard the news, he passed out. He has been taken to the hospital and his health continues to deteriorate. No parent ever wants to see their child leave before them. The poor man lost his wife and now his only son. The impact of these two tragedies must be devastating.Sushant had demons. Demons we may never know about. He didn’t leave a suicide note. There has been updates stating that Sushant has been suffering from clinical depression for the past six months. We don’t know if he has been seeking help from a mental health professional. We know the man lost the battle. We don’t know what demons people are fighting behind closed doors. That smile we plaster onto our face when interacting with the world, can easily be faked.Remember Sushant. Remember all those we have lost to suicide. Remember these individuals who lived a life that had meaning and joy to everyone they interacted with. These lost individuals had family that loved them. Friends, lovers, classmates, coworkers, neighbors, etc.When someone be it family, friend, or even acquaintance comes to you and tells you “I’m not doing well. Can we talk?” Don’t brush them away. Don’t push them aside. You have no idea if this is a desperate attempt at reaching for help, or if that conversation will keep them away from the ledge. It’s hard to pinpoint depression. People that are suffering internally are skilled at hiding it. You won’t know unless they choose to discuss it with you. Always be willing to speak with people in need. You don’t know if you will get a second opportunity to do so.Remember Sushant. As there has been many that we have lost in the past to suicide. Committing suicide shouldn’t be the answer. Help others realize that.",UNKNOWN,Dr.Praveen Sheoran,559,204,241.3K,2020,https://www.quora.com/Who-are-the-Indians-whose-sacrifice-changed-the-course-of-modern-history-of-India

He would have portrayed that boy next door attitude as Manav amazingly!I felt like I lost someone whom I know personally.We can relate to his struggles. Many of us from middle-class families come to cities with a lot of dreams and ambitions.It isn’t that easy to be a TV star and successfully debut in Bollywood and give competition to all the leading stars in the market.When he died, he was at the peak of his career. He wasn’t some forgotten actor.His last movie, Dil Bechara was and is eagerly awaited by everyone.Every day, we are fighting for our dreams. There might arise a stage where someone might feel that they are done. That’s what happened to Sushant!But we should take his bucket list as our inspiration, not the negative aspects and get demotivated. Like him, I wish to support organic farming now.

I liked few of his movies and that was it.What happened to the cold exterior I had built over the past few years that let's nothing bother me much ?I introspected.It made me look around myself and think about the people in my life that I haven't been paying enough attention to.In the pursuit of my own desires and hobbies.I realised that I could have given more time to them specially in this lockdown period. Even though I did give time to them,it wasn't enough. I could give more.I feared and felt guilty that even when I knew they weren't okay , I chose to not pay much heed. Even when they were some of the closest friends I had.In my defence I can say I had my reasons. And the reason of my negligence wasn't apathetic. It was because I was in my own mess and insecurities regarding the future.I was afraid whether I'll be able to get a job and make my parents proud or I'll be left behind while my peers will become successful.But then we all have reasons. And though most of the things in life can be attributed to reasons , not checking on your close ones can't be I suppose.So instead of posting things like “Posting all this stuff is shallow in my opinion. Not many follow what they post on Social Media.This is why his death seems so personal! It made us think about our near ones we weren't paying attention to.I hope he's finally at peace among the stars he so adored !A little preface about the painting:-The painting is called “The Starry Night “. It was made by Dutch painter Vincent Van Gogh. It is said that he himself was in depression when he painted it. He soon committed suicide after.This painting was Sushant's Twitter background picture.Coincidence? I guess not.May be he was giving us subtle hints.

And I feel sad, not exactly sad, something different.We always see a celebrity as someone who has the most amazing lifestyle. High on glamour, high on fashion, high on luxuries and thus high on happiness. When Sushant’s news came to us, the first question that was on everyone’s mind was “What did he lack? He had everything, then how come he was depressed?” I guess, this is the issue. We always try to relate happiness with success and whenever someone proves us wrong, we find it hard to accept the reality.There are so many children in this world, who dream of becoming Sachin Tendulkar, Lata Mangeshkar, Shah Rukh Khan, etc. but only a few of them are able to pursue those dreams. Sushant was one of them. The general public is able to relate to Sushant more than anyone else in the industry. He was just like us, preparing for engineering exams and was in the rat race to secure a good college. And he did.Can you ever relate to Alia Bhatt or Ranbir Kapoor or Ranveer Singh? No. Because they never belonged to your world. But Sushant did. We used to see ourselves in him every time we would hear his life story, his interviews, etc.Now when he is no more and that too because of suicide, we feel it as a personal loss.
