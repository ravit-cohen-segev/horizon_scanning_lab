However, after having read the book “Artificial Intelligence and the Future of power” by Rajiv Malhotra, I feel better equipped to answer this question.The wide spread belief is that AI can replace repetitive tasks done by humans or tasks that are tedious and time consuming for humans with very little accuracy, like in the case of facial recognition or tasks that involve less or no social interactions like programming. Majority folks believe that where there is a need for human emotions or human touch (like Sales for instance or healthcare) jobs are irreplaceable. Another popular belief is that since machines do not have consciousness they cannot perform certain jobs done by humans.Let me start de-mystifying the second belief first. To perform our day to day tasks common sense and cognitive intelligence is more than sufficient. Human consciousness and lack of machine consciousness is irrelevant for our daily activities. To paraphrase from the aforementioned book, a driverless car for instance does not need to be conscious in order to do the job. All it needs to do is ensure safe journey of the occupants of the car by getting inputs from various sensors and take objective decisions based on the inputs. Cognitive intelligence is more than enough for this job and this can be achieved through big data and machine learning. If we still need a driver who can crack jokes while driving that can be programmed too based on facial recognition(for reading the mood of the passengers) and NLP (understanding voice commands). In a way sense of humor is also programmable if the right data is fed into the machineNow to the first point, even today Facebook and Google ads act as wonderful sales representatives for any company in hijacking the minds of people and giving them compelling reasons to buy products/services. Even outside of ads, these Social Media ML algorithms can decide which posts to promote and which ones to block thereby giving a perception that certain things are right and certain things are wrong. Most times political parties use these media as their trusted sales partner for marketing their USPs to the voters. Something that touches people’s emotions but can be done through AI and ML algorithms.Overall I would say my world view about AI has changed after reading this book that boasts plenty of such examples. With this new world view I would not blindly believe the rosy picture painted by media and experts about AI’s role in the future of jobs. However, one thing is for sure, AI is here to stay. The point is all stakeholders need to be well informed about its impact. It cannot and should not be a one way traffic",1 follower,Chris Nash,2.4K,5K,30.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-jobs-that-can-will-not-be-outsourced-or-taken-over-by-robots

A good example of this would be a car engine:A lot of people pretend to understand how a car engine works, all while fearing for the day they might have to lift the hood and try to work on the thing. But an engine isn’t so much a singular complicated monolith as much as it is several smaller simpler elements: elements so simple, in fact, that they’ve been around for centuries in one form or another.To begin understanding the predicament humans face, lets start by examining application of mental power.When you get down to it, our brains are quite similar to computers. For that matter, we’re incredibly fast and capable computers. We regularly make approximations based on vector calculus and parabolic trajectories when we, say, throw or toss objects to each other. We’re blindingly fast when it comes to recognizing names and faces. And we’re capable of learning and creating unlike computers ever could.Our problem is merely optimization: We, as humans, are naturallyThis principle applies quite well to computers too, of course. You would never expect your Xbox to work well as a desktop computer. (You can make it happen, but it doesn’t do it very well.) Or, for your toaster to play video games. (It can, but again, not very well.)However, there do exist robots and computers thatThe technology is already here right now; it’s just a matter of time before it becomes mainstream. The computational power required to replicate the iPhone existed in the ’90s. But it was too expensive to make pocket sized and affordable for everybody. Given time, that changed.Is there any reassurance here? Is there any way to combat this? Any jobs that will remain a safe haven for automation?Well, possibly.As aforementioned, I’m not convinced that there are any jobs out there that cannot eventually be outsourced to automation. Given enough time and optimization, a computer can successfully emulate any human task.My question, however, is this:Like most things in economics, we follow the money. And at present time of writing, the money is in the hands ofMost of the jobs that robots threaten to replace are jobs that rely on somethingSo the answer to our question is this:What jobs exist out there that rely on perfectly optimized human attributes -- jobs not made for mindless tedium, but which hinge on being performed by none other than a human? Or even better, what jobs exist out there that we willCan you think of any jobs out there, where you’d much prefer to hire and pay one of THESE people….…rather than buy THIS computer….….to do the job?I can think of a few jobs off the top of my head:1: Nurse, Caretaker or Babysitter:2: Teacher:3: Artist:4: Prostitute:Most people are rather short sighted about the tasks of a sex worker. The reality of the matter is that a prostitute provides so much more than sex; they provide human connection. Ask anybody who’s ever worked as or spent the night with a prostitute, and half the time they’ll tell you that one of the pivotal influences was just a matter of having somebody to share an interpersonal experience with. To spend the night talking, or to get dinner, or even just to cuddle.Pimps5: Religious Pastor or Motivational Speaker:6: Programmer:7: Mathematician:I’m certain there are more openings out there.

8,"OK, let’s start with this: automationNow it’s a tiny fraction. The tractor, combine, and other forms of automation destroyed a huge number of jobs. Around 1975, there were vast numbers of factory jobs. Since then, manufacturing output has much more than doubled, but manufacturing employment has fallen off a cliff.Some jobs were lost to offshoring, but most were destroyed by automation (which is why production is still rising).So automation does destroy jobs. But whaOK, let’s start with this: automationNow it’s a tiny fraction. The tractor, combine, and other forms of automation destroyed a huge number of jobs. Around 1975, there were vast numbers of factory jobs. Since then, manufacturing output has much more than doubled, but manufacturing employment has fallen off a cliff.Some jobs were lost to offshoring, but most were destroyed by automation (which is why production is still rising).So automation does destroy jobs. But what about all the new jobs it creates? There are some, of course, but not many. How many jobs do you think were created producing, selling, and servicing tractors, combines, etc? Eighty percent of all US jobs, to replace the farming jobs they have destroyed? How many jobs do you think were created producing, selling, and servicing robots and other factory automation technology since 1975? As many as the 8 million they destroyed? Not even close, which makes sense if you think about it. If automation created as many jobs as it destroyed, it wouldn’t save business money, so they wouldn’t do it.OK, so if automation destroys more jobs than it produces, then why is unemployment at multi-decade lows? Clearly lots of new jobsBut if new jobs are created, who cares whether they’re created by automation or not? The distinction is important because if the companies were able to use automation to produce the extra stuff they want to sell, then the new jobs wouldn’t be created. Automation doesn’t create jobs, it creates demand; if the demand can be filled without creating jobs, that’s what will happen.There’s a second problem. Often people whose jobs are destroyed never find another job. Younger people come along to take the new jobs created, because the new jobs require skills the people who lost their jobs don’t have. So while unemployment is at multi-decade lows, part of that is because after a certain number of weeks of unemployment, people are no longer counted as unemployed, but that doesn’t mean they have work. In fact, the proportion of Americans over 16 who are employed is also at multi-decade lows.So the new work that needs to be done may be done by robots, and even if it’s done by humans, it may need skills that the people who’ve lost their jobs don’t have, and may never be able to acquire. We could have strong demand for workers and still many people who can’t find jobs.Furthermore, there’s an ongoing shift in the kind of automation that’s going on. Up until a decade ago, most of the work that was automated was just repetitive physical tasks. Now Artificial Intelligence technology is starting to be deployed, allowing more sophisticated tasks to be automated. We already have financial reports and sports stories being written by computers, and computers are able to do legal discovery much faster and more reliably than paralegals, andComputers are going to continue to advance, increasingly taking over tasks that require intelligence and judgement, and people are not getting any more powerful. If this trend continues, and there’s no indication that it will not, increasing numbers of people will be incapable of learning skills that make them competitive with computers.So why am I advancing such an anti-automation idea? I’m not. Far from it: this is excellent news. Would you like to be a farm laborer, cutting grain all day with a scythe? I sure wouldn’t. I’m delighted those jobs were automated: I get to eat grain without having to cut it myself. I get to have fancy gadgets like the one I’m typing this on without having to work in a factory. Automation is an awesome thing.There’s just one catch. Kind of obvious, really. If automation replaces most jobs, then how will we live? The companies will have robots building all this wonderful stuff, as much stuff as we could want, but only company owners will be able to buy it. Right now our economy works because businesses need to hire workers to produce their goods and services, and pay those workers, who spend that money to buy the stuff the companies produce. Without workers, the companies earn all the money, and don’t spend it, so the money stops circulating.When this starts actually happening, you can expect to see workers earning a decreasing share of the national income, with businesses retaining more. In fact, that’s well under way already. In the early 1960s, workers took home more than 67% of national income. By 1997 it had fallen below 62%; in 2001 it had recovered to 65%, but since then it has fallen to 59%. The trend is downward and accelerating.So the problem is not automation. Companies can produce an abundance of everything we want, and more automation means more ability to produce. The problem is that our economy cannot distribute that production without people working to earn their share. We’re going to need to think of another way to distribute that production. Right now the best we have to turn to is our social welfare system, which doesn’t do very well and doesn’t look likely to scale to ongoing mass unemployment.

Technology will create a substitute for the teachers, and a modern classroom will be more than a substitute for the teacher.A modern classroom is defined by technology these days. Ever since Educomp in India raised the hooplah ofThere is constant pressure on teachers and administrators to implement technology in classes. There are several advantages of making use of technology in teaching. These advantages being a uniform pattern of class, a similarity of content, identification of problem, scalability of operations and adaptation to swiftness of changes.The question remains – can technology replace teachers ? Well, the answer is clearly no. Though beneficial, technologies can never replace a teacher.No matter how advanced or smart a computer program or a product is, it can never come close to the knowledge and life experience a teacher brings. Several researches have been conducted and it has been proven time and again that teachers bring about a change which no technology can. A teacher simply does not impart knowledge or information. And teaching is definitely not about facts and figures.A good teacher encourages independent thoughts and independent learning. He/she can be a positive influence, can be an inspiration to set and achieve goals. The trust and bond between a teacher and student creates the perfect learning environment; which can never be achieved through virtual learning.The generation today loves technology.New educational technologies will not only energize the students, but teachers as well. Which means,While classrooms cannot function without a teacher, the fact remains that in the near future it will be the other way around too. Facilitating learning through technology presents tremendous opportunity for both the student and the teacher to deepen their knowledge and empower themselves. The teacher will have to become a facilitator of parting trustworthy information from electronic sources to the students. Teachers versus technology are an ongoing battle.Technology plays a supporting role, but it’s the teacher who brings it all togetherAnd as long as the balance is maintained we can expect an education system that not only promotes learning, but also opens doors to creative freedom and expression.In India, it is even more significant that technology doesn't substitute teachers as the value systems are very different. Technology can impart skills, clear some concepts but can never impart values which the teacher can impart. a tech loaded class can impart information but will not prevent the information to be misused by the students.",UNKNOWN,Pallavi,5.4K,495,8.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-jobs-that-can-will-not-be-outsourced-or-taken-over-by-robots

I am aware of all the criticism that will come my way. Nevertheless I do not regret my actions, so do yourselves a favor and save that few seconds it takes you to type ingratiating judgement.Some years back I stepped into an exam hall and got seated and all, waiting for it to start.It was a tertiary-level examination, which made what happened next worse.As everyone took their seats in the exam hall, the standard announcement came that no one is allowed to leave the exam hall and before the papers were given out, I suddenly remembered that my pen might have been out of ink.I checked. It was.So I immediately raised my hand and got the attention of the nearest invigilator.This was a teacher who knew me, I took one of his classes and often played games or slept in them as I already learnt what he was teaching elsewhere. By some rules I still had to attend the class and exam. He had tried to humiliated me a few times by asking me questions when I was not paying attention but I managed to answer them correctly. I was otherwise never rude to him or made things difficult.“Can I borrow a pen?” I asked.His reply : “You come to an examination without a pen? Why did you bother to come at all? Don’t take the exam!”Note he was not saying it with some stern look, he has a slight grin on his face.I glared at him reflexively, I was not in a mood for jokes. Exam stress and lack of sleep.“My pen ran out of ink and I forgot to replace it.”“Whose fault is it you forgot? My fault? Why don’t you forgot to take the exam as well?”I can only continue to glare at him and he gave me a smug look.There were hundred of people in that dead silent exam hall and all of them were staring at me.I was well aware of exam rules in the institute.“Any attempt to communicate with another student will be considered cheating.”These rules were strictly enforced. I couldn’t just turn around and ask my buddy for a pen.I needed permission to borrow that pen and he knew it.I asked him again for permission to borrow a pen to take the exam.“No.To better illustrate what possessed me to such extreme measures later. It was my last paper and also my hardest and most important paper. I hated the subject but I pushed myself both physically and mentally to ace it. 72 hours without sleep after two weeks of exams, I was at my weakest and most stressed out moment but I mustered my remaining strength to take this paper. Which might be the key factor I forgot about my pen.And there this guy was, smirking right at me with every ounce of mockery he could possibly show. Stepping on all of my hard work in front of all my friends and hundreds of other students, showing everyone see how helpless I am to watch him ruin my academic progress while he looks right at me and enjoy it.All because of what? I wasn’t attentive in his class?The papers were being passed out, and I sat there with the exam script with no pen like an idiot, I looked at him, figuring it was time he would stop this cruel joke and let me borrow a pen.He widened his smirk and tiled his head in a manner toward me, as if saying,“What are you going to about it?”Not only was he was serious about not letting me borrow a pen and making me get a zero for the paper, he is provoking me to make a scene on the spot and get myself into trouble.He didn’t just refuse to allow me to borrow a pen.He genuinely intended to inflict severe harm and humiliation on me while enjoying it!But in a great feat of self-control - I did not snap.I wasWas it my fault that I didn’t make sure my pen had ink for an exam?But did I deserve to be deliberately humiliated like that?Thankfully that was my last paper, with all the rage coursing through me it was really hard to focus.Immediately after my exams, I had one clear goal in mind - To DESTROY that man.Did I think he was a bad teacher who shouldn’t be educating the youth of my nation? Totally.But I’m not going to give you some pretentious righteous crap to justify my actions since I’m anon.I didn’t give a fuck who he was going to educate next. I just wanted to inflict an immense amount of pain and suffering to him because all I could feel was a burning desire for revenge for what he did to me and I didn’t care whether it was through his career or any otherwise.I went all out. Legally though. I’m a law abiding citizen.And also, one thing I never did do for revenge was involve my parents. They held high positions in government institutes and I was sure some action would have been taken if they had made the complain on my behalf. To be honest, because I knew it was a personal vendetta and not a legitimate concern that required the assistance of my parents and I felt that if I did I would become the stereotypical spoilt brat relying on the influence of my parents and any revenge I derive would be meaningless.First thing I did was speak to my primary lecturer and complain.I articulated my injustice to her as firmly as I could and made it clear that I would pursue this matter all the way. She reassured me that she would make things right.Guess what, he made a joke out of it, said I was at fault for beingI went on to speak to the head of department and even the dean of the faculty, shooting strongly worded complain emails about “unprofessional behavior unbecoming of a teacher in this fine institute” left right center.Eventually the ruckus I made culminated in a meeting between myself, the dean and my mortal enemy, who painted a story of how I was an evil troublemaking student who constantly disrupts his class and he had tried in all his holy patience to educate in vain but he never gave up on me because he’s such a great educator. Rubbing in my face that I was being immature for something that was my fault, sticking to his story of how he was “just trying to impress on me so that I would not beIt was always a long shot to go through the system, I knew his actions seem mild, and it was by his actions that he was judged and given a pass. But it was not his actions that drove me, I wouldn’t have harped on it if he was just being strict or simply had a wicked way of imparting life lesson. It was because I saw the true intentions of pure malice behind his actions that I would not forgive him.I’m betting by now some of you are wishing the story ended here, and the antagonist (me) is defeated without fulfilling his evil plans.Well too bad for you.Holidays began and I devoted extraordinary effort to finding a way to defeat my nemesis. I was a man of focus.I read up on exam rules, school guidelines, ministry of education code of conduct for teachers, which I somehow obtained and even spoke to lawyers. There was no opening in the opponent’s defense.I was not ready to admit defeat, such was my thirst for vengeance.I had to think outside the box..So I went through his facebook.YEARS OF IT.THOUSANDS OF PHOTOS AND COMMENTS.METICULOUSLY.He was a married man with kids, most of his content was beyond reproach, a few slightly suggestive comments at female students pictures but nothing that would get him into trouble. Some photos of being drunk but nothing that violates the ministry code of conduct.I googled his phone numbers and emails, and then I ran them through every other search engine I knew again.Pages upon pages of boring stuff at a car forum, trade listings, property sale etc, I checked them all.Then came one mundane looking forum post with his personal email..something about asking for contacts..I must admit I was just about to call it quits as I clicked it.As I read the context of that forum post, fire from the depths of hell burned in my eyes. Metaphorical horns sprouted from my head and I gave a cliche maniac laugh.My nemesis had made one fatal mistake, one chink in his armor and I found it..That forum, despite its random sounding url, was a forum to discuss and advertise prostitution and his post asking for contacts, was in response to a review to some office lady escort!He made the mistake of using his personal email (one that I managed to find anyway) there!It was recent and upon closer inspection, there were multiple such posts and many reviews posted by the same user. Looks like my nemesis was one unfaithful philandering prick.I found a vital opening and prepared to strike! But I reasoned I had to be thorough, anyone could have posted his email, heck he could accuse me of doing it, between the words of a squeaky clean family man teacher and a student with a well-profiled grudge against him, my odds were not good. I had to shackle him to that account publicly and let it be the proverbial stone that sinks him.I contacted this local news website, it reported on sensational social news and wasn’t really respected, such as neighbors caught physically fighting on videos, nutjob hurling vulgarities randomly in public. However it got some uniformed personnel in trouble when they were photographed sitting on seats in the metro reserved for handicapped and pregnant passengers, so you could see why I chose them.They were enticed by the possibility to do an expose on a teacher of one of the nation’s famed institutes and agreed to meet with me. Expectedly, they had concerns about the legitimacy of the teacher’s ties to that user account before they would publish it.I told them of a plan to bait him into using his mobile number to identify himself as the owner of that account. They were reluctant initially, but after reading the explicit contents of his reviews in that account, I convinced them that it was their journalistic obligation to expose him.We cooperated and implemented the plan.I had factored the possibility that he would have used a second number for his perverted hobbies that couldn’t be tied to him and all my efforts would have been for naught. But after scrutinizing his behavior, I felt it was more likely that he only used one number and deleted incriminating messages.And I was right, that mistake would cost my mortal foe dearly.Without going into details, the enemy fell into my trap, hook line sinker, he smsed a number we had prepared and confirmed that he was the owner of the username from that forum and wanted to get contacts for an escort.I requested that the website staff exclude mentioning me or even a student in their story. They went with an anonymous tip.Then came the day of reckoning when the story came out and I landed my figurative deathblow on my mortal foe.He never knew what hit him.My only regret was I was not there to see his face when it did.It was still the vacation and the url to that story spread around, it had his name, face and screenshots of his user account reviews and the SMSes tying him to it.It wasn’t headlines or anything, but as far as the school was concerned, it was like 9/11 happened. Guess who was Osama in this scenario?His facebook account was closed down, and he “couldn’t be reached for comments” but it was too late, the website had all they needed.I’ll never forget that delightful afternoon I shed so much tears of sadistic joy just reading all the online comments calling for his blood. Many students also came out speaking against his teaching ethics. Words like “pervert” “disgrace” “disgusting” “fired” were thrown about in this sweet symphony.As the enemy fort lay ablaze and in ruins I stood atop admiring my hard-fought victory. Although words fail to describe this feeling, can you feel it just a little, my dear readers?By the time the new semester began, he was gone like the wind. He became a hot topic for everyone to gossip, including the teachers, one of whom told us he was going through divorce.I could have let go of what happened that day at the exam hall, been the bigger man yadda yadda.. but I am not that man. I am a man who willfully chose the satisfaction of vengeance over virtues and I got a teacher fired.And I unashamedly, unapologetically, (albeit anonymously) admit:IT FELT SO GOOD!!But I wasn’t done.I remembered when he bullied and humiliated me then rubbed it in my face at my most helpless and vulnerable.There was one last thing I had to do.Text.“Dear Mr ___,I understand now the importance of the lesson you were trying to teach me.If only you heeded your own words.It’s your own fault for being careless.”I never got a reply.",269 followers,Karthik Reddy L,16K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/Will-WiFi-be-replaced-by-more-reliable-Internet-connectivity-technology-any-time-soon
15,My fourth grade teacher had been reading about young children having sex. She asked us to close our eyes and raise our hands if we had had sex. I had been molested the previous summer and was really a mess because of it. I thought this was my opportunity to get help so I raised my hand. While my eyes were closed she came to my desk and then asked me to open my eyes. The entire room was staring at me. She basically interrogated me and called me a liar. I think she is probably not only one of the worst teachers but a truly miserable human being.,"358,950 followers",Sean Kernan,2.9K,5.6K,726.9M,2016,https://www.quora.com/With-the-rapid-advances-in-technology-many-jobs-will-be-replaced-by-machines-What-jobs-are-safe-from-automation
16,"In middle school, my mom was actually the substitute teacher.She has a savage wit. I warned them beforehand that she would destroy them if they mouthed off but some didn’t listen.An 8th grader, Bryce, came walking in late, strutting, acting all cool.Mom said, “Why are you late?”Bryce shrugged and said, “I was walking my girlfriend to class, sorry.” even though he wasn’t sorry. He was just proud to announce he had a girlfriend.Mom said, “You still should’ve been on time. The 2nd grade hall isn’t far from here.” And the class started laughing.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/With-the-rapid-advances-in-technology-many-jobs-will-be-replaced-by-machines-What-jobs-are-safe-from-automation
