For all possible technological development lines, some lines would touch closer Biology first than, say, Mechanics or Chemistry. There is no guarantee in which order sciences and technologies must develop in relation to each other or in relation to any specific Biology. Medicine is almost one of the last disciplines to develop modernly, even the last one if not considering Electronics and Computing. The invention of the microscope went quickly into exploring Biology rather than Medicine, for instance, and lenses were first used to collimate solar light as a weapon rather than be used as sight correctors. Other relations of inter-technological development are possible, like traces that electronics were understood and lost before chemistry was something, or astronomy not leading anywhere near physics as a motivation but inspiring some mechanisms instead. We are used to think some technologies as coming together but Mathematics was late in helping Physics and Metallurgy had no real use for chemistry at its start. But there s also the case of our biology leading directly into biological technologies. Think harvest breeding and horse domestication. Our pets and food were very certainly manipulated by our ancestors to couple them to our specific biological needs (like traveling and cuddling) rather than relying on foraging or hunting, exclusively, which in themselves would have led to shipping or propelled weapon technologies right away. And this happened intuitively, without any reference to formalizations like Mendel s. So it is tempting to assume that any species able of developing rational technological thought would start with its own biology but our own evidence is that we immediately diverged into physical manipulation of the world, litho fossils, when breeding medicinal saliva or work division castes or even using severe limbs as weapons was open as possibility at first. We didn't even think of asking pelting to be Human like skins until leather tanning was discovered! But it is true also that for a very primitive, evolving, species, it s own body and biology would be the natural starting point for developing technologies. Yoga, which is a nonsensical discipline, is still considered a technology by some. Acupuncture develops under very unthoughtful observations that suppressing nerves, as in destroying its termination with a pointy object, do actually reduce pain or sink people into unconsciousness. And it is well known fact that in anthropological populations ritual cannibally is taken as beneficial or necessary, corpse manipulation other than interring is peremptory, or coprophagy is called just in case for different effects, mostly assumedly curative or cosmetic. To the point it is believed some parasitosis do qualify as cancer cures with parasites eating cancer cells preferently! Which is only one step away from sanguine with leeches as a cure… This is a common theme in science fiction, biological powers incorporated ab ovo in alien species providing better results than physical technologies (Superman), or incorporation of physical technologies in the species body (cyborgs), or (synthetic) lifeforms used as tools (Flinstones). What is now, though, the main trend, is the use of genetic manipulation to modify Humans in better ways than eugenesia could have imagined possible, from eradicating with a genetic cure inheritable diseases, to tagging DNA with personal information or chip activating DNA code. We even have glow in the dark CATS!! It is my opinion that Ergonomics is the very last of such technologies to have pop up in history and it is still under-developed, with only a few goods marketing as designed with Human body dynamics in consideration. This is not the same as biomechanics; we are far from plastered rocks or wooden replicas for dental prothesis, or hooks and peglegs as the only technological possibilities for limb prothesis, but unless torture implements are considered ergodynamic, in an inverse way, ergonomy is the most explicit and novel example of technology being synchronized to our biology rather than having technology achieve an effect first then hoping people will adapt to its use. It is understood that the Human mind is infinitely better at manipulating the external world than biologically fixed species programs like physiognomy, tropisms or instincts, and the hand is the most general physical manipulation tool yet available, so it is not really a surprise that technologies would develop naturally under a Human adaptation assumption instead of making efforts to have a technology very FIT for Human manipulation… under considerations like efficiency, comfort, convenience, effort-saving, userfriendliness, aesthetics, medical repercussions, side effects… all of them categories from Economic technologies. Ergonomy is what would be expected as first technology, but other than chairs and tables there were no real.advancements until very late in civilization s history, even thrones and beds had purely utilitarian constructions, and this is understandable as a consequence of the universal capabilities of both Human hands and mind-brain obviating the need to overfit the world to our biology while exploring what can be made with the external world! (Pillows were invented by the Romans, but box springs came on until the eighteenth century or so, Spartan was rock beds, etc.). There is no doubt hands and mind (and eyes [feet]) evolved concomitantly in struggle with its habitat, —environment and the ecosystem species implied by it—, as the very first technologies (opposable thumb; Self, individuality, world representation; and stereoscopic vision in color [metacarpal articulation] respectively), and that the world afterwards resulted in a much harder nut to crack, speaking very much to the point!! that such economic considerations to better accommodate our physiology and behaviour were secondary to the exploration and harnessing of methods to dominate the external world, and are not really evident and directly perceivable, much the way war paint technologies took a while in being recognized as pointless and ineffective to win battles. Once the habitat was dominated by evolution, the Human body came second and first in becoming a transformable product with associated methods or technology still in use by primitive societies or revivalists (tattooing, piercing, bondage, maiming including tonsure) but which ultimately lead to no more developments (no lamarckian genetics) and are even shunned normally nowadays, like sports doping, matrimonial prearrangements, or outright eugenesia and even abortion, so full emphasis was diverted by necessariety to developing objective technologies the best way possible disregarding how well Humans fit with them; to first produce an effect over the world is more important than finding methods adequate to our fundamental physiology, although it is our fundamental physiology what enables the possibility of finding methods to produce effects! Hence cuneiform writing and pictograms develop first to the effect of recording events and only much later alphabetical or phonetical systems, pen and ink, or keyboards, are invented to the same effect. This means that any species evolving intelligence to the point of adequating the environment or itself to its basic needs, and upkeeping the methods in use, once the purely biological stage is surpassed will be led away from its own biology into purely physical, objective technological paths, the more its own biological tool technologies provide generalized or universal solutions to basic biological problems. Medicine doesn't develop well early because a species evolved to become the Dominant Life Form, will find cheaper to spend a new individual in a new hard task than to assume the costs of learning how to fix an individual and fixing it optimally to perform the same new hard task again. Plenty other examples: oars in galleys come before sails, plows don't come with umbrellas, aurigas had no seats for passengers, safety gun triggers are a second thought, etc. Ergonomy should be inherent, but in fact implies an advanced stages of technological prowess and knowledge, and economic concepts based on satisfaction, individuality, user satisfaction, sales increases, produced historically only after the concentration of big markets. So yes, there would be a trend to accommodate technology to our physiology and biology, by following standard market-rules, in itself a technology to better handle the needs of individuals. But notice that Fit to Purpose is pryor to Fit to Satisfaction, as this certainly guarantees the punishment of the producer of brittle swords, by hands of those who d call the same swords Fit to Satisfaction! It is Markets that pull toward satisfaction while technology itself brings consequences if it is not well fit to purpose first, so yes, there must be a cultural bias in Occidental technology towards disconsidering ergonomy until markets force technologists to better please consumers, in itself a technology to ensure satisfaction of basic needs (money…). It is too difficult and hard to make, until mass markets claim for it. And what is said of products CAN be said also about technologies, so there d be an observable trend to make technology research and development fit consumers satisfying basic needs, albeit very slowly and only after markets, concentration of individuals, develop. Technology is researched to achieve some purpose and once achieved it becomes its commercial value, researchers and developers are committed to that end and do not much care about how well the technology will accommodate to basic biological needs, individual or collective, and they are well doing so besides, because ultimately the total.collection of technologies possible is opaque and hard to forecast, and confronting the unknown it is the best way to proceed. So nowadays we let modern markets partially decide the progress of technology toward this or that objective, or under this or that consideration, while keeping a core doing what has to be done to progress technologically, before letting markets have an opinion (there are regulations… but ultimately private entities can do any kind of research not considered [extremely] dangerous, and then apply it outside markets [Prosumption, the ultimate in fit-to-please, including modern in-house software development], or concurr to markets without warming to license its use or seek producers to incorporate in products; even illegally, as long as research itself does not result catastrophic to the researchers). That we now do consider conditions such as sustainable, recyclable, environmentally friendly, (ecological, responsible, vegan, FDA-approved…) or non GMO, Humane, Kosher, PG rated, long etc., whether collectively or individually desirable, as indispensible conditions for technological development, or for technology usage and its current products, is a historical and cultural resultant conditioned to knowledge accumulation across disciplines and driven by the historical growth of markets, but not a necessary consequence of the development of any set of concurrent technologies because fit to purpose is inherent to development but fit to please requires progress and is too much of a burden to a starting species or for new ideas and insights… unless of course the purpose IS to closely follow and satisfy said species Biology, or development does not take place. This be so true past the stage of physiological innovation (evolution) that first technologies do have to closely FIT the biological environment and satisfy the most basic needs of the species itself to be of any value and mechanically have benefits applied to resources dedicated to its development and usage. Handling of fire must come first or closely before stone knives, and even thoughts of metal handling must be very, very posterior to dressing pelts which in itself must be concomitant to inventing knots, etc. Certainly the Age of Iron is marked as an age and is significantly more complex technologically than the Age of Stone was in a natural way, but even then this might be a consequence of purely contingent conditions, like the chances of discovering glass in beach fires and exporting such tech inland are great but seemingly did not happen until much later when Human population grew around sandy beaches and had some leisured time (the fires of Menelao did not burn high in Troy s lands…). But there s still one case that is proper, when first technologies fail and are not suitable for the habitat, then further technological progress becomes limited to immediate resources and the resources or bodies, and this case seems to be quite common in fact! Egyptians developed ridiculously elaborated methods to handle inadequately Human corpses, probably because disciplines like making fire, cartography or food preservation failed, but engaged into big solid constructions because river transportation was easy and flourished. There is very little, if at all any, evidence of subterranean water handling or public illumination in ancient abandoned cities, so we can imagine technology followed their biological behaviour so well they went extinct due to lack of fundamental urban technologies, to say the least. Island or swamp inland societies with limited physical resources did commit to the most biological and closely body-related methods to achieve any effects possible to the point they barely had any technology other than body rituals, body usage or fake notions like Zombie technology, unless exported by cultural clash by modern developed societies, and then becoming hard to assimilate, fueling precisely concerns about technology and its relation to biology… beyond purely self driven and market dynamics of technology development, application and progress. Africa mainly remained in between Prehistory and the Age of Stone left to its own means until Occident advanced continental transportation to a point of comfort to move relatively big quantities of men with little risk, and begun spreading Africans to all continents, after Africans failed to produce transportation technologies for jungle and desert; but they consistently perform well in races, so it can be said they developed running technology and incorporated it into their genetic pool through breeding, the most close to.biology possible.without passing through chemistry, instrumentation, XX Century technologies, etc. One other point of view available is also that of technology actually mimicking the biology of the technological species, a favorite of Science Fiction, like Avian species flying in winged airplanes, or Horror scenes like tentacled monsters whipping whips.anh people do expect full.auyonomous Androids some day even when robotically speaking adapting problems and environments to robots is much easier than making fully generic robots the way a technological species would incorporate physiological (evolved) advances into itself. Conversely, there is not much consensus nor support for synthetic beings as of yet, or chimerisms like anthropomorphing animals are in fact forbidden, even if necessary or interesting, so these areas do not seem very promising even with markets to lead them and Human biomimicry is limited to some medical biomechanics and prothesis design, dental, limbic, ocular, etc. Toy making has also seem some exaggerations in this respect, with some dolls emulating corporal functions to the dot. In contraposition, I ve proposed at times designing crane vehicles mimicking the way wrists and elbows in forearms function, which would lead to very flexible yet strong and smooth operation, although there don't seem to be many similar opportunities to other kinds of mimicking strictly Human biology in technological forms. Here, vaping can be considered the very last new technology to emerge in close relation to Human body capabilities, beyond what Medicine or Food Technology offer currently or as future perspectives. What is different, though, is the general field of biomimicry, which is nowadays considered one of the best future bets in technology advancement and product making, even when CAD/CAM assisted by mathematical/AI processes does promise to defeat even the best findings in evolutionary matter across our ecosystems, past and present, with designs far superior to biological adaptations and better specifications regarding their economies. Biomorphic design is in vogue and fighting hard against mathematical models and Human ingenuity to bring better products and technologies satisfying even very specific and hard to please markets. Electric automatic doors and elevators have been an all time hit among Humans and become more and more innovative constantly! Just like escalators, and way before them, stairs, they subtly satisfy the way our biology works and find unimpeded acceptance among most Human groups, even being slightly accepted by feral groups. There s nothing like them in nature or close to Biology (save sgairs, which in nature may be forced to be interpreted as such even when totally inadequate for Human use), there is no mimicry, biomimicry or biological conformation other than fit to physical usage, but cannot be achieved or conceived without first whole sets of previous achievements coinciding orderly as requirements, (which is why the fantasy of ancient hidden temples full of mechanisms is entertaining, or modern myths arise, like that of the (super-)technological African in movies). But in the end it is soft technologies like marketing, econometrics, the web, modeling and simulation, social communication, education, etc, what will be deciding the relation of technologies new and future to the actual Biology of Humans and even other species, now that knowledge and population have accumulated and are more balanced than ever… and soft technologies do point to different criteria of efficiency and need hierarchies we do know are objective and fundamental. We also hope for it all to be sustainable in itself and by its own dynamics and logic, pleasing Humans better and better, but the myth of lost civilizations is still debatable as being just a myth, past dead alleys and dead ends may prevail and revert the species to purely biological conditions and habitats, contradictory requirements imposed by markets and laws can thwart future development, stunt promising research, commit very costly errors and generally act adversely to the search of possibilities in unknown and opaque Reality, disregarding top Human and Rational understanding. What is clear is that technology progress is (optimistically) not a matter of evolution but of complete application of Rationality and Human capabilities to purely Human problems and lieu Human solutions, while Human evolution itself is historically non existent but be evidently accelerated to the point of lifetime visibility by determined application of present and future, not purely Human Biology based technologies.

And humans have now been around for less than 5 million years (modern) , so we are still just a flash in the pan getting started. Hasn’t been that long since we came down from the trees, and our dependence on technology is just an artificial mammary that we probably should not rely on.","220,632 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,783M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-evidence-to-suggest-that-past-civilizations-may-have-had-technology-to-rival-our-own

Which led the foundations of modern societies. We could get nutrition without spending most of our days hunting.18.000 years ago clay pottery was created.8200–7600 years ago we invented boats. Which is an essential vehicle for transportation.5000–6000 years ago Egyptians created the Famous Pyramids. Which was a really construction challenge.4000–5000 years ago we have invented wheels which made traveling easier and allowed cultural interactions.3000 years ago we created Compass2400–2300 years ago we started using Math.1300 years ago we discovered gunpowder. Which led to the creation of all firearms700 years ago the first firearm was used.First telescope was invented in 1608Fist vaccine was created in 1796. Which saved literally millions of lives.In 18th Century The industrial revolution began which led to the creation of;• Camera in 1816• Refrigerator in 1834• First Telephone in 1876• Light Bulb in 1879• The first automobile in 1885• Radio in 1900’s• Planes in 1903. Thanks to Wright Brothers• Television in 1927• In 1938 the first basic computer was created• Nuclear Weapons in 1945 along with Nuclear Energy• We have set foot on Moon in 1969.• The Internet was created in 1990• Smartphones in early 2000’s• Hadron Collider was created in 2008• In 2009 the tallest man made structure ever, Burj Khalifa was builtAnd these technological advancements are keep getting better everyday. We are close to universal Quantum Computing , We will colonize Mars by 2030And there are so many more things that i couldn't find the time to wrote that changed the world.","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,742,6.8K,91.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-evidence-to-suggest-that-past-civilizations-may-have-had-technology-to-rival-our-own

16,"Well, for well over half of human history we were ‘cave men' and our goal was simply to survive, rather than to advance. We had primitive technology limited to stone tools and pottery. We obviously had little to no understanding of science and humans lived in basic hunter-gather groups of 50 people or so. This is how it was for most of prehistory. however, one major event would change humanity for ever. Basic knowledge of plants. Humans eventually learned that seeds germinate when planted, so they Got the bright idea of doing just that. They began agriculture and settled down.

Humans eventually learned that seeds germinate when planted, so they Got the bright idea of doing just that. They began agriculture and settled down. This led to the first civilizations. We had specialization of labor and this allowed one person to feed multiple people. This meant that not everybody has to focus on food production and could instead focus on other things such as advancement. We have made some very important discoveries over the centuries such as metalworking in the bronze age, sanitation, a better understanding of our universe, and electricity. electricity later allowed for inventions such as the telegraph, telephone, television, radio, internet, and many others.","16,982 followers",Christian Winter,528,18.4K,79.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Will-WiFi-6-compete-with-5G-in-the-near-future-as-the-technology-continue-to-evolve
