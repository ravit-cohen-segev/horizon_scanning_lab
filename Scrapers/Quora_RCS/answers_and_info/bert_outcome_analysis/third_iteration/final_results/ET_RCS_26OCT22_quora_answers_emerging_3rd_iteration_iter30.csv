Executives in this business were praised as world class operators, prescient for positioning the business perfectly.What everyone failed to notice was that GE was riding a bubble. The industry got caught up in a hysteria as deregulation opened up new markets for small firms to build “peaker plants”.These small power plants sold to the large, regulated companies during times of peak use. When demand was greater than supply in the early years, these companies made a fortune.As with all bubbles, everyone jumped in and wanted to build a peaker plant and GE profited wildly, selling the turbines, generators, electrical equipment and even service contracts to run the plants.The real world class talent was in the engineering and operations teams that built equipment without equal. GE had the best technology at the perfect time.As a young manager, I saw the trail of hubris this success left behind.I had the opportunity to regularly present to senior officers and found the experience to be menacing at times, confusing at others.As the market started to unravel, we would be summoned to a large conference room to “brainstorm” ideas to get back on track. One by one, field managers would present the business challenges and offer thoughts on strategy.Without fail, we would be told that we were just making excuses.It didn’t matter how accountable our tone was, any suggestion out of our control was summarily discarded.In a tighter market, customers were not willing to pay a 20–30% premium for our brand name anymore.“Our pricing is fine. Your team can’t sell.”Never mind, this was the exact same sales team that delivered record results just two years before.Customers have real concerns with delivery times.“Bullshit. We don’t know how to sell value.”Value? Our customers are filing for bankruptcy left and right.These meetings were sold as an exchange of ideas, a dialogue to discuss strategy.They turned into displays of ego where a frustrated executive tuned out what he didn’t want to hear and used his authority to show you he was right.“The stronger man is always right.”It got to a point where you just wanted to get through the meeting. You would lead your presentation with how lousy of a manager you were, transition into how lousy of a team you had and close with a determined promise to fix the first two things.Managers stopped raising real issues. Senior executives grew even more frustrated because no one would tell them the truth. This solidified their impression that the team “just didn’t want it bad enough.”God forbid you mention anything strategic as this would insinuate something was wrong with the decision making at the top.This was about the time I got out of that company.One of those executives left GE to run Home Depot and then Chrysler. He took the same approach in both roles, leaving a trail of destruction before he was fired from both posts.GE has since lost 80% of its value. From the world’s largest company to unworthy of the DOW Jones in 15 years. Blame leadership hubris.In large companies, executives can get completely separated from reality. They devise strategy, it becomes gospel and they expect execution.Business is messier than this. Markets change. Customer needs change. Technology disrupts.Large companies need executives that are willing to communicate with the front line and adapt as conditions change.Companies with executives who believe that the only good ideas come from those with the loftiest titles, tend to fade into obscurity.The stronger man or woman isn’t always right.",UNKNOWN,Cory A.

The list doesn't say one show is better than the other, it simply highlights the shows that you can watch first before digging deeper. Here goes:1: Breaking Bad- This is a fine example of world class television, my friend. A masterpiece by Vince Gilligan and even greater performances by the cast, specially Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul.2: Game of Thrones: the show is a masterpiece if you want a period drama with exceptional characters, creatures and graphic portrayal of humans and magic and whatnot. Although, its ending has a very controversial tone to it, the rest of the show is unbelievable. A must watch, if you will.3: The Office (US)- ‘That's what she said'. Just watch it, no description can suffice its beauty.4: Death Note- This is the most popular anime of all time (no need to panic, fellow otakus). It is an intense show, although short, but it has the perfect ending.5: The Wire- This one has THE BEST SCREENPLAY of any crime show I have ever watched. Impeccable dialogues. Intriguing storyline. Intense scenes and characters. This show is perfection. I repeat, perfection.6: Peaky Blinders: This show here is one of a kind. The Shelby family running a gang in Birmingham, England, while doing illegal businesses over the years. The show becomes a must watch because of the performances given by characters “Thomas Shelby” and “Polly Gray"". Charisma. Riches. Blood. Family. It has everything.7: House MD- It is an extremely stretched show, but Hugh Laurie is one immensely talented actor. His character is the only thing that will push you to keep on watching it. It's a medical drama and has its ups and downs, but Hugh Laurie as Dr. Gregory House is what acting looks like.8: The Mentalist: Yet, another stretched show with GREAT ending. Again, the role of Patrick Jane is made livid by none other than Simon Baker is what keeps the show interesting.9: Scrubs: Amazing. Beautiful. Light-hearted medical sitcom that will make even your knees laugh. Highly underrated show.10: Sherlock: This show is pretty good, even though it's too short. But then again, Doctor Strange is playing Sherlock, so there's that.11: The Boys: Everybody loves the boys. Contemporary. Unorthodox. ADULT. Fine, yet very bloody show.12: Suits: it's a relatively new show, but I personally have liked it and still do. So you could give it a watch and see what happens.13: Supernatural: it's an incredibly long supernatural drama comprising of 15 seasons. The show's funny and very interesting if you like this kind of stuff where spirits and monsters are as common as humans. You could give it a shot, because I personally love it.14: F.R.I.E.N.D.S- I am sure everybody's heard of this show and there's no reason to keep it out of the list. This is a neo-classic and everybody should watch this at least once in their lifetime.15: Brooklyn 99: a really good sitcom by Michael Schur, who's also the creator of The Office, aforementioned. Amazing cast and amazing dialogues. A fun watch.16: The Witcher: adapted from the game and book franchise, The Witcher is one show that I have high hopes for. I really believe this is the show that can level GOT. *Update: Season 2 is 🔥*17: Jack Ryan: an Amazon original, fast-paced thriller, although short, but amazingly done by our very own John Krasinski. Can't wait for season 3.18: Moon Knight: The only good show that Marvel Cinematic Universe came up with in 2022. It is in a league of its own. It’s on Disney+.19: Honorable mentions:20: Chuck Lorre's sitcoms are fun-watches if you're into them, I personally like The Big Bang Theory, Two and a half men and Mom, but to each his own. All of them are great sitcoms.I could stretch the list, but to what purpose. There are many many great shows out there, this is a tentative list which you could start from, but anything you watch leaves something in you and that's all that matters.

The show’s main storyline revolves around an alternate reality ‘The Underground’ and the existence of paranormal beings. Four kids, a robust police offer, a kid with supernatural powers, and a Demogorgon (the antagonist) make up for the primary cast of this beautifully written sci-fi TV drama, thriller series. They could possible be on the list for 2021 as well, as they are set to release the fourth season around that time.SEX EDUCATIONA show based in the UK,Most Googled web series of 2020STRANGER THINGSA wholesome package for sci-fi fans, Stranger Things released its third season this year. The show’s main storyline revolves around an alternate reality ‘The Underground’ and the existence of paranormal beings. Four kids, a robust police offer, a kid with supernatural powers, and a Demogorgon (the antagonist) make up for the primary cast of this beautifully written sci-fi TV drama, thriller series. They could possible be on the list for 2021 as well, as they are set to release the fourth season around that time.SEX EDUCATIONA show based in the UK, Sex Education came out with its first season this year. As the name suggests, the show primarily focuses on ‘educating’ the characters on the show about sex. The story revolves around a socially awkward boy (Otis), who is new to the idea of sex and his mother who is a sex therapist and overtly eager on guiding her son. Other teenage characters are also seen playing strong roles in guiding the protagonist through his new sexual discoveries.MONEY HEISTMoney Heist is one of the most critically acclaimed foreign language TV series. The show focuses on a heist with the motive to print the Royal Mint of Spain. The activities are orchestrated by the mastermind behind the plan – The Professor. A group of criminals enter the early stages of this heist with a unified plan only to see themselves have a difference of opinion and tangle themselves in a dramatic turn of events.CHERNOBYLOne of the most highly-rated shows on IMDb, Chernobyl digitally expresses the horror of the nuclear attack in 1986. It has been rated as one of the best portrayals of a disastrous event to have been witnessed by mankind. After the streaming rights for this show were purchased by Hotstar, it became known to a larger Indian audience.BROOKLYN NINE-NINEOne of the lighter shows on this list, Brooklyn Nine-Nine is pretty much of a legendary one. Some have also taken leverage to compare it to Friends and have even rated it a tad bit higher. A comical take on the functionalities of a police station in Brooklyn, this show has a very easy-going vibe and a humour the Indian audience seems to be thoroughly enjoying. However, it is slightly unfortunate that we have only been blessed with five seasons of the show!SACRED GAMESAfter the top five slots being taken by foreign shows, finally a show of Indian origin on this list.Sacred Games probably had the biggest stars and buzz the Indian web series market had seen, when it released back in 2018. This year saw the release of the second season, which was probably a slightly disappointing affair. The show ends with an extremely tight cliffhanger, and with no hint of a third season it has left the audience a little disappointed. However, it did great in terms of viewership and is also among the most Googled Indian web series of 2019.KOTA FACTORYFollowing the tracks of Laakhon Mein Ek, Kota Factory is another show based on the education system in India. It is the only show that streams on YouTube, on this list. It has a simple story line that dramatizes over the course of the episodes. It takes a closer look at the coaching classes culture in Kota, Rajasthan. The name of the show hints at how these classes are producing bots and not humans, hence terming them as factories.DARKA very well placed drama-series, Dark picks up pace as two kids get lost in a small town in Germany. This opens up the truths, and a dark past of four families as they go in search of the kids. Twisted relationships, sinful actions, and a dramatic storyline are what rate this show as highly as it is. It might be slightly slow-paced but it does have twists that would leave you asking for more.CRIMINAL JUSTICEAnother Indian original on this list, this one is on Hotstar. Criminal Justice has a stellar cast with Vikrant Massey and Jackie Shroff at the heart of it. As a dramatic, crime and thriller series it was pretty much on track to do well for an Indian audience. We searched for it, watched it, and let’s face it, we enjoyed the drama.MADE IN HEAVENWeddings are oh-so-big an affair in India, and it was about time we had a show on it. Made in Heaven though is a slightly different take on the entire concept. Through the medium of weddings, the show has successfully highlighted a range of social issues in the Indian society. It is an anthology and the wedding couple changes every episode. The primary cast i.e. the wedding planners, however, remain constant and do a lot more than just plan weddings.Thankyou","2,481 followers",Nachiket Bhatt,607,256,1.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-are-the-top-technology-based-web-series-shows

12,"It depends.I will put a quote from “Chainsaw Al” Dunlap that sums it up best: “There are three types of executives in this world. There are those who can get short term results and haven’t a clue where they are going to take the company in the future. Conversely, there are those who have a great 10 year plan, but are going to be out of business in about 10 months. And then there are those who can get short term results in conjunction with a vision for the future. Those are the good ones.”I have worked in companies with excellent CEOs whose limit of ability peaked out at a certain level, usuallIt depends.I will put a quote from “Chainsaw Al” Dunlap that sums it up best: “There are three types of executives in this world.

Conversely, there are those who have a great 10 year plan, but are going to be out of business in about 10 months. And then there are those who can get short term results in conjunction with a vision for the future. Those are the good ones.”I have worked in companies with excellent CEOs whose limit of ability peaked out at a certain level, usually between 50 and 100 million dollars annually. They were great up til that point but they could never master the skills to get beyond it. In one company he was the home-grown CEO and founder. He was brilliant and smart but his vision failed him at the 50 - 100 million dollar mark and the company languished. By the time everyone realized this it was too late, the market passed us by and we were on the slow road to Hell. I also worked at companies where the vision of the President was far-reaching and all-encompassing. This was John Chambers, the man who ran Cisco. When he first got there, Cisco was on the verge of bankruptcy. Within ten years it was the undisputed market leader. He was able to ride the technology wave and harness it to propel future growth. He wasn’t afraid to sacrifice yesterday’s award winning but now creaky technology for something new. I also worked at a company where the CEO and founder was more fond of riding his bike in road races than running the company. He was a smart man in every way, but vitriolic, petty and small and the company never exceeded ten million in revenue and was sold for scrap eventually. I’ve worked at companies run by technology gurus who thought their little science project would alter the world. They zoomed up the revenue ladder while they sat back and let everything go stale, forgetting that today’s cutting edge technology is tomorrow’s blunt instrument. Everything changes and you have to be on top of it every day. It’s okay to fail as long as you keep moving and keep trying — sooner or later at least one of your ideas will take off (hopefully). But standing still, as Thomas Watson of IBM once siad, it’s “death knell of any business.” So there is no one answer to your question. I want the CEO who is going to propel me to success through the success of the company. I like the idea of a good ole boy who started the thing riding it to success — but that doesn’t always work. Riding a company to success by the seat of your pants is rare no matter what you hear of Musk and Zuckerberg. The road to success is often littered with formerly great names of companies that believed in one man and rode his vision into obscurity — WANG and DEC come to mind.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,2.4K,996,155.9M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-were-the-founding-visions-of-the-top-technologies-companies
