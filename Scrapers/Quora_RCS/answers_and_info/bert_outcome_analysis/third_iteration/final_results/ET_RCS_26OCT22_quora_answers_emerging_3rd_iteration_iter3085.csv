It can be focused on exaggerating the self and/or putting others down. The term is more widely used in society than before, and a question that is often asked by social commentators is: ‘Does social media increase levels of narcissism?’ The answer from research conducted in many laboratories is, almost certainly, ""yes""—but with lots of caveats!It now seems clear that different types of social media have different relationships to different aspects of narcissism. That sentence is almost as difficult to follow as the patterns of emerging results themselves! To begin with, research has found strong associations between the aggressive ""grandiose narcissism"" and a whole range of social media behaviors, such as: time spent on social media, the frequency of tweets, and the frequency of posting selfies1. However, little relationship has been found between social media behavior and the more ""vulnerable"" and self-directed types of narcissism1. Thus, different aspects of narcissism are differentially associated with social media—but are different forms of social media also implicated with narcissism?In our own work2, we found that people who had high levels of narcissism traits to begin with tended to use Twitter (and other textual-based platforms) more-and-more over time. However, those who used Facebook (and other visually-based platforms) tended to become moreThe question for most of these studies, as always, is which comes first—the narcissism or the social media use? Moreover, we need to ask whether this is a direct link between the two variables or whether some other factor is involved. In answer to the first question, in our own longitudinal study2, we noted that there were different relationships over time between narcissism and the use of different social media platforms—prior narcissism drove later Twitter use, but prior Facebook use drove later narcissism. While not causal evidence, these data are suggestive of the direction of action between narcissism and social media use—and it is different for different forms of social media.Of course, it may be that some other aspect of personality or behavior is linking narcissism with social media use. One possibility is suggested by a recent study4, where it was found that cyberbullying andSo, different forms of social media are related, in different ways, to different aspects of narcissism—so far, so complicated! This brings us to another wrinkle in this increasingly complex story: the differences between men and women. Men and women differ in terms of their propensity to show narcissism, at least currently in many societies, with greater rates for men (8% of the male population) than for women (5% of the female population)5. Men also score slightly higher than women in terms of ""exploitative/entitlement"" feelings, and ""authority/A recent study noted that girls use social media more than boys (43% of girls versus 31% of boys use it for at least an hour a day at age 15)7. These girls also reported lower levels ofBut we shouldn't just accept that this is a passive effect of girls being influenced by others through their need for social-comparison making. Research is increasingly showing that such social-comparison for women is an active, and partly aggressive, process that may be deeply associated with female narcissism. In our laboratory, we found that women are much more likely to use intimidatory self-presentation tactics on social media than men. Echoing the work mentioned earlier, it has been shown that the narcissistic trait of ""exploitativeness"" is associated with increased selfie taking by girls8. This can lead to increased femaleThe disturbing trend towards female-posted sexualized selfies could be explained as resulting from ""intimidatory"" self-presentation strategies used by girls with narcissism9. This behavior may get reinforced by the user receiving ""likes,"" which are especially important for the ""vulnerable"" narcissist, and this reinforcement drives more of this completely inappropriate and self-harming behavior. But, not receiving ""likes"" can be just as bad for this group and their behavior!Receiving no reinforcement from such behavior can lead to a temporary increased level of activity and aggression—a well-known phenomenon of non-reward in the animal laboratory10—as well as to a host of negative impacts on physiology and immunity, through the action ofThus, not only is the relationship between social media use and narcissism complex, and mediated by the types of social media use, and the characteristics of the users, but it has implications for how What we should view this form of cyber behavior. The problem of inappropriate content is more than just a problem for the social media companies and censorship—such inappropriate behaviors and content may actually be fostered by the psychological impacts of the social media platforms, and the personalities of their users. The evidence is strongly pointing to the need for a thorough re-evaluation of our relationship with this technology.References1. McCain, J. L., & Campbell, W. K. (2018).

Those letters stand for “The Baden Analine and Soda Factory” and it put those new science trainees to work. Before long, BASF was the largest producer of artificial dyes on the planet in any color you could imagine. They had taken a British breakthrough and worked hard on it.Another couple of guys developed by this system were Fritz Haber and Ferdinand Bosch. They developed a process for turning air into fertilizer on industrial scales. It’s still used today to produce enough fertilizer for crops feeding two billion people. It could also be used to make key components used in making explosives, which kept Germany in World War I after its natural supplies of nitrates ran out.They also did some fooling around and came up with a new material called “plastics”, although at the time they didn’t realize the importance of it.Meanwhile, back in England, they were still focusing on teaching people in Latin. There was little government support for the applied sciences.

That had a huge impact on what technologies countries were turning out.Beyond that, German universities were highly focused on scientific research sooner than those in a number of countries. And before unification of the Germany Empire in 1871, the geographic area was a collection of smaller princely states, and a number of them had developed universities, so when unification came, the new Germany had a number of universities distributed more widely than comparably sized long-established countries. In the 19th Century, British science and engineering was known to be the world’s best. The Industrial Revolution really got under way in Scotland and when Britain built its new Parliament palace in the 1830s, the Big Ben clock was included to demonstrate the glories of British precision engineering. The German Empire set out to compete with Britain and its collection of universities provided a base for that development.Oxford University in Britain dates to the 12th Century and Cambridge University is almost as old, and they were generally regarded as the universities in the world well into the 20th Century. The University of Edinburgh, founded in the 16th Century, was not far behind. These three storied institutions provided many of the great scientific advances in history. They also focused broadly on scholarship in languages, government, humanities, and arts, and their great profusion of scientists and scholars meant people paid attention to a lot more than the science they were doing. Britain developed regional colleges that would be late in developing strong research. Germany’s universities meant extensive research was occurring in more places than in Britain, which in the long run helped them turn out scientists and engineers for industry.I would like to take this opportunity to disabuse anybody who thinks it of the notion the rest of the world was riding around on turnip wagons while Germany was creating scientists and technologists. Throughout Europe and America, strong scientific and technological programs were addressing issues that were most urgent for their countries. For Germany, quickly developing world-class research and application programs were essential for the new country to make economic progress that would foster a sense of German nationhood. Besides formidable work in science and technology, Britain needed institutions to train the leadership for maintaining a global empire — people skilled at administration and strategy and with the best understanding of cultures available then. And the United States of America had, in 70 years, gone from 13 states on the Atlantic Seaboard to a great nation stretching from Atlantic to Pacific needing infrastructure, economic markets, and industry needed to knit the country together. Starting in the early 17th Century, Harvard University, Yale University, and a few other private universities began developing strong academic and scholarly programs. Then American states invented the “state university,” an institution set up to educate young people in the knowledge base and skills required for effective leadership and study the state. Then in a few decades, America invented the “land-grant university.” States were granted great stretches of federal land to sell and raise money for building universities for agriculture and mechanical arts and eduction in the liberal arts. That’s why some public universities are the XXX A & M University (Agricultural and Mechanical) or XXX Polytechnic Institute.

Actually, most of the German stuff was inferior.

Military structures are inherently conservative and they PREFER to use the tried and true “battle tested” technologies rather than take something to war that turns out not working. Americans had advanced jet aircraft prototypes in 1938 — the military rejected them for propeller technology. Both Northrup and Bell had flying jet prototypes by 1942. America decided to mass produce one tank design in huge numbers at a time rather than retool every time someone had a good idea—that was ultimately the right decision because we overwhelmed the Germans with sheer numbers. America got the Atomic Bomb first.So why do you think they had a technological advantage? They had been disarmed after World War One, so most of what they built up prior to the war was new. Other countries still had lots of surplus laying around and without a good reason, didn't want to scrap and replace it. The second is propaganda. Germany made a big deal about “wonder weapons” to convince their people they could win by something like “magic” — even though the war was lost almost before it began.I do give the Germans credit for advanced rocketry, but it really does come back to the conservative mindset: Americans were offered similar weapon designs, passed on them, but when they saw them in action used against them, changed their minds and played catch up. America used a lot of rocket launchers later in world war two — when you actually see footage you see the rocket barrages — but we don't SEE it in movies because that is too expensive and dangerous to have flying around movie sets.American LSM(R)-188 Warship, World War Two.","5,781 followers",Bob Kinch,724,3.5K,36.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Germans-of-pre-WW2-obtain-such-advanced-technology-and-tactics-well-ahead-of-any-other-country

Average IQ scores have been increasing in all countries since the turn of the twentieth century (the earliest point in time for which data is available). The change in IQ scores has been approximately three IQ points per decade. One major implications of this trend is that an average individual alive today would have an IQ of 130 by the standards of 1910, making them more intelligent than 98% of the population at that time. Equivalently, an individual alive in 1910 would have an IQ of 70 by today’s standards, a score that would be low enough to be considered intellectually disabled in the modern world.

Why do I say that?Now, it depends on your idea of ‘advanced technology’. Probably fire, wheel, constructions, and even glass and some form of writing date back to way before when we think they started. Why do I say that?Now, I’m not like 200 years old, I’m just in my mid-forties. And history as I did study that has being challenged and rewritten THAT much. If you expect to be living in the age in which all the secrets of our past have been disclosed, I’m sorry to inform you that you are delusional. Positivism is over, baby.So, for all of those who go with the “we’ve kept a low profile for 288,000 years because it all got faster when we got to discover x” (where x=agricolture, fire, wheel, writing) I just remark that we already shifted the starting date of this acceleration from 2500 BC to 4000 BC and then to 6000 BC and then to 10,000 BC. The fact that we lackWe of course got a big acceleration in progress with the demographic increment due to extensive coltures. Then another boost with writing. Then another with geographical expansion. And until that, these phoenomena occurred in different continents at different times independently. Then Gutenberg. Then the industrial revolution. The mass media. Computers. The internet. And ok, each time we saw how much we can progress in a very little time compared to generations who saw very little change during their lifetime. But negating the -very strong- possibility that there were civilizations during those 288,000 years that we just happen to not having discovered yet, or even some who left no trace and we’ll never be able to discover is plain stupid.Reinforced concreteA good example of the distorted perception of the past most people has is concrete. Most people think concrete is a modern invention, and ancient buildings were all stone or in best case clay bricks. Actually the Romans had a very wide costruction experience in both unreinforced concrete (like the Pantheon dome in Rome) and reinforced concrete, who could be reinforced with iron bars or wood.The technique to reinforce clay with planks and sticks dates back to the Sumerian - millennia before the Romans.Setting back the starting dateAs I already said, we had to set it back several times. There will be a day (which I’m quite sure hasn’t come yet) when we’ll be unable to set it back again, because despite our technological advancement and new digging sites, there will be effectively no trace of a civilization more ancient than the last one we’ll have discovered. What shall we think then? That civilization started with the first civilization we know of? Why? After we learned so many times that everytime we thought that we were wrong? Inventing more excuses like the lack of technology and the smaller population?

Not only do they allow for almost every sci-fi scenario imaginable, they also add a great deal of value onto the human life.Right now, human lives mean very little in the face of high-end destructive technology like nuclear weapons.
