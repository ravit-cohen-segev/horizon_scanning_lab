So rather than making a single product better they have to make sure that the single product works well with other products in the ecosystem. That’s a huge obstacle if you are trying to improve the tech as it leads to slower iterations with a bulk of extra work.The other companies don’t generally implement such an approach, they generally focus on a single product and make it better as a standalone item. That product then works well with whatever it’s integrated to but the best case scenario is reaching the levels of what Apple is already providing in the ecosystem. A very good example is the NFC, Apple adopted the existing and somewhat old technology around 5–6 years later than major parties. However once they did the services like Apple Pay and such were available for people to use.The thing to focus on is that Apple isn’t in the business of creating the best tech, they are far from it. Apple’s business is focusing on creating the best experience. They move much slower and sometimes use outdated tech but end up providing a better experience to their customers who are already in the ecosystem. If you actually try to use any Apple product outside the ecosystem (with products of other vendors) you realize how Apple fails in the tech but that setup never leads to a better user experience. Most of the time the advanced tech that other companies provide end up being features that nobody actually uses. I think a great example is again NFC in this scenario, it has been around much earlier than Apple decided to adopt it but nobody was using it in their daily lives for things like payments before Apple actually did.M1 is probably a great example as well. If you compare the products with M1 to other products you see that rather than being a laptop they are much closer to tablets. In fact they are simply tablets with keyboards that have worse battery than competition but much better memory and working performance. However Apple is using its ecosystem to turn those tablets into laptop alternatives, they are still far from it but Apple’s idea of combining iOS and Mac with small differences could end up being a major cost saver for the company and they are betting on the world turning to smaller and lighter alternatives to laptops. There are already similar products produced by other vendors that are much better in terms of the tech but they can’t be used as anything other than tablets so far, this is where Apple makes a difference and it’s really what their business is.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,8.8K,996,155.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-Apple-technology-falling-behind

This gives them a chance to reach out to the market they have been trying to reach for years.Is Apple technology falling behind? If you look at the latest iPhones, you will notice that the screen is much larger than those on previous models. The touch screen allows for a much greater level of interaction, whether you are typing or using a stylus. It makes browsing through the web easier than ever before.However, the screen and input method are not the only features that make this device so useful. One of the biggest features is the fact that it takes up significantly less space than the older iPod Touch. With less space to lug around, you no longer have to worry about lugging around several different media players. You can carry around just one device and everything you play and watch easily fits in the palm of your hand. This makes entertainment much more convenient.What does this mean for Apple technology though? While it may seem as though they are falling behind, they are actually coming out with newer devices every year. They continue to develop the hardware, software and add more features to their devices in order to keep up with technology and stay ahead of the competition.Do not let it be behind you. While many companies are scrambling to come up with newer products, Apple continues to invest in research and development of their products. They have the money to spend on research and development of their devices, which they use to improve and enhance their products over the years. You do not have to wait for new Apple products to arrive on the market. These days there are a number of websites offering reviews on Apple products, including those that have been bought and used.Take time to review these sites, find the one that offers you the most reliable information. This is especially important if you plan to buy an Apple device. You want to make sure that you are getting your money's worth when you purchase one of these expensive gadgets. If you do purchase one of these devices from them however, they will offer you a free Apple technology. This will help you to download it onto your computer for free.In today's world, everyone is looking for ways to be more productive. Apple understands this and they are working hard to keep up with technology. The question is; are you falling behind? If you want to learn more about Apple technology, you can check out these excellent review sites today.With the iPad, iPhone and iPod touch, Apple is taking their product line to a whole new level. They're redefining the way people interact with their electronics. Instead of being limited to using a mouse or keyboard for input, you'll have the ability to utilize a finger. Today, you can even use both your fingers and a handkerchief for input. This is just the beginning of innovative product lines like this one. As consumers and buyers, you need to stay abreast of new product developments.Is Apple technology falling behind? It sure seems that way, as they're working diligently to create new and improved products all the time. You may not know it but you could be holding a piece of the future for yourself. By staying ahead of the trends, you'll be able to see Apple technology grow into a billion dollar company. Are you ready to be one of the next millionaires?You'll be glad you took the time to do your research. You don't want to blindly buy something that you don't fully understand.

Heck there are probably at least a couple of them sitting in museums someplace that we could copy.But as a computer - it needs “memory” to store its programs in - and the 1960’s version used something called “core rope memory”:(That looks to be about a foot tall by nine inches wide.)The Apollo computers needed 72kbytes of program storage built out of this weird kind of memory.ButYou can’t buy it anywhere!Setting up a new production facility to make core rope memory would be a MASSIVELY complicated and expensive proposition. Sure we COULD do it - but there is no reason why we would.Storing 72kbytes is child’s play - there’s more memory than that in your mouse!These days, we can use “flash memory” (which uses quantum tunnelling - an obscure corner of physics that was virtually unknown when back when Apollo was designed).We can EASILY put a million times as much storage into a thousandth of the space that the core-rope took - and in the process cut the weight down by a factor of at least a couple of hundred by tossing out that huge circuit board and buying a 128Gbyte thumb-drive for $22 on Amazon instead!(That’s about the size of your thumbnail)So we’d have to redesign whatever connects to that circuit board to have a USB interface. But honestly - the entire Apollo guidance computer could easily be replaced by a $10 Raspberry Pi Zero…we don’t even need that complicated control panel either. Why spend a million dollars redesigning the computer - when we could just give the mission commander a $50 cellphone instead?Of course then you’d want to rewrite the software - add lots more fancy features - fix the bug that came close to ending the Apollo 11 mission…that kind of thing.OK - so now imagine that process - repeated through every single subsystem of the entire SaturnV, the lander, the command module…everything.In PRACTICE - if we wanted to use Apollo-era technology to go back to the Moon, a LARGE fraction of the spacecraft would have to be redesigned, and re-tested (because every tiny design change has to go through careful checking before we trust it with people’s lives)…and in that case, it would be much better just to design an entirely new moon rocket using modern technology…and while they’re about it - let’s make it able to take people to Mars and do other stuff.Which is precisely what NASA are in the process of doing.Another problem with the original design is that the standards for astronaut safety have gotten much more stringent over the past 50 years - and what was considered tolerable risk back then would not be acceptable today.So:Sadly, it is a very popular meme - to say that NASA has lost the technology to go to the moon…people love to hear stories of crass incompetence in government run agencies.But that’s REALLY unfair. NASA lost NOTHING.If you want to blame anyone for the fact that we can’t travel to the moon today - then blame yourselves.The people of America lost interest in the moon landings. The live coverage of the Apollo 17 landing got worse ratings than a re-run of “I Love Lucy” for chrissakes.If people had continued to care - then NASA would have steadily improved Apollo - replacing it part by part as better technology came along - and today we’d have something extremely modern, cheaper, safer, faster - instead of wasting 50 years on the dead-end of the Shuttle and ISS programs.But the USA is a democracy - and when the people stop being interested in going to the moon - government cuts funding and says “Make us a manned space station” - so NASA obediently mothballs the moon rocket designs - and that’s that.Then, 50 years later - the people say “We Want To Go Back To The Moon!” - and are pissed that NASA can’t just roll out another Saturn V and send people back there.It doesn’t work like that!","2,489 followers",David Lewinnek,15.9K,437,4.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-Apple-technology-falling-behind

Scientists have successfully removed this extra chromosome from a cell of a person with Down syndrome, creating a non-Down syndrome cell in the process.Extra chromosome 21 removed from Down syndrome cell lineThis means removing chromosomes without destroying cells is possible.So, in summation, you can remove chromosomes from a cell, meaning you could remove a Y chromosome from an XY recipient cell and an X chromosome from an XY donor cell.

It’s not like making a female, where all the bits are available. You can’t simply grab a second cell if you need a second copy of something. You need a Y chromosome, which is not available. Well, perhaps I should say that you need the genetic information of a Y chromosome, which usually isn’t available on an X chromosome.",UNKNOWN,Devin O'Keefe,21.7K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-Apple-technology-falling-behind
26,"It is not only theoretically possible, but it wouldn’t actually require a level of technology that much more advanced that what we already have.To make a female human baby from a zygote with an XY chromosome would only require knocking out the SRY gene complex on the why chromosome, which could probably be done with existing CRISPR based technology.Then you have to implant the zygote in a surrogate and you’re off to the races.This would result in a child with Turner’s Syndrome, probably.Avoiding that would require inserting an additional X chromosome from whatever source into the zygote, and tIt is not only theoretically possible, but it wouldn’t actually require a level of technology that much more advanced that what we already have.To make a female human baby from a zygote with an XY chromosome would only require knocking out the SRY gene complex on the why chromosome, which could probably be done with existing CRISPR based technology.Then you have to implant the zygote in a surrogate and you’re off to the races.This would result in a child with Turner’s Syndrome, probably.Avoiding that would require inserting an additional X chromosome from whatever source into the zygote, and there are a number of techniques for adding foreign genetic material into a cell that could probably be modified to do the job with just a little bit further advancement in sophistication.","26,668 followers",Donna Fernstrom,628,9.3K,64.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-Apple-technology-falling-behind

Such a situation is not compatible with life, and an egg that somehow ended up fertilized this way would never even make it to fetus.People tend to think of X and Y chromosomes as “sex chromosomes.” In fact, the X chromosome also carries almost 800 critical protein-coding genes that have absolutely nothing to do with sex, including a number of genes involved in regulation of brain and nervous system development, regulation of gene transcription, regulation of apoptosis, control of RNA transcription, control of ribosome production, and more.The X chromosome contDeath very early in development.

Mon El is a Daxamite.There's another bunch of Kryptonian species exist seperately in Mongul's warworld as fighters, they never been exposed to yellow sun or kryptonian atmosphere so when they first came on earth, their powers manifested slightly differently but very similarly to how a kryptonian's power would manifest on Earth.
