And overall I'm an optimist.If you compare the world today, to the world as it existed a century ago, I think it's impossible not to agree that on the overall balance technology and science has had a much larger positive impact than negative.We live longer, we're healthier, we're less likely to die as a result of violence, we're more educated and wealthier, and there's never been less famine, or less illiteracy, or less maternal deaths than there are today, to mention a few obvious things.But I do think there are challenges and dangers, and I do think we need toNo. We're not moving too fast.

This isn't a problem by itself, but itThe problem is that while capacity to do work is reasonably democratically distributed, capital is not. There is no such thing as a person who is 100 times as effective as the average person in picking strawberries or painting an house. But thereOver the last century or so, working and earning a salary has been the main income for a pretty big fraction of humanity. That makes it crucially important for equality that a large fraction of the total productivity of humanity goes towards paying salaries.If that is no longer the case, a trend that's been underway for several decades already and seems set to continue if not accelerate, then we desperately need some alternative mechanism for ensuring the same outcome.A future where a smaller and smaller fraction of humanity controls a bigger and bigger fraction of the total income, justified by nothing more than randomly happening to have the right parents, isTechnology matters for this because it is one of the primary mechanisms that allows us to replace employees with capital. It is not this replacement that is problematic; indeed it's a GOOD thing if we can get jobs done with less human labour needed. The problematic thing, instead, is that while labour is inherently, at least to some degree, democratically distributed, there are no natural limits to the concentration of capital.",UNKNOWN,Paul O'Brien,6.6K,6.4K,6.8M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-stacks-are-good-for-developing-a-e-commerce-startup

7,"Yes, they do get time in the office, but are also expected to keep their skills up to date on their own time. The difference between what an engineer would learn in the office or at home depends on how valuable what they are learning is to their employer. No one would ever stop doing their daily job until they read and worked through the examples in a book on programming (most are around 500+ pages and take quite a while to get through). They wouldn't complete an online course from Coursera in the office either. Software engineers, like other employees, are hired to add value to a company. UsuYes, they do get time in the office, but are also expected to keep their skills up to date on their own time.

No one would ever stop doing their daily job until they read and worked through the examples in a book on programming (most are around 500+ pages and take quite a while to get through). They wouldn't complete an online course from Coursera in the office either. Software engineers, like other employees, are hired to add value to a company. Usually they do programming tasks like fixing bugs, changing the typeface of all the text throughout a web site, finding a faster way to load images from the company's servers onto a smart phone, etc. There is never a time when a tech company's business, product, design, or engineering teams don't have a list of tasks for the engineering teams to do. However, if it benefits the company to have engineers slow work on other tasks and learn something, then they will get some time to learn it. Also, if an engineer needs to build a feature that uses Google Maps, it would be fine for them to watch a tutorial on working with Google Maps because it helps them to do their job.As an example of learning a new language, a few years ago Apple transitioned from the Objective-C programming language to the Swift programming language. The iOS engineers at my company explained to management that learning Swift was valuable to the company because it was Apple's new language and they needed to use it in order to keep the app modern and because it's a more efficient language. The iOS team came up with their own micro-course on swift where each week for a few months one person on the team would learn something about Swift and teach it to the rest of the team. In fact, anyone else in the company was encouraged to attend the classes as long as it didn't interfere with their normal work.This is a bit of a tangent, but I'm an Android engineer and I like to go to the more interesting branding, content, or marketing meetings. I just like to learn how these teams work. My boss doesn't mind this at all. He likes the idea that people on our team have insight into other parts of the company. It can help us keep our goals aligned with the rest of the company's.As another example, there's Android and the Kotlin programming language. Android apps are typically written in the Java programming language. There is a new language that is growing in popularity for Android programming called Kotlin. Where Swift is a language created by Apple, Kotlin is a language created not by Google but by JetBrains. Regardless of whether Kotlin is better than Java, it is not Google's official language for developing Android apps. There is no need for an Android team to switch from Kotlin to Java. This makes it much harder to quantify the business value of having a team of engineers learn Kotlin. If they can make the case for Kotlin, they'll get some time to learn it.There is virtually no scenario where a web developer would be given time to learn virtual reality programming or computer vision. It would always be more cost effective for a company to hire someone with experience in those areas.Ultimately, a company doesn't care how an engineer spends their time so long as they get their work done. If an engineer spends half an hour a day learning a new language or playing foosball and they are still productive, no one will care. If they spend three hours a day learning a new language or playing foosball, then they need to be prepared to explain how they’re not wasting the company’s money.I hope that answers your question.",42 followers,Andy Baker,2.8K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-stacks-are-good-for-developing-a-e-commerce-startup
8,"The thing is, even when you're writing a bit of code, you're often learning.This is because most things that you have to program, are new to you. Repetitive tasks are often written as a function so that you don’t have to do it again, switches are either/or, and common code is just that.But when you need a new function, a different way of joining that sql, or designing a new way of doing something, you will learn something.",116 followers,Amogh Huilgol,703,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/Are-we-moving-too-fast-on-the-way-of-technology-development
