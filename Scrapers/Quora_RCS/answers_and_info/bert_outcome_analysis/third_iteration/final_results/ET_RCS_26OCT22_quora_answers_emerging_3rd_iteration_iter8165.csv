NASA was given very little time to develop the necessary technology, after all, and direct ascent would not require the development of docking and orbital rendezvous capabilities that were seen as complex, difficult to create and introducing points of vulnerability for the entire mission (read: “What if something fails in one of these systemsYes, and also no.Let’s start at the beginning: Why was lunar rendezvous used for Apollo at all?The first concepts for a manned lunar landing assumed a “direct ascent” method would be the safest, most straightforward way of accomplishing the program goal. NASA was given very little time to develop the necessary technology, after all, and direct ascent would not require the development of docking and orbital rendezvous capabilities that were seen as complex, difficult to create and introducing points of vulnerability for the entire mission (read: “What if something fails in one of these systems around the Moon?”)In a direct ascent mission profile, a spacecraft is launched from Earth as one unit, transfers to lunar orbit, descends to the surface and launches back - all without a single docking or rendezvous stage.Unfortunately, once the initial studies were complete, a teeny tiny problem was revealed……namely, that the starship would beWhelp. It turned out that developing the rocket necessary to lift that thing would probably eclipse the effort required to perfect orbital rendezvous, guidance and all. Because sometimes, it’s the huge “big ticket” machine that’s way more difficult to create than the cutting-edge whiz-bang electronic system.The two remaining options: Earth Orbit Rendezvous (ie. “build the huge thing in orbit in a few launches”) and Lunar Orbital Rendezvous (“use a smaller lander instead of one huge space ship”) had their own pros and cons, but ultimately LOR was chosen over EOR. There were two primary reasons: one, it saved…orbital rendezvous turned out to be simpler than anticipated.But why, you might ask? Doesn’t it require sophisticated calculations? Isn’t it like hitting a bullet with another bullet?Kind of. But here’s the thing: both bullets are moving along ballistic trajectories. There is no air resistance that slows down either bullet. More importantly, the bullets can beIn order to meet a spacecraft in orbit, you need to know, essentially, three things:If you haven’t noticed yet, here’s why it turned out to be easier than anticipated: all three of these things can be either pre-calculated (the ascent profile) or calculated on site, using nothing else but relative positions and speeds of the target and the ascending spacecraft!And holy hell, it actually gets better!First, the fact you only need relative positions means that *both* the target and the ascending ship can gather the necessary data, giving the scheme redundancy. And, since both ‘bullets’ are moving at a steady trajectory around the Moon, it means that should an error be made in the calculations, it is not fatal: the ascending lunar lander is not going to crash back into the Moon if it misses the command module. So, as long as the lander gets into an orbit, there will be room to fix errors.To that effect, NASA had to develop:The final part is super important. NASA did successfully develop sophisticated guidance systems for Apollo. NASA did develop great inertial navigation systems. NASA purchased and installed state-of-the-art mainframes for ground support, too. Apollo also enjoyed its legacy as a direct ascent spacecraft in the fact that the Service Module’s engine was super beefy.But, shit happens, right? What if all of the above failed?Fear not: with the right mission planning, the risks could be minimized.Two things present the biggest risks during a lunar orbital rendezvous mission: navigational system failure on the surface, that prevents acquisition of data necessary for launch, and a failure in orbit that prevents the computer from calculating the maneuvers (length and times of engine burns) to close and dock.The first problem was solved byApollo 11 landed right near the lunar equator (the site was only 0.67 degrees north). Why is that important, you ask?It meant that, should all electronics fail and the slide rule broke somehow, the crew only had to fly a pre-calculated ascent profile (which they memorized) and get the LM intoRemember what I wrote about orbital planes? Launching from any other latitude requires calculating an azimuth in order to achieve a specific plane, and you simply cannot get your plane to zero degrees, either. If the command module was in the wrong place (because it was an emergency launch), then it might not have the fuel necessary to adjust its own plane and intercept the lander.But when launching from the equator? No azimuth required. You just keep going in the same direction you were going when landing (also from an equatorial plane) and your orbit will be more or less aligned no matter when you launched.Then the CSM acquires you with its own radar and does the interception using its own engine.The second problem was pre-empted by goodEnter Buzz Aldrin. A lot of people aren’t sure why he’s sometimes called “Dr.” Aldrin, so let me explain: he’s called that because he’s a PhD, and the title of his thesis is…“Line-of-sight guidance techniques for manned orbital rendezvous”Buzz Aldrin, who you might recall was selected as the Lunar Module Pilot for Apollo 11, was, at the time, the world’s leading expert in navigational problems relating to orbital rendezvous. He could, quite literally, perform all of the required calculations by hand, using a sliderule. He’d still need some data, but those could be fed from either spacecraft (two radars = redundancy!) or even, with some effort, from the ground.RedundancyEven the crew itself was an additional backup to all the backups. A multi-modal failure that simultaneously knocked out all of the redundant systems was not very likely.So, to summarize:",0 followers,Paweł Żuk,885,568,1.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Lunar-Module-manage-to-rendezvous-with-the-Command-Module-while-it-was-in-orbit-around-the-Moon-Wouldn-t-this-require-a-fairly-sophisticated-guidance-system-on-one-or-both-of-the-vehicles

On-board radar units provided very accurate measurements of the relative positions and velocities LM (Lunar Module) and CSM (Command and Service Module stack). All of these devices were state of the art for the day, and very expensive, but that wasn’t a big problem for the Apollo program.To put the computational requirements in perspective, you can simulate the missions, complete with nice graphics [1], using a Raspberry Pi 3. [2] The Raspberry Pi actually uses more capacity for the graphics than the astrodynamics, and still spends most of its time waiting. The astronomy and astrodynamics libraries use models developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratories, quite similar to the ones used for actual interplanetary missions.[1] The graphics wouldn’t be to modern video game standards, but better than what you’d have seen on arcade-style games from the late 1980s.[2] Some years ago, I used a Raspberry Pi 3 to implement an interplanetary flight simulator.

3,"Essentially, the question is asking: did the lunar orbital rendezvous require a sophisticated guidance system?Yes, and no.YesNoEssentially, the question is asking: did the lunar orbital rendezvous require a sophisticated guidance system?Yes, and no.YesNoThose conditions are:With that, the process is relatively simple, and relatively efficient (though never quite as efficient as calculating your exact trajectory in advance):If you do this, you can make orbital rendezvous without needing to make too many (or even any) calculations and without wasting fuel. You just need a reliable restartable rocket engine and a bit of time.If you are in a rush, you can brute force it (accelerating towards the target, then accelerating up or down to maintain altitude) but you will waste a ton of fuel. That ruled out the brute force approach for Apollo.Still, the Apollo missions would have had to make more precise calculations in advance since their ascent stage engine was only quaified for 15 restarts and was fixed thrust. Without making precise calculations, eyeballing would have needed a lot of experience doing the manoeuvre, which the Apollo astronauts did not have. With precise calculations, there would be little to no fuel wasted and it would only need a minimum of 4 engine restarts (ascent, lower orbit circularisation, transfer to target orbit, target orbit circularisation).","3,603 followers",Mark Shulmann,548,2.2K,34.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Lunar-Module-manage-to-rendezvous-with-the-Command-Module-while-it-was-in-orbit-around-the-Moon-Wouldn-t-this-require-a-fairly-sophisticated-guidance-system-on-one-or-both-of-the-vehicles

We have seen pictures of how modest was the beginning of ISRO - carrying rockets on bicycle and rockets being made in a small Church in Thumba. ISRO formed by scientists like Vikram Sarabhai, Satish Dhawan etc. and DRDO formed by bureaucrats. DRDO has 30000 employees with 5000 scientists and rest 25000 IAS or I am sorry service officers.This is the primary reason for ISRO’s success and DRDO’s failure - presence or absence of Nehru. In 21st century, Nehru has become the punching bag for most Indians and I have also joined this bandwagon.Nehru offering banana to an elephant: Nehru made India a ‘Sir CV Raman is known as the first Asian to ever win the Nobel Prize for his pathbreaking contributions to science. He is credited with discovering the eponymous 'Raman effect', the phenomenon of inelastic scattering of a photon by molecules when they are excited by high levels of energy, along with his student KS Krishnan. Though he started his career in commerce and the finances, Raman who always had a bent for science, started his formal career as a scientist in 1917 after he became the first Palit Professor of Physics in Calcutta University. He quickly reached the top of the pyramid in India and was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics by 1930.Today, many in India are commemorating his 48th death anniversary. Tributes have been pouring n on social media, with a large number of students and politicians tweeting their messages.However, in his life, Raman often displayed a sharp disdain for politicians and governments. His career was marked by severe competition and Raman was often accused by his contemporaries of favouritism and arrogance. After winning the Nobel, Raman was made the Director of the Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru. However, his tenure as chief was cut short after he was removed following intense internal rivalries.Raman's biographers have often mentioned that Raman was a man of many words and sharp wit. One of the times he exhibited it was when he tricked then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, cited by some as Raman's lifelong nemesis. Raman had been against wearing the tag of 'nationalism' on his sleeve and post-independence, had refused to serve on the Congress Party's National Planning Committee. He was also critical of Nehru's scientific vision and policies which were focussed on channelling research resources to the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) laboratories and other institutionalised groups. He was against government control of scientists and scientific enquiry and remained against it till the end of his life.This dislike perhaps came to fore on a particular instance when Raman practically pranked Nehru when he visited the Raman Research Institute set up by its namesake in Bengaluru in 1948. According to a report in Scroll, Raman allegedly met Nehru warmly and proceeded to turn off all but the UV lights in the laboratory. He then placed a piece of copper and piece of gold in front of Nehru and asked him to identify which was gold. As the copper glowed more under the UV lights, Nehru was mistaken and answered the question incorrectly, following which Raman reportedly laughed and said, ""Mr Prime Minister, everything that glitters is not gold.""The incident has been documented in Uma Parameswaran's biography of the Nobel laureate titled CV Raman: a Biography in which she wrote the reason for Raman's dislike for Nehru was because “Nehru had chosen the copper piece (thinking it was gold) again and again, fooled by light that did not emerge from the natural light of wisdom.”There have been other reported instances of Raman showing his anger toward Nehru. According to a Feb 2018 report in Swarajya magazine, the scientist allegedly smashed the Barat Ratna medallion conferred on him by the Indian government in 1954. out of his anger toward government control over scientific research.Now one can guess how his great grandson Rahul Gandhi got the idea to make gold from potato....ek taraf se aloo dalunga aur dusre taraf se sona niklega!!! (potato will enter into machine from one side and gold will come out from other side).

Generally speaking, those objects of study are called “manifolds.” The definition is technical, but the “brief explanation of the idea” is that a manifold is something that looks like normal Euclidean space if you confine yourself to a small enough neighborhood. IfIf you are exploring a problem that involves stuff going on in just one patch, you can “push” that problem to a corresponding Euclidean space and solve the problem there. If you’re working on a problem that potentially involves more than one patch — for example, if you’re studying a path that wraps around the whole manifold, passing through multiple patches on the way — the general philosophy is that you “push” the problem to the various Euclidean spaces, solve the problem there, “pull back” the solutions to the manifold, then make sure the things you pulled back can be glued together properly as you go from one patch to another.If there’s one pattern you see over and over in basic differential geometry, it’s that pattern: push a problem to Euclidean spaces, solve it, pull back the solution, and make sure the individual pull-backs line up correctly as you go from one patch to another.Why it’s harder / better than it might lookI’m going to ask you to do something that you think is easy, and I guarantee you’re going to do it wrong. Ready? Visualize a circle.WRONG!You’re probably visualizing a circleYou might balk. Even if you could do that, why would you? Fair question. There are reasons, and I’ll get to them in a second. But for now I just wanted to focus on this concept.One of the big features of differential geometry is that you’re often not “living inside a bigger space.” When you study an object that’s sitting inside of a plane or some other ambient Euclidean space, you are studying “extrinsic” geometry of the object. When you don’t embed the object in an ambient Euclidean space, you are studying “intrinsic” geometry of the object.Intrinsic geometry is harder, at least in the sense of having to spill a lot of ink to rigorously define things that are very easy to do with the benefit an ambient space. Take curvature, for example.When you’re studying a curve in a plane, you can easily define the curvature at a pointBut if youFine. You can do all this, but why would you want to?This is not the historically accurate answer, but to me it’s the intellectually most satisfying: consider general relativity. (For the record, the foundations of differential geometry — including the modern definition of manifold — were developed about 50–70 years before general relativity.) Broadly speaking, the idea of general relativity is that the geometry of the universe says a lot of interesting stuff about physics.But whatDifferential geometry gives us a way to study the intrinsic geometry, so this question never needs to be solved. We can compute, say, the curvature of the universe at a certain point, without worrying about an unobservable “super-universe” containing ours, in which circles are being drawn to aid our computation.Other IdeasOnce you develop the “groundwork” of defining intrinsic analogues to all the geometric concepts you took for granted (curvature, tangent/normal vectors, boundaries, volumes, etc.) there are nice questions you can ask.One big family of questions concern “rigidity.” Broadly speaking, a rigidity question is whether or to what extent some geometric or topological feature constrains other geometric or topological features. For example, very often you get theorems that a manifold satisfying some condition on curvature and/or volume can only be one of a few well-known or concrete possibilities.Another type of question is whether one manifold can fit inside another, or whether one manifold has other submanifolds necessarily sitting inside it. Perhaps the most natural or straightforward is whether any manifold can be embedded in an ambient Euclidean space. (The answer is yes, although it’s not obvious why.) A harder question is whether certain manifolds always have certain types of closed curves inside.There are of course many other types of questions, but they start to get a little specialized even to state.",0 followers,David Rutter,1.1K,8.5K,7.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Lunar-Module-manage-to-rendezvous-with-the-Command-Module-while-it-was-in-orbit-around-the-Moon-Wouldn-t-this-require-a-fairly-sophisticated-guidance-system-on-one-or-both-of-the-vehicles

Most of the movies so far suggested are not hard sci-fi. For those who don’t know, hard sci-fi is science fiction which does not break current understanding of physics, so mostly that means no things like flick-of-a-switch artificial gravity, no faster than light travel, realistic gravity and orbital mechanics, ships not maneuvering like atmospheric fighters or oceangoing sea vessels, no sound in space, aliens that aren't just humans with rubber bits stuck on their nose, no silly time or interdimensional travelling (counter-intuitive effects of relativity or bending of space time are acceptable so long as they are explained in-store and mostly adhere to relativity) etc. Very, very few science fiction films or tv shows fit these criteria. My nomination is not a movie, but a tv-show. Funnily enough it’s on Syfy, which usually sucks, but I think it was made in conjunction with Netflix and is based on a book series so I they were pressured to put effort into it. It’s “The Expanse”Pictures from GoogleThis would have to be one of the most scientifically accurate tv shows/movies I’ve seen set in the distant future.Without giving too much away it’s basically set in the future, humanity has colonized most of the Solar System, but there’s a Cold War between 3 major factions:The United Nations of Earth- Basically your typical dystopian future bureaucratic oligarchy trying to impose it’s will on all the human colonies by exploiting it's effective monopoly on breathable air. People on Earth live in luxury, going to schmoozing dinner parties and complaining about grasping colonials trying to take more than they deserve.Mars- A military dictatorship that is antagonistic towards Earth, edging for total independence. Mars is the largest off-world colony. Because of its large population and limited resources it has developed a highly authoritarian, Spartan-like system of government where resources are strictly rationed. Martians view Earthlings as weak and decadent and resent Earth's monopoly on breathable air.Belters- People who inhabit asteroids and dwarf planets in the outer regions of the Solar System. Mutated by life spent in low gravity, too weak to survive on Earth. They have extremely poor living conditions as they have to work to collect ice to produce water, as well as metal ore, which they can then trade for air from Earth. Air and water are the most valuable commodities in this region of space. There’s a quasi-religious, low level insurgency agitating for independence from both Earth and Mars.A Belter being subjected to Earth gravityThere are some other interesting factions in the show, like the Mormons, who have become a major religion and are building a massive colony ship to go and colonize Kolob, from the Mormon bible. There are also various gangs, police, spies etc.The story is about a bunch of characters investigating a series of murders, terrorist attacks and conspiracies in what seems to be an attempt to instigate a war between the major factions of the Solar System.Why I think it’s a good “hard” sci-fi show is basically because it does physics really well, like to the point where most people wouldn’t even realize how realistic it is. For example there’s no faster-than-light-travel, people zip around the solar system at high speed in ships with very limited fuel supplies, to the point where fuel plays a large part in the story, unlike most sci-fis. Also, the show does have “artificial gravity” but it’s not artificial gravity like most sci-fi has where someone flips a switch and, hey presto, Earth like gravity. The show has a few ways of explaining artificial gravity;The first is just low gravity. On the dwarf planets like Ceres people just live in micro-gravity. For the most part things behave as they do on Earth, probably for budgetary reasons, but every now and then it will show a bird flying by flapping it’s wings really slowly or someone will throw something and it takes a long time to fall. Like I said it doesn’t apply to everything, but it’s a nice little nod to realism.Then there’s magnetic boots and harnesses. Again, this one isn’t entirely accurate, people walk onto a ship, turn on their magnetic boots or put on their harnesses and then suddenly everything like hair or liquid behaves as it would on Earth, but like I said that’s probably budgetary reasons.They also use spinning rings to generate gravity, but unlike most sci-fis where they use a ring that’s only a few yards across that manages to generate perfect Earth-like gravity, the ring stations in the show are huge. Like the Nauvoo, the Mormon colony ship being built for a great pilgrimage. Ring ships would need to be at least this big in order to avoid having the gravity at your head substantially lower than the gravity at your feet.It's hard to gauge how big the ship is in this picture but it's HUGE. It's construction is an enormous project requiring years to build and enormous investment by the Mormon Church to complete.But my favourite form of artificial gravity is one I don’t thi...",0 followers,Mark Hughes,585,2.5K,18.4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Lunar-Module-manage-to-rendezvous-with-the-Command-Module-while-it-was-in-orbit-around-the-Moon-Wouldn-t-this-require-a-fairly-sophisticated-guidance-system-on-one-or-both-of-the-vehicles

In the movie there is a corporation that has perfected the technique for mining this helium and sending it back to Earth as an energy source. However, in order to make the operation profitable they only send a single operator to the moon for a three year contract before they are replaced by the next miner. The story begins with Sam Bell nearing the end of his three year rotation and he’s going a bit stir crazy by himself with only intermittent messages from his employer and family and the lunar station robot to keep him company. Without getting into spoilers there is an accident which causes some serious issues with the three year schedule. Essentially the movie is basically just a one character character sketch but Sam Rockwell is a brilliant enough actor who is able to pull it off.I can’t recommend this movie enough.

The plot advances through intellectual arguments between Oldman and his fellow faculty members.And that’s the whole movie, in a nutshell. A farewell party turned to something infinitely more interesting after Oldman makes an audacious claim – that he’s been walking on this planet for 14,000 years.What follows is an 89-minute examination of that claim.You see, Oldman’s friends are accomplished University professors, each of them specialising in subjects such as Biology, Art History, Anthropology, History and Archaeology.They will not take Oldman’s lofty claim lying downAnd so, we are treated to a game of intellectual and philosophical tête-à-tête.Although his colleagues are rightly disbelieving at first, with every passing minute, Oldman’s claims grow bolder and more incendiary.The entire movie is centred on their conversation, and it is utterly enthralling. The ideas are ambitious, and the dialogue crackles.I will confess that the standard of acting is dubious at certain points and the production values are appalling at times, but it doesn’t hinder the experience.Ultimately,No matter how many millions producers throw at a movie, unless the writing is substantial, it will feel hollow.And it is in this aspect thatJerome Bixby, the writer, initially conceived this story in the 1960s and only completed it on his deathbed in 1998.

Although sci-fi is normally associated with just about anything to do with space or the future such as the action movie, Independence Day, and the space-western, Star Wars, at its heart, good science fiction should be about the human condition. Out of all the films that have been released in the past few years, one film perfectly fits this bill-ArrivalThe basic premise of the film is that one day twelve alien ships appear at separate, seemingly random, locations around the world. Nobody knows why they are here or even how to communicate with them. As a result, Dr Louise Banks (Amy Adams), a linguistics professor and physicist Ian Donnely (Jeremy Renner), are hired by the US Government to find the answer to the question, “What is your purpose on earth?” and thus discern whether or not they are a threat to humanity’s survival. Whilst their team frantically work towards learning the alien language and how to communicate with them, the alien’s presence causes tensions to mount. Before long, everything they’ve worked towards is put into jeopardy as global war looms.Although being ostensibly hard sci-fi and exploring high concept ideas on the nature of time, free-will, language and communication, Arrival still manages to be rooted in a human and emotional story. Part of its success in this perfect marriage was in its protagonist, Dr. Louise Banks, and her brilliant portrayal by Amy Adams (which certainly deserved at the very least an academy award nomination). First beginning with flashbacks from Louise’s past and the death of her daughter at a young age that leaves Louise apathetic to life, Amy Adams delivers a melancholic and subtle performance, layered with emotion as her character begins to achieve a sense of agency as the film progresses.Through the film’s premise of an alien encounter, Arrival looks at how we would deal with the possibility of such an event (the rather cynical, yet unsurprising conclusion offered is one of chaos, ignorance, collapse in trust and paranoia). In doing so, the film puts a mirror up to society, to teach ideas of communication and trust, ideas especially relevant in the current political climate (the film was released three days following the US election). By having our human protagonists study aliens and their non-linear language, we begin to study humanity through our differences to the aliens. The various world governments fear the aliens and the potential for any malign intentions not due to any evidence, but because of what they know about human history. However despite its critical commentary of our society, Arrival offers a message of hope, a message on living life.Despite its thoughtful nature, the film is far from a slow, artsy film, offering moments of tensions and drama through the film that prevent the film from ever being boring if you weren’t already invested in it. Its brilliant direction from Denis Villeneuve and screenplay (adapted from Ted Chiang’s “Story of your Life” by Eric Heisserer) is complemented by excellent cinematography and a score by Johan Johansson that goes from hauntingly beautiful to eerie and anxiety inducing.Overall, Arrival was to me a brilliant antidote to the current state of the film industrial, one that was (and still is) full of blockbuster reboots and extended universes designed with the sole intention of setting up the next sequel and hence make money. However with Arrival, I was presented with a well-crafted, thought provoking, ambitious film.
