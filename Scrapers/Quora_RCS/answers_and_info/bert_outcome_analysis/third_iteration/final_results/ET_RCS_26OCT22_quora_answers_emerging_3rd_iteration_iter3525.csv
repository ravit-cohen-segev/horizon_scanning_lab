For a large mission, it could take hours for all the bombers to formate around the assembly ship before departing for the target.That’s in the USAAF for daylight bombing.The RAF, with it’s strategy of night bombing, initially simply gave each plane it’s own individual route and there was no formation as such. Later the RAF used a relatively loose formation (compared to the combat box) known as aIn a bomber stream, all the aircraft flew the same route at the same speed to and from the target, but each aircraft was allotted a time and height slot in the stream in the hope of reducing collisions. The calculation was that the loses due to the increase in collisions due to the close proximity of hundreds of bombers that could barely see each other, was more than offset by the lower losses due to German defences, particularly night fighters.The Bomber stream was helped to find the target by theThere were three types of pathfinder. The ""illuminators"" dropped flares along the stream’s flightpath for the bombers to follow to the target. The ""visual markers"" dropped target indicators once the aim point had been definitively identified, and ""backers-up"" dropped incendiary bombs to light fires in the target location.Once that was all done, the ‘Master Bomber’, who spent the raid circling the target broadcasting instructions, would order the main force to attack and, hopefully, destroy the target.","31,963 followers",Graeme Shimmin,901,2.1K,22.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/During-WWII-what-methods-did-the-Allies-use-to-get-hundreds-of-bombers-into-formation-above-their-home-bases-without-chaos-or-collisions-Seems-like-a-harder-problem-than-modern-air-traffic-control-and-with-less-advanced-technology

You’ll find that most surviving Beaufighters, including those in the UK and USA, had carried Australian serials at some point.Australia produced the Mark 21, of which 364 were Aussie built, as a follow-on from the also Australian-built Beaufort bomber (700 built) because of the perceived commonality of parts.The RAAF operated 2 Beau squadrons in Europe: no 456 nightfighter squadron was initially equipped with Beaufighters to replace its Bolton-Paul Defiants. Its Beaus were largely Merlin-powered Mk IIs. They were soon replaced by Mosquitoes. The other squadron was 455, which was moved to Coastal Command and became part of a strike wing conducting anti-shipping strikes alongside no 489 (RNZAF). Number 455 squadron largely performed anti-flak attacks on German shipping, with guns and rockets, while 489 squadron was primarily a torbeau (torpedo-carrying) unit. There is lots of footage from these shipping attacks available.In the Pacific theatre the RAAF had 2 Beaufighter squadrons primarily (nos 30 and 31), initially with British built Beaufighters (Mk IC, Mk VIC, Mk X, Mk XI) until the Australian-built Mk 21s came along in late 1944. The Mk 21 was derived from the Mk X, but with numerous changes such as 4x.50 calibre machine guns, no fin fillet or thimble nose, and a Sperry auto-pilot.The Beaus were part of the defence of Port Moresby and Milne Bay in 1942, and took part in the battles of Buna and Gona in 1943. They also took part in the battle of the Bismarck Sea in late 1943. Footage of this is especially available, as Damien Parer (the movie cameraman who filmed the Academy Award-winning Kokoda Front Line) lodged himself behind the pilot and in front of the navigator, basically on top of the magazines for the 20mm cannon, to film the attack. The Beaufighters provided cover for the USAAF Mitchells bombing the Japanese convoy.So, the Beaufighter contributed greatly to the Allied war effort, basically in night fighting, anti-shipping, ground attack, and supply-line interdiction. That, and it helped build Australia's aircraft industry.Additional fact: The original Beaufort plans and drawings received from Bristol were all in metric measurements. They had to be converted back to Imperial units prior to Australian production. It must have been a Bristol thing, perhaps in the mould of Isambard Brunel and the Bristol railway.",52 followers,Richard Hanway,556,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/During-WWII-what-methods-did-the-Allies-use-to-get-hundreds-of-bombers-into-formation-above-their-home-bases-without-chaos-or-collisions-Seems-like-a-harder-problem-than-modern-air-traffic-control-and-with-less-advanced-technology

They would then join formation by squadrons who would form into groups and groups would form into divisions and then set out for the target hopefully when scheduled to do so. The timing was critical because if they were late, their fighter escort could either miss them altogether or at very least would be forced to leave before accompanying them as far as scheduled.As the bomber force increased in numbers, they adopted distinctive markings for different bomber divisions and groups within the division. As an example, the H in the White Triangle below indicates this aircraft was from the 306 Bomb Group. The WW indicates the specific squadron an the R is an individual aircraft number.Later as the bomber force grew, the US developed the technique of using distinctive painted lead aircraft (each group would have a differently painted lead ship) that would serve as the rendezvous point for all aircraft from that group. Basically, they would all join formation with that aircraft as the lead and when the formation was complete the lead ship would go home and the group would head to the target.","2,444 followers",Pete Feigal,969,401,9.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/During-WWII-what-methods-did-the-Allies-use-to-get-hundreds-of-bombers-into-formation-above-their-home-bases-without-chaos-or-collisions-Seems-like-a-harder-problem-than-modern-air-traffic-control-and-with-less-advanced-technology
3,"The truth is that bombing accuracy in WW2 was terrible! In 1943 the average circular error was 1200 feet- meaning only 16% of bombs fell within 1000 feet of the aiming point.

That aircraft is the de Havilland Mosquito.The “wooden wonder” was faster than enemy fighters when it was introduced. It could carry a very heavy bombload as well, because it carried only a crew of two- no gunners! However, by 1944 in the raid on Amiens prison (Operation Jericho) it needed fighter cover. In this raid, the low-level Mosquitoes displayed great precision. They were able to destroy the German guardhouse, breach the exterior walls, and free prisoners by putting holes in the cell block walls.Mosquitoes also famously knocked Herman Göring off the air in 1943 by knocking out the main Berlin broadcasting station.

A true “unsung hero.”At Pearl Harbor, Coral Sea, Aleutians, Guadalcanal, Midway, at almost every naval engagement on the war, the PBY was there and contributed greatly to the war…and that’s not even mentioning her service with other Allied forces.It was the 1st US plane to attack the Japanese, it flew in the first offensive raid against the Japanese, before even the Doolittle Raid, the 1st US Navy aircraft to score an air-to-air kill against a Japanese fighter, at Midway one of the few aircraft other than a dive bomber to score a hit on a Japanese ship, and the only American one with a torpedo.It was so successful the Japanese thought it was some “super-plane,” attacking them throughout the war and they targeted them, esp. when they could.“PBY”, Patrol Bomber Y (“Y” was the designation for Consolidated, the builder.)“Catalina” came from the Brits but the US adapted it, and shortened it often to “Cat.”The PBY seaplane was a flying boat, with the hull being like a boat’s, not just a “float plane” (just a plane equipped with floats.)Not the most modern aircraft of the war from 1936, it was actually considered obsolete by 1941.Not a speedy racer as its fuselage was an actual boat…and it had a huge high aspect ratio wing that gave it low induced drag and thus low total drag at low indicated airspeeds This is perfect for maritime patrol aircraft who spend much of the time a low speed/altitude and gives them its of endurance/linger time. The negative for the wing is lots of parasite drag, or a lot of total drag at higher indicated air speeds, but this wasn’t that big a deal as it was mostly low and slow.A typical battle mission weight would be around 32,000 pounds so the Cats max speed (in a dive) would be about 155 knots or 178 mph or 287 kph. In level flight it can max out at 147 knots or 169 mph or 272 kph, and that at 5000 ft. Typical cruise speeds are about 150 mph.No performance at high alt but didn't need to as it was always low and slow, searching for downed airmen, or bombing ships/subs, for instance.It’s engines were very simple and trouble-free, 2 ×(Above: Pratt & Whitney R-1830–92 Twin Wasp in its most basic form: Reliable as an anvil, air-cooled as all combat engines should be, and perfect for long missions over water.)The Cat had a very low stall speed. At the end of a mission and light on fuel, its stall speed was around 65 mph true airspeed at sea level. Now that's without putting the flaps down because…the Cat doesn't have flaps! This ability to fly so slowly was a key to so much of its value and esp. on rescue missions.(Above/below: Cockpit.)(Above/below: Nose close-up.)Some say that the PBY was so slow that navigators needed calendars more than they did chronographs. Typical true airspeed is 115 knots with a fuel burn of 86 gph at 5,000 feet. Maximum endurance is more than 20 hours. Some described her as “breathlessly hot in the tropics and achingly cold in the Arctic,” and at once hated and loved her. In spite of her shortcomings, the rugged PBY rarely failed to bring her crew home despite all that the enemy or the weather could muster to bring her down.o90opl;’/;(The PBY was the first production airplane with wet wings and has remarkable range, 2,338 nm on a no-reserve fuel capacity of 1,750 gallons. In the war, Qantas Empire Airways operated “Double Sunrise Flights,” so-called for the obvious reason. These PBYs carried VIPs and mail nonstop between Perth, Australia, and Galle, Ceylon—3,592 nm that required 33 hours, a record for an airline flight using an airplane. Average flight time was 28 hours.)it was a unique and interesting design:(Above: Please click to get BIG images as we are going to use it next:)Its hull was made up by five watertight compartments separated by four main bulkheads each fitted with a water tight door. You can see in the illustration above these operations/doors pretty clearly. It really looks like a boat, and not a plane.Using the above illustration: the front compartment is for the bombardier who also serves as the bow gunner, only separated from the pilot’s compartment by a small curtain, so not truly a separate section.Then the cockpit then aft of the cockpit there is the first watertight door.The next aft compartment is the navigator/radio operater’s compartment with the navigator and navigational equipment on the port/left side/wall. (Navigators also controlled the heater, but most Cat’s didn't get heaters till very late in the war and the crews just had to dress for temps/conditions they would encounter from the freezing North Atlantic to the balmy South Pacific. The heater burned fuel from the main tanks and the fuel supply for it has t be turned on by a value controlled by the flight engineer’s station.)Then on the starboard/right side is the radio operator and his station.Now next aft of this is the second watertight door is another compartment……above and a large compartment between the second and third door, and just forward of the big machine gun blisters. This is the APU compartment/bunks/galley. This is where the crew lived, (literally, as 15 hour and longer missions were common, flying out of hidden remote bases, with minimal supplies, and could, like other seaplanes, operate for extended periods without ever touching land by using seaplane tenders…(Above: PBM 5 Martin Mariner being hoisted by a large seaplane tender, 1945.)(Above:(Above: But back to the compartment, there are three bunks and a on the starboard side a small galley,(just a pair of hot plates with two settings, but giving some real food preparation, a real luxury in a warplane at this time.) Just aft by.few inches is the APU, auxiliary power unit, a small piston engine that powered a very useful electrical generator, esp for mechanics to do do repair work inside and for the crew to use electrically without wearing down the bg batteries, to prep the Cat for a mission. The APU can also power a small bilge pump,( remember its a boat.)Aft fo the galley/bunks/APU is the big viewing blisters where guns were often located. British Cats had dual .303s…and US PBY’s had a single .50 mounted on each side…The final compartment is the tunnel/tail gunner’s compartment with a single .30.(Above: Tail/tunnel gun.)Space for storage was in this area, too, but not too much weight for balance reasons.Now the final compartment, the flight engineer (please go back to the big cutaway image) is perched above everybody else in a suspended seat literally underneath the wing in the center.As aircraft became more complicated back in the ‘20’s sometimes a flight mechanic was added to assist the pilots with the engines and other systems, and soon the flight engineer, FE, was added. An FE was like a ship’s engineer, and was common by the the late ‘30’s on large complex aircraft and stayed till the early 2000’s. The FE did basically everything that was needed except fly the aircraft.The other crew positions were of course critical to the plane, (pilots/navigators) but the FE was the jack-of-all-trades and essential. At least two of the aft gunners were also mechanics, too, or at least well trained.The Cat also amazingly had three separate anti-icing systems for freezing conditions, allowing it to fly where other aircraft could not. It could dispense alcohol onto the props, exhaust heat onto/into the wings and heat the tail from a gasoline burning heater in the rear…Below: the exhaust heat in to the wings system, drawings:Different drawings of the same exhaust heating system for the PBYs wings, above and below:(Above: Details from the anti-icing duct)The non-amphibious PBYs could taxi up out of the water only after a ground crew had wadded in and attached some beaching gear, unpleasant in the arctic. So the much superior amphibious PBYs were created. These wheeled PBYs could taxi on runways or operate off remote sand beaches, giving them even more use. (I had a flight in the St.Paul CAF Squadron’s beautiful PBY, shortly before it was flipped in a wind storm and destroyed the wing in the late ‘80’s and with that big wing it took off in about 2 1/2 feet! Only thing I’ve ever been in that big that took off that quickly was the Ford Tri-Motor at Oshkosh.)They were fantastic search and rescue aircraft, (famously the USS Indianapolis,) particularly in the Pacific theater, air-sea rescue PBYs (called “Dumbos”) retrieved thousands of ditched pilots and shipwrecked seamen, often under fire and usually in seas that would have trashed a lesser boat.One Dumbo landed three times to pick up downed bomber crews and eventually took off with 25 extra men aboard; for that mission, Navy Lt. Nathan Gordon became the only PBY pilot to be awarded a Medal of Honor.Another Cat needed a three-mile takeoff run to lift a total of 63, including its own crew, and the pounding probably popped half the rivets in the hull. But the record goes to the Australian Catalina that carried 87 Dutch sailors — standing room only, thank you — after Japanese bombers mauled their freighter.(Above/below: art by Roumain Hugault.)With 15,000 pounds of passengers alone, to say nothing of the airplane’s fuel and crew weight, that put the RAAF PBY well over gross, but the Cat’s basic weight-and-balance rule was that if the payload hadn’t yet sunk the boat, it would somehow take off.(“…But the bumblebee doesn’t know it can’t fly…”It did so well it was used during the war and after by many nations, and stayed in US Navy reserve service till 1957 and with the Brazilian airforce till 1982. It far outlasted its own replacement, the Consolidated Coronado…(Above: Compare the older PBY to this spanking brand new Coronado…and you would imagine the newer, bigger fancier design would be far superior…it’s bigger, faster, can carry far more weight, four engines for better reliability in ling missions…but the PBY was more successful. Almost ALL Coronados were scraped in 1946. The older Cat had a longer range and could stay aloft far longer, a huge factor on search and rescue. But the main issue was cost. (Amateur historians always focus on guns! speed! manoeuvrability! Etc, where the professionals look at cost, repairs, spare parts, ease of maintenance, etc.)You could buy three Cats for a single Coronado, that can stay out longer and go further.The PBY was a great aircraft with great tactics, and the Cat was at war even before the US arrived: a British Cat flown by a US Naval officer spotted the Bismarck which led to an attack by Swordfish that ultimately led to its sinking.When Pearl was attacked the Cats had been in service since 1937 and the Japanese, esp. from Yamamoto’s knowledge, understood their great threat, and even keyed on them during the attack. Of the 81 PBYs before the attack, only 8 survived…Of those 7 had been airborne and escaped, the 8th was able to take off and escape. This was a high priority target. A few hours before the attack, a PBY spotted a Japanese mini-sub, attacked her and helped the destroyer USS Ward to find and sink it. So a Cat was in the 1st action between the US and Japan.PBYs suffered terribly in the Japanese fighter attacks in the Philippines but on Dec 10th a nose gunner in a PBY shot down a Japanese fighter, the 1st air-to-air kill against a Japanese fighter, at least a certified Navy kill.In the first months the Cat crews learned to stay in the clouds and fly at night, hiding, and set up remote bases in the middle of nowhere using seaplane tenders.On Dec 27th 1941, the first US raid was launched, 3 weeks after Pearl Harbor, and the PBY was the aircraft chosen. They went in alone as the range was too great for any escort. There is little info about this raid and at this early point the US hadn't learned yet how to use the PBY offensively…but they would.The 6 PBYs attacked Japanese ships at Jolo Island SW of the Philippines. Lacking offensive experience they attacked at 10–12,000 feet, standard doctrine at the time, but way too high. They had Norden bombsights, but worthless at that high altitude. 2 PBYs actually “dive bombed” the Japanese and almost got two close hits. 4 were shot down, but they learned much.At Midway the Cats found the Japanese on June 3d the day before, a tremendous advantage that very likely gave the US a big help to win the battle. A PBY attacked a Japanese oiler, the ‘Akabono Maru’ at night and scored a torpedo hit on her, damaging her, the only American torpedo hit in the entire battle.The PBYs crews started darkening their planes with soot, (eventually black paint when it was finally delivered,) and attacking at night, with flame arresters around the exhaust, and called themselves the Black Cats. In the Guadalcanal campaign they went after Japanese supply ships, running down the Slot, (“The Tokyo Express,”) hitting them at night at low level with bombs and machine guns. The Japanese, facing significant losses, switched to hauling supplies in by war ships, mostly destroyers, but they couldn't carry near as much and used up too much of the Japanese’s precious fuel and it wasn't economical. So they switched again to small boats and barges that were vulnerable to the PBY’s and other aircrafts, strafing attacks.PBYs and PT Boats were both operating from remote and secret bases around Guadalcanal, both supplied by seaplane tenders and were very hard to find/stop. One month alone the Navy reported the Black Cats sunk 41,000 tons and damaged another 43,000 tons…aprox. 12 ships sunk, 12 ships heavily damaged.One PBY Black Cat squadron, VP11, was credited in a month with 100,000 tons sunk and damaging a further 100,000. And there were 14 Black Cat squadrons, total.PBYs attacked enemy subs across the globe, sinking at least 38 German U Boats……directed naval gunfire, rescued downed aviators and sailors, flew tens of thousands of recon missions, staffed, bombed, torpedoed,…versatility is the key to a top aircraft, and the old, low, slow Catalina surprised everyone at her capabilities.(Above: PBY dropping depth charges.)General characteristicsPerformanceArmamentThe PBY was a war-winning aircraft and mostly unsung.(Above: Only one prototype PBY-5T(Twin) Catalina was built and flown in 1944.

The experienced ones knew to keep their head swiveling, their plane jinking as well as looking for targets and keeping track of their wingmen as well as knowing not to fire for a second or more so the gunsight could lock onto an opposing fighter.Most air to air combat over Europe involved bombers, with gunners getting in each other’s way in the freezing cold with a 160+ MPH wind blowing against them. They didn’t wear flak jackets when fighters were around because the metal plates in the jacket would set off the cannon shell and turn their bodies into a red mist while they at least had a chance if the shell passed through their body.If a pilot survived a crippled aircraft and were able to bail out you might be greeted with a cup of tea or coffee or a pitchfork and a noose depending on which country they were flying over.","1,709 followers",Niklas Kager Kofler,688,305,8.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/During-WWII-what-methods-did-the-Allies-use-to-get-hundreds-of-bombers-into-formation-above-their-home-bases-without-chaos-or-collisions-Seems-like-a-harder-problem-than-modern-air-traffic-control-and-with-less-advanced-technology

7,"Probably the most feared allied warplane was the British De Havilland Mosquito fighter bomber. Toward the end of the war, the German night fighter pilots began suffering from a bad case of what they called “Moskitoschreck” or “Mosquito terror” as the British Mosquitoes began sneaking up on them from behind as they were sneaking up on the British bombers. The Mosquitoes shot down several hundred German night fighters (278 total), in addition to which a number of German fighters crashed while making emergency landings to avoid Mosquitoes (real or imagined).

Toward the end of the war, the German night fighter pilots began suffering from a bad case of what they called “Moskitoschreck” or “Mosquito terror” as the British Mosquitoes began sneaking up on them from behind as they were sneaking up on the British bombers. The Mosquitoes shot down several hundred German night fighters (278 total), in addition to which a number of German fighters crashed while making emergency landings to avoid Mosquitoes (real or imagined). Just a rumor that there were Mosquitoes around was enough to make the German pilots want to land as fast as possible.In addition to being much faster than the German night fighters due to their twin Rolls Merlin engines, the Mosquitoes carried four machine guns in their nose and four cannons in their fuselage. They were fitted with a device called Serrate which allowed them to detect night fighters by the night fighters radar emissions, as well as another device called Perfectos which allowed them to detect night fighters by emissions from their IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) systems. This meant the German night fighters didn’t have much of a chance.But actually, the Mosquito was originally designed as an unarmed, fast, light bomber. It had the unusual characteristic that it was built out of wood, but despite that was faster than any of the German fighters except the jets. The British would have cancelled it at the start of the war, except that it could be built in woodworking factories and thus not affect aluminum aircraft production. It was called the “Wooden Wonder” or “Timber Terror” by affectionate pilots.For the most part, as a light bomber it was used to fly above or below German anti-aircraft defenses and simply outrun German fighters. By the time the German interceptors reached their altitude, the Mosquitoes had already dropped their bomb load and were on their way home. It was estimated that during a raid a Mosquito could fly to Germany, drop a 4000 pound bomb, go back to Britain, refuel, fly back to Germany, drop another 4000 pound bomb, and get back to Britain before the last of the heavy bombers got home.The British used to send them in ahead of the heavy bombers as pathfinders to drop incendiary bombs to mark the targets, and follow the heavy bombers with Mosquitoes to kill the German night fighters. The loss rate was very low (0.7% chance of being shot down vs 2.2% for the heavy bombers). The Mosquitoes dropped twice as much tonnage of explosives as the heavy bombers per aircraft lost - and it only had a two-man crew versus a seven-man crew for the heavy bombers.It was also used in surprise raids on German targets. After Mosquitoes bombed the main radio station in Berlin in a carefully timed raid during one of his speeches, Goring remarked that it was unfair that, while his air force was short of aluminum to build planes, every piano factory in Britain was building Mosquitoes.Over Britain, they also shot down 486 V-1 flying bombs, since they were among the few aircraft fast enough to catch it.The above is a Mosquito “Tsetse” equipped with a 57 mm anti-submarine gun mounted under the nose. It was capable of blowing a hole through both sides of a German U-boat if it caught it on the surface. That was more than enough to sink a U-boat.","29,949 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,916,7.7K,249.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/During-WWII-what-methods-did-the-Allies-use-to-get-hundreds-of-bombers-into-formation-above-their-home-bases-without-chaos-or-collisions-Seems-like-a-harder-problem-than-modern-air-traffic-control-and-with-less-advanced-technology

But if you cite the example of British made Rail and Road bridges over river with lime mortar or concrete, that lasted more than 100 years, then certainly we have to look back to lime.Britishers must have preserved the lime technology - they preserve every fact very carefully with all protection even thousand years old,but will not publish unless required. However as far as our knowledge goes, those slaked lime were used with some type of natural gums as admixtures from Tamarind, Bel Fruit, Molasses etc. The degree of slaking, amount of admixtures, curing time (much more than cement, even upto 6 months) are not known to us, neither we have preserved it nor developed it,after invention of cement.Cement achieves a specified strength after a fixed time curing just by adding water - a property with which an engineer can design every structure with confidence, can never happen with lime. So the use of lime in mortar or concrete has been completely abolished.The resistance of lime mortar with stone masonry to the atmosphere, during earth qake, urge the engineers and scientists to rethink of using lime. But due to many quality control criteria in using lime as described above, single use of lime is not user-friendly at present condition. Now it is well established that lime yeild without crumbling.So the best mortar mix is - cement:lime:sand in diff. percentage for diff. type of work.Refer ASTM standard specification for mortar.But problem lies-you can not blend lime with cement at your home due to unknown particle size, degree of slaking, uniformity in blending. In advanced countries,cement preblended with lime or semi hydrated lime in powder form is available to be readily mix with cement - home blending is dangerous--for which it is avoided in our condition.",251 followers,Smith Jacobson,5.9K,1.2K,2.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/During-WWII-what-methods-did-the-Allies-use-to-get-hundreds-of-bombers-into-formation-above-their-home-bases-without-chaos-or-collisions-Seems-like-a-harder-problem-than-modern-air-traffic-control-and-with-less-advanced-technology

Thousands of farms are facing dire hardship or worse, hundreds of lobster boats are tying up for the last time, Jack Daniels is rolling over in his grave and Boeing workers wonder how secure their jobs are.And China has just begun to fight.

15,"No, Frank and Alex. The ‘Trade War’ is an overblown term for the tariffs introduced by President Trump. The US accounts for 14% or so of Chinese exports. Many of these are difficult to replace - the rare-earth metals that go into modern batteries are a good example, but other large exports are intermediate goods that are used in US manufacturing, small bits and pieces that go into cars for example and their sales levels will not fall in the short term.

They have bought his story that their problems are the fault of various people not like them (East Coast intelligencia, Chinese, Immigrants etc) and he is Doing Something About It.It has shown even the most brown-nosed of the US allies that the US is quite capable of shitting on them whenever the whimsy takes the President. I do not know the consequence of this but a rapid re-organsiation of European defence (very belatedly) is at least one.Meanwhile the US continues its sad decline due to:All this amounts to wasting more than one dollar in five spent in the US on non-productive or counter-productive stuff (that is 20% of the population working non-productively) and the US government is no more capable of addressing these than it is of reforming gun law, sought by over 80% of the US population.
