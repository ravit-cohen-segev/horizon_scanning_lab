I have worked in technology startups primarily around Blockchain etc. Here, however, it can be said, is where I have been privileged to have been exposed to various research experts etc. Especially in fields of --; but, especially not just specific to both: bits and atoms. In the words of of Peter Thiel, who said, “we've seen innovation in the world of bits, but not in the world of atoms.""That said, however, as we move towards all the research I have done on the Deep Learning technology we have presently. It would appear as though achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) would seem to be not really in our near to distant future. To begin: why are neural networks not considered fit for natural language understanding? That is because natural language emerges via three structurally unique Organic neural networks.• sensory input• white matter• contextual evaluation• grey matter• muscle orchestration• white matterAs a consequence; if artificial intelligence could make decisions and conclusions based on correct data, should we follow the guidance?What isSo, grey matter access to white matter, Telemetry also known as:• when preexisting habits become inappropriate unsafe or counterproductive.• when jargon creates an important context within which the presumptions of the user/worker/student prunes and grafts existing behaviors onto the new experiences effectively.• new jargon can be polymorphic in that it might also serve as a caution to others who are indifferent to the changes.Moreover, as evidenced -- no actual science can violate cause and effect. To the extent and scope of a given technology, yet to be, and deemed needed. In essence, this would demonstrate that, any given science experiment is infact a machine. Consequently, it can be observed that; once someone in possession of some form of a simple machine: then they can extrapolate novel attributes, and conditions. In essence, any given science experiment is a machine.Consequently, what people observe and assume to be Artificial Intelligence (AI) as is being portrayed and consumed generally and loosely. When we observe what may appear to be displayed as human-like robots; or holograms in fictional representations; that are talking and acting like real people. And are having human-level or even superhuman intelligence and capabilities. This should and is referred to what is called the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and it does NOT exist anywhere that we at this point in our human existence know of. However, what we actually have for AI today can be considered as way simpler and alot more confined within the the area of research development called Deep Learning (DL).As a matter of fact, based on the empirical research evidence available in these specific parameters and subsets of Deep learning. It can be safely stated that only the findings produce evidence that it can really achieve some very basic but specific tasks. Which may be better than some people. However, within the Deep Learning (DL)research they currently are constrained by fundamental limitations -- that are also heavily impeding those very next but important steps towards becoming AGI. Now, what this means is if that the aim is to acheive AGI. Then there must be serious innovations happening globally from the best individuals and institutions. Who are striving to come up with progressively more dynamic networks and more proficient and efficient methodologies; geered at shaping them into some version similar to an artificial human brain.Having said that, however, most deep learning methods just find a statistical fit of a model to data. DNNs find a narrow fit of output data to input data that does not usually extrapolate outside the training data set, and may learn incorrect features to identify objects with that do not work for novel inputsFurthermore, with today's machin learning (ML) and deep learning, the problem is that, there is no true perception, memory, prediction, cognition, or complex planning involved. There is no actual intelligence in today's AI. So, until someone can explain how we create synthesised intelligence I wouldn't be sure how we observe empirically; how exactly we are able to merge with them. Computers cannot do this, they just don’t have the plasticity or the capacity. Human beings are the most complex constructs in the known universe. We will have some profound and spectacular technology over the next five hundred to a thousand years. Basic computer architecture hasn’t changed in 75 years.Below I will attach an answer by one of the best and most significantly thorough research scientists in the field of AGI. His answer will also cover all aspects of your question.Here is an answer by Brent Oster:Answer to Why is artificial intelligence a hype? by Brent Oster","284,852 followers",James Altucher,992,878,91.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-understand-the-great-question-mark-of-technology-which-is-the-emergence-of-general-artificial-intelligence

At what point does it make a difference to you, for better or worse, is the question to ask.","8,707 followers",Mario Galindo Queralt,529,637,8.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-understand-the-great-question-mark-of-technology-which-is-the-emergence-of-general-artificial-intelligence

3,"Good question,But I think you have a total misunderstanding of technology as well as artificial intelligence “AI”, or “general artificial intelligeince” or GAI or whatever people dream up in terms of the “ultimate” in artifical machine. An artifical manSuch a machine are things which according to the nonsense and hype spouted by every man and his dog, would wipe out humans, as we are not as strong or as clever as such machines that could exist like “Skynet” or the “Terminator” or both? Lets also think of the various SCIFI movies which depict armies of robots killing off man. Maybe self drivingGood question,But I think you have a total misunderstanding of technology as well as artificial intelligence “AI”, or “general artificial intelligeince” or GAI or whatever people dream up in terms of the “ultimate” in artifical machine. An artifical manSuch a machine are things which according to the nonsense and hype spouted by every man and his dog, would wipe out humans, as we are not as strong or as clever as such machines that could exist like “Skynet” or the “Terminator” or both? Lets also think of the various SCIFI movies which depict armies of robots killing off man. Maybe self driving cars would suddenyl be woken up and morph into conscious objects and then decide to sacrifice themselves and killing off humans by deliberately causing accidents ? There ar emovies where cars are possessed by demons or the devil and kill humans, any difference ?I find it interesting that even the scifi writers who have the poetic freedom to dream up any scenario they like, moslty depict “the fact” that such machines or GAI thingys need to evolve, improve, and in some cases loose to man, or have to resort to time travel to survive…..Possibly it all come down symantics and defintion, but if we stick to the “correct” or most generally accepted defintions as used by experts in these fields of science and technology, and not the hyped up nonsense spouted by most people including the press trying to improve their sales by sowing fear and discord amongast the masses, , AI is nothing more than a specific set of numerical algorithms applied to data. Thats it ! Computer algorithms, ie computer programs written for different types of computing devices, which typically are connected to various machines, which include planes, cars, fridges, petrochemical plants, power stations, toys, cell phones, HIFI, etc. They all power down once their batteries empty or the plug is pulled.What I as an engineer also find ludcious about robots, is that robotics in its current form, need to use methods of “control”, and “optimisation”, sub-branches of science, maths and engineering to actually work. They need motors, gears, pieces of plastic and steel, as well as sensors, such cameras, thermocouples, pressure and flow meters,Whats GAI ? Well I for one, as electronic engineer, involved with AI for nearly fourty years, and deploying them/it she/he ?? in the real world, is not sure at this stage but it could involve the possible existance of something akin to software or AI algorithms that can think like a human, possibly have human-like consciousness. Does it exist now ? Nope. Could it possibly exist sometime in the future? Not 100% sure, it is possible, but I cannot predict the future. But IMHO opinion, will not exist in my life time, probably never. But nobody can predict the future.Note I say something “akin” to software, running in something “similar” to a computer, but not necessarily actual software or hardware that we use today. Software and hardware exisitng today does not come even close to doing to what humans do. I say humans as a whole, and not necessarily just the brain, or other aspects of the he human being such as consciousnes. Our abilities are not necessarily only in the brain, but comprise of the whole human body, plus other possible aspects of existence which make up our ability to think, create, love, hate etc. I am of the strong belief that there aspects to existence which are not known and understood. Even if we take into account the latest in physics, or quantum physics, quantum-biology, etc, there too much not known, and even the “artificial” theorectical abilities of maths canot explain stuff.Whats technology ? Everything that exists as tools for us humans to use. Does it have a big question mark ? IMHO No, but then how do you define define the “question mark” of technology. Are you referring to the future of technology, or its use or abuse now, in the past and possibly in the future ? Not sure what you mean.But coming back to “technology”, to me a paper-clip, hammer, screw driver, vaccines, cocaine, plough, sword or atomic bomb , are all examples of technology. So what is this big question mark ? Is it the abuse of technology, for example like biology and bio-engineering which can be used to cure a disease, but all kill millions as a biological weapon ? Is it the so-called, point in time after which AI creates itself, becoming like God ? Is that how you define God, is that your belief?>Steel, can be forged into spoons, forks and knives. Knives can be used to cut food, or kill a person. Software can be used for good, or bad. For example, satellite images can be used to identify forest fires and where to put them out, and save lives and protect property. They can also be used to identify military targets, and help missiles take them out.So again, there is not absoluate answer, defintions need to be made, and in the end it all comes down to your belief and perceptions of reality.","20,170 followers",Sriraman Madhavan,4.1K,186,7.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-understand-the-great-question-mark-of-technology-which-is-the-emergence-of-general-artificial-intelligence

What could you or others do that might make this new person not care about becoming or remaining a functioning member of society? What is the worst that can happen?

How will you choose to interact with this new kind of creature? Will you try the “not fully human, therefore…” line of thinking? If so, expect the worst, which will probably be pretty bad. What should you do instead? Think about the new person you and your significant other created. What should you do, and hope others do, with respect to that being?
