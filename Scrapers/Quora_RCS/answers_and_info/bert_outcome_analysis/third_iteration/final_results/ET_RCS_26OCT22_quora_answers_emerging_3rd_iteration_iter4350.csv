5,"Absent a solid proof of impossibility, it’s kind of silly to say that any technological advance is “impossible”. “Forever” is a long time, as is “at some point”.On the other hand, absent an actual demonstration of success, it’s kind of silly to be “convinced” that something is possible, at least by a certain route with a certain kind of technology.

Maybe you think you can see a path, and can’t see where any really major obstacles might be hiding, but appearance can be deceptive.Personally (as an AI researcher), I’m pretty confident that general, if not totally human, levels of AI will be reached in the next couple of decades. I think I can see a path to that. But it’s not completely via Machine Learning/Deep Learning — we’re going to need some symbolic knowledge and reasoning as an important part of the package, and I personally can’t see how that will fall out of Deep Learning as currently conceived. But I can’t discount the possibility that someone smarter than I am might find a solution of this type.Edit:This was in 1969 or so… Everyone was optimistic in those days, and progress felt like it was moving really fast, and perhaps growing exponentially.I was one of the optimists, though I think I could see more clearly than most that exciting results on a few expert-level tasks was not really getting us closer to human-like common-sense reasoning and everyday planning. So I worked on those common-sense things and made some progress there.The world then was very different. Everyone at the MIT AI Lab was excited about the arrival of the “Moby Memory” — a big, expensive box that contained as much core memory as the PDP-6 machine could address directly — that is, 256K 36-bit words, or a bit more than a megabyte. FINALLY we would be free from the frustrating limits on memory capacity that had been holding us back for so long. Finally, we could go after more general — maybe even human-level — problems.Ooops! Turns out, general AI was harder than we thought, even with that almost unimaginable jump in computational resources. It would take a dozen more giant leaps in computing power to reach where we are today. And once we cleared away the immediate, visible obstacles on the intellectual side, there were many more layers to deal with.So, if your point is that I have a long track record of being too optimistic about AI progress, “Guilty as charged.” Feel free to take my prediction above with a very large grain of salt.In addition to all these layers of difficulty, funding has been a big problem for the progress of AI. People making technical predictions, including me, tend to make the unstated assumption of aThat kind of funding was present in the early part of my AI career, but it has not been available since then — at least, not in the areas of AI that I believe are most important for progress toward general, human-like AI. That has cost me a lot of wasted time and distraction, and the same is true for many other researchers working in similar areas.Right now there seems to be plenty of money for AI, but only in deep learning and certain application areas. But it’s mostly “Gold Rush” money, focused on making as much money as fast as possible, and/or tweaking the “State of the Art” by another 1%, instead of trying to get to the heart of the monster.Now I’m retired and can work on what I think is most important for a change — though, sadly, without money to support any grad students. I just turned 70, so now it’s a bit of a race…",36 followers,Adam Ambrozy,579,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/With-the-field-of-AI-booming-how-possible-is-it-to-become-very-wealthy-getting-a-PhD-in-AI-and-creating-selling-some-revolutionary-AI-technology

Apparently (we’re not mathematicians here), when applied to lens design, the formula completely eliminates the problem of spherical aberration, resulting in a lens system that’s as sharp at the edges as it is in the centre.The solution has far-reaching consequences that will impact not just how photographers shoot, but also astronomy, microscopy, the design of lasers, and just about anything that involves lenses.Let's wait till we see this revolutionary technology ultimately arrive in the markets.Next time anyone says maths is useless, show them this!Thank YouSource : 1.2.3.4.",2 followers,Pratim Das,1.2K,208,3.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-modern-technology-has-turned-out-to-be-a-lot-less-useful-or-revolutionary-than-people-initially-thought-it-would-be

To torment you, your evil captor forces you to take a series f steps to the left and right.

You might try alternating right and left steps, but here’s the catch: You have to list your planned steps ahead of time, and your captor might have you take every second step on your list (starting at the second step), or every third step (starting at the third), or some other skip-counting sequence.

I actually don’t even know what I should guess: Although there are infinitely many primes, they get rarer and rarer as we go up the number line (because, the higher a number, the more there are smaller numbers than that number which could be potential factors). So chances get smaller for large primes to be a twin prime. But recent development in mathematics goes into the direction of proving that there actually are infinitely many twin primes.To explain why we came closer to solving this problem recently, let me ask a few similar questions.Are there infinitely many “3-away”-primes, i.e. primes that are 3 less or 3 more than another prime?This question is easy to answer, it’s no: If two primes are 3 away from each other, one of them must necessarily be even, and the other one is odd. But there’s only one even prime: 2. So the only “3-away” primes are 2 and 5.Are there infinitely many “4-away”-primes (like 13 and 17)? Nobody knows.Are there infinitely many “5-away”-primes? No, it’s the same argument as in the 3-away case, and actually this applies to any odd number. If n is an odd number, then there is at most one pair of “n-away” primes.Are there infinitely many “6-away”-primes? Again, nobody knows.So, does there exist an even number n, such that there are infinitely many “n-away”-primes?This is what has been proven in 2013, by a then unknown mathematician called Yitang Zhang. And the answer is yes. There is an even number n, which is smaller than 70.000.000 (we don’t know which one, though), such that there are infinitely many “n-away”-primes.You might think that this is not that big an achievement, since 70.000.000 is a pretty big number. But it is a huge achievement. Before 2013, for all we’ve known, distances of large primes could tend towards infinity. And now we know that there is some kind of bound in the sense that, if you give me an arbitrarily large number (like a zillion, or even a zillion zillions, or a zillion to the power of a zillion), there are two primes larger than that number that are closer than 70.000.000. And 70.000.000 is a heck of a lot smaller than infinity.And, since then, this bound has been improved: We’ve gone down from 70.000.000 to 246, i.e. we know now that there is an even number n smaller than 246, such that there are infinitely many “n-away”-primes. When this bound is down to 2, we will have proven that there are infinitely many twin primes.Most of this answer is taken from this video:","114,094 followers",Alon Amit,857,7.5K,119.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-unsolved-math-problems-are-solved-by-great-mathematicians

When I played Star Trek: Elite Force 1 and 2, I couldn't help but notice there were no major player choices in the first, but there was in the second. If there had been a third, they'd have had to assume you're choice. Take Deus Ex and Deus Ex: Invisible War. In DEIW the world is in a state of collapse due to the actions of the main character in DE. In DEIW there were some assumptions established in game about how that came to be, yet in DE, there are a few endgame choices, all with varying consequences.Mass Effect changed the game. Bioware gave players the option to import your character to the sequel. ME to ME2 to ME3. If you let Kaiden die to save Ash then guess what, Kaiden’s still dead next game.

I saw the toll it took on him/her having to carry the weight of not only humanity but all sentient species of the galaxy.All to end a threat that is responsible for wiping out all life in the galaxy countless times over.One thing I took away from the series is that no matter how futile or painful it is to fight for what is right, we must never stop.
