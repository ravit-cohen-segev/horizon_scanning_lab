By the time I got to my office I usually had 25 voice mails to return.In order to respond to specific questions for each loan in process, I had to pull the file open so I could respond accurately (and often had to make other phone calls before I could respond to a specific question).",2 followers,Steven Burton,1.1K,720,14.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-biggest-communication-issues-in-the-real-estate-industry

Before you got married you have 24 hours in a day to do everything; go to work, get back home, have some rest and go to sleep and any other and when you got married no time is added to your 24 hours it's still the same.So making excuses like I don't have time, I am so busy will not lead you anywhere because no one is going to add anytime to the 24-hours we all have. You just have to adjust your time and make time to make your relationship work. Otherwise if your marriage break down you are not going to find peace or joy in all the things you are busy doing now. You're going to realise those are not the things that really makes you happy and makes your life better. So find the things that she is interested in and talk about it if there is any problem you can ignore it for a moment talk about happy moment and I things she likes the most.For better results you can as well see a counselor to address issues that are pushing threat to your marriage and see how best to make your marriage better.

He also doesn’t know what Julia wants him to do. Julia has big feelings and is in pain. Is that about right so far?”Jeff started with a shrug that turned into a nod. Julia looked up, made eye contact, and nodded too.I said “OK, now we have somewhere to start. Let’s try this: Julia, Jeff is doing things you don’t want him to do, and not doing things you want him to do. I don’t care how small the things are, lets just make a list. I’ll write them down.”Julia, after a few false starts, and some more tears, put together a list of ways she felt emotionally abandoned, rejected by Jeff, though she didn’t use those words. I summarized. Jeff seemed to pay attention, but looked even sadder.Taking another chance, I summarized how I imagined Jeff was feeling most of the time — tired, run down, irritable, overwhelmed, like a failure, etc., and watched carefully how he reacted.Julia looked shocked. At that moment I was pretty sure we were on the right track. I used the words “clinical depression,” and they seemed to realize it was something Jeff had — a disorder, an illness, something that could get better.Long story short, Julia got it, fairly quickly. The distance and lack of connection wasn’t about her. In fact, she could help with her understanding and support.Even longer story, Jeff saw our psychiatrist, got a self-care program that took advantage of his “I always do what I say I’ll do” attitude, and I think some medication too. Julia was fully on board. She went to the psychiatrist sessions and made sure Jeff did what the doctor said.I think I met with them as a couple for about 10–12 sessions. Jeff continued with the psychiatrist monthly for about a year.Jeff was never 100% into the psychotherapy, never got fully comfortable talking about his feelings, but it was enough.He and Julia got great results.
