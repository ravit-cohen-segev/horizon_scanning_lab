As Robert Wright argues in the amazing book,Most of the massive changes driving human history have been communications revolutions. I mean this in the sense that they enable more and more brains to be in close proximity to one another -- creating, spreading and iterating ideas/technologies more rapidly than was previously imaginable.There are a few major communications revolutions in human history that qualify.The development of languageSo what will be the next?  Well, if you buy the argument that the big revolutions are those that bring more and more brains into proximity of each other, then the next big change will be the merging of the internet with our brains.Right now, the main things keeping our brains from being literally connected to the internet areBut things change.My guess is that the technology that enables our brains to communicate with the internet will start with the treatment of major neurological disabilities.The therapeutic use cases could very easily evolve into enhancement. Human enhancement of this nature raises a massive host of ethical issues.But again, things change.I don't know if this will lead to the Singularity that people like Ray Kurzweil talk about. But barring some civilizational collapse or some major international agreement never to go there, the merging of biology and internet technology seems almost inevitable.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,17K,996,156M,2010,https://www.quora.com/Prediction-What-will-be-the-most-revolutionary-technology-to-emerge-in-the-next-20-years

The electronic wristwatch needs only a display to be feasible today. But the biggest potential lies in the production of large systems. In telephone communications, integrated circuits in digital filters will separate channels on multiplex equipment. Integrated circuits will also switch telephone circuits and perform data processing.This came from Intel, not from Apple, Samsung, Google or nVidia. Those companies didn’t even exist when Gordon Moore wrote this.Intel was the first company to develop a microprocessor(4004).Intel was the company whose processor was used in PCs which conquered our homes.Intel is the company whose processors are used in most of our laptop computers.Intel is the company that proved that you can make very high-performance processors without breaking binary compatibility, while most of the other companies had given up trying to improve the performance of on their old instruction sets.Intel was the company that has made huge innovations on chip manufacturing technologies. ForIntels CPUs are used in most of the servers which run the “revolutionary” services of Google.Intels CPUs are used in those Apple laptopsAnd now Intel and Micron are going to change our memory system by bringing another level of memory between our SSD drives and DRAM memory, which allows a very fast access to memory which can be used as a storage. This is already in the market with the names “Optane” and “Xpoint” but it has not yet broken through, and operating systems do not yet take good advantage of it. When properly used by the operating systems, this could practically eliminate program startup times, and allow using much smaller amount of DRAM, which could then be made faster.","9,989 followers",Brett Bergan,890,7K,83.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Prediction-What-will-be-the-most-revolutionary-technology-to-emerge-in-the-next-20-years
6,"Intel is more or less responsible for the modern computer processor. Up until about ten years ago, they were at the absolute cutting edge of processing.Then they got complacent.

The AMD 3970X hit an overclock of 5.72ghz across all 32 cores under liquid nitrogen cooling. Even without liquid nitrogen, the 3970X should be able to hit at least 4.8ghz on most cores, if not all.Intel now has very serious competition. The question is exactly what they’ve been doing for the last decade. Intel has so far been incapable of going under 14nm. AMD is allegedly already working on 4nm.Intel has failed to innovate recently because it hasn’t had to. Now we’ll have to see if they are even capable of innovating in 2019.","36,848 followers",Sylvain Saurel,3.2K,6.2K,265.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Prediction-What-will-be-the-most-revolutionary-technology-to-emerge-in-the-next-20-years

8,"Intel is, perhaps, a bit like Apple. They now seem like a one trick pony. Microprocessors are their business today.It sounds like old news and we like to root for AMD to take away some of Intel’s business. But for all practical purposes Intel invented the microprocessor in 1971 and have been refining and improving ever since.They have been deep inside the PC and have had much to do with the PC architecture. They have invented the necessary process technology to build their microprocessor.In fact, Intel guys invented most of the industry.

Look up the Intel founders and you will find the guys who invented the basic process that the industry has used for 60+ years (the planar process) along with the guys who invented rewriteable non volatile memory and a number of other key pieces of the semiconductor industry.Everybody writes down the big 5 tech companies today, Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft, but there really should be 6 and that 6th would be Intel. None of the 5 would exist if the PC didn’t exist and the PC would not exist without Intel.So the premise of your question is wrong. Intel is more important than anybody on your list and has done more important innovating that all of them.

Remember USB? That was Intel.Intel also frequently drives desktop motherboard standards.I’m not as sure what they have been up to recently, mostly I have been assuming a lot of “swing and miss” type things, but they may have some slow burn successes actually out there percolating. (It also could be that because I am not, nor have I ever been fond of Intel that I’m not lying a lot of attention and they have done some obvious important stuff recently that I haven’t been paying attention to)I think failure to view Intel as innovative stems both from it not having appears to do a lot recently","21,773 followers",Glyn Williams,3K,9.1K,53.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Prediction-What-will-be-the-most-revolutionary-technology-to-emerge-in-the-next-20-years
10,"It is hard to actually understand this question as Intel has been continuously innovating since inception.

The very process for producing these chipsets was in most part pioneered by Intel who have created many other giant companies springing off of their innovations or production requirements. Do not confuse the fact that now others make microprocessors, or materials or production equipment as without the actions of Intel many of these firms would not exist.Not only are Intel chipsets the dominant in computing, but of course they are the basis in many ways of competing sets from those like AMD. And while Intel has not done so well in mobile, even those firms owe a lot to the innovations driven by Intel.Intel does not produce end consumer products, so perhaps they do not seem as immediate or “Sexy” as some of the other named firms, but they have surely caused many revolutions.
