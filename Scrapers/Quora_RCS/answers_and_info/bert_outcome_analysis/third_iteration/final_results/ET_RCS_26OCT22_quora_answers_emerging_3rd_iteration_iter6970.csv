Yesterday the multi-page websites were popular, today the trend for simplicity brought single-page apps back on the top, so I'll tell you a couple tips aboutProgressive Web ApplicationsThe world first heard about progressive web apps in 2015. The next year we met the pioneers of this technology, and in 2017 progressive Web Applications seem to have become the major competitor of native mobile apps.Progressive web appsOnline customer support2016 was the year of chatbots. 2018 will be the year of helpful chatbots. Since there are thousands of bots out now, the quality of their services will be the next web development trend.The prediction is that 85% of all customer interactions will proceed without human assistance till 2020.A customer service chatbot becomes a must on almost every website. Whether you are selling electronics, crocheted toys or software development services, you should have a chatbot.Static websitesYou definitely remember the concept of a static website from the early years of the World Wide Web. All the first websites on the Internet were static.But then the era of dynamic websites began.Websites became more functional and easier to update even for people with no technical background. At the same time, the development process became more complicated, as the extended functionality required communication with the server, so backend development got involved. Modern CMSs are the actual dynamic websitesNowadays, the web is returning to its roots. Static websites are becoming the web development trend of 2018 again.Single-page websitesAnother web development trend for simplicity is single-page websites. This solution allows putting all the content onto one long scrollable page, removing any clutter.One-page websites have a bunch of advantages. They don’t challenge the visitor with complex navigation, multi-level menu, and tons of text. The essential information is all on one page. The user only has to scroll to it.Of course, the use-cases of single-pagers are limited. This type of website will not suit e-commerce projects and blogs. At the same time, businesses can significantly benefit, presenting their services in a simplified and more engaging manner.Push notifications for websitesMobile apps notifications turned out to be a highly efficient means of user re-engagement. And recently this idea has been implemented for websites and is becoming new web development trend.The workflow looks quite simple: the user visits a website and is offered to enable push notifications. The user will then be notified of any changes on the website (like a new blog post or a private message), even after he has closed the tab with that website.The major benefit of such a technology is obvious - you can keep the user engaged without big efforts.Flash to HTMLIn 2010 Steve Jobs published hisThe major weakness of this technology is the incompatibility with mobile devices. An enormous amount of traffic is lost just because of the outdated technology.Motion UISimplicity is the trend in recent years. This is also true for web design. Users are already tired of crazy GIFs and flashing ads, that’s why websites with moderate design get more appreciation.At the same time, sophisticated motion UI is becoming more popular. Animations allow to add more style and enable you to distinguish your website from the thousands of others with the static UI.There are several ways to add some life to your minimalistic website. Consider page header transitions, nice hovers, animated charts, background animations and modular scrolling. These and many other elements may make your web presence much more enjoyable for users. The true artwork!JavaScript - Angular 2 and Angular 4JavaScript is the number one programming language for web applications. With dozens of JS-related technologies already existing and still in development, it will even strengthen its positions. The highly anticipated release of the last years Angular 2 becomes highly appreciated in modern web development.We met Angular 2 in 2016. It is a complete rewrite of the AngularJS framework. The main advantages are improved modularity, app architecture scalability,PHP 7.x - Laravel 5.xPHP remains the popular choice for website backend development. This programming language has improved its positions even further after the release of version 7.x. The latest update of the PHP framework Laravel 5.x is a recognized web development trend in 2018.Laravel is the most popular open-source PHP web framework. All the benefits of it can be fully experienced on dynamic websites with complicated backend.Laravel offers ready solutions for complex tasks. The variety of existing packages makes the development process faster and more reliable.

The technology giants like Google, Facebook, IBM, and Microsoft are developing powerful artificial technology to be used by the users.AI had already been started by a large number of applications, such as Google’s search algorithm. An easy access to some powerful AI tools, developers are likely to use AI in new and innovative ways in coming months.Virtual RealityVirtual reality is the future prospect of internet with which users have already started feeling in virtual environment using computer hardware and software. The gaming industry is using this trend comprehensively in web development process. The visual displays used in virtual reality allow the users to immerse in the virtual world and stop the sensory impressions coming from the real world.Google and Mozilla are making pioneering efforts on APIs with which virtual reality will transition to the web. In coming months, we will see more and more virtual reality in many applications.Static Website GeneratorsStatic website generation is increasingly becoming a significant part of web developer’s toolkit. These generators are very handy, as they create websites from plain text, usually stored in files rather than databases. They are benefiting the developers in terms of security, speed, ease of deployment, and handling of traffic.Today, the popular website generators in use are: Jekyll, Middleman, Roots, and Hugo. Many developers consider it as an interesting area to watch out for in the coming months.Rich TypographyIn 2016, developers showcased a number of creative uses for typography, and 2017 is only going to feature a much richer typography. The designers are putting more efforts in order for type to take up more space on the screen.It can be expected that they will come up with even more creative typefaces in order to keep up with this trend. The typography used in websites will have more contrasts by placing a variety of effects, images, and videos.More JavaScriptIn terms of using JavaScript, 2016 saw a significant change, and 2017 will only take it further. This evolution and growth in JavaScript are responsible for bringing up the language to chatbots, virtual reality, internet of things, and much more.

It is an industry-defining statement as web development keeps on changing. User expectations are evolving rapidly, and it is quite essential than ever before to create digital experiences which are more engaging, intuitive and fun.One of the key reasons for all these years of change and latest trends is that, in order to succeed, you need to play along with the current trends rather than ignoring them. You can easily do this by exploring the recent development and seeking ways to integrate these trends which apply to you, sooner than others.Mentioned below are the current trends in web development.1. Rise of ChatbotsIt has become quite important to be directly linked to customers. Chatbots, whether they are oral or written conversation software, allow the websites to be easily contacted at any time. They allow to continuously maintain customer service. The evolution of chatbots has provided with brilliant capabilities like answering the most common queries, redirecting the customer to information pages, and even assist them in completing a transaction.2. The emergence of Progressive Web AppsMobile phone usage has increased significantly with apps accounting to be the consuming prominent portion of the time spent on the smartphone. It would be logical that the use of a particular format which is similar to web application will be welcomed by the general users.3. Addition of Website NotificationsNotifications remain to be among the best tools for mobile applications. The ability to easily send information directly to any interested user is becoming popular in different areas, from providing sports scores to traffic info or even promotional sales.4. Introduction of One-Page WebsitesOne-page websites are composed of a very long page. In order to navigate through them, you simply need to scroll or just use links to easily go up or down the page to any desired section. Custom web development of one-page websites is on the rise.5. Growing Popularity of Static Websites.A static website is quite basic. Every page is simply encoded in the HTML, and it displays the static content to every visitor. These websites are quite secure. They load very quickly and are quite inexpensive to develop.6. User Interfaces in MotionInterfaces remained to be a major concern for developers for quite some time. Even the best designs are rendered pointless if the user isn’t able to easily find what he is actually looking for. They allow you to easily use animations or even transitions which show users different actions, or even important segments, along with giving life as well as a class into the projects.7. Material DesignIt is a popular and widely adopted design trend which is gaining much more popularity. It was duly developed by Google in a significant attempt to combine motion and visual material.8. Photo ContentThe importance of good photo has never lost its importance on the internet as a great photo can easily allow launch or even relaunch of a discussion. This particular concept isn’t new as quality photos are quite in demand to launch debates easily from the story reflected in the image. A unique photo which is full of individuality easily conveys the information to the users. Hire website designer who can easily include photo content to tell an exciting story.Over the years, web development has experienced a massive change.

In any case, the innovation acquired present-day developers and financial backers' consideration because of its capability to perform top-notch client experience near local application one.In 2019, 65% of internet shopping orders through the website were made with cell phones. PWA's rising website pattern makes it feasible for clients to see their number one websites on a versatile web program or work area and without downloading extraordinary applications or PC programs. PWAs in 2021 will be composed with HTML and CSS, JavaScript, React, or Angular. Other than incredible client experience and no requirement for programs, PWA could send message pop-ups and furnish clients with disconnected admittance to stored content.For whom these most recent website innovations might be significant? Online business, news stages, organizations with low advancement spending plans, and those who'd prefer to contact a greater crowd without losing it on the application downloading stage ought to be very mindful at this point. That is likewise evident that PWA can change cash calculations in App Store and Google Play Market world where paid applications should impart benefits to application aggregators.Artificial Intelligence and BotsWhat does the eventual fate of web advancement resemble? That is accepted by numerous that one year from now bots will turn out to be more self-learning and will handily coordinate with specific client's necessities and conduct. That implies that every minute of every day working bots will actually want to supplant support chiefs and save costs for some organizations.In the forthcoming decade, chatbots will stay the most well-known instruments to serve individuals and become a significant part of computerized advancement.Gigantic B2C organizations as of now utilize the innovation to serve their clients — official page chatbots inside Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Skype are genuine models. A bot could be likewise incorporated into PWA, normal website, expert or family gear, and any Internet-associated application created by a business organization.Bot's ascent will likewise impact patterns in web plan, particularly UX one. The huge progress of AI and AI innovation brought about interest for remote helper plans, which isn't just about visual experience, or item serving calculations, yet in addition about valuable sound plans.The main benefits of AI-based bots are all day, every day critical thinking potential, human-like insight, and profound customer conduct examination.Incomes from the man-made reasoning programming market worldwide from 2018 to 2025 (Statista)Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)Sped-up Mobile Pages (or AMP) is one more web advancement pattern. The possibility of it is to accelerate page execution and decline the danger of leaving it by a client. AMP innovation is somewhat like PWA. The thing that matters is that pages become sped up because of the open-source modules as of late created by Twitter and Google.AMPs are upgraded pages that could work quickly and have an improved but advantageous plan with just fundamental highlights contrasted with full-scope web items. Those pages are likewise versatile cordial and their substance is consistently decipherable.New patterns in web plan, for example, AMP improvement show that the Internet is turning out to be more client arranged. Despite the fact that we have 5G Internet innovation and most brands decide to create local applications to make any client experience better, the AMP module allows organizations to save costs on UX and arrive at clients with any Internet speed. Accordingly, we will see more modest and specialty items effectively rivaling colossal market pioneers.Single Page Application (SPA)These days, with rapid Internet norms, there is no should one be stuck on a methodology where each activity made on the page like snaps on different catches prompts one more web page downloaded from a worker.Single page application (or SPA) is one of the new website drifts that assists us with dodging consistent correspondence with the worker and show better page execution and give a high information insurance level.SPAs acquire their ubiquity because of the JavaScript system's rise. Working with them you block specific program occasions and solicitation JSON which resembles working with a web application. Google pages like Gmail, Google Drive, or Google Maps, just as person-to-person communication stages like Facebook, are of that sort. Current web patterns perception clarifies that in the future most practical websites will be developed as SPAs.Why developers of 2021 lean toward the SPA approach? SPAs have more opportunities to hold clients' consideration as they appear to be quick working — SPAs give clients moment criticism (contrasted with normal locales with their white screens before the page will be totally downloaded). Single-page destinations likewise burn-through less and could work without worker-side code by any means (API innovation).Voice Search OptimizationThe web improvement future is by all accounts not so much text but rather more voice and it's not just about virtual multifunctional home colleagues like Siri, Google Home, In 2021, the greater part of all brilliant and IoT gadgets will hear clients and execute orders given by voice. And surprisingly more — they will actually want to perceive the voices of various individuals and give customized AI-based insight to everybody.Voice search is only the main illustration of innovation that was executed over 10 years prior. In 2021, individuals would like to invest less energy composing orders as gadgets could comprehend them unmistakably. That is the reason most organizations are currently considering how to improve their physical and computerized items for voice search and voice orders. 55% of all families around the world are anticipated to have a voice right hand before the finish of 2022.The most recent in web advancement is voice-actuated self-standing gadgets and voice enhancement for normal web destinations and applications. Reinforce with AI, voice inquiry streamlining is useful for both end-clients and proprietors. To start with, it saves time and permits a client to arrange more (web-based shopping and administrations). Second, innovation is performing multiple tasks. Third, it acquires clients' additional unwaveringness as assists them to adapt to the schedule.

And the changes happen everywhere — politics, ecology, media and of course, software development.Here are the top 10 predictions about software development trends in 2020.Java is the number one choice for programmersSince its development in the mid-90s, Java has climbed the ranks of the world’s most popular programming languages and has been occupying the first place for years. The explanation is simple: “Write once, run everywhere”. Thanks to the high security, many large enterprises have adopted Java and such leading service providers as Google, Microsoft, Amazon support it for app development. Among such advantages as stability, extremely wide use in Android app development, automatic memory allocation and variety of open-source libraries, Java has one more benefit which is a high degree of platform independence thanks to the JVM feature. Many popular programming languages including Kotlin, Scala and Groovy use JVM as their runtime. Though, having no competitors in matters of stability and trust, Java is foreseen to continue ruling in 2020.Rust, Java, Kotlin, TypeScript take top positionsGoogle officially named Kotlin a “first-class” language for Android development and the amount of ‘Kotlin’ job postings has immediately grown, meaning that anyone who seeks for Android-related position should learn it.Another language that is attaining popularity is a superset of JavaScript — TypeScript. TypeScript is an object-oriented language, prone to fewer errors, and offers support for JavaScript libraries, that’s why its use increased from 20.8% to 46.7% in the period from 2016 to 2018.One of the most preferred languages according toPython is on the way to becoming the most popular language in the worldThe popularity of programming language Index (the PYPL index), which analyzes how often language tutorials are searched in Google, gives Python the first place among the most popular languages with the biggest growth (19.0%) in the last 5 years. Being one of the easiest programming languages to learn, Python continues attracting more and more newbies eager to master it. According to theNewcomers cannot take JavaScript’s positionJavaScript has been the most commonly used programming language for a while. 69.7% of professional developers use JavaScript language according toWeb frameworks: React is taking over front-end developmentBecause of the great focus on development simplicity and users’ experience, React has overtaken all the front-end competition. Apart from being elaborated by Facebook and obtaining effective UI, React has extremely fast updates, provides an opportunity for the user to make changes in the code without affecting other parts of the interface and has one-direction data-flow allowing writing a stable code.With all these features React is predicted to strengthen the number one position more in 2020 and adoption of React by companies with wide-known names like Instagram and Netflix proves this.Native app development is an attractive option for enterprisesBanks, financial institutions and big enterprises tend to choose native app development over hybrid, and it will remain the same in 2020. The main reason is security. The native app provides substantial protection of customers’ data, user-friendly interface, and smooth performance. Enterprises eager to show that they don’t save on their client’s experience and will continue opting for native app development.Cross-platform app development: why React is going to dominateDeveloping a cross-platform application might be a great decision in many cases. There are multiple options for cross-platform development like veterans (Ionic and Xamarin) and newbies (React Native and Flutter). React Native was developed by Facebook based on mature and successful web framework React, which we’ve discussed above. It shares the same base, offers high code reusability and is used by Facebook in the mobile application development. The popularity of React app development is increasing considering all the positive changes being constantly implemented into React Ecosystem.Tensorflow 2.0 is the next level for the Artificial IntelligenceArtificial Intelligence continues to grow every year and is becoming a foundation for many technologies around the world. Possessing simplified and integrated workflow, eager execution, integration for Swift and IOS, optimization for Android, and many other great features, the deep learning framework TensorFlow, elaborated by Google is predicted to become a world leader in deep learning and artificial neural nets in 2020.Big Data streaming: Flink for the futureReal-time data processing framework Flink is gaining popularity due to the ability to prevent the blocking of TCP channels, to minimize data transfer, to reduce garbage collection and offering space-efficient storage of data. Flink is considered to be the most powerful real-time data processing system nowadays and will definitely keep this position in the next few years.Big Data Computation: Spark will continue to sparkleSpark has taken the place of Hadoop in the world of batch processing and now is thought to be the most popular open-source project on the planet, with more than 1,000 contributors from more than 250 organizations. With the ability to run anywhere, Spark offers a wide range of specialized processing engines (SQL engine, a real-time streaming analytics engine, a machine learning library, and a graph database).",25 followers,Ivan Chau,662,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-blockchain-technology-for-a-developer

Wars make or break emperors.Europe for the most part of the A.D(and probably before that too) has continuously been on war. Britain was pillaged by bastard feudalism. Frequent tiffs and power plays between the various powers of Europe, kept the Europeans on their toes and called for innovation. But this also made them weak and made them expend themselves.Sometimes I feel from a non-European non-colonialist point of view, it is good that the two World Wars happened. Else wise, the Europeans instead of killing each other, would have exterminated the rest of the world. Maybe an exaggeration, but Europe has a bloody history, and it has exported that to where it set up its colonies.In comparison, India has had a much more peaceful and prosperous atmosphere :The following video should give you a real idea, on how stable and prosperous the Indian subcontinent was:After the British came of course, they upset everything. Thats an another story.For a significant part of the last two millenia(by significant, I mean right up until the 1800s) India and China had been dominating the international trade and amounted for the highest contributors of the World's GDP.""Discontent is the first necessity of progress. Show me a thoroughly satisfied man and I'll show you a failure."" - Thomas EdisonAdd to that social and religious dogmas and a fragmented country, its downfall was already guaranteed.. If not the Brits then somebody else.Great empires fall not because of external threats, but because of internal weakness.So, a battle-hardened Europe which was always trying to out-perform itself and its contemporaries would eventually beat those who do not make progress, even if they have a head start. And that happened through the rapid progress achieved under the Industrial revolution.But this only partially justifies how we got enslaved by the Brits.

27,"Not enough investment (time, resources and money) by all parties concerned, apathy among those in power are just some of the reasons. The technology sector depends to a great extent on good quality technical research. This is lacking in India for very good reasons which I will discuss in brief.

Let us look at an example to help us understand the problem.Not enough investment (time, resources and money) by all parties concerned, apathy among those in power are just some of the reasons. The technology sector depends to a great extent on good quality technical research. This is lacking in India for very good reasons which I will discuss in brief. Below I talk about just one sector (Integrated Circuit Design sector) to show you the true extent of the problem.I recently had this very interesting conversation with a university professor  in the USA about research to production timelines. Let us look at an example to help us understand the problem. Take integrated circuits used in processors and memory devices. The scaling trend is that the technology node (size of each transistor in these circuits) halves every two years. And the particular technology node that is under research now will go into production 5 to 6 years from now.Much of the top notch research in this area is heavily concentrated in the United States. So when it goes into production, the design and development jobs will stay in the United States. And the mind numbing, boring IT work is outsourced. So Indian Universities will invest even lesser in research on the future trends because the incentive to do so is very less in the long term because the good jobs (design and development) are anyway not coming to India. So to summarize:Bad technical research in the past ---> No major work / jobs in the high technology sector coming to India ---> Therefore no investment for research on future trends in that sector ---> Pattern continues.So you see, it is a vicious cycle that keeps us bogged down as far as the high technology industry is concerned. To put things in perspective, some of the best Electrical Engineering departments in India are stuck teaching the 600 micrometer technology node which was a 1995 or so standard! Most universities in the USA are already teaching the 32 nanometer or even better the 22 nanometer technology already! Now that is very bad and also tells us why we are so seriously lacking in attracting better investment in the technology sector.I am sure that this holds true even for most other sectors that are classified under ""technology"".So how do we fix it? No strings attached investment in research and development is the only way. There are no two ways about this. If the Government and technology industry in India are serious about fixing this problem, then the research at the IITs, IISc, and all the NITs need to be ramped up at the earliest. This need not even take too long. The sector I talked about above can be fixed within 5 years. Yep! You read that right! Just 5 years. India can be primed and ready to deliver by the release of the very next technology node in that sector. All that the government needs to do is spend money. Train the professors, invest in local research,  invite companies such as Intel, Qualcomm, AMD and a few others to not only train local talent but also ramp up the investment in India.I'm pretty sure the same is true for other sectors too. But will the Government do what it needs to do? In fact is the Government even capable of doing all that is required? At this point of time, I find it hard to believe they can do anything about it.A combination of apathy, general disinterest in the technology sector and not enough budget allocations for research and development are standing in between us and the ""technological superpowers"" of the world.But all said and done, India is capable. We just need a willing Government to take us down that road. You have included Israel in your question. I believe we can aim much higher than that. And we are more than capable of achieving that goal.There is also a very good reason why I say India is capable. Take the example of another sector. Thorium based nuclear reactors for energy production. 75% of the all the research in the world in this sector is being done in India. What is more is that India is home to 25% of the world's reserves of Thorium. So there are great opportunities in this sector for the future. So yes, India can be a world leader in the Technology sector. But is the Government willing and actually capable of doing all that is required to make that happen?

Poverty and financial insecurity has yet to lift its hold on Indian mindsets.  Once these are removed and the vast majority of Indians have the confidence that their basic needs won't challenge their survival, they will start innovating and contributing, by taking greater risks going into the unknown, and being able to feed their curiosity and inventiveness a whole lot more.Even if you were to invent something or innovate today in India that is primarily meant for Indian consumers, the first and foremost worry in your head will and should be how someone might copy it, sell it better or cheaper because of zero cost to develop, and laugh all the way to the bank, while you wonder what happened.  Intellectual Property protection in India exists, but except in the case of the most obvious violations by big players, we don't quite see the government cracking down on copycats and infringers.  This is extremely discouraging.Fiscally and socially too, there is a very important uniquely Indian cause.  We look at failures as criminal wrongs.  In the USA, you can afford to fail time and again, and the gumption and resilience will be appreciated.  Money will keep coming after you if you promise to keep pushing for some breakthrough.  In India, an loan that cannot be repaid can ruin a person.  Look at all  the farmers committing suicide, shamed into that corner of 'failure'.We love to laugh at and heckle failures.  It is in the spirit of entrepreneurship to encourage getting through all failures quickly, and with knowledge gained, not remorse gathered.  The vast majority of Indian minds are yet to grasp this.  Then of course there is the famous Indian crab mentality - hoping to get ahead by dragging others back.  This poisonous habit just needs to go.Indian banks too, are usually willing to lend to exactly those who don't need the money - looking at their track record, and ability to repay based on their current income levels, not by the genius of what they are proposing to do.  This has led to money being looked at as a destination, as an end goal, instead of the resource it actually just is.So, when it begins to accumulate, Indians just hoard, because we bloody worship it.  We don't think of money that is not doing any work as a total waste.

Because in democracy the power is in the hand of citizens and if your citizens are rickety how can you build a robust growth. Government only work to help citizens to function well by providing them basic facilities, support, logistics to carryout their activities.In our case only few people were educated and they saw a big nation full of resources and uneducated/underprivileged people who can work for them like slaves. This happened and nepotism became a culture in India, part of it we can still see in India. It became a habit of Indians and I don't blame Indians for that.In my view, only thing we could have done in the beginning was choosing communism over democracy. But now switching back to communism does not seems a good choice because we have much better population demographics and democracy have better long term outcomes. We can choose capitalism as a core principle in out democracy which can bridge the gaps and provide a robust growth.But the good news is that despite all these struggles we managed to educate out children, empower or females, removed taboo of cast from our society to an extent, revived entrepreneurial spirit in young Indians. Things are going down in right path and now we have the biggest population and eventually biggest economy. It would be a breeding ground for innovation, technology, science, medicine, arts.We are preparing ourselves for 4th industrial revolution and on any cost we don't have to miss that bus. India will continue to have problems, but year by year we are getting rid of them. We will surely be the leaders in technology, which is evident from space technology. Not only space if we dig down we innovated much more in IT, technology, science, medicine. Patience is the key, we have big bright population, no one can replace us from being a future breeding ground of Innovation, we just need to keep growing GDP.",88 followers,Shabarinath Nair,4.1K,156,2.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-blockchain-technology-for-a-developer
30,"Brace yourself for a very politically incorrect and a highly angry answer from a very angry Indian.This iswhich apparently took exactly 5 years to get completed. It happens to be the largest single-structure airport terminal.Five years, get it? That’s the exact time for which a government in India under a party or alliance is supposed to run in one term.Now a curious question my friend.How much time will it take for India to make an exactly similar airport, assuming the government is very much sincere about the project?Well, first, it will need land. And toBrace yourself for a very politically incorrect and a highly angry answer from a very angry Indian.This iswhich apparently took exactly 5 years to get completed.

And to get land, you will need to find one. Since land in India can be got for such a thing only by clearing forests or some sort of vegetation, demolishing old constructions which is of no use, and to buy land from some other source(s) . No problem, this hurdle is easy to overcomeNext is tender for construction. Okay, this is easy too.Now comes commitment. I guess this is a left-hand play. For a government who can construct highways fast, this is something they definitely can do, right?Now, let’s go back to first point. What if there was a patch of vegetation???BAAM!!!!A retinue of fellows claiming to be environmental activists, farmer activists, activists against common sense, will begin a protest on why trees and grasses are being removed.Next a retinue of film stars whose weddings have a larger carbon footprint than what my family produces in a year and who currently lives outside India, will give us their piece of mind on why hurting grass is bad.Finally some politician trying to sharpen his dividend (doesn’t matter if in opposition or government) will try the best to gain some followers.Someone will try to take it to hon’ble Supreme Court and try hard to delay this even further.A project that can get completed in 5 years or less will get completed in 15 years!!!!!!!!You serious ????And such is the story of literally everything that requires a patch of land- Metro shed, factory, highways, railway stations, nuclear power plant, high speed railway lines, …….insert your choice. Brand every single of them as a “All the fellows who will be into this, showing how much they stand for the beautiful and romantic idea of “anti-corporatism” will ironically, do all these with help of free JIO sims made by Mukesh Ambani, wearing clothes from Westside run by TATA group, sitting on a bike assembled by Rahul Bajaj’s company, and with phones made by guess who?????Go ahead dear Indians,please protest against that Japanese company which might help you have faster trains between Delhi and BhopalYou want good trains, but you don’t like high speed train tracks occupying a strip of land in a farm.You want Made in India phones but have problems with a cellphone factory set in neighbourhoodYou want metro trains, but have a problem with a shed occupying a tiny region.You want uninterrupted electricity, but have problems with a power plant.You call yourself as anti-corporate, yet work in AmazonIn short, you think yourself as smart, but you are an emotional foolEvery time you behave as an emotional fool, someone in Beijing laughs on a joke, and I guess you can see that joke, at a nearby mirror maybe???It is 2019 where industries and infrastructure rule the roost, and a country which has more of these will be the one to wield maximum power and the one which would provide the highest standards of living. Badmouthing corporate culture is like hitting your own legs with an axe.You want India to speed up? The first step is to stop acting as a fricking roadblock. Atleast you can do this much I guess, alongside changing your mindset and priorities. Is that too much to ask?China thanks to its mindset of supporting industralization lifted its own poor to middle-class levels, at a speed no other nation managed to do. India on other hand managed to reduce its poverty significantly in two decades.Two decades. You know what went right two decades ago??? Liberalization of economy. China did that way before India did, and they did it under a non-democratic government. India under democracy managed to do it in 2 decades, slower than China. I think that we can do it faster even without becoming a non-democratic nation, provided that people of India stop behaving like emotional fools.India expects every man and woman to side with her in the race to progress, not against it. If you are against it, you are part of the problem and not solution.","68,805 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,682,17.3K,413.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-blockchain-technology-for-a-developer
31,"These are few issues why India lags behind. And read further to understand why we lag all these.These are few issues why India lags behind. And read further to understand why we lag all these.I'll tell you why Indians lags all these. India was one of the richest in culture and way of its living 2 centuries ago but it had been under control of British for more than 2 centuries after and its just has been 65 years from now we are independent. We now live an independent life and are independent externally. But we still are dependent, we are dependent inside our brains.Dependency made a lot of impact on the minds of people here. Dependency bought fear, Dependency bought ignorance, Dependency bought complications, Dependency restricted us, Dependency taught us slavery,  Dependency made us used of getting adjusted to things,Dependency bought poverty, Dependency developed illiteracy.And mix of all these it bought selfishness. Selfishness of them being clean, Selfishness of their homes getting cleaned but not the country's. Selfishness of them excelling better but not the other people around.This has lead to lag several things behind and made us what we are todayBut this will last some day, fortunately dependency taught us how to fight back from dependency. We are battling inside us and it could take few decades. But for sure it will happen. We will get our independence with in.The day when we reach 99% literacy rate which will automatically decrease our national poverty line of 20% to 0%. India must and will be a country that would reach beyond her imaginations.There this man called Modi, who is working hard, branding/marketing India in every possible way , for the first time ever inspiring people to work hard and most importantly telling them with his actions.I believe once we get used to good, the good which will make us care about our people, our country, then we will settle down for ever. Give us some time and brace yourselves to see the impact we would be creating.Jai Hind.","45,235 followers",Bala Senthil Kumar,533,12.1K,51.4M,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-current-trends-in-web-development
