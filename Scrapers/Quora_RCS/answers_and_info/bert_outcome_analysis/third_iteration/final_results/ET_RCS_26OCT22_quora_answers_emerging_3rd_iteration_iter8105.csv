I came up with an approach that computed a character distribution histogram for every string: you take a 64-bit field, split it up into 16 sets of 4 bits, and then compute the number of characters that are X modulo 16 for X = 0...15. For example, in the string ""hello"", the ASCII values of characters are 104, 101, 108, 108, 111, which are 8, 5, 12, 12, 15 modulo 16. In a 64-bit field, ""hello"" would thus correspond to a 0001 in the 9th, 6th, and 16th sets of 4 bits, a 0010 in the 13th set, and a 0000 in every other set of 4 bits. In the end, every string I had boiled down to a single 64-bit histogram.After computing these histograms for every string in the dictionary, I could compare them to the histogram of the search string and use bit arithmetic to quickly determine a lower bound on the edit distance. For example, if one string has 5 letters that are 3 mod 16 and 0 letters that are 4 mod 16, and another string has 0 letters that are 3 mod 16 and 5 letters that are 4 mod 16, then their edit distance will be at least 5 (i.e. it takes 5 edit edit operations if you replace 'aaaaa' with 'bbbbb'). Because the lower bound was almost always much higher than the distance threshold I was interested in, I could avoid the full Levenshtein distance computation about 99.99% of the time. As a result, I could do my edit distance check against an entire 1m item dictionary in milliseconds, which was very acceptable for the use case I was working on.","12,130 followers",Leo Polovets,4.1K,481,6.3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-programming-algorithm-that-you-have-ever-created

The worm was written, probably, between 2005 and 2010.Because the worm is so complex and sophisticated, I can only give the most superficial outline of what it does.This worm exists first on a USB drive. Someone could just find that USB drive lying around, or get itBuckle in.The most sophisticated software in history was written by a team of people whose names we do not know.It’s a computer worm. The worm was written, probably, between 2005 and 2010.Because the worm is so complex and sophisticated, I can only give the most superficial outline of what it does.This worm exists first on a USB drive. Someone could just find that USB drive lying around, or get it in the mail, and wonder what was on it. When that USB drive is inserted into a Windows PC, without the user knowing it, that worm will quietly run itself, and copy itself to that PC. It has at least three ways of trying to get itself to run. If one way doesn’t work, it tries another. At least two of these methods to launch itself were completely new then, and both of them used two independent, secret bugs in Windows that no one else knew about, until this worm came along.Once the worm runs itself on a PC, it tries to get administrator access on that PC. It doesn’t mind if there’s antivirus software installed — the worm can sneak around most antivirus software. Then, based on the version of Windows it’s running on, the worm will try one of two previously unknown methods of getting that administrator access on that PC. Until this worm was released, no one knew about these secret bugs in Windows either.At this point, the worm is now able to cover its tracks by getting underneath the operating system, so that no antivirus software can detect that it exists. It binds itself secretly to that PC, so that even if you look on the disk for where the worm should be, you will see nothing. This worm hides so well, that the worm ran around the Internet for over a year without any security company in the world recognizing that it even existed.The software then checks to see if it can get on the Internet. If it can, it attempts to visit either http://www.mypremierfutbol.com or http://www.todaysfutbol.com . At the time, these servers were in Malaysia and Denmark. It opens an encrypted link and tells these servers that it has succeeded in owning a new PC. The worm then automatically updates itself with the newest version.At this point, the worm makes copies of itself to any other USB sticks you happen to plug in. It does this by installing a carefully designed but fake disk driver. This driver was digitally signed by Realtek, which means that the authors of the worm were somehow able to break into the most secure location in a huge Taiwanese company, and steal the most secret key that this company owns, without Realtek finding out about it.Later, whoever wrote that driver started signing it with secret keys from JMicron, another big Taiwanese company. Yet again, the authors had to figure out how to break into the most secure location in that company and steal the most secure key that that company owns, without JMicron finding out about it.This worm we are talking about is sophisticated.And it hasn’t even got started yet.At this point, the worm makes use of two recently discovered Windows bugs. One bug relates to network printers, and the other relates to network files. The worm uses those bugs to install itself across the local network, onto all the other computers in the facility.Now, the worm looks around for a very specific bit of control software, designed by Siemens for automating large industrial machinery. Once it finds it, it uses (you guessed it) yet another previously unknown bug for copying itself into the programmable logic of the industrial controller. Once the worm digs into this controller, it’s in there for good. No amount of replacing or disinfecting PCs can get rid of the worm now.The worm checks for attached industrial electric motors from two specific companies. One of those companies is in Iran, and the other is in Finland. The specific motors it searches for are called variable-frequency drives. They’re used for running industrial centrifuges. You can purify many kinds of chemicals in centrifuges.Such as uranium.Now at this point, since the worm has complete control of the centrifuges, it can do anything it wants with them. The worm can shut them all down. The worm can destroy them all immediately — just spin them over maximum speed until they all shatter like bombs, killing anyone who happens to be standing near.But no. This is a sophisticated worm. The worm has other plans.Once it controls every centrifuge in your facility… the worm just goes to sleep.Days pass. Or weeks. Or seconds.When the worm decides the time is right, the worm quietly wakes itself up. The worm randomly picks a few of those centrifuges while they are purifying uranium. The worm locks them, so that if someone notices that something is wrong, a human can’t turn the centrifuges off.And then, stealthily, the worm starts spinning those centrifuges… a little wrong. Not a crazy amount wrong, mind you. Just, y’know, a little too fast. Or a little too slow. Just a tiny bit out of safe parameters.At the same time, it increases the gas pressure in those centrifuges. The gas in those centrifuges is called UF6. Pretty nasty stuff. The worm makes the pressure of that UF6, just a tiny bit out of safe parameters. Just enough that the UF6 gas in the centrifuges, has a small chance of turning into rock, whi...",0 followers,John Byrd,61.9K,439,10.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-programming-algorithm-that-you-have-ever-created

Here's an opportunity to exercise my story telling. Let's see how I do. There is some computer science in this story described at an intuitive level. If you don't skip those parts, it will help to understand what a ""graph"" is in computer science.Since most roads in the hierarchy are minor roads, route calculation algorithms used in the industry were made much faster by not considering most of those roads in the calculation.But there was a problem. How could the reach of each node be computed efficiently? It could be computed by computing optimum routes for every possible pair of origins and destinations for each version of a road map, but for maintenance of a road map of the United States, that would be too expensive.Mission Peak:So I coded it up, the computation of reach bounds and the route calculations using reach bounds. My tests convinced me that it would work well. Then I became convinced that I had something interesting both in the academic world and in the industry. I had never even submitted an academic paper to an academic journal or conference, but I decided I'd try. I found a conference on algorithms called Alenex, learned the procedures for preparing an academic publication, wrote it carefully following academic standards and conventions as well as I could with proofs and some pseudo-code, had a co-worker review it, and submitted it to Alenex for formal review. It was accepted and I flew to New Orleans in January 2004 to present it. Reach-based routing had been invented and presented to the world, and it brought together methods from industry and academia.The power point slides in this story are from my talk at Alenex.http://www.siam.org/meetings/alenex04/abstacts/rgutman1.pdfI later realized that as pure as academia might be, being an academic gives one a little advantage, being a little more savvy about marketing one's own work.Dmitry asked in a comment (below) how this invention advanced my career. There is no clear answer but it's such a good question that I'll expand my story right here.I had only recently joined a team at Yahoo at the time I made the presentation at Alenex. In my four years at Yahoo, I’ll say that the answer is no, my paper did not advance my career at Yahoo.After a few years at Yahoo, I had a chance to move my career in a new direction and believed that my paper would help. I was put in contact with a senior scientist in a research organization with Yahoo. I thought that moving into research might be a good career move for me. I thought that my paper might compensate for my lack of a PhD (I have only an MS in computer science from UC Berkeley) to gain admission to research.Being an architect however is not an easy role - more responsibility than authority - so a talent for persuasion is needed. I sometimes blame myself for making another mistake, something like confirmation bias. I felt that reach-based routing should be used to solve a harder problem in which the map data is very dynamic. Certainly, it was very hard to resist building on previous investments based on my unique understanding of concepts in reach-based routing. I was given the chance to try it with Telenav's research team in Beijing. The results of that research were not considered good enough to continue forward. A diagnosis of the technical shortcoming was not simple, but I have thought about my proposal as a mistake because I believe I lost credibility. I should not have proposed something as speculative as I that.Location of Telenav office that I visited in Beijing:So although the answer is mixed, I can summarize by saying that my paper advanced my career only a little and not always in useful directions, some of which is my own fault.I always want to thank my boss at Wavemarket, Scott Hotes, for giving me the opportunity to invent reach-based routing.",911 followers,Anthony Moh,8.5K,214,2.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-programming-algorithm-that-you-have-ever-created

I guess it’s scary in the sense that children all over the world are singing this nursery rhyme without knowing the sad way it came to be ( which is probably for the best ).Sources:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death","2,051 followers",Hazel Lockey,14.1K,76,10.1M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-programming-algorithm-that-you-have-ever-created

It’s called the ‘strange-face-in-the-mirror’ illusion (bit of a mouthful, I know).You turn off all the lights in your room except for a dimly lit candle or lamp. Then, you pull up a chair and sit in front of a large mirror.The visual illusion is easy. All you have to do is stare at yourself for around ten minutes, without removing your gaze from the mirror, and ensuring you pick a point to focus on. You can see the effects taking place even after about a minute or so of doing this.What starts to happen is that your face distorts and morphs, and after a while, a lot of people start to see unpleasant, disturbing, and often frightening images.The results, to say the least, are simultaenously intriguing and terrifying.The initial experiment involved fifty people, who all did exactly as what is outlined above.After doing so, the participants began to see strange distortions in their reflection:(These don’t add up to 100% given that these patients are able to see multiple different things - the distortion is ongoing.)The study in general noted that:‘Apparition of monstrous beings produced fear or disturbance. Dynamic deformations of new faces (like pulsations or shrinking, smiling or grinding) produced an overall sense of inquietude for things out of control.’So for what reason does this potentially frightening experience occur?A few articles have stated it’s because of the Troxler effect, which basically is where the brain selects important information and influences our perception. Take this pretty famous example, the Lilac Chaser:If you stare at the cross in the centre for a few seconds, the pink dots will start to disappear.This is because brain classifies them as irrelevant. But the green dot (which does not exist, but is rather another illusion of colour created by the brain) however, is moving, and thus important - so you can still see it, even though you can’t see the others.To supposedly lessen the processing burden on itself, the brain removes its attention from the less important information - from the feeling of our tongue resting on our mouth to the way our clothes feel on our skin.According to these articles, the same thing happens when you’re staring into the mirror. Your brain supposedly gets ‘bored’ because of a lack of stimuli.A participant commented:At one point it looked like something black slithered across the floor behind me (I can’t explain that one).The creepiest moment however, was when my eye (and I swear this happened), looked away and then looked back at me.It appears to be quite a scary phenomenon, although again, the results vary greatly from person to person - although it’s safe to say it leaves most feeling extremely uncomfortable.Regardless of its explanations, it’s something anyone can do - although I really wouldn’t recommend it. It can be a very disturbing experience and I’d advise against it.It’s honestly quite frightening what the brain can get up to when it’s got nothing better to do.If there’s something to take away from this, it’s that it’s probably best to avoid staring into the bathroom mirror at 3am chanting ‘Bloody Mary’.","1,716 followers",Ambica Koul,17.3K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-programming-algorithm-that-you-have-ever-created

In 2007, he was featured in an article by David Dosa called the New England Journal of Medicine.This is where things start getting creepy. According to David Dosa, Oscar is able to “predict the impending death of terminally ill patients”. How does he do this?By lying down with them a few hours before they die.Funny enough, there are many real stories concerning him. But here’s a summary.After Oscar had been at Steere House for around six months, staff noticed that Oscar often chose to nap next to residents who died within several hours of his arrival. It seemed to staff as if Oscar were trying to comfort and provide company to people as they died.Joan Teno, a physician at Steere House, clarified that ""it's not that the cat is consistently there first. But the cat always does manage to make an appearance, and it always seems to be in the last two hours.""After Oscar accurately predicted 25 deaths, staff started calling family members of residents as soon as they discovered him sleeping next to someone in order to notify them and give them an opportunity to say goodbye before the impending death.As of January 2010, Oscar had accurately predicted approximately 50 patients' deaths.I don’t know about you, but this absolutely freaks me out.

Now let me introduce you to Naegleria Fowleri, also known as, theThis amoeba thrives inThis amoeba does exactly what its name says- eating the brain.When you are in a freshwater-body containing this amoeba and water there reaches high up your nose, this amoeba enters your body.Unfortunate thing is that, unlike other germs, this amoeba is hard to get caught by immune system near the nose. For instance, most germs get filtered by mucus in our nose. But Naegleria Fowleri manages to escape.Then it may stumble upon the olfactory nerve cells in your nose. These lead to olfactory bulb. There is a chemical in this area that helps in smelling named acetylcholine.The amoeba can smell this. It enters the olfactory tissue. Here is where a few immune cells attack the amoeba. It usually gets killed. But sometimes it doesn’t get killed. Then tracing the chemical, the amoebaThere it begins to attack the brain cells, and tear apart brain cells for the chemical. It begins to devour brain cells and the chemical. Amoeba multiplies.This is when the other immune cells attack the amoeba. But, while killing the amoeba, they even damage the brain cells.A battle which causes destruction begins. Till now, there is no kind of effect on the victim. But now, this increases body temperature like during fever, but this just makes things worse since Naegleria Fowleri thrives in hotter bodies.Stuff gets worse now. It all starts with headache, nausea etc. Then you get hallucinations, confusion, etc.Soon, the brain swells, but due to bones stopping it to swell further, there is lack of space, and the expansion causes medulla(brain stem) to rupture.This, leads to the death of victims.Within a week after infection, there is death.Survival from this is quite very rare. In most reported cases, the patient dies.But the lucky part is that, this infection is very, very rare. And for the amoeba itself to reach our body, needs to be splashed far up the nasal cavity. Then again, near olfactory tissue, it needs to escape the immune cells guarding, which is a difficult task. They rip apart amoeba and eat it, or use chemicals to kill it.It is quite rare, but due to the increasing water temperatures around globe, cases of this might increase.",63 followers,Lindsay Elizabeth,11K,174,32M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-facts-that-are-extremely-scary-to-know

There was a form of torturous execution named the Brazen Bull. The convicted was to be put inside the metallic structure and then the bull would be heated up until the criminal was pretty much cooked alive. This design managed to disgust a tyrant who was often brutal to his subjects and therefore he put the creator of this device inside to scare him and then locked him in. He eventually took him out and chucked him off a cliff. Also the screams of the victim would be converted into the sounds of a Crying Bull.That’s done at least.Thanks for reading..",0 followers,Rupa Gupta,3.5K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-facts-that-are-extremely-scary-to-know

His notorious experiments on patients are shocking, the darkest of which he executed at hospital's bell tower.Karma eventually caught up with the wicked doctor. Eventually, he lost his mind and climbed to the top of the bell tower and flung himself to his death below.4.Many believe that hundreds of thousands of tormented souls still remain trapped on Poveglia Island. A sense of sorrow and suffering continues to permeate from the island to this day.In fact, it has even been said that you can still hear their screams.5.One thing visitors report experiencing is the sensation of being watched. Others report being scratched and pushed by invisible forces.Some entities have even been said to push visitors into walls or chase them down corridors.6.With more than 100,000 plague victims and mental patients buried on the small island of Poveglia, it is no surprise that human bones continue to wash up on its shores.7.Locals to this day claim that the demented doctor’s spirit is still in the tower and will remain there forever and that on a quiet night, if you are listening closely, you can hear him ring the tower bell.8.Years after Poveglia Island's mental hospital was shut down, a family decided to purchase the island, intending to build a private holiday home there. The very first night was filled with such horrors that within hours the family fled, never to return.They reported that their daughter's face was nearly ripped off by an angry resident entity.9.Amid the numerous reports from illegal visitors is the story of a curiosity thrill-seeker who went to Poveglia with a group of friends. Upon entering the abandoned mental hospital, the illegal tourist reported a heavy sense of dread descend around them, followed by a deep voice that warned:""Leave immediately and do not return."" The visitors immediately complied.10.

Scaphism was a form of ancient torture back in the day. It consisted of the victim being covered all over with honey and then subjected to large amounts of ants and other insects.6. Back in 1888, there was a brutal murder taking place in London. Now known as The Whitehall Mystery. A young woman was dismembered and her body parts were scattered across the city in different locations. The murder was never solved.7. While filming the movie ‘The Exorcist’, many actors got injured, the set burned down, a Priest was brought in several times to bless the set, and the actor who played Burke, Jack MacGowran, died of Influenza.8. In the Czech Republic, there is a church called The Sedlec Ossuary that has decorations made entirely of human bones. This happened because there were too many people in the cemetery to bury everyone, and the church leaders claimed that if their bones became part of the church, it only made them closer to God. Nice propaganda spin there, guys.9. In New York City, more people commit suicide than are murdered.10. Sharks kill about 12 people a year. People kill about 11, 417 sharks—an hour.11. Back in the 1960s, the skeletons in the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland were real. At the time, they thought that fake skeletons didn’t look scary enough. So they contacted the UCLA medical department and bought loads of skeletons that were usually used in anatomy classrooms. As time went on, fake skeletons started to look more convincing. Disney claims that they gave the real skeletons proper burials, but many speculate that there could be at least a couple real ones left over on the ride.12. Do you ever wonder what people did before the invention of assembly-line cups and bowls? In ancient England, people used the tops of hollowed human skulls to drink and eat.13. Hundreds of years ago, when people died on the battlefield or elsewhere outside, their bodies often just lay there until they rotted away. As they decompose, their skulls would start to grow a moss called usnea. People believed that this moss contained the spiritual qualities of the fallen soldiers, and they would gather it up as medicine. Apparently, usnea that grew on hanged men’s skulls was seen as the most effective.14. At Harvard University, there is a book bound in human skin.15. Psycho is the first American film to show a toilet on screen. It's also the first American film in which we hear a toilet being flushed. (That's just how repressed Americans were in the 1950s.)16. Ed and Lorraine Warren actually investigated the paranormal, and The Conjuring is an adaptation of the Warrens’ experiences with the Perron family and their supposedly haunted farmhouse.17. Actress Virginia Madsen was really hypnotized for some scenes so that her trance could look authentic in The Blair Witch Project!18. Every seven years, people in Madagascar dig up their ancestors, change their clothes and dance with them in the19. The bodies of members of some Hindu castes are considered too sacred for cremation and so are floated down the Ganges river in India. The Aghori Babas take these bodies and eat them in a ritual as a symbol of triumphing over fear. For them the biggest fear for the living is death, so eating the dead bodies is a way to conquer it. The Aghori do quite a lot of disgusting stuff.20. In Papua New Guinea, the Fore tribe also eat dead bodies. When a member of a tribe dies, the whole tribe cooks and eats the bod. Women and children eat the brain while men eat the flesh. This is done in the hope that the spirit of the deceased will stay close to living family and tribe members. This tradition was technically banned after an outbreak of so-called ""hysteria"" in the 1950s.21. How about we set aside a day to worship the penis? Well, that’s what the people of Kawasaki in Japan have done; they have decided to celebrate fertility and the “power” of the penis. This is also called Shinto fertility festival, Shinto beliefs of openness use of nature and deliberate simplicity. Shinto is a Japanese religion, it focuses on ritual practices to be carried out diligently, to establish a connection between present-day Japan and its ancient past. This interesting ritual takes place every year on the first Sunday of every April, with all kinds of phallic activities going on.22. In the Menses rituals of Uaupes, Brazil, girls are brought out naked on the streets and are beaten to death or till they are unconscious. Why? The reason is shocking but easy to guess, as are most reasons related to women opression. If the girls still wake up after this extremely cruel treatment, they are considered 'womanly' and 'worthy' of marriage. So much for proving your worth and even then, somehow it is never enough!23. In some countries, mothers eat their own placenta after giving birth. Why? All of it for the nutrients that the placenta contains. This tradition is followed in China. I'll leave it on you to decide if this ritual is right for the baby and the mother.24. In Denmark, people throw cinnamon on anyone who is single. At least as long as those men and women are over the age of 25. If you are single in Denmark and you hit 30, you get pepper thrown on you.

45,"The Mystery of LamIn the early 20th century, occultist Aleister Crowley conducted the Amalantrah Workings, in which he would attempt to invoke supernatural entities through the visions of his partner and medium, Roddie Minor. Crowley (preferred by him to be pronounced like the bird), was infamous for his presence in the occult scene, titling himself “the Beast 666.”The main focus of his work was the summoning of the intelligence known as “Lam” (meaning “path” in Tibetan). Crowley would go on to have multiple alleged encounters with this being in 1918. His illustration ofThe Mystery of LamIn the early 20th century, occultist Aleister Crowley conducted the Amalantrah Workings, in which he would attempt to invoke supernatural entities through the visions of his partner and medium, Roddie Minor. Crowley (preferred by him to be pronounced like the bird), was infamous for his presence in the occult scene, titling himself “the Beast 666.”The main focus of his work was the summoning of the intelligence known as “Lam” (meaning “path” in Tibetan). Crowley would go on to have multiple alleged encounters with this being in 1918. His illustration of Lam, from that year, is shown below:Does it remind you of anything? Crowley also associated Lam with something known as the Egg, which it purportedly uses as a mechanism for inter-dimensional travel, or teleportation.The description of this vessel is highly reminiscent of many alleged alien encounters reported later on, but the connection is particularly clear in the infamous Lonnie Zamora case. If you don’t already know, Lonnie Zamora was a police officer in the 1960s who claims that he, on a chase to pursue a speeder, witnessed a massive explosion in the wilderness nearby. This led him to abandon the chase and pull aside to investigate, only to discover what looked to be two small men tending to an ovoid craft. Before he had time to gather his wits, the door slammed shut and he saw the ship take off, along with multiple other witnesses later on.Below is Lonnie’s illustration:Later members of Aleister Crowley’s Ordo Templi Orientis (Lt. “Order of the Eastern Temple”) did make it abundantly clear that they believed Lam and the modern ideas ofSome members became fixated on studying Lam and the other “trans-mundane” entities (note: the term “extraterrestrial” was coined in 1956, decades later). They made several things clear:Now, this part’s important:Two other members—renowned rocket scientistThe result nonetheless was the expansion of Lam’s portal, as the two were admittedly not as deft in closing the portal as Crowley had been. Only a year and a half later, the age of UFO sightings began withAs the century progressed, the Order under Kenneth Grant cleared up their beliefs on “the Great Old One” (intentionally referred to in the singular). They say the beings operate between the Sirius and Andromeda star systems, and that Lam is actually actively supporting their agenda. It is the Order’s conviction that the Age of UFOs is but a sign of the impending end of our age… whatever that might actually imply.“Colored version of the Whore of Babylon illustration from Martin Luther's 1534 translation of the Bible.”So, in sum, occultists gave early descriptions of what looked to be grey aliens well before they were publicized. Even if you’re not convinced whatever they dealt with was aliens, that’s certainly their belief. Additionally, just before the start of the Age of UFOs and the innumerable reports that brought the concept of the extraterrestrial to the public, OTO members claimed to have permanently opened Lam’s portal. If these events are to be viewed as more than coincidental, this suggests that we have the concept of aliens on its head—UFOs are actually esoteric, occult phenomena, not ones necessarily of science. And, perhaps the most frightening part of all this, the results of the Babylon Working are unknown. No one’s sure whether the new age is almost here, or even if it’s here right now. No one knows whether the moonchild was ever spawned or not. No one outside the inner ranks of the OTO, that is.Coincidence or no coincidence, I think it’s undeniable that these facts at minimum constitute one hell of a story.More information about the Babylon Working:Okay, this is sort of a long-winded exposition of some of the things I’ve learned. Please note that none of these are my personal beliefs.Again, the purpose of the Working was to spawn a moonchild. This moonchild would apparently be the spirit of the Whore of Babylon given in the Book of Revelation birthed from a human womb, seemingly paralleling the birth of Jesus.I’m not much of a Bible scholar myself, but there are a couple things I think should be connected. There seems to be a belief among members of the Order that Lam is a manifestation of what’s called “Lucifer-Gnosis.” Now, Gnosticism and Luciferianism are two very similar belief systems, both believing that the God of the Bible is tyrannical, ignorant, and actually the antagonist.On Luciferianism: The mythos of Lucifer is very common even in Mesopotamian cultures preceding the Bible, always describing a light-bringer, striving for heavenly dominion, often through his pride, but failing and being cast into the underworld by the chief deity. (The character of “Lucifer” in all these traditions is seen as the embodiment of the morning star, or Phosphoros, and gets its meaning from the star’s nature, which is actually just the planet Venus: its brightness, the fact it never reaches the place of the other stars up high, etc.) To those in the Order of the Luciferian stripe, Lucifer was the real protagonist, trying to bring knowledge to humans despite the ignorance brought by God, which they see plainly shown in the myth of Adam and Eve. (The snake, identified with/as Lucifer, encourages Eve to eat from the Tree of Knowledge, for which they are punished by the creator God, and make their own fall from heaven, the original sin)Gnostics believe Jesus to be the hero opposing God, yet both Jesus and Lucifer are interestingly referred to as the “morning star” in parts of the Bible. “Gnosis” is the Gnostic view of spiritual enlightenment/salvation. Gnosticism is fundamentally a rejection of the physical world, which was thought to be created by the biblical God.I also don’t think it’s a coincidence that the Whore of Babylon is what’s being reified. Babylon is portrayed as a wicked city of sin in the New Testament, and Lucifer is also described in Isaiah as the King of Babylon (although some believe the passage refers to an actual unnamed king). Nevertheless, the Age of Osiris will probably be a realignment of humanity away from the biblical God.Other sources:Main source and a great investigative piece by occult journalist Dan Boudillion:For related information, this is a fascinating Vice article I’d recommend:—",224 followers,Naman Geda,1.1K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-facts-that-are-extremely-scary-to-know

47,"5. Bite MeIn ancient China, there was a process of making a “mellified man,” which was essentially mummifying someone with honey. In order to do this, an elderly person, ideally near death, would volunteer themselves to the process of being binge-bathed in honey, and given only honey to eat, until their entire digestive system was honey. Then, when the volunteer died, they would be covered in honey for 100 years. After this century or so, the contents were turned into a candy that was said to heal broken bones.Pexels4.

In order to do this, an elderly person, ideally near death, would volunteer themselves to the process of being binge-bathed in honey, and given only honey to eat, until their entire digestive system was honey. Then, when the volunteer died, they would be covered in honey for 100 years. After this century or so, the contents were turned into a candy that was said to heal broken bones.Pexels4.

Two Can Keep a Secret if One of Them Is DeadNo one knows how famed creepy writer Edgar Allan Poe died. At least, those who did know are long since dead, and all firm records of his death have been lost. Poe was found on Baltimore’s streets on October 3, 1849. Eerily, he was wearing someone else’s clothes. He was in pretty bad shape, and died in hospital just four days later. He was never coherent enough to explain what had happened, and he kept shouting “Reynolds” the night before his death. There’s nothing left from his medical records, including even his death certificate. Speculation about the cause of his death ranges anywhere from suicide, cholera, heart disease, epilepsy, and even murder. He was only 40 years old.Flickr2.

Dark LoverAlthough it was a political marriage, the union between Joanna I of Castile and Philip “the Handsome” of Burgundy was one of passion, albeit lopsided passion. By all accounts, Philip was into Joanna, but just not enough to stay faithful. Unfortunately, Joanna wasRefusing to part with her philandering husband, she viciously clung to the body. Even when her father and the government stepped in to finally bury Philip, their separation did not last long. Joanna ordered him exhumed, leapt at his coffin, and kissed his dead feet. From that moment on, you couldn’t have Joanna if she couldn’t bring Philip. The coffin—thankfully closed most of the time—would accompany her to meals, travels, and even her bedside. Only years later did Philip return to the ground, albeit at a safe distance, i.e., buried right outside of her window. On the bright side, Joanna’s cheating husband was finally all hers.",0 followers,Dada Ifeoluwa,757,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-facts-that-are-extremely-scary-to-know

If a climber dies in this area they will likely be permanent residents of the mountain because helicopters can’t fly that high and it is too dangerous to attempt to carry them out.And this is only looking at med errors (which kill roughly 7,000 Americans every year). One could literally write a book on this subject, but I’ll provide only one example here.Back in 1999, a Cardiologist contributed to the death of his patient when his prescription of 20 mg Isordil, an antianginal drug, was misread by the pharmacist as 20 mg Plendil, an antihypertensive drug.Take this instance and multiply it by tens of thousands and that will give you a snapshot of how bad the problem is.** A picture says a thousand words.** An individual hornet can kill forty European honey bees per minute.A group of 30 hornets can destroy a 30,000 member hive of European honeybees in less than four hours.If that wasn’t enough, the giant hornets, in addition to killing the bees, also dismember them and return to their nest with the bee thoraxes which they feed to their young.Yes, they are venomous and have been known to kill humans.** Still photo from Congressional testimony about the CIA heart attack gunProject MKNAOMI was the code name of a joint DoD/CIA research program running from the 1950s through the end of the 1970s. One of the more sinister devices to come out of this collaboration is what might best be called a “heart attack gun”.The idea is that the weapon shot a small poisoned dart into the intended target. The person who was shot would feel nothing other than perhaps the sting associated with a mosquito bite. The dart would completely disintegrate within a matter of seconds.The poison contained in the dart was designed to cause a fatal heart attack in the victim. The causative agent supposedly disintegrated quickly and was impossible to detect on autopsy.Does this all sound too James Bond-ish to be true? I thought so as well until I heard about the United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence activities. These were also known as the Church Committee hearings and there was testimony in front of the Senate in 1975 regarding this weapon.Watch the clip below and decide for yourself what you think about this.The CIA's Secret Heart Attack Gun",10 followers,Karuna Jha,773,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-facts-that-are-extremely-scary-to-know

Also, most of the pictures are of newborns, witch makes it even more F’ed up, so, yeah.These monstrosities can affect any age group, and are most commonly found on the Uterus, Testicles, and Tailbone. They are incredibly rare, affecting about 1 in every 40k people, but like any rare disease when you have 7 billion people on the planet, it adds up. 1 in 40k is equal to about 175,000 people.There is another extremely rare form of Teratoma known as Fetus in Fetu, which basically translates to fetus within a fetus. It is formed when one twin was unable to survive in the womb, and is enveloped inside the surviving twin, and it will usually look like a malformed baby growing on the surviving babies backside. This form of Teratoma affects roughly 1 in 500k infants.

This happened because there were too many people in the cemetery to bury everyone, and the church leaders claimed that if their bones became part of the church, it only made them closer to God. Nice propaganda spin there, guys.4. Buzz offThe Japanese Hornet is one the largest and most venomous hornets in the world. A sting from this bug can result in kidney failure.5. Oh Twin Brother, Where Art Thou?In 2015, a young woman began to have headaches. They discovered that she had a brain tumor, and when the doctors removed it, they were shocked to see that it was a lump resembling skin that contained bone, teeth, and hair. But this was no parasitic twin: the mass was called a “teratoma,” or “monstrous tumor.” When the woman was an embryo, some cell tissue fell off and ended up where wasn’t supposed to be, her brain. It then develop hair and teeth while the rest of her grew as normal.6. A Warrior’s BloodIn ancient Rome, some people believed that if they drank fresh, warm blood from a fallen Gladiator, they would absorb their power. They also believed that drinking blood cured epilepsy.7. Horrible Protein SmoothiesIn the 1600s, alchemists were hardcore into finding eternal life, and they came up with some pretty disgusting theories and supposed elixirs along the way. One such alchemist, John French, used to prepare a “brain tincture,” if you can guess what that was made of. He then left the mixture to sit inside of horse manure for six months, until it became a liquid and could be drunk. The worst thing of all? French had plenty of other colleagues trying out similar medicine.8. I Pray the Lord My Soul to TakeFour of the actors in the 1982 horror movie9. Six Feet UnderIn the 19th century and before, being literally buried alive was an ever-present worry, as medicine could sometimes mistake a comatose or otherwise unresponsive patient for a cadaver. Because of this, people developed “safety coffins” that would allow the buried person to alert those above ground that the corpse in the coffin was not, in fact, a corpse.10. A Boy’s Best FriendAround 1904, a boy named Robert Eugene Otto, or “Gene,” owned a strange-looking doll of a boy, who he named Robert. Robert the Doll is said to be haunted, aware of what is going on around him, and even responsible for multiple violent mishaps. Robert’s tale formed the basis for the film11. The Wonders of the Human BodyIn Philadelphia, The Mutter Museum is filled with fascinating and disgusting bits of human anatomy that have been preserved. Mutations, tumors, and medical anomalies are on full display. Just don’t go if you have a weak stomach.12. Wow, Those Look Real!Back in the 1960s, the skeletons in the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland were real. At the time, they thought that fake skeletons didn’t look scary enough. So they contacted the UCLA medical department and bought loads of skeletons that were usually used in anatomy classrooms. As time went on, fake skeletons started to look more convincing. Disney claims that they gave the real skeletons proper burials, but many speculate that there could be at least a couple real ones left over on the ride.13. What a ChatterboxJust like dolls, ventriloquist dummies have become a theme in horror movies. One of R.L. Stine’s most memorable villains is a ventriloquist’s dummy named Slappy. Well, if they creep you out, don’t go to the Ven Haven Museum in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky. It’s filled with vintage ventriloquist dummies. If you’re scared of dolls, this place is probably your worst nightmare.14. That Could Have Been Bad…In January of 2017, a 100-foot asteroid nicknamed AG13 passed by Earth. It was less than the distance of the moon, and just missed hitting our planet. Scientists only saw that it was coming roughly two days before it could have hit Earth.15. Frozen in TimeMadame Tussaud’s wax museum is famous around the world for frighteningly life-like figures of celebrities. What most people don’t know, however, is that Madame Anna Maria Tussaud got her start by rushing over to grab heads from the guillotine during the French Revolution. She used these heads to showcase her waxing process.16. Devil’s Advocate“The Devil’s Bible,” also called the Codex Gigas, is a legendary Latin manuscript that’s said to be the product of a monk’s bargain with Satan himself. In the 13th century, a monk was about to be executed for his crimes unless he could compose a single, impressive work in one night. To achieve this impossible task, the monk sold his soul to Satan and produced this 165-pound, three-feet-long book. While that’s just a legend, The Devil’s Bible17. Do I Know You?After a stroke or some sort of brain trauma, some people can develop “prosopagnosia,” also known as “facial agnosia.” This is when someone loses the ability to recognize faces. Even if it’s your best friend, you would no longer be able to distinguish a face from anything else. Many people suffering from prosopagnosia won’t even recognize themselves when looking in a mirror.18. Deadly SinsIn the Catholic religion, Purgatory is an intermediate place where souls go that is neither Heaven nor the hot place down below. In Rome, there is a small museum that claims to have documentation of hauntings from people whose souls are stuck in Purgatory, generally manifesting as a burn mark on the pages of the Bible and other objects.19. Haunted Plague IslandPoveglia, Italy is considered to be the most haunted island in the world, as untold numbers of people dying of the plague were quarantined there in the 18th century. In the 20th century, the island was then used to hold a mental asylum, and it currently lies abandoned and undeveloped. Any takers?20. Brain FoodDo you ever wonder what people did before the invention of assembly-line cups and bowls? In ancient England, people used the tops of hollowed human skulls to drink and eat.21. Do the WaveIn 1934, a mountain slide dumped heavy rocks into a lake near a town called Tafjord in Norway, a small, remote town. The slide triggered a 203-foot tsunami that hit Tafjord, killing 40 people and injuring even more. This real-life event inspired a horror movie called22. Moss DefinitelyHundreds of years ago, when people died on the battlefield or elsewhere outside, their bodies often just lay there until they rotted away. As they decomposed, their skulls would start to grow a moss called usnea. People believed that this moss contained the spiritual qualities of the fallen soldiers, and they would gather it up as medicine. Apparently, usnea that grew on hanged men’s skulls was seen as the most effective.23. Massive WavesThe biggest tsunami on record was 1,720 feet tall. It hit Lituya Bay in Alaska in 1958. Scientific evidence shows that this area is likely to be hit with another tsunami eventually.24. Don’t Judge a Book by Its CoverAt Harvard University, there is a book bound in human skin.25. A Long Time ComingAmong the Toraja people on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, when a family member dies, they aren’t immediately buried. The Toraja think of death as a process, not a sudden change, and their elaborate funerals can take place months or even years after the death. During this period, the body of the deceased is wrapped in cloth, and is thought to wander around the village until the departed person is finally officially laid to rest.26. Memento MoriVictorian England had a bunch of strange fads. For example, tattoos were very popular, especially with Victorian women. Bizarrely, post-mortem photography was also all the rage. In these photographs, people would take a recently deceased family member and stage them, either in a family portrait or alone, as if the deceased was just sleeping or resting. Sadly, these people still looked totally dead.27. Dead and DazzlingHonestly, Victorian people were really weird. In addition to being obsessed with post-mortem photography of their dead loved ones, they also liked to wear jewellery out of these deceased family members and friends, often incorporating teeth, hair, and bones into rings, necklaces, and the like.28. Bite MeIn ancient China, there was a process of making a “mellified man,” which was essentially mummifying someone with honey. In order to do this, an elderly person, ideally near death, would volunteer themselves to the process of being binge-bathed in honey, and given only honey to eat, until their entire digestive system was honey. Then, when the volunteer died, they would be covered in honey for 100 years. After this century or so, the contents were turned into a candy that was said to heal broken bones.29. Small But DeadlyThe Black Death was serious business centuries ago, and there’s a reason it became an epidemic.30. Two Can Keep a Secret if One of Them Is DeadNo one knows how famed creepy writer Edgar Allan Poe died. At least, those who did know are long since dead, and all firm records of his death have been lost. Poe was found on Baltimore’s streets on October 3, 1849. Eerily, he was wearing someone else’s clothes. He was in pretty bad shape, and died in hospital just four days later. He was never coherent enough to explain what had happened, and he kept shouting “Reynolds” the night before his death. There’s nothing left from his medical records, including even his death certificate. Speculation about the cause of his death ranges anywhere from suicide, cholera, heart disease, epilepsy, and even murder. He was only 40 years old.Source-Thanks for reading.",2 followers,Rana Ashish,12.1K,316,27M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-facts-that-are-extremely-scary-to-know

It was shortly after closed down.Sometime in the 20th century the police arrested 10 suspects believed to be spies. One of the evidences against them was a radio they used to communicate through encrypted messages sent through a number station.Also sometime in the 20th century a “painter” was arrested for the same reason. He also used a number station to send encrypted messages.So, this still may sound like a conspiracy theory, and partly it is, because the government still refuses it’s existence (wow, I hate sounding like a conspiracy theorist).

Most companies can buy work equipment and return taxes on it.Meaning Microsoft sells their software to the people that have money, and have things to lose when caught pirating and does so while avoiding most taxes, which means 100%, or close to it, of the money of sale goes to Microsoft.And Microsoft “gifts” the OS to anyone that can’t afford it, only to get the money from them later on when they do have money.","1,036 followers",Tose Nikolov,16.1K,5.4K,6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-programming-algorithm-that-you-have-ever-created

It is nearly synonymous with computer.To reiterate concisely:Without piracy, Windows might not have won the platform wars.Updated Takeaway:Windows was sold to computer manufacturers and preloaded on most computers from the mid-90s on. After your third computer you technically owned three licenses to Windows. At that point personal users' choice to pirate did not matter.5k Upvote Edit: AnecdotesBack in ‘98–01 some of the options my family and I were looking at to buy were preloaded with flavors of Linux. Go to Fry’s or Best Buy today and try to find a desktop not running Windows. Google has to buy shelf space for their ChromeOS products.Windows' dominance is tautological - it is ubiquitous because it always has been.Back when PCs were still relatively new to the consumer market and super modular (the 90s) the biggest expense for building your aunt a new PC would be the Windows license. But as the question states, “Here ya go, Aunt Betty! Gee, $50? Thanks!Linux's learning curve is virtually identical to Windows. But it is virus free. And cost free. And all software is free. There are a LOT of reasons to give Aunt Betty Ubuntu, and if it were her first PC, she would have no idea the difference!By allowing private users to get access to Windows for free means software makers would be choosing between selling to the all-free Ubuntu market or the supposedly paid-for Windows market which isIf you give away 10,000 $10 rewards cards on a busy street corner you can tell businesses ‘We have over 10,000 cardholders in this town alone!’ The businesses will buy in. It ain’t honest, it’s business. And it worked.Clarification: If you give the cards away or allow people to share their rewards card, you have retained the value of the cards. If you reduce the price to $0 you have eliminated the perceived value of the card. Piracy lets them access a larger market without losing the perceived value set by their price.Piracy worked for Windows. Bill Gates’ fortune comes from piracy as much as anything else.But you should always buy a license when you are able. It supports the businesses you love and encourages them to keep making great products.10k Upvote Edit: SecurityOne of the big dangers around pirating an Operating System is that your security may be out of date. Outdated Adobe software risks nothing, but having a copy of Windows which does not receive security patches is super risky.Pirated Windows led to WannaCry's spread in China and RussiaAs I always say,“When results matter, don't take chances.”Your Aunt Betty might lose her Freecell high scores, but your office might lose five years of accounting records. While I'm totally supportive of people using pirated software when they cannot afford to buy, I have no sympathy for businesses which make money from a tool not paying for it.If you use Photoshop to make money, buy a license!If you use it to make memes, well, have fun kiddo.15k Upvote Edit: Edits for ConcisenessRephrased for brevity, eliminated superfluous statements.Feel free to add your story of when you first installed Windows of questionable origin and helped solidify Microsoft as the #1 OS!18k Upvote Edit: Edits for Clarity & AccuracyUpdated bulleted lists, cleaned up language, general housekeeping.

If Microsoft made it impossible to buy pirated copies, some might use linux, some might use Mac and some might not buy a new PC for that year. All of those would hurt far more than losing potential revenues from that student.Those ""free"" copies create a massive pool of Windows users that attracts the whole ecosystem of developers - creating a virtuous cycle. The massive body of Windows-comfortable consumers coming to the workplace makes Windows the default standard there.In fact, the group that is usually the most angry with this pirating is Linux. Microsoft is in essence dumping free copies that takes away a huge share of Linux at the lower end of the spectrum. Sort of what Microsoft did to Netscape [by giving away free copies of Internet Explorer shipping automatically with Windows]. By being lax on piracy they get the job done [Windows for everyone] without even getting into any anti-trust trouble.Back when we were in college, IBM used to woo us by providing free software [Websphere, DB2] and free training & certification - so that we are IBM ready for the workplace. My smart anti-Microsoft classmate [who now works for Google] would remark that while IBM has to spend money on DVDs and free training, Microsoft doesn't even have to spend on DVD cost and training, for the same outcome. The pirates do that job - helping Microsoft get something that other companies spend a lot of money on.

Suppose MS has 1 million customers to whom it sells Windows at $150 a pop.BusinessesNow, businesses are a completely different thing. They buy almost exclusively volume licenses because they get a better overall deal but, here is the thing, they also buy lots of other stuff from MS, such as support incidents. Also, as they expand they upgrade, so you end up with a Windows Domain Controller, for example, and several Windows clients. Often they buy warranty, too, and other services. The bigger companies go straight out to Enterprise contracts which are a sort of all-you-can-eat buffet. They also costs a lot of money (obviously) but give customers complete peace of mind. This is where MS makes an awful lot of money.Now that we have set the stage, let’s see how MS has operated over the years.Private individualsMS has never had a really good reason to prosecute individuals: the cost of a lawsuit could well end up into the hundreds of millions, draining any profit that may come out of the segment. Worse, still, it would make MS look very bad from a PR standpoint, going after the little guy. Last, businesses are made of people, so the more people know how to use their operating systems the better chance they would advocate for Windows in the office.BusinessesThis is, instead, very different. MS has always aggressively pursued piracy from businesses, partly because they could make an example of them, partly because their Enterprise contracts keep them well in the black. Here, one lawsuit is enough to scare hundreds of small/medium businesses into compliance.Enterprises never really pirate because, for the most part, they don’t have to. As I already said, they are a sort of all-you-can-eat buffet, so there really isn’t even a financial reason to pirate software.Things have, however, changed.You may think that Linux, MacOS X, etc. have triggered the changes, but it’s not so. What triggered the change isHow did MS react to this? Well, it changed strategy.Clearly the old model wasn’t working out anymore, with the Enterprise contracts being at risk as well. That was the one thing that MS absolutely didn’t want to lose. But how do you keep paying customers who are clearly unwilling to use PCs?Well, you either do it indirectly or directly or both. Over the years, MS has offered a number of ISV (Independent Software Vendor) programs to allow new and struggling companies to use Visual Studio to create applications. Keep in mind that, while you can use apps on your phone, you can’t create them on your phone. You need a decent screen and a decent computer to do that. By incentivizing ISVs to use Visual Studio, they can keep a hold on the PC market for companies. But most of their power comes from a reinforcement cycle of private and business use, so… how can them keep a hold on private users as well? Simple: by transforming Windows in a service, i.e. a paid yearly subscription that is costlier as you go up in your needs. We are seeing this slowly happening, even though we’re not quite there yet. The various updates being pushed are, in essence, the foundation on which this Windows-as-a-service will be built. This is also why MS has tried all kinds of dirty tricks to get users updated to Windows 10.If you’ve followed the news from MS, you’ll probably wonder “what about the ads?”. Yeah, that. To understand that we need to make a foray into customer segmentation, so bear with me.Customer segmentsTo understand this, leave software aside for a minute. Consider, instead, products’ coupons. If you collect a certain number of coupons, you get some quantity of the product for free. Now here’s the thing: cutting those coupons and sticking them on a card is labour intensive and boring. Whoever does that? Old people, mostly, or people with little means. They see that as a worthy endeavour because they can get more product for essentially the same price. Also, they get coupons from family and friends who, ultimately, subsidise the purchase. Do you see where this is going? Those who are willing to spend more will subsidize those who are willing to spend less. But because the cost of the product per unit is far lower than even the cost the lowest payer pays, the company will still make more dough than it would have without coupons.This is, in fact, the perfect scenario for downloaded software: once built, the cost of download is minimal to none. You can make it available to billions of people without spending a dime more. Sure, coupons are much more difficult to manage, but that’s easily solved with service tiers: the bottom tier (which may end up being free) will have ads. The higher ones will not and will have increasingly more services. This is also the strategy used by Office by the way and it seems to be working quite well.How does all of this relate to piracy though?Quite simply, MS has understood that there’s no point trying to sue people or small companies for piracy: they can make them pay what the customer wants because then they can sell all sorts of services that are mostly profit. This means that, ultimately, nobody will be pirating Windows or Office because there will be no reason to do so.",3 followers,Pawan Kumar,928,204,840.8K,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-programming-algorithm-that-you-have-ever-created

It doesn't matter at all how fast or slow that is to access.However, the funny thing is that it turns out that computing with modern computers doesn't really give much advantage when talking about the complexity classes that are interesting today.This is because the classes themselves are generally pretty massive. The class P (polynomial time algorithms) includes linear time, n log n, n^2 algorithms, even algorithms as slow as n^k for any fixed value of k. This means that for the underlying operations to move a problem from one complexity class to another, they would need to be super-polynomially faster or slower between two versions in question.In general, they aren't. Random memory access in a real computer, especially on disk, is much slower than the “can only move one memory space at a time"" that formal machines use that I mentioned earlier. But it's not *that* much slower. Certainly not slower enough to change what complexity class you're in for the standard classes.One semi-notable exception to the above is quantum computers. They might be able to do certain operations ”faster” enough that they have their own complexity classes at the lower levels.
