Laws were passed, laws were enacted because the people of L.A. refused to put up with the status quo. Anyone who refused to be part of the solution became the problem and were quickly outed, politicians, industries and anyone else who stood in the way. Technology will not be a problem once we decide to protect ourselves. Thus far we are willing to accept the hundreds of thousands deaths that our global warming has caused. Wars, famine and diseases have not convinced us that global warming is worth the cost to reverse it. In this country we vote for politicians who claim there is no such thing as global warming. Our energy companies run ads claiming they are doing something about the problem while continue polluting. Until the people of the world refuse to suffer from the conditions that global warming causes we will be cursed with the condition. We have our military giving their lives in the Levant and Africa because of global warming. There is a better way to rid ourselves, in this country, than new technology. Vote! Vote for those who promise to do something about the problem. Stop buying gas from energy companies that aren’t investing in renewable energy. If possible buy electric vehicles. Again, VOTE! Opinion: One of the greatest problems facing the elimination of the effects of global warming is abortion. People who are pro life tend to vote for the very people who either don’t believe there is global warming or who are on the payroll of the companies that contribute to the problem. There are not enough natural disasters, or wars or famines, or shortening of life that will stop global warming unless we, the people, put a stop to it. If you want to stop the catastrophe that lies just ahead of us, you stop contributing and then make our government pass laws to stop all of us who won’t stop contributing to the problem. After that our country will have to help other countries stop their pollution. We withdrew from the Paris Accords, if you think that helps the problem then vote that way. On the other hand if you believe that was stupid and contributes to the problem then vote that way. Voting is not a right it is an obligation.","246,825 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Wars-are-often-a-source-of-technological-challenge-leading-to-innovation-Will-the-ecological-crisis-have-the-same-impact-over-the-next-10-years

If I can’t remember them, then why would I recommend them?For each one of these books: either they made me a better person, or I felt, even as I was reading them, that my IQ was getting better. Or, in the case of fiction, I felt like my writing was getting better by reading the book.Or I simply escaped to another world. I like to travel to other worlds. To pretend to be a character in someone else’s story.I think if you can find even one takeaway in a book that you remember afterwards, then it’s a great book.Remember: It’s hard to remember more than 1% of a book.Time is the ultimate judge of wisdom. How you bounce back from misery and despair in order to thrive.

And now that your hormones are raging, you have to figure things out with absentee parents and friends that are disgusted with you.You have to begin to piece together the jigsaw puzzle of why this crazy chaotic universe that started so long ago has now finally invited you to the party.I read about 200 books a year. I don’t say this to brag. If anything, it’s embarrassing. I don’t remember most of the books I read.And what I do remember I usually steal and plagiarize for my own writing. Or the books are research for a podcast that I forget immediately after I do a podcast.So I can say a lot of books have changed my life. Books I read yesterday changed my life today.These are the 40 books that changed my life.But I have to go back to age 15, when I was pimply and scared and shy and afraid and beginning to learn the mythology of failure.The book that saved me was “Illusions: Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah” by Richard Bach, who was also the author of the classic “Jonathan Livingston Seagull”.I reread this book quite a bit. Maybe once a year.Here’s what I learned:Don’t take yourself too seriously. Don’t take other people too seriously. Don’t take the sun, and the moon, and the stars so seriously.Life is about freedom. Seriousness chains you. Be light. Be caring. Be good. Then there are less things to be serious about.What happens when you are free from the illusion?Magic happens. Coincidences happen. More things are funny. And laughter extends life.When you are not so serious, you realize there are more people worth of love.Meaning is joy. Meaning is “sleep soundly at night”.How stupid we are: insignificant brats that came 15 billion years late to the party and think we know something.Hence, “Illusions” - respect for the mystery of it all. Be bewildered. Be confused. Be a wanderer. Explore.We’re all reluctant messiahs.I was 15, scarred from cysts, parents that ignored me, bullies that beat on me so much I wouldn’t go to the cafeteria or bathroom during school hours, I’d cut school to wander around in crime-stricken bankrupt New York City. It was safer than being at school.But it was an illusion. And I was free. I hope I always keep that feeling of freedom that was gifted to me by that one book I read when I was 15.Related Post:","284,846 followers",James Altucher,1K,878,91.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Ive-just-read-The-Next-100-Years-by-George-Friedman-the-CEO-of-Stratfor-What-other-accessible-to-the-non-expert-books-are-there-covering-possible-cultural-technological-and-geopolitical-trends-for-the-next-century

The last vestiges of “phone” technology is perhaps the circuit-switched voice connection, which ended with 3G cellular radio, a technology that’s end-of-lifed by most network providers, with sunsetting maybe starting soon (Verizon was going to pull the “plug” by January of 2020, but they gave it an extra year).You might also note that these pocket personal computers have obsoleted, or at least eaten into much of the market for not just POTS/landline phones, but pagers, SatNavs, most classes of consumer cameras and camcorders, PDAs, media players, payphones, scanners, photo albums, books, magazines, address books and rolodexes, televisions, voice recorders, notepads, business cards, flashlights, calculators, alarm clocks, barcode scanners, watches, calendars, newspapers, webcams, credit cards, dayplanners, radios, compasses, Gameboys, walkie-talkies, timers, sketchpads, guitar tuners, airline tickets, and even, to an extent, big computers.So what’s the future evolution of pocket computers? Well, let’s take a look at what made the smartphone so successful as a personal computer itself. There was a time, when I was a kid at least, when a computer wasThis changed fundamentally with the personal computer. The personal computer wasPocket computers started a bit before smartphones, but once you got smartphones, personal computing changed fromSo asking where smartphones are going is essentially the same thing as asking where personal computing is going. The easy answer: bigger, better, faster, more. Bigger not necessarily a matter of size of of scope — you can buy a $50 smartphone today, and you can buy a $2500 smartphone. Every year, some company or another tries out a new peripheral or two. Apple put a scanning LIDAR device in the iPhone 12 Pro… a bunch of companies made folding phones. Those that are well received get accepted by the public catch on, the others, not so much. But smartphones, like PCs before them, are mature enough that you don’t see too many big jumps in technology anymore. Which is not a bad thing given the cost of upgrades… unless you’re one of the companies making them.Nathan BrittWe see this with smartwatches, too. They do afford a bit of additional convenience over the phone. Actually, before the pandemic, I wasn’t very kind to the idea of the smartwatch: do I really need to save myself the arduous journey of my hand to my pocket. But since I got a smart watch (a simple one, the Honor Magic Watch 2), I’ve reconsidered. The smartwatch means I can answer phone calls without the “where did I leave my phone” question, I can enter those 2-way authentication codes, etc. It’s really the same thing asBut I specifically mentioned Nathan because he brought up smart glasses. We saw that with Google’s Glass project. Everyone thinks Google Glass just vanished, but in fact, no, it didn’t. The Google Glass Enterprise Edition 2 still exists, for various business uses. It’s still very much a first step. Glass gives you Android, a low resolution heads-up display at the periphery of one eye, a camera, and a small battery built into a pair of glasses. So it’s basically a very low end smartphone-like device, the main advantage being that it’s hands-free. This wasn’t ever going to be a hit, in this form, with consumers. But you have to start somewhere.The other end of the spectrum is the Microsoft HoloLens. This is a $3,500 PC for your head that, oh-by-the-way, offers full augmented reality by way of scanning lasers creating a visual overlay. And yet, even the HoloLens isn’t perfect… the eye box (the area of overlapping image) is about 52 degrees in HoloLens 2… you can fall off the edge of your AR pretty easily. But it’s a full fledged, smartphone-like computer, containing a Snapdragon 850, typical phone RAM and Flash, etc. But it’s bulky and weights over 0.5kg.And still, this one’s important because it’s not justThis would affect other products, too. When I can call up a virtual monitor tha floats wherever I want it, at sufficient resolution, my need for real monitors is greatly reduced. And the whole concept of an operating system changes. Rather than calling up apps from a menu, our most-used apps will present at virtual objects in our environment. Move from the livingroom to the kitchen, office, car, etc. and you’ll have different virtual objects, representing the ask-for apps useful in those situations. But we’ll also have more automatic apps, things that engage based on what we’re doing.And it’s quite possible that’s a large a change as the smartphone was in the first place. If not fundamentally more. Give that device five years of mainstream use and the idea of picking up a screen will look as quaint as a person typing into a big desktop computer does today (he says, typing into his big desktop computer).The problem, of course, is in the details: how do we get an advanced computer, display, radio, and battery into a thing you’re going to be willing to wear for 8–12 hours a day? How much of our regular set of smartphone peripherals migrate there? And how will society react in an era when pretty much everyone might be recording everything all the time (because we will for AR, the computer analyzing what we see, even if we don’t save it). We’ll be wearing these while driving… as long as it’s you and me driving and not robots, that makes all of those cellphone problems all the worse, because we’re already holding the device. The greater the actual value, the greater the impact on society and the number of new problems we’re likely to encounter and, maybe, decide to deal with.I do imagine at some point the major jump would be fromRead MoreVerizon 3G Network Shutdown","41,191 followers",Dave Haynie,929,6.9K,95.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Wars-are-often-a-source-of-technological-challenge-leading-to-innovation-Will-the-ecological-crisis-have-the-same-impact-over-the-next-10-years
