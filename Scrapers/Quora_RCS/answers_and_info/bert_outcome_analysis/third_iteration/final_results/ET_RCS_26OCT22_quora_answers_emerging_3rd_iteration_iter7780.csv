Fission, by contrast, generates a vast cocktail of products with a hugely varied chemical and radiological spectrum, requiring a range of cleanup and defence mechanisms.While fusion is not totally clean and safe, it is orders of magnitude below fission in worst-case consequences.","220,646 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,783.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-we-use-nuclear-fission-to-boost-nuclear-fusion
4,"It doesn’t, not atom per atom. As other answers to this question point out, a typical fission reaction releases about 200 MeV of energy. (If you don’t know what MeV means, don’t worry about that for now.)A typical fusion reaction releases about 18 MeV. That’s less than 10% of the energy released by fission!However, if you have equal weights of fuel, then the energy released by fusion is greater. That’s because one atom of U-235 has a mass of 235 nuclei, whereas the mass of D + T has the mass of 5 nuclei. That’s a factor of 47 less weight.

The fusion core emits a large number of fast neutrons, and these neutrons are capable of causing fission in ordinary U-238. So the fusion core in such a bomb is surrounded by U-238, and the induced fission gives about half of the energy. It also gives almost all of the fallout. So in the neutron bomb, this layer is omitted, resulting in much less fallout. The emitted neutrons, which can kill anyone nearby, give the neutron bomb its name.If you are still concerned about what MeV means, it is a unit of energy that is very useful for nuclear reactions. It means “one million eV” where the eV (or “electron volt”) is an energy unit equal to 1.6 x10^-19 joules.","220,646 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,783.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-we-use-nuclear-fission-to-boost-nuclear-fusion
5,"Will fusion live up to its promise to provide nearly infinite very cheap energy?Yes, the ultimate potential of D-D Fusion is very great -Fusion Energy from the D-D fusion reaction longer than the earth has existed or the sun will burnThe complete conversion of deuterium nuclear fuel releases an energy content of 250 x 10^15 joules per metric ton of deuterium. The quantity of deuterium in the world’s oceans is estimated at 4.6 x 10^13 metric tons. Deuterium present in seawater will yield around 5 x 10^11 TW-years of energy. In the year 2017 the entire planet consumed around 17 TW-years of energWill fusion live up to its promise to provide nearly infinite very cheap energy?Yes, the ultimate potential of D-D Fusion is very great -Fusion Energy from the D-D fusion reaction longer than the earth has existed or the sun will burnThe complete conversion of deuterium nuclear fuel releases an energy content of 250 x 10^15 joules per metric ton of deuterium. The quantity of deuterium in the world’s oceans is estimated at 4.6 x 10^13 metric tons. Deuterium present in seawater will yield around 5 x 10^11 TW-years of energy. In the year 2017 the entire planet consumed around 17 TW-years of energy, which means that the energy content of the deuterium in seawater would be enough for 29.5 billion years of energy supply.To give all 10 billion people expected to live on the planet in 2050 the level of energy prosperity we in the developed world are used to, a continuous average use of power of 6 kilowatts per person as is typical in Europe, we would need to generate 60 terawatts as a planet—the equivalent of 900 million barrels of oil per day.The time since the earth first formed = 4.54 billion years.The time until the sun burns out = 5 billion years.The deuterium in the sea is capable of completely powering planet earth at a level of 60 Terawatts for 8.33 billion years(longer than the earth has existed or the sun will burn).------Large tokamak magnetic fusion designers often tend to discount the deuterium-deuterium (D-D) fusion reaction because it is not possible to achieve the necessary fusion reaction rates and break-even energy with D-D fusion using tokamaks and stellarator devices such as we currently are able build. The situation is different, however, with Inertial Confinement Fusion which typically employs a fusion plasma that are literally 10^11 times more dense than the typical ion plasma densities used in MCF tokamaks or stellarators.The power than can be drawn from a plasma at fusion conditions is proportional to the second power of the plasma ion density. Even small improvements in plasma ion density will result in significant improvements in the performance of a fusion experiment.There is an impressively large Range of plasma density in current and planned fusion experimentsThere is literally a factor of 10^10 to 10^11 difference in plasma ion density between MCF and ICF fusion experiments. This large difference has implications for commercial fusion technology as the denser the plasma, the more power that can be realized from a fusion burn and the smaller the physical fusion reactor can be while achieving fusion energy with energy gain.The D-D reaction takes place at higher temperatures than can typically be achieved in magnetic confinement tokamaks and typically has a lower fusion cross section leading to lower fusion reaction rates on earth relative to D-T fusion .D-D fusion is more complex and proceeds with multiple fusion side reactions, but when all of the side-chains run to completion, D-D fusion actually produces more energy than D-T fusion per starting mass of reactants. D-D fusion produces T and He3, which in a secondary reaction burn with D. This was practically demonstrated in early thermonuclear tests like the 10 Megaton Ivy Mike fission triggered deuterium experimental test in 1952.D-D fusion does normally produce TritiumD-D Fusion of Deuterium fuel produces energy through four reactions:D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeVD + D -> T + p + 4.03 MeV(side chains)D + T -> He-4 + n + 17.588 MeVHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThe net effect of these four fusion reactions taken together is:6 D -> 2 He-4 + 2p + 2n + 43.243 MeV-------Fusion and neutronsDT and DD fusion release large amounts of their fusion energy in the form of fast neutrons.The task of shielding fast neutrons requires• Fast Neutrons (E >1 MeV) must first be thermalized with highneutron scattering materials (typically materials that have a high percentage of light atoms like hydrogen)• These thermal neutrons can then be absorbed or shielded with material having high cross sections for neutron absorptionAbsorption of thermalized neutrons can be done by relatively light materials like polyethylene plastic unlike gamma radiation that require lots of high-z material (lead, concrete, water) to absorb the penetrating gamma.LLNL's Dr. Ralph Moir has pioneered several molten salt fusion reactor concepts (HyLife II and PACER Revisited). A thick liquid falling wall of molten salt loaded with a neutron absorber like 50 micron particles of Boron Carbide as a slurry can absorb damaging fast neutrons. Such a thick falling wall of molten salt can effectively protect fusion chamber structure and largely prevent neutron activation of fusion reactor materials. This permits molten salt ICF fusion reactors to have long 30+ year commercial lifetimes and to at reactor end of life produce little or no neutron activated waste.Slide comparing fission and various fusion reactions from Professor Gerald KulcinskiThere are actually rather good reasons to believe that when nuclear fusion is commercially introduced, it will in short order form the basis of very commercially competitive power plants that will deliver reliable, cheap energy to all in the world that need energy.Fusion’s near term commercial potential -Not all approaches to nuclear fusion will have identical commercial characteristics. Some approaches to nuclear fusion will not in the end be able to produce any actual energy beyond what is required to operate the fusion experiment and as a result will effectively become fusion research dead ends. Other fusion approaches including some that currently receive high levels of funding and international support may ultimately reach break-even energy, but these approaches to fusion may after scaling end up to extraordinarily complex and impractically huge size may end up being uncompetitive with fossil fuel and renewable energy power plants. Such a large experimental fusion physics demonstration may perhaps be built only a single time as a kind of technology proof of principle, but then go no further and never get built in any significant numbers by communities needing cost competitive electrical power.Plasma Density matters when competing to produce cheap energy -Approaches to fusion that routinely use very low density plasma, like tokamaks (ITER) and stellarators (W7-x) will have to be physically larger and contain a much greater volume of fusion plasma than fusion devices that routinely operate on denser plasma. There is literally a 10^11 difference in operating plasma density at fusion conditions between Magnetic Confinement Fusion (MCF) devices like tokamaks and stellarators and Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) Experiments like NIF. This is a huge natural competitive advantage to ICF fusion in terms of potential commercial competitiveness.Comparison between the fusion chamber volume of an Inertial Confinement Fusion experiment (NIF) versus a Magnetic Confinement Fusion experiment (ITER) -(notice man in lower right corner for scale)Those who advocate Magnetic Confinement fusion devices will be quick to point out however that ICF fusion currently requires a large stationary football field sized laser fusion driver to ignite the small high plasma density ICF fusion capsules. This is true, but the size and the cost of ICF laser fusion drivers is dropping very rapidly (and the cost of ICF laser fusion drivers are also dropping at a rapid rate) and the impact of the laser fusion driver is destined to be a shrinking contributor to ICF fusion power plant physical size and cost.The power that a pulse laser fusion driver can deliver has increased roughly by a factor of 1000 every decade for the last 40 years. This is in fact a stronger sustained technical advance than even Moore’s law (transistors on a CPU chip).Cost of fusion power generators that can operate using high density fusion plasma -As previously mentioned, the physically smallest and least costly commercial fusion power plants of the future will probably operate using the highest density fusion plasma. Approaches to fusion that cannot operate on a least medium density plasma (10^18 ions/cm^3) will probably not be able to compete, head to head, with fossil fuel or renewable energy power plants.LPP Fusion is currently a private sector small fusion leader in the quest for fusion and is expected to use medium density fusion plasma in their Dense Plasma Focus fusion device. LPP Fusion has produced the following slide as a cost goal for their small modular commercial fusion device.These is a respectably low and impressive cost estimate for small fusion.The Department of Energy EIA's findings suggest that natural gas–fired power plants are cheaper to build with overnight capital costs ranging fromLPP Fusion’s DPF device would be 10X or more cheaper to build and would produce 10X cheaper electricity than the cheapest current form of natural gas power plant.ICF fusion power plants that use the densest fusion plasma have the potential to be the most cost competitive of all small fusion approaches when the technology becomes commercially available.As fusion power plants advance to commercial reality over the next decade, they should improve in power density and decrease in cost.Small Fusion: step by step ferociously, one step at a time.Effort to bring fusion to commercial reality will be rewarded.The investment in fusion technology will be justified and the low cost power that fusion will generate will lift billions of people around the world currently without any access to electricity out of chronic grinding poverty and want.","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-we-use-nuclear-fission-to-boost-nuclear-fusion
6,"I used to work on fusion simulation codes (particle in cell) with the US National Labs when I was at NVIDIA, and I was very interested in seeing if we could solve the problems with fusion and picked the scientist and engineers' brains endlessly. My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that thereI used to work on fusion simulation codes (particle in cell) with the US National Labs when I was at NVIDIA, and I was very interested in seeing if we could solve the problems with fusion and picked the scientist and engineers' brains endlessly. My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,202.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-we-use-nuclear-fission-to-boost-nuclear-fusion

If you split nuclei heavier than this, you can get energy out. But to go past the minimum you have to put energy in, not get it out.

The fusion core emits a large number of fast neutrons, and these neutrons are capable of causing fission in ordinary U-238. So the fusion core in such a bomb is surrounded by U-238, and the induced fission gives about half of the energy. It also gives almost all of the fallout. So in the neutron bomb, this layer is omitted, resulting in much less fallout. The emitted neutrons, which can kill anyone nearby, give the neutron bomb its name.If you are still concerned about what MeV means, it is a unit of energy that is very useful for nuclear reactions. It means “one million eV” where the eV (or “electron volt”) is an energy unit equal to 1.6 x10^-19 joules.",2 followers,Eugenio Peraza,684,4.7K,2.7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-we-use-nuclear-fission-to-boost-nuclear-fusion

It is an enormous undertaking, on the order of the International Space Station or CERN, but politics and terrible mis-management have continued to plague the progress. A very major change was instituted about 2 years ago, and things have greatly improved since.In any case ITER’s importance cannot be over-stated: there would be no hope for fusion as a potential energy source for mankind without all the research work done worldwide “in support of ITER”. Last month, for example, the 7th (annual) ITER Business Forum was held, with over 1000 (!) delegates attending, from 436 companies and 25 countries. Last October the IAEA (Vienna) organized its 29th FEC - Fusion Energy Conference - in Kyoto (the location changes each time); more than 1400 delegates and over 800 research papers were presented.But fusion energy is much more than ITER. ITER has been the most important catalyst for hundreds of laboratories all over the world, doing work to make fusion happen. In China, in Korea and in Japan are very important world-scale experimental devices, and they will open the path to fusion electricity. In Europe there is very significant activity in almost every country - but especially in the UK, France, Germany and Switzerland. Very unfortunately the US is falling behind, and while the science of fusion has progressed largely due to earlier US activity, and current ideas in the US are at the leading edge, government funding has essentially dried up and private sector funding, while in principle is around, none has been invested in serious fusion technology.Now to your original question: the state of current fusion energy research. In principle there is really only one general method that might prove successful in the medium term, and that is magnetic confinement fusion (MCF) of a deuterium/tritium mixture at very high temperatures. Probably 80–90% of the world’s fusion research is on MCF. Temperatures of 150 million degrees, super-conducting magnets, tritium breeding/storage/isolation, first wall blankets, divertors, plasma facing materials and other aspects of the exciting fusion future - we can do these things!And when it happens - when fusion electricity can be made - imagine a world where the fuel for energy weighs one ten-millionth that of the equivalent of coal, and that fuel comes from seawater! Imagine a world with zero-carbon electricity production (and no other greenhouse gas emissions), with no possible explosion, with virtually no radioactive waste, with no oil pipelines or coal-miners dying on a daily basis.“If all this is true why don’t we have it now?” An excellent question.

Also, scientists need several years of testing the device with normal hydrogen before slowly moving to a deuterium and tritium mix that will achieve full power. It's a relatively slow process, requiring numerous tests to ensure that the device is stable and safe.The next step is a prototype fusion power plant, DEMO, to be built in the 2030s if things go as planned. This device, larger than ITER, will attempt to demonstrate that a stable fusion power plant is feasible. Showing that fusion is economically viable is the next step.A discussion of fusion research would be incomplete without mention of the other viable mechanism for controlled fusion, inertial confinement, which uses multiple lasers fired on a pellet of deuterium and tritium to compress and heat the fuel to the necessary density and temperature for fusion chain reactions. Two facilities employing this method are the National Ignition Facility (NIF) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Ignition_Facility) and Laser Mégajoule (LMJ) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LMJ). NIF is operating at LLNL in California, and LMJ will be completed in France in 2012. Inertial confinement is currently much less efficient than magnetic confinement, but a ""fast ignition"" device, HiPER (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HiPER), claims it will produce fusion gains of 72, far surpassing ITER. HiPER is still in the planning phase, and will probably not be complete before 2020.I'll conclude with a few reasons fusion has been so elusive for the past several decades. Numerous plasma instabilities require large and complicated devices to maintain a stable, high-temperature (100 million K) plasma. Furthermore, sudden disruptions in the plasma cause the walls to be bombarded by this hot gas and dust, and it is hard to find materials that can withstand this repeated abuse. Likewise, scientists must learn to prevent these disruptions as they will be even more powerful in larger devices. For inertial confinement, different instabilities require incredibly powerful and symmetric laser pulses to achieve fusion. More powerful, efficient lasers with the ability to fire at about 10 Hz are required for viable power plants. Each confinement method faces a plethora of other problems to be solved, and I don't have the expertise to go into much more detail. Fusion scientists have made great progress, and they continue to make progress on these many challenges.Original answer from August, 2010.

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,202.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-we-use-nuclear-fission-to-boost-nuclear-fusion

The H- bomb, of course, is typically portrayed as ""uncontrolled"" release of fusion energy using a relatively small fission (A-bomb) trigger. What the Pacer project envisioned was the regular deto­nation of very small fusion bursts optimized for ultra-clean cost effective power generation in carefully designed, steam-filled caverns one mile underground, producing enormous amounts of electricity and, if desired, fissile material for startup of exceptionally clean operating fission reactors like Thorium Molten Salt Reactors or LFTRs.Most appealing about this approach presented by Dr. Seifritz is that there are only minor scientific and technical obstacles to the reali­zation of a Pacer-like power generating systems for harnessing fission-fusion and with only a few additional years of development, pure fusion energy. PACRER fission-fusion power plants could be undertaken immediately, on the basis of field proven existing technology and know-how, guaranteeing com­mercial fusion power within five years in a time frame that matters for solving worldwide climate and energy scarcity problemsWhy were PACER power plants, which would actually been 100X cleaner in terms of production of Minor Actinides and fission product high level nuclear waste, canceled by the Nixon Administration?President Nixon had made campaign promises to the American people to rein in federal spending, and the Nixon Administration searched for ways to trim spending. Leading edge nuclear fusion research, unfortunately, came to the attention of Nixon Administration budget managers and several visionary nuclear technologies then under development including Molten Salt Fission Reactors and PACER fusion were cut as President Nixon tried to keep his promise to the American people in reining in federal spending.In addition, environmental and ""nonproliferation"" arguments were put forward in Congress intending to force discontinuation of the Pacer projects at LANL and LLNL. These arguments, however, lacked technical validity.The underground mounted PACER reactor could be located far away from any community, operate very safely in a conservatively designed underground PACER cavern, and pose no nuclear haz­ards to populated areas of the globe while safely and sustainably producing ultra-clean DD fusion power used to produce commercial electricity.Dr. Ralph Moir led LLL efforts into producing PACER reactors in the mid-1970s.Modern versions of PACER would probably use pure fusion technology.A pure fusion peaceful nuclear explosive (PNE) optimized for ultra-clean power generation is a nuclear device design that does not need a fission ""primary"" to ignite fusion in a secondary stage but rather employs a pure fusion deuterium-tritium primary to ignite a pure deuterium power generating second stage.Pure fusion ICF devices produce small controlled bursts of fusion energy inside of 100 meter deep underground mounted evacuated mini-PACER cavity. When such a small fusion device is initiated inside its stainless steel cylindrical chamber, no shock and no sound is transmitted to the ground above.Vacuum will not permit transmission of sound.Vacuum will not permit transmission of shock.The mini-PACER device produces the Tritium it needs for the DT primary from Tritium produced via the D-D fusion reaction on the preceding shot. Tritium (190 milligrams) need only be supplied from an external source one time on the very first shot. All shots made in the mini-PACER reactor thereafter can be provided from Tritium bred in the reactor from residual Tritium scavenged from the fusion chamber debris left by previous D-D fusion shots. Thus Tritium supply is cheap and sustainable with the modern pure fusion form of PACER ICF; the vast majority of fusion energy produced by the mini-PACER reactor each shot is from cheap and ubiquitous Deuterium fuel separated from sea water.National governments have tended to respond with unreasonable fear to fusion reactor designs that produce power in short controlled fusion bursts. Much less technically mature and more difficult tokamak and stellarator reactors have for decades received funding preferentially over practical demonstrated ICF fusion approaches because they promised smooth power generation from extended continuous fusion burns as opposed to a series of many short, controlled fusion bursts. The reality is that tokamaks and stellarator fusion devices have not in 60 years attained burns producing any significant amount of power for more than a few seconds before the plasma confinement is lost and the fusion reaction stops.Reliable, repeatable, small controlled fusion bursts inside an evacuated chamber designed to safely contain all the radiation generated by fusion reactions is just as safe as the safest magnetic confinement continuous burn experiment. In all cases, the fusion reactions used are the same. Nuclear waste generated are in all cases also the same. Tiny mini-Mike fusion devices are harmless if stolen as they require large stationary lasers or ion beam particle accelerators to ignite them.Underground ICF pure fusion power generation is just as safe as the safest form of fusion that anyone has so far proposed and is a lot more rapidly implementable.Note 1: DOE during the cold war had a well funded and well led program to develop pure fusion experimental devices.(It 	may now be revealed)DOE published in 2001 the following document -RESTRICTED DATA DECLASSIFICATION DECISIONS 1946 TO THE PRESENThttp://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/rdd-7.htmlcontained in section C of that document are the following facts:Information on the DOE's pure fusion program:(1) Fact that the DOE made a substantial investment in the past to develop a pure fusion experimental explosive device(2) That the U.S. does not have and is not developing a pure fusion weapon; and(3) That no credible design for a pure fusion weapon resulted from the DOE investment. (98-15)(Point 3 may be disputed -Note 2:controlled and uncontrolled –but is this really true?Is there in reality two types of fusion?It is said that in uncontrolled nuclear fusion, vast amounts of energy in uncontrolled manner is released causing destruction only—the hydrogenbomb is an example. Thus uncontrolled nuclear fusion is not viewed as something of use for constructive purpose.It is perceived that in controlled nuclear fusion, the vast energy of fusion reactions is released steadily so it can be used for peaceful purposes, say, for nuclear fusion reactors.But is there really a differenceor is it just a perception?Is it perhaps true that there is really only one type of fusion and depending on the technology and the amount of fuel you use, you get a more or less rapid release of fusion energy.The truth is that during the 1950s, fusion program managers wanting to develop fusion reactors like tokamaks and stellarators sought to dissociate themselves and their fusion technology (good) from thermonuclear fusion weapons technology (bad) which the public feared. The notion of controlled versus uncontrolled fusion was largely public relations and spin employed by AEC fusion program managers to enlist wider public support.While the smoothness and the time of release of energy from fusion may be different, the fusion reactions (Deuterium Tritium or Deuterium-Deuterium) are all the same and the waste products produced (helium and neutrons) are all the same.","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-we-use-nuclear-fission-to-boost-nuclear-fusion
18,"The first answer is wrong in the sense that something undergoing fusion will cause fusion to occur in nearby stuff. the problem with fusion is containment. Most fusion experiments use an exceedingly hot plasma at around 100 million degrees K. This plasma must be contained without touching anything otherwise it will cool too much and fusion will stop.

ITER, currently being built should be the first fusion reactor that will produce more energy than it uses over a sustained time period. The follow on from ITER should the first fusion reactor to be producing electricity and connected to a grid.

A lot of problems become power problems if you have enough cheap power; that is, things we think of as social problems or resource problems or political problems are easily solved with massive amounts of cheap, non-polluting energy.Let’s take one trivial example: water.Modern wars are fought for oil. Future wars will be fought for clean water; in fact, we’re already starting to see that now.But cheap fusion power? Cheap power makes water an inexhaustible resource. We can make fresh water from seawater; we don’t often do so because it requires absolutely prodigious amounts of energy. Cheap, nonpolluting energy solves water resource problems.Transportation! Modern transportation relies on oil. If you buy a plane ticket, most of the money you spend on it goes, not to the plane, not to maintenance, not to staff, but to jet fuel.Small fusion reactors in aircraft can cut the cost of air travel into one-third to one-fifth what it is now. And that doesn’t even consider that a plane can haul more people if you don’t have to carry all that jet fuel!Lockheed Martin is spending money in fusion research for this exact reason.

21,"As others explained, making nuclear fusion happen is relatively easy.But that kind of misses the point.

How slowly? It produces less than 300 watts of heat per cubic meter. That’s comparable to… a well-maintained compost pile. Its less than the power density of our human metabolism.That’s all. That’s what you get when you lump enough mass to make more than 300,000 Earths.We obviously do not have 300,000 spare Earths to play with, and it would not be very practical either. So we cannot use gravitational confinement. We are trying to use other means to confine the fusion fuel for sustained fusion.And we aren’t simply trying to mimic the Sun. We want to do better. After all, for a practical fusion power generating station, we want to be able to produce a lot more power, perhaps up to a few hundred megawatts of raw thermal power per cubic meter inside the reactor. So we are trying to best the Sun by a factor of a million, give or take.That is hard. That is, if I may use somewhat unprofessional language, damn hard. Insanely hard.Which is why, nearly 70 years after the first uncontrolled fusion explosion (aka. hydrogen bomb) here on the Earth, we still do not have working fusion power stations.I thank my generous supporters on","220,646 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,783.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-we-use-nuclear-fission-to-boost-nuclear-fusion
