1,"The Modular PhoneCloud computingThe Microsoft HololensAugmented reality of any kind in a headset or other wearable form.My best guesses, based on upcoming and developing tech. Could be another round of fidget spinners for all we know. My bet is on AR, or if something big were to come out of the blue; whatever would trump the smartphone somehow. Also 5G networking may be a possibility for next year. Keep tuned! :3","246,848 followers",Dushka Zapata,957,8.5K,232.4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-best-upcoming-gadgets-in-2018

3,No… Acc to me its a big No.. B’coz CS and IT are evergreen field.. you can say that its overcrowded due to which competition is more but value will remain same.Only the thing left are skills you have… its all upto you..,380 followers,Ankur Saxena,849,56,266.8K,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-are-best-upcoming-gadgets-in-2018
4,"Nobody can answer your question because “…probably make their way into electric cars,” is such a high standard that almost all battery “breakthroughs” fail to reach it.Presently, every alternate chemistry for rechargeable batteries has one or more massive hurdles to overcome…that they may never overcome.An EV battery has to have high power/kg, high power/liter, operate well from -20 degrees C to 45 C, resist catching fire, resist shaking and shock damage, be made out of plentiful elements, charge quickly, last for thousands of charge/recharge cycles, lose very little charge per day while idle,Nobody can answer your question because “…probably make their way into electric cars,” is such a high standard that almost all battery “breakthroughs” fail to reach it.Presently, every alternate chemistry for rechargeable batteries has one or more massive hurdles to overcome…that they may never overcome.An EV battery has to have high power/kg, high power/liter, operate well from -20 degrees C to 45 C, resist catching fire, resist shaking and shock damage, be made out of plentiful elements, charge quickly, last for thousands of charge/recharge cycles, lose very little charge per day while idle, return most of the energy put into it, last for a decade, be readily mass-produced, and have a cost at or below $100/KwHr (because that’s where the market leaders will be in a year).So what candidates are being heavily researched to meet that?The good news is that there is so much research going into solving these problems that someone is bound to at least improve on the status quo, if not double or triple it. Once proven, they’ll likely take 3–5 years to get from the lab to a shipping EV.The status quo keeps getting better, too, so leading edge is a moving target. Panasonic/Tesla keep improving their cell charge density by about 10% per year, so by the time any of these breakthroughs breakthrough, they could be 30–50% better or cheaper.",3 followers,Steve Baker,6.5K,27.4K,163.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-best-upcoming-gadgets-in-2018
5,"Maybe Zinc-Nickel or Zinc-Air or Zinc-waterAdvantages: Less prone to fire if malfunctioning, same energy efficiency as Li-ion, cheaper to produce, more readily available materials (Zinc instead of Li)Disadvantages: More advanced structure to withstand charging cycles - from what I have gathered, that’s where the most challenges are and batteries with catalysts etc are not fully tested or implemented in real life yet",3 followers,Steve Baker,4K,27.4K,163.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-best-upcoming-gadgets-in-2018

And it’s true, they have massive amounts of data storage. NobodySince it’s now 2020, we can scientifically multiply this by 10x to ballpark that Google has about 150 exabytes of storage capacity, in various form-factors. In fact, we can be generous, and include all the Google Cloud Platform storage, and double it, to get a nice, round 300 exabytes of storage.That’s a lot! That’s close to 50GB for every human on earth. Google has been aggregating, sorting and storing data for two full decades. But remarkably, the LHC at CERN could produce this much dataIf we wanted to keep all 30 million events per second we would need about 2,000 petabytes to store a typical 12-hour run. For a typical running year of 150 days uptime, this would mean almost 400,000 PetaByte =The “events” described here are particle collisions. The layman’s explanation of what’s going on at the Large Hadron Collider (and to be clear, IOf course, CERN can’t actually store or process 400 exabytes of data; the data is filtered down to a “measly” ~125 PB per year, for a total archival capacity of about 330 PB,The LHC experiments produce about 90 petabytes of data per year, and an additional 25 petabytes of data are produced per year for data from other (non-LHC) experiments at CERNThis involves not only scientific data – about 330 petabytes (330 million gigabytes) of data as of the beginning of 2019 from past and present high-energy physics experiments – but also many other types, including photographs, videos, minutes, memoranda, web pages, etc330 PB, while not Google-scale, is still an enormous quantity of data. And best of all, it’s being put to good use — helping us understand the fundamental physical laws of the universe.*Probably. Maybe. Nobody outside of Google can actually tell us what fraction of the data they ingest is permanently shunted onto cold storage or for how long.","12,843 followers",Bradley Voytek,651,193,4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-best-upcoming-gadgets-in-2018
