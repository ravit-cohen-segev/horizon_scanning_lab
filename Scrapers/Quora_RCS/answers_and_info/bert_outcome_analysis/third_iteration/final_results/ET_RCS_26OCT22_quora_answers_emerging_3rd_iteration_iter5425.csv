The shortage of qualified experienced work force limits what we can achieved, but the lack of training limits us more. Industry no longer trains its employee but hire young trained software engineers knowing that in five years they will be obsolete. It is cheaper to hire than to train especially when software engineers jump from job to job.Bottom line: It is called the ""American know how"" based on our survival as a nation. It is not what we know but what we can know. To keep up with innovations and/or technologies, we need to adapt. And to fill the gaps we need to train.See",1 follower,Gordon Strathdee,4K,783,12.2M,2014,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-key-skill-gaps-in-the-United-States-that-must-be-filled-in-order-for-the-workforce-to-keep-pace-with-emerging-innovations-or-technologies
1,"The US is the most technologically advanced nation there ever was, so obviously not! I had the privilege of living there for 4 years in the 90s. It was a little like a sci-fi movie when someone gets transported to the future - I would just wander about gazing at the technological marvels that surrounded me. Just to pick out some of the highlights:1) Domestic life - I was once visiting a friend’s house and their mother happened to be loading clothes into the washing machine.

Just to pick out some of the highlights:1) Domestic life - I was once visiting a friend’s house and their mother happened to be loading clothes into the washing machine. She turned to me and said, “Do you have washing machines in Scotland?” Obviously, I was forced to admit, that no we didn’t. Instead we just went down to the river and bashed our clothes off rocks to clean them.2) Transport - I spent two weeks in the lovely town of Columbia. Missouri. There I amazed the locals with my insistence on using a strange outmoded form of transport known as “walking”. Locals would slow down as they passed in their modern cars, pointing and laughing. To them, it must have been like watching a live action version of the Flintstones.3) Voting – would you believe it, but in the UK we still vote by drawing a little X next to the candidate we want to vote for. No sign of the advanced electronic voting they have over in the states. Indeed, we are so old fashioned that we haven’t even outsourced our voting to the Russians yet!4) Guns – It may be hard for an American to believe but almost nobody in the UK owns their own guns. This means that if we have to rise up and overthrow our own government (currently seems like a good plan) then we will be armed with nothing more than some particularly well sharpened sarcasm.Still, perhaps one day we can hope to be as advanced as the US. And there is some hope, as we now have our very own version of Donald Trump as PM!4K",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,12.7K,996,156M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-key-skill-gaps-in-the-United-States-that-must-be-filled-in-order-for-the-workforce-to-keep-pace-with-emerging-innovations-or-technologies

3,"This is a multi-faceted question. For the existing workforce, the key gaps are: learning on the fly or being motivated to learn on the fly, problem solving skills, and flexibility in one's responsibilities and tasks.For the workforce that is not yet in the workforce or people not participating in it, often general education or technical background is missing. Making this education more generally available whether online like Coursesa or scholarships to universities.",0 followers,Jon Mixon,832,33.8K,427.4M,2014,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-key-skill-gaps-in-the-United-States-that-must-be-filled-in-order-for-the-workforce-to-keep-pace-with-emerging-innovations-or-technologies

Invest in the foundations of K-12 education, eliminate funding through property taxes and replace it with funding through general tax revenues. Have resources allocated on a per pupil basis with funding/operations then delegated to local authorities. Manage those authorities to high yet non prescriptive academic standards with curriculums focused on problem solving/critical thinking rather then rote learning.Start paying teachers properly and treating them like professionals, expect more and pay more. Teachers are paid very poorly in the US, that and their relative lack of autonomy is why you have terrible teachers. The unions are just as militant in Canada and Finland yet students there smoke those in the US in PISA scores.Drill it into student’s heads that education is a life long process and they will likely have to change careers and retrain multiple times. Engrain the expectation that you will have to do some sort of post secondary training. That was a constant refrain as far back as the early 90s in Canada.Fund employment insurance and job training centres which put the newly unemployed or underemployed in touch with resources which educate them on the job market and can refer them to retraining or job search programs. Subsidize both and have a social safety net that allows participants to complete the program without being forced into suboptimal decisions just to survive. It doesn’t have to be tonnes, you’re talking maybe 1500 bucks a month for 20 months.Heavily subsidize post secondary education including trade schools. Develop apprenticeship programs that link industry to post secondary institutions. post secondary costs in Canada are about 1/4 what they are in the US but admittance based entirely on academic merit. It would be extremely difficult for a person like George W Bush to get into a Canadian university.Basically the US will have to substantially restructure their entire education system and develop a social safety network that grants the underemployed the opportunity to retrain. Personally, I don’t think this type of change is culturally/politically possible in the US.Given how important human capital becomes in a technological advanced economy the ROI would almost be immediate.That doesn’t count the massive opportunity costs and the inordinate amount of money the US wastes on housing people in jails or remediating the social ills of having a underclass of people effectively locked out of opportunity.",43 followers,Andy Zehner,988,3.1K,2.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-key-skill-gaps-in-the-United-States-that-must-be-filled-in-order-for-the-workforce-to-keep-pace-with-emerging-innovations-or-technologies

6,"Global experience.Innovation is the study of the unknown and the possible.I don't consider lack of a technical skill to be a barrier. These can be acquired or adopted.Not being open to experience is what holds back innovation.Eg. Africa and India had the most rapid penetration of mobile payments. This was because access to banking was low, but access to mobile phones desireable.I accept this is a subjective answer and not meant as definitive.

Some of the leading challenges are related toThere are some technical innovations already available but not as affordable or applicable for coffices. Here are some of my top picks - along with those that I haven’t seen on the market yet.Portable Noise-Canceling HeadsetThere are hundreds of headsets available out there - yet, I’m still on the hunt for a portable, comfortable, and affordable one that won’t annoy a prospect over a call.Jumping on a call is always a chore for everyone who happens to be in a loud area. A small headset that reflects the noise and produces crystal clear voice quality at an affordable fee would be a dream for any cofficer who has to contribute with voice communication as well.5x More Powerful Laptop BatterySome business laptops are getting better in battery life time. Yet, that comes at a price.You either end up with a 11″ screen that isn’t suitable for pixel-perfect design, or a large notebook with an external battery that weights a ton.On top of that, some activities require powerful CPUs or video cards that can easily kill even the most well optimized hardware devices out there.Being able to take a flight overseas and spend 15 hours on your laptop without breaking a sweat would be more than ideal. Plenty of journalists and bloggers struggle during long conferences. Professional video editors can hardly imagine running a portable station that would last more than a couple of hours.Wide Coverage 4G ModemsOK, Internet connectivity is pretty much a solid requirement for most remote workers.There are three main problems that people face when working from a coffee shop:Being able to work from a beach or in any coffee shop with a reliable 4G modem would be very much preferable. I use both my phone and a 4G modem locally and they fail in certain areas - especially outside of the big city.SkyroamNotebook LockersSpending several hours in a coffee shop will likely result in a restroom break. Leaving your notebook unattended is not preferable yet carrying it over to the near restroom is inconvenient.Some notebooks support different forms of lockers - such as the Kensington cable lock. Those have some limitations in terms of size or reliability - and there are ways to squeeze a notebook around then if you browse some YouTube videos.A locker system that’s portable and extremely reliable would be a safe bet for remote workers. An example would be a strong magnet that doesn’t affect that machine and can be tapped under the table with a fingerprint. It would be the size of a large coin and make your laptop entirely stuck on the table until unlocking it yourself.Projection Virtual KeyboardVirtual keyboardsThe main benefit of using a virtual keyboard would make a large notebook obsolete. You can use your phone or a tablet and avoid carrying a heavy backpack on the way to a coffice. Also, this would let you spend some time working at all times - waiting in a line or for a dentist’s appointment.Virtual External MonitorIn addition to the virtual keyboard, a virtual external monitor would be really awesome. On one end, you can still use it with your phone - limiting the constraints of the small screen size. On top of that, many of us utilize a second monitor at work.If you sit near a wall, you can easily project your screen right next to you. Some privacy concerns may arise and projecting on the desk instead may be more preferable. In practice, using your keyboard holder or a small and tiny stand used for projecting would still work perfectly - being a lighter and more portable alternative.There are additional utilities such as self-charging stations (already available), self-walking suitcases following your watch, Moleskine notebooks storing data in your iPad and the like. Google Glass was also an interesting experiment and I expect a competitor to follow with a more refined model soon. But the more affordable and common new gadgets become, the easier would it be for remote workers to become productive in the coffee shop next door.",UNKNOWN,Bill Yu Liao (廖彧),650,138,1.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-key-skill-gaps-in-the-United-States-that-must-be-filled-in-order-for-the-workforce-to-keep-pace-with-emerging-innovations-or-technologies

I am going to give the perspective of a 52-year-old who has seen a great deal of change, some of it for the better, most of it for the worse.

I am going to give the perspective of a 52-year-old who has seen a great deal of change, some of it for the better, most of it for the worse. I am going to share what has led to my misanthropic nihilism and negativity concerning the current “state of affairs.”Even with our greater technology, I-Phones, computers, medical advances, and other luxuries, these problems lessen us every day, and not enough people care to do a damn thing about it. Obsessive greed is one of the things we most need to tackle, from big corporations to medicine and higher education. Money is important but we have allowed that obsession to get in the way of the higher interest of caring for all our citizens. Making all their needs more affordable and obtainable is a good start. I am thankful I do not have kids. I would grieve incessantly now to think of the world I have brought them into. I only hope that younger people are observing this disaster and that they will take the reigns and make some needed changes. It may be too late.* To the few folks (including a lady who was so rude I deleted her comment) who think we should love the country as it is or “get out,” I say this. Such reactions are naive and juvenile. I love my country and I wish to see it become better. Civilizations do not progress through complacency. They advance when folks sound alarms and encourage change. That is why women and minority groups now have rights they would never have enjoyed had they just “loved it or got out.”",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,575,996,156M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-key-skill-gaps-in-the-United-States-that-must-be-filled-in-order-for-the-workforce-to-keep-pace-with-emerging-innovations-or-technologies

Wearable Tech / Augmented RealityWearable tech is already all around us – think Google Glass, fitness wristbands, and smartwatches – but some futurists believe we’ve only just begun to scratch the surface of this transformative tech.Augmented reality is becoming more and more sophisticated each year, and many experts predict that it will reach awe-inspiring new heights within a decade or so.Many huge tech companies have already begun devoting a huge chunk of their research efforts into innovations in this area. Companies like Facebook, Microsoft, and Google are working on their own standalone AR headsets that will be able to project 3D images into your eyes. Google’s Magic Leap is a great example of this. Microsoft, Facebook, Google, and the Google-backed Magic Leap.Futurists think that if this kind of wearable tech is sophisticated enough, it will flat-out replace not just smartphones, but also any other screen-based devices you might have. If tech can beam movies, games, and anything else you do on a screen straight into your eyes, there will be no need to have anything else.2. Virtual RealityMoving on from augmented reality technology to the even-more-immersive virtual reality. Virtual reality headsets have already come on leaps and bounds from the early novelty models we saw a few years back, but there’s a long way to go from here.Virtual reality tech wouldn’t just influence what you see and hear but would hijack all other senses too. For example, full body virtual reality suits are already under development which will allow you to feel in virtual reality. The suits give you biofeedback so that you really feel what’s happening as if it were real. Combining that with some form of movement pads that let you walk around in a virtual space, we could have a whole virtual playground at our fingertips. If this kind of tech were widely available, and anyone could access the virtual space, smartphones would soon become redundant. Instead of using your smartphone, you could simply step into a world in which you can interact physically with your emails, games, and everything else.3. Transhumanist TechnologyThe third technological innovation that may replace smartphones is also the scariest. We’re talking about human/machine fusion – biological upgrades that turn us into something more than human. Cyborg tech, if you will.Elon Musk’s Neuralink company has already begun developing such technology. The company’s goal is to build computers into our very brains via ‘neural lace’.It’s in the very earliest stages of development but hopes to eventually be able to bridge the brain to a computer. With these brain-implants, we’d be able to search the internet, read emails, make calls, and anything else directly in our minds. This would make the need for any kind of interface, including smartphones, redundant.In that sense, it would be the endpoint of technological evolution. Screens would become irrelevant and humans themselves would become one with machines. It’s a thought that’s as scary as it is exciting.",5 followers,Bill Otto,7.6K,7.5K,43.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-key-skill-gaps-in-the-United-States-that-must-be-filled-in-order-for-the-workforce-to-keep-pace-with-emerging-innovations-or-technologies
