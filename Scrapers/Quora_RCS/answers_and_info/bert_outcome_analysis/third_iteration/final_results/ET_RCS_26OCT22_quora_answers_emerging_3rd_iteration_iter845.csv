Let me explain.Most people think of evolution as operating on members of a species with “inferior” traits, thereby reducing their survivability and ultimate contribution to the gene pool. With this understanding, you’d then point to our modern longevity and note that “humans have largely solved the problem of survivability” — which we have. We can remedy poor eyesight, compensate for chronic diseases, vaccinate against plagues, work around infertility, etc. But this understHumans are very likely evolving faster today than at almost any time in the past.

With this understanding, you’d then point to our modern longevity and note that “humans have largely solved the problem of survivability” — which we have. We can remedy poor eyesight, compensate for chronic diseases, vaccinate against plagues, work around infertility, etc. But this understanding is based on a narrow view of evolution.Evolution operates at a species wide level across vast periods of time. And what is it looking for? You might say, “survival of the fittest” or “natural selection”. And that’s where a lot of the confusion comes from. With ever longer lifespans and no natural predators, evolution seems to be way back in the rear view mirror for Homo sapiens. But what evolution really cares about isSo if we want to see if humans are evolving, we need to look for any signs ofSource:A Tale of Two Fertilities - Africa and Everywhere Else.

2,"Has technology outran evolution?No, you can run, but you can’t hide from evolution.Evolution is the way organisms adapt and change in response to changes in their environment. Technology is currently one of the major driving forces behind environmental change. Technology in the broadest sense first gave us fire, which allowed our ancestors to cook their food which was an important factor in the increase in the size of their brains. Then there was agriculture which gave us cow’s milk and the need for lactose tolerance. The less energetic lifestyle resulting from agriculture has also has allowedHas technology outran evolution?No, you can run, but you can’t hide from evolution.Evolution is the way organisms adapt and change in response to changes in their environment.

Then there was agriculture which gave us cow’s milk and the need for lactose tolerance. The less energetic lifestyle resulting from agriculture has also has allowed a reduction in the weight of our bones. Technology has reduced the amount of stress our environment puts on us, which is the opposite way to that in which evolution usually works, but if you relieve pressure there is normally a reaction. There are, for example, far more people with allergies today than there were fifty years ago. As general levels of hygiene and medical care increase, our immune system does not need to be so robust. My wife and I have three children, all adults now. The oldest has asthma and is allergic to peanuts. No-one else in the family has any allergies. They were all brought up under very similar conditions. So, why does only one have the allergies? It can’t be entirely environmental. Genetics is a possible reason.Our bodies have cooled by 0.05° Fahrenheit per decade over the past 200 years as our more sessile lifestyle has slowed our metabolic rate. This is cumulative and is passed on from one generation to the next, so it can only be evolutionary.Since we’ve only known about evolution, genetics and DNA for a few generations it is far too soon to expect too many directly observed changes. Congenital defects are less likely to be fatal today but it is possible that in the not too distant future genetic engineering could have an effect on them. It’s difficult to think of anything more artificial than genetic engineering, but it will still have an evolutionary impact.","74,719 followers",Tiny Nair,776,689,28M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-can-be-the-next-technological-evolution-which-can-wipe-off-the-current-technology

It's hypothesized that the reason humans learn so quickly is that we are fitting new examples into our existing knowledge rather than forming entirely new categories. If we could teach machines to do the same, they would learn exponentially faster and apply that learning more effectively.Transfer learning is a very hot topic in AI research right now, so I expect major breakthroughs in the next few years. I think this may be sufficient to achieve artificial general intelligence, but even if not, it will dramatically extend the range of tasks that machines can accomplish.","58,988 followers",Michael Wolfe,504,2K,17.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-can-be-the-next-technological-evolution-which-can-wipe-off-the-current-technology
