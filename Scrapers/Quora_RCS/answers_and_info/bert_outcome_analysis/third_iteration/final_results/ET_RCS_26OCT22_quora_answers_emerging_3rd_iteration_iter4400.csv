A conspiracy to, reduce cost in money transmittance, speed up transactions, be a store of value, protect privacy, force accountability on central banks and fiscal policy of governments.I guess you could call it a conspiracy for a better future.",0 followers,Jackson Brownlee,9.3K,181,12.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-Bitcoin-a-conspiracy-or-a-future
1,Neither. It is a revolutionary technology with many world changing applications.Because of the potential of this technology it is being way overvalued at present.In plain english it is being valued according to it’s POTENTIAL not it’s reality.Whether you think that’s good or not is a matter of opinion. But speculative bubbles have never ended well in all of recorded history.Maybe this time its different.Wanna bet?,0 followers,Keith Albert,6.3K,602,20M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-Bitcoin-a-conspiracy-or-a-future
2,"as in sudden? striking?, evoking emotions and passions? I guess it depends how you look at it. For example, when I think of someone who feels dramatic about Bitcoin I think of someone like Michael Saylor, the Microstrategy CEO. he speaks of it in almost seemingly religous terms.For others, not so dramatic perhaps. Just a way to increase net worth.","1,772 followers",Thomas Y Graham,639,55,4.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-Bitcoin-a-conspiracy-or-a-future

If it does, it won’t be until after a long, drawn-out battle between the ones selling and the ones with high incentive to keep the price above cost e.g. Miners.There’s too much sunk cost into Bitcoin at this point to make it likely that one event will cause it to drop to zero.That said, Bitcoin has the very real problem of being close to useless as a product. The most you can say of bitcoin’s usefulness is its value as a hedge for other even riskier cryptocurrencies.But this hedge is based on the assumption that another cryptocurrency won’t surpass its market cap in the long term, which i won’t bet on.What’s much more likely to happen is another coin will gain market share over Bitcoin and unseat it as the most popular cryptocurrency, and both investors and miners and startups will simply move over to support the new platform, in the process causing the bitcoin price to decline over time.So in summary…Will it drop to zero suddenly? To me, unless bitcoin protocol is compromised, its mostly impossible.Will it drop inevitably? Without a doubt. From a technology POV, there are too many other more qualified contenders.",0 followers,Steph Brooks,891,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-Bitcoin-a-conspiracy-or-a-future
4,"I think it is an illusion. Consider what its value is based on, and the cost of mining for new coins and the difficulty of transactions in the absence of the miners.?It is a lot like the value of Gold in that neither has any real value as a means of doing or producing things for our society. It stores value well however, and that is an important consideration in any society using debt backed fiat currency, which is to say every nation on the planet.A year ago it was a future. Now I do not think it has much of one as it has gone parabolic. I think it will peak and then crater, soon. YMMV and thI think it is an illusion.

8,"Yes. There were lots around. Perhaps the most prominent was Igor Gouzenko, the Soviet /Russian cipher clerk who spilled the beans on various Soviet efforts to infiltrate our government.During the 1950’s the RCMP regularly investigated suspicious persons, including me - while I was in university, I joined the CCF party (predecessor to the NDP - then mainly known for Tommy Douglas’s pushing medicare in Saskatchewan) and my very conservative uncle (who taught at that university) read me the riot act about the risk I was posing for the whole family.One family connexion, Miss Marjorie Lamb, becameYes.

Most of us respected her work but some certainly thought she was excessively … involved in trying to crush that threat.It was interesting to me that when she died, a letter was found among her papers from US President Dwight Eisenhower, thanking her for her service. Marjorie was a very warm, kind person and dedicated to the Canadian community. We spent many evenings together during which she told me stories of some of the very real risks that Soviet spies had presented to Canada, and, through us, to the US. Those accounts certainly sounded genuine to me - although she was always very careful to keep key details to herself.","18,164 followers",Anand Nyamdavaa,505,826,29.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-Bitcoin-a-conspiracy-or-a-future
