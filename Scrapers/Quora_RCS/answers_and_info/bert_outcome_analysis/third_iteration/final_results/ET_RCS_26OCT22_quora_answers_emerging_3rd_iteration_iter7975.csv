National City Lines [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy ] - Phillips Petroleum and General Motors colluded to buy up the tram lines and interurban lines across America and run them out of business in order to sell more motorcars. Studies done at the time showed that 2/3 of post war America would never buy cars if they had easy access to street cars and interurban for less cost. They also showed that electrically driven trams powered by power lines running over the tracks would always be less expensive than individual motorcars with complex internal combustion engines. The investment in and crashing of the tram and interurban system of the USA would triple auto and fuel sales and was well worth the losses incurred.On Nov 1, 1952, the US Atomic Energy Commission in conjunction with the US Department of Defence detonated the first hydrogen bomb, Ivy Mike [ https://youtu.be/h7vyKDcSTaE ].This bomb used lithium-6 and deuterium to promote the Jetter Cycle. [ https://ieer.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/1998/07/DangerousThermonuclearQuest.pdf ] Here neutron flux was used to convert Lithium-6 to Tritium and Helium releasing 4.8 MeV of energy. The energetic Tritium scattered off the Lithium-6 remaining and fused readily with the Deuterium producing another alpha particle (Helium) and an energetic neutron. The neutron can interact with any of a variety of heavy nuclei to produce many more slow neutrons to create a large reaction from a small spark.By March 1, 1954 a ‘dry’ hydrogen bomb was detonated, Castle Bravo [ https://youtu.be/b5tmkna-k-U ]. Here the system was made very compact and easier to build.By 1956 a ‘fission free’ hydrogen bomb billed at the ‘Humanitarian H-bomb” because of its lack of radioactive fall out which used only lithium-6 deuterium was built.At that time people wondered if it might be possible to build tiny fission free ‘nuclear hand grenades [ http://media.restraint.org/2009/03/fusion_microcapsule.jpg ]’ that would be detonated in a thrust chamber to produce rocket thrust for a massive interplanetary rocket [ https://youtu.be/xYoLcJuBtOw ], others wondered if it might be possible to contain the jet of plasma in such a way to produce electricity directly using MHD with these inertial confinement [ https://www.nap.edu/read/18288/chapter/4 ] units.By 1954 Lewis Strauss, Atomic Energy Commission chair, reported to the public on the results of classified research associated with Project Sherwood a wide ranging study of fusion technology. Princeton University had looked into hot fusion under this program using their Stellarator. Being unclassified it was widely reported in the press.Meanwhile, weapons labs had looked at Lithium-6 Deuteride with a neutron multiplier like Zinc-64 that took a long time to undergo a (n,2n) reaction, so could not be made into an explosive but could sustain a continuous reaction.

The first was Senator John F Kennedy - JFK, who later became President in 1961 who vowed to the nation that he would not see this nation loiter in the backwater of scientific advance, and would everything he could to advance technology in America so we could meet the challenges of the 1970s. The central challenge being a looming energy crisis.The second was entrepreneur Elon Musk who began the company SpaceX whose goal is to make humanity multi-planetary.John Fitzgerald Kennedy and Werner vonBraun were on track to take us to Mars by the late 1970s. Elon Musk is on track today to take us to Mars by 2024.Back in 1961 JFK became President and wanted to make America great by solving important challenges facing humanity. So, JFK sought to have the US government build atomic powered spaceships because by doing so we would develop the skills needed to meet the challenges of the 1970s - the energy shortage predicts by scientists in the 1950s.This President while serving as Senator from the great State of Massachusetts, was highly critical of Eisenhower’s handling of the Strauss Affair and subsequent diversions by the McCarthy rampage following that and the abandonment of commercialising nuclear fusion technology during the H-Bomb program.Primarily because this former Navy PT Boat Captain and war hero understood that;1. The USA and the world was running out of oil (according to chief geophysicist for Shell company 1956 report)4. Brookings Institute Study that outlined out to implement the power of the atom with least disruption and greatest geopolitical effect. This President declassified this report November 22, 1962, after learning that the discovery rate for oil worldwide had peaked. Major findings of this report included;If you listen to JFK’s Rice University speech in full and in light of this background, you will hear that it is not about landing on the moon, but rather leading the way into the challenges of the 1970s - the principal challenge being - the pending disruption of the US economy due to the exhaustion of legacy fuels within the Continental United States.If you listen to JFK’s Rice University speech in full and in light of this background, you will hear that it is not about landing on the moon, but rather leading the way into the challenges of the 1970s - the principal challenge being - the pending disruption of the US economy due to the exhaustion of legacy fuels within the Continental United States.JFK worked closely with Werner vonBraun and his team at Huntsville, who was very popular following his appearance on TV as well as films and magazines on the subject of ‘man in space’ both before and after Sputnik.1954 Disney Film detailing the atomic powered Mars ship.vonBraun had a step by step program for the US that would first build reusable chemical boosters that would first orbit a person then send them around the moon, then land them on the moon, and have them live there.This would prepare humanity for the next step, a trip to Mars.Each of these capabilities also had significant military consequence, from surveillance to orbiting bombs, to putting missiles on the moon that would strike enemies on Earth without any fear of retaliation.There were also commercial benefits. Weather satellites, navigation satellites, communications satellites. The development of advanced computers to create a digital communications network bringing unlimited information to every home.https://monoskop.org/images/5/51/Wiener_Norbert_The_Human_Use_of_Human_Beings.pdfFollowing trips to Mars and beyond, the resources of many worlds would be available to humanity, not just one.With advanced nuclear power we would end high cost energy and energy scarcity. With unlimited resources from other worlds combined with automation made possible through advances in cybernetics we would end poverty. With improved communications and understanding we would end war.This was the vision of leaders in the 1950s following the war years of the 1940s. The development of the atomic powered SST in the 1960s and an atomic powered passenger rocket in the 1960s would bring the world together while the development of atomic powered pulse rockets in the 1970s would ply between worlds expanding our horizons. beyond Earth.Elon Musk taught himself programming at an early age and developed a number of software products which he made and sold and earned money. He worked with his brother and his friends and developed trading software that was later sold and became Pay Pal. He used his profits to do some things that interested him. He developed an electric car, with his brother he started a solar panel company and he hired the rocket team from TRW and created SpaceX. Like his original business these businesses were a success.The goal of Tesla, and Sun City were to end pollution of fossil fuels. The goal of SpaceX was to make humanity multi-planetary. As the first step to achieving that goal he wanted to build a small orbital vehicle and sell space launch. Once that was making money, he wanted to use the capability of the Pintle Fed Engine - a TRW specialty that was used on the Lunar Lander LEM during Apollo - to recover the first stage via retropropulsion.Musk used his knowledge of computers to streamline rocket engine production and devised an incremental program of improvement that added only a few percent to the cost of his rocket operations - but the payoff was the ability to recover the FIRST stage. This was 85% the cost of space launch, and if he recovered that - he would save 85% the cost of the next launch.When he succeeded with the Falcon 9 and was able to relaunch, he began lowering prices. A 15% reduction in cost, suddenly made SpaceX dominant in the space launch business, allowing them to capture 45% market share because they had a lower price and improved reliability. Since a system that has already proven itself in flight, is more reliable than one that’s never flown. Musk had achieved something no other aerospace company had achieved - making a profit in space launch without subsidy.With these profits SpaceX then developed the Falcon Heavy. Basically three Falcon 9 boosters strapped together with two of the three operating as the first stage, and the third operating as the second stage. The first stage would land at the launch centre. The second stage would land downrange on a platform. This increases his savings from 85% to 95% and gave SpaceX a range of options.SpaceX also developed the Dragon capsule which gave it the opportunity to learn how to build manned spacecraft and again bring his innovations in software and control to bear. The experience in building an attractive and functional motorcar also contributed to this skill.As SpaceX built up its supply of spare booster to reuse, the company next looked at using spare launch capacity to launch a number of its own communications satellites, creating a global wireless hotspot the company has dubbed StarLink. This network uses lasers to communicate between satellites in space, and phased array microwave on each satellite to communicate with the Earth, painting virtual cell towers from space - so that every hand set, tablet, lap top and desk top computer with a wireless capability could recognise and communicate with one another. In this way, SpaceX will capture a large portion of the $1.45 TRILLION per year telecommunications market.With these profits SpaceX will be in a position to fully fund its Big Falcon Rocket - BFR. This is a smaller version of a previously discussed Internplanetary Transport System. ITS. The BFR is a highly reusable two stage to orbit rocket capable of carrying 150 metric tons into orbit. The ITS was to be a highly reusable two stage to orbit rocket capable of carrying 450 metric tons into orbit. These were similar to earlier plans to build a ‘fly back’ Saturn V and ‘fly back’ Nova rocket in the 1960s which had 120 tonne and 420 tonne capacities respectively. These systems used wings wheels and parachutes to recover the two stages. Musk was to use retropropulsion using the highly throttable engines to land the spacecraft.This would revolutionise space launch reducing the cost of putting 150 metric tons into orbit to less than $7 million! An incredibly low price!Now a rocket sitting on the surface of the Earth must be able to impart a speed of 9.4 km/sec in order for the rocket to push through the air and raise itself into space and attain a speed of 7.9 km/sec at altitude. SpaceX’s BFR achieved this in two stages. The first stage achieved 2.9 km/sec and the second stage achieved 6.5 km/sec. Why these speeds?Its a good question because rocket scientists use Calculus of Variation to determine how much work each stage would do to minimise the size of the vehicle. If both stages burn the same propellants, then both should do about equal work. Which means each should add 4.7 km/sec per stage. Doing otherwise makes one or the other stage bigger than it needs to be - increasing the size of the entire system. But SpaceX proposed 2.9 km/sec and 6.5 km/sec. Why?Well, lowering the speed of the first stage, made it easier to recover. That’s one reason. But not the main one. The main reason was that if you refuel the second stage on orbit, and if you have the ability to impart 6.5 km/sec to that stage ON ORBIT, then you can fly that stage to the Moon and Mars after refuelling.A big two stage rocket done this way, was also an interplanetary spaceship.Hence - the name BFS - Big Falcon Spaceship.BFR was announced in November 2016 and first flight is planned for 2020. Unlike rockets that get thrown away, these rockets get reused and reflown.

The thermonuclear fuel is located in the secondary configuration of bomb materials, and is ignited by an A bomb of sufficient force.The A bomb primary in the Clancy book is boosted by the insertion of a small amount of tritium gas into the core just before detonation. Already present in the core is lithium deuteride, which is a dry powder. The tritium is also inserted into the plutonium spark plug in the secondary, but that is not important to the question. Tritium gas plus deuteride does greatly boost the fission reaction of the plutonium in the primary. The tritium undergoes fusion immediately with the deuteride in the lithium deuteride as the bomb begins to explode, and dumps a high number a high energy nuetrons into the plutonium. The plutonium in the primary is fissioned by the chain reaction of neutrons being released by each generation of plutonium as it fissions in ever greater numbers — the A bomb depends directly on the number of neutrons being emitted for its explosive potential. But the additional influx of nuetrons from the tritium/deuteride fusion greatly boosts the fission rate of the plutonium.The tritium has to injected just before the detonation as a gas.Tritium, however, is unstable and decays with a half life of 12.3 years. It undergoes beta decay — a neutron emits an electron and an electron antinuetrino, and is converted into a proton. The result is Helium3. Instead of one proton and two neutrons, you have two protons and one neutron. In the Clancy bomb, the tritium was supposed to be filtered during the process of insertion in order to remove the He3, resulting in only tritium being present. But the terrorists prematurely killed the scientists helping them with the design, and they were therefore unaware of the need to do this. As a result, a mixture of tritium and He3 was inserted into the primary’s core.He3 readily absorbs nuetrons, which poisons the chain reaction for the primary. Instead of boosting the output, it lessened it. It acted in the same manner as control rods in a nuclear reactor, which typically consist of another ready absorber of neutrons, such as boron, cadmium or other elements with similar properties. As the fission reactions were being deprived of neutrons, the chain reaction fizzled early. The trigger was supposed to have a yield of 70 kilotons, but ended up with only 11 kilotons. According to Clancy, the H bomb component needed an A bomb trigger of at least 30 kilotons in order to ignite the H bomb materials. The yield of only 11 megatons therefore failed to ignite the secondary. Instead of a yield of around 400 kilotons, the bomb fizzled at 11 kilotons, which is still only slightly smaller than the Hiroshima bomb.I am unsure how much He3 would be needed to cause this degree of poisoning, and therefore how old the tritium sample had to be in order to decay into the necessary amount of He3.

If they had filtered the tritium, they could have removed the helium-3 that actually inhibits nuclear fission. (I recall that the novel described it as a simple procedure to filter the tritium.)(But the terrorists - in tying off loose ends - killed the German scientist (boom! headshot!) who had designed their bomb about two seconds before he was going to mention “Hey, we need to filter the tritium.”The helium-3 reduced the yield of the fission device to about 11 kilotons, which was still plenty to kill virtually everyone at the stadium. (The novel describes three or four survivors found in a bathroom, and one plot-relevant survivor in an armored truck in the parking lot.)Of course, I’m no nuclear scientist, so I can’t vouch for the accuracy of Clancy’s story. I strongly advise against trying to build your own fission or fusion weapon, as both the components and the completed product tend to be particularly harmful to children and other living things.","5,782 followers",Bob Kinch,541,3.5K,36.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-long-before-we-land-on-Mars

We can apply similar logic and it turns out that it would take about a year to reach velocities close to the speed of light.The problem is: the only way we know to accelerate a rocket is to apply Newton’s third law i.e. eject some mass quickly behind it. (We’ll leave off gravity assists here). And the only way we can get very fast is to eject a lot of mass - (or eject it VERY quickly). But this means that you have to carry the mass in the rocket to eject - which means the rocket has a lot more mass - and you need extra energy to accelerate that extra mass.

Second, I will examine historically the space program that was proposed by JFK, and how the part of it which would have provided high speed, high capacity interstellar travel was shelved.Light-speed transfer of robots and (eventually) humans.Before you exclaim, every radio or television broadcast occurs at the speed of light. Such a broadcast can easily contain the complete specification of a robot, and its prior memories and present instructions.It is possible to broadcast on a narrow beam using a radio telescope or laser. We have used the former to communicate with spacecraft for many decades, including a couple of spacecraft which are surprisingly far outside our solar system.We now have the technology to create a great many things remotely, called 3D printing. A large collection of remote manufacturing devices might be required to build arbitrary robots. But a class of robots could be envisioned which fits within the technology we have today. Perhaps a stock of chips would be used for its electronics, as chip printing (fabrication, but it is basically printing) requires a rather large, complex facility.Then the printer(s) could be sent on ahead with an initial set of exploration robots, and based on what they transmit back, a set of plans for a new robot, specialized for some purpose, maybe to reach in a hole or something, could be sent at light speed.The only reason it has not been done is because the capabilities are limited at present, and with only a couple of robots on Mars, there hasn’t been pressing need for it. But it could be done.Israeli doctors have demonstrated 3D printing of a heart using a stock of living cells. Such a device, extended to produce complete organisms, while not available today, could conceivably be created in the future. It is not prohibited by any law of physics. Determining the memories and motivations of a complex biological entity in order to transmit them with the specification has not been worked out. There is probably not a physical law against it. We will have to work out how memories are stored before we can say definitely. For years people thought they were stored in neural networks, but now it appears at least some memory may be stored in RNA, and transfer of memory on how to solve a maze has been transmitted from one mouse to another.This brings up all sorts of questions, like is the original preserved? Does the copy have the same rights as the original? Etc. I’ll leave you to play with that. Quite possibly by the time we deploy this technology to send ourselves to other galaxies, we may not be biological anymore anyway.Very fast interplanetary and interstellar rockets.JFK’s speech to Congress in 1961 starting the space race requested funding for 4 points:You will immediately notice that 1, 2 and 3 have all been satisfactorily accomplished, and 2 has not. We use chemical rockets, which are wimps energy-wise, powering from electron orbit transitions instead of nuclear transitions, fusion or fission.The version specifically mentioned by JFK was a Nuclear Thermal Rocket.Development actually began in 1955, considering various designs, and before the program ended in 1973 sufficient testing was done that the next step would be to construct a full scale engine for operational deployment. For two or three decades most of the human race ran paranoid from anything nuclear. However, the 2019 US budget contains $100 million to revive this program. SeeAnother type of nuclear propulsion was investigated with Project Orion. An ocean-liner sized vehicle would be transported on pulsed nuclear explosions, and would be launched at sea. This was abandoned in the mid 1960s because of fallout fears (800 bombs just to get to orbit). However, it could be launched from orbit, though it would be expensive to get it to orbit. JFK was horrified when shown a militarized model of this hypothetical vehicle. The Nuclear Test Ban treaty made the project unworkable. The technology, complete with shock absorbers, might be used one day to deflect an asteroid from hitting the Earth.A more viable and controllable and cleaner long-term solution … and a more energetic one … is controlled fusion powering plasma thrust. The trouble is we have been slow to develop controlled fusion. However, slow progress is being made.Coupled with a magnetic scoop to feed interstellar hydrogen into the reactor, a Bussard Ramjet could potentially reach 10–15% of the speed of light.Beyond that speed, the reaction does not produce enough energy to overcome the momentum loss of scooping up the fuel. Inside a solar system, the device would deploy its magnetic field as a magnetic sail to propel away from the star, and for breaking at the destination, using the solar wind. A store of fuel would be needed for maneuvering within a solar system. The VASMIR engine of Ad Astra, a plasma high thrust electric powered engine using magnetic plasma containment, might be a good way to start getting our feet wet with this technology. To go faster, a move from fusion to antimatter propulsion would do it. Though still somewhat less than light speed.Near light speed transportation can be obtained by using lasers, focused starlight, or microwaves. Sending a very lightweight probe to another star system by this method has been proposed.As to WHY these have not been developed, you can see it is a combination of waiting for the technology to be developed, and also waiting until the planet-hunting observatories find some place really interesting to go.",48 followers,Ryan Murphy,11.5K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-long-before-we-land-on-Mars

In fact as the photons are ejected it is reduced in mass.","57,718 followers",Jack Fraser-Govil,628,2.6K,42.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/In-Tom-Clancys-novel-The-Sum-of-All-Fears-terrorists-construct-an-H-Bomb-but-something-goes-wrong-with-the-construction-causing-the-bomb-to-fizzle-What-went-wrong-in-the-bomb%E2%80%99s-construction

13,"No, photonic propulsion is.The fastest known way to reach Mars is via a laser propelled light sail. This light sail would be accelerated to 1.5% the speed of light which would be enough to reach Mars in as little as 3 days, depending on planetary alignment. Although it wouldn't be able to stop at without ramming into the planet.For spacecraft with a payload, it could make the journey in a month.Nuclear propulsion e.g. Orion drives could get to Mars in about 125 days with an acceleration rate that humans could handle.",151 followers,Sawyer Smith,3.4K,550,8.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-can-renewable-sources-of-energy-make-oil-related-wars-irrelevant
14,"Yes and no.There’s only one way to travel inTsiolkovsky equaitondescribes the laws of propulsive motion. Here Δv is the total change of the rocket speed achievable by engines, vₑ is exhaust speed, m₀ is initial mass of the rocket (payload + structure + fuel tanks + engine + fuel), and m_f (why doesn’t Unicode have subscript “f” letter? it makes no sense) is the final mass of the rocket (payload + structure +Yes and no.There’s only one way to travel inTsiolkovsky equaitondescribes the laws of propulsive motion. Here Δv is the total change of the rocket speed achievable by engines, vₑ is exhaust speed, m₀ is initial mass of the rocket (payload + structure + fuel tanks + engine + fuel), and m_f (why doesn’t Unicode have subscript “f” letter? it makes no sense) is the final mass of the rocket (payload + structure + fuel tanks + engine, but no fuel). This equation was derived for a single-stage rocket, but the multistage ones are no different - staging just allows you to get even higher mass ratio than a single-stage rocket, it doesn’t change anything qualitatively.What does this equation tell us? Well, to get higher speed, you have to have higher exhaust velocity and higher mass ratio. And the exhaust velocity is more important, as the logarithm is relatively slowly increasing function:For example, if we want to send something into space (not into orbit!), we should apply a velocity change of some 2 km/s. If we were launching aSo, exhaust velocity (or its equivalent, specific impulse) is really important, much more important than the rocket mass, especially given that we can’t create very large rockets. However, we can’t just take the highest specific impulse engine and use it to launch people to Mars, and the reason of that is mechanical effectiveness:(here c is exhaust velocity, v - change of velocity).Unfortunately, the engine doesn’t just use fuel to provide thrust - it also has to push that fuel (or its combustion products) out the rocket, which requires energy. The optimum amount of energy is reached if the exhaust velocity is about the same as the total velocity change of your rocket, and if it’s less than that or more than that, you need more energy.Conventional chemical rockets use fuel+oxidizer mix to store that energy. Combustion releases a lot of heat, and that heat is what pushes combustion products out the engine. However, for higher exhaust velocities you don’t have so much fuel to store your energy in, and, typically, you don’t burn that reaction mass, so, if you want a really high specific impulse, you need some other method of providing energy for the engine. For example, you could use a solar panel (optionally - in combination with lasers from Earth). Or a nuclear reactor with adequate insulation and cooling (which is very difficult in vacuum). All of these options have one large drawback: they are very, very heavy if you need a lot of power. And this mass is not a “good” mass of fuel, which you use up in the flight to speed up, it’s a “bad” dry mass, which makes your mass ratio much smaller.To sum up, there’s only so much power you could generate on your spacecraft in flight. And that’s why we can approximately divide the rocket engines into two main classes:For the fastest possible travel to Mars, we probably need to use both options. First, inject into transfer trajectory with high-thrust engines, then, during the weeks or months of flight, use low-thrust engines to get more velocity.Ok, that was it for the flight in vacuum. But: we don’t plan to fly in vacuum! No rockets ever flew in vacuum. We launch from Earth (which is not vacuum) to Mars, and the whole flight takes place not so far from Sun (which is also not vacuum). Theoretically, we could try to use this fact. In Solar System, we have light and wind from Sun, and could probably make some light from Earth. This may lead to more efficient spaceflight, and some sci-fi authors have already described the necessary concepts.Unfortunately, in your question it’s not really clear what you mean by “known way”. I’ll try to cover different possible meanings of these words. NASA has a system of levelling the technologies, a set of so-called “technology readiness levels”. Let’sSo, as we may see, if we consider the technology readiness level 3 as “known way”, and if nuclear pulse propulsion proves to be better than beam-powered propulsion, then the optimal technology stack would be something like space elevator (or, if we move it to TRL 2, liquid air cycle rocket) + nuclear pulse drive + electric/magnetic sail. However, not sure the latter is necessary as it may not provide enough total thrust during so short trip time.In all other cases, no, nuclear pulse drive is not what you want to choose.",16 followers,Josh Neufeld,619,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-long-before-we-land-on-Mars
15,"No, that would be rather pointless. You want them to go up, and then drop down again somewhere on Earth, where you presumably want to destroy something.They can use a Proton rocket to send one to Mars. Not that there would be any point; there's not really anything there to destroy.",33 followers,Matthew Lee,1.2K,548,11.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-long-before-we-land-on-Mars
