In other words, the only real measure of any individual’s worth (in today’s world) is his/her ability to monetize their activity. The activity itself is not the source of value - only the ability to monetize it.Personal worth should be measured by the good one does in the world - creative pursuits, caring for the sick and disabled, entertaining each other. Those who continue to monetize their activities will be able to enjoy a higher standard of living than a UBI would provide, but lack of monetizing does not necessarily mean lack of productivity or purpose.","17,272 followers",Sean Lana,7K,718,36.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Will-court-reporters-soon-be-replaced-by-AI-technology

7,"Instead of nuclear weapons with their long-lasting effects, one future weapon technology will be kinetic energy hypervelocity projectiles - large inert projectiles fired from railguns will have a tremendous energy and penetration, and if the weapon fires large steel rods (or small iron asteroids) from orbit, the effects will rival nuclear weapons while lacking any of the downsides of nukes.","105,668 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.5K,6.8K,91.6M,2012,https://www.quora.com/Will-court-reporters-soon-be-replaced-by-AI-technology

You can read these problems listed below to get a view of the scope of some of these problems or you could be lazy and skip to the middle.1) Collateral Damage - believe it or not, the goal of a nuke is not kill large numbers of people. That form of psychological warfare can work as a final violence to end a conflict, but it usually is not a goal. What is meant, like in the attacks Hiroshima and Nagasaki were mainly to destroy, military and military manufacturing facilities in the cities. In that war, the bombs were used also to break the Japanese military spirit, but in general civilians are unnecessary losses.2) Radiation Damage - Though temporary, there is radiation damage that can make people who aren't very near ground zero can still get sick as well as poisoning the land. The effects don't last long per say. Hiroshima is now a prosperous city again.3) You can't use to many of them - another theme of our favorite movie genre is that if too many nuclear weapons go off at once we have this funny thing called nuclear winter. In the same way that a big rock took out the dinosaurs, huge amounts of dust could rise up in the atmosphere blocking the sun and significantly cooling the Earth for a few months or years. This would trigger a massive die-off and a bad day for all of us.4) Disposal - These weapons and their nuclear armaments are a major mess to cleanup, given we never actually use them. At this time there is no good use of weapon's grade nuclear waste if you don't want to blow it up. Disposal of this material is always a stop gap measure and involves very expensive facilities or burring it and hoping no one ever digs up by mistake... for the next 100,000 years.So how could we achieve all the benefits of a nuke without the ugly side effects listed above?Well we can't do it all with one weapon. Let's explore.First we need the ability to take down a great deal of targets. The nuke was good for this specifically if it were targeting an entire base. All the personnel, all the equipment and all the facilities. Of course there are still the families and civilians that work on even bases.In many ways this has already been made obsolete. As the Iraq conflict showed us, the ability to manipulate precision strikes on a large number of targets has given us the ability to cripple any strategic targets without all the nasty loss of life. This is good for taking out facilities like headquarters, manufacturing plants, ship yards, weapons storage and any other permanent location. It doesn't solve the problem of all those pesky soldiers who will eventually be without jobs though and turn insurgent on you, but you can completely take out the Capitol building without hurting the camera man in the hotel down the street.Perhaps there is also the need of disrupting information and capabilities. The losses of Japanese cities caused a breakdown in the order structure for the country. If Kyoto or Tokyo were to be targeted there would have likely been panic as many of the important centers of power, governance and order were located there. Still sometimes disrupting these capabilities are important. For that reason there is a technology that is useful to do this.Weapons have been developed that channel a nuclear weapons energy into just disrupting the capabilities of the enemy without physical death and damage. These are still technically nukes, but they blow up in space causing a rain of energized electrons that ride the Earth's magnetic field and disable all electronic equip. These are known as High Altitude Nuclear Explosions (HANE) and very view can completely bring down a countries infrastructure for months. Now we may wonder why is this all that useful just to turn off the lights. One of the major purposes of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki attacks were to stop the production of military equipment. Well this would effectively shut down any production in target area, as well as communications and even basic systems from stop lights to hospitals or water. Grocery stores are gone so the people now have no means to feed or fend for themselves. The big picture is that a government is now immediately force...","1,445 followers",Miles Negrete,3.9K,1K,8.7M,2012,https://www.quora.com/Will-court-reporters-soon-be-replaced-by-AI-technology

General purpose AI and singularity would not even come near the “chaos” that agriculture created. Until 12000 years ago, ourThen these random dudes and dudettes come with their mastery of wild seeds. And before long, food production became a much easy thing. A single farmer in a few acres of land could produce more food than dozens of hunters attacking many square miles of forest. This gave rise to the “Instead of foraging and hunting, most people got involved in other things - like pottery, painting, urban planning, building homes & drainages, administration, mining, jewellery, accounting, medicine…A few thousand years later, another bunch of dudes would start harnessing the power of steam and create “nasty” things like locomotion. Rather than beating our horses to get to the next village, we would get to the other end of the continent reading newspapers. We moved around, explored things. Rather than using little children for many jobs such as chimney sweeping we kept finding better methods. Eventually the horse carriage workers and others moved on to other things.We often confuse general purpose AI with robotics.Let’s assume the worst case and we have a general purpose AI - that can do everything a human can. What would happen?It would be only as bad as agriculture - that destroyed most of what we did everyday. We could be doing things like sports. In most video games, bots are way better than humans. Does it mean we are less likely to play with other humans? In fact, we would play more with other humans just because the bots are better than us.We would do art, psychiatry and so many more human fields that we have not even created. Just like people could not imagine separate professions like art before the invention of agriculture, we have a problem with imagination.And we would spend more time with our children - who often grow alone with their TVs and more time with our parents - who often rot away alone.But, this is assuming there is a general purpose AI. Robotics is not the same as general purpose AI.Oh, what about movies like The Matrix and Terminator. Oh, you guys are now giving us Hollywood? If you believe in those weird movies, do you also believe in other dystopian movies like “I’m a legend”? In the latter movie, a germ gets out and wipes out most of humanity. Does it mean we have to close down the pharma and medicine industry?Hollywood can paint a dystopian picture from anything possible. They have even made something as harmless as vacuum cleaners into dangerous things. Should we stop doing all of them?In fact, anything useful can be made dangerous - think fire, water, air, cars, electricity, trains, medicines, petrol, sugar - any of them can kill you very easily.Anything that cannot kill you, is not of much use to you.Robotics, like any major revolution, can indeed cause chaos in the society. No different from agricultural revolution or industrial revolution. There will be displacement. People said the same for computing too. Could the people who were worried about computers doing spreadsheets in 1970s have thought about the whole new industries created by computing 40 years later?But, there are a whole set of important things that are not effectively today and we need robots there. Let me give you some examples of these:It need not always be life threatening. You walk into most stores now, and it hard to find anyone to assist you. The robots could walk with you, understand your requirements, help you shop and get things on your vehicle. It could play football with your children and take them off TV.I could give you 100s of such examples and that is the future. But, to get there we have to have more simpler robots doing more mundane things. A baby has to go through the toddler stage before becoming an adult.40 years ago, your parents would not have imagined what you do with computers. They could not have thought of the kind of revolutionary applications that we take for granted.A new revolution is beckoning us.
