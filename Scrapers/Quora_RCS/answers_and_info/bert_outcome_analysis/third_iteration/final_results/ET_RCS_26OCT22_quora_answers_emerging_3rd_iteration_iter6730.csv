Now people are having a hard time believing a syndrome in our children that causes serious psychological problems is caused by deprivation from nature. Many parents do not believe there is an actual problem caregorized as a mental problem that is easily cured by taking your children for walks out in natural, beautiful areas away from the mad confusion of uncivilization. Indeed, many psychologists don't believe it. Perhaps those who do not believe that being sequestered from a natural environment causes mental problems are victims themselves.Personally, I have seen the problems of our society from a very early age, so although I have always believed in good hard work and the good things in life, I have never actually been a part of the world nor a sucker for what it offers. This being so, I have always been conscious of the importance of goals, and have balked at doing anything to support this evil system of things. I have always objected to paying taxes because so much of them pay for killing people, for example. I have not heartily pursued putting my inventions on the market because I did not want to give more life to a doomed, failing world. Can you imagine having a vehicle that did not run on petroleum products? The world would be a whole different place had I shown it how to build different kinds of engines, engines way more efficient and pollution free.But: “As technological advances ever continue to evolve?” What a phrase! Technology is merely knowledge applied to effect a specific function or purpose, often utilized by a mechanical contrivance. The word is based in ancient Greek, and there meant art, or artificial.Mankind observes things in his environment, and from this learns the knowledge and principles by which it had been built, and then applies that knowledge to build something for his own purposes. This making of something artificial based on the knowledge learned from the natural environment is called technology. The contrivance made can be good or evil according to the purpose of the one making it. Weapons are made for evil purposes, but they are an example of technology.People nowadays seem to worship technology as though it were an entity with a life of its own doing miraculous things. This should be no surprise, because they worship evolution in the same manner. Science, too. Science means knowledge, though, but science does not create knowledge, it discovers the knowledge already created. But tell me, please, since evolution is supposed to be a turn to something better, an advance, how you can evolve an advancement? Isn't that superfluous?Technology comes from the minds of men applying the principles nature teaches, and thus there is nothing new under the sun. Technology does not advance. Men find new things to do with the existent knowledge of nature, that is all. So, the evolution of the advancement of technology, as you call it, is merely men building new contrivances to fulfill their own goals.“Having sustenance and covering, we shall be content with these things.” Really, is not life about working to produce food to eat, houses to live in, clothes to wear, and loving and communicating with fellow man, and taking care of this beautiful planet in all of itsThe nature of our environment and our own nature are integrated, but nature does not depend on us, we depend on nature. Therefore, everything which takes us away from nature is detrimental to our own nature, to our existence.The world has been 24/7 since it began. People have lost sight of what we naturally are, how we should be living for a long, long time. Technology is not bad, but people come up with contrivances for harmful purposes, and such contrivances are bad. Contrivances for harmonizing us with nature are good.Go natural, worship God.Peace and love.","66,698 followers",Dima Vorobiev,8.2K,4.2K,139.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/As-technological-advances-ever-continue-to-evolve-turning-us-into-a-24-7-world-are-we-losing-sight-of-what-everyday-life-should-actually-be-like

We talked about it a lot - and his perspective is an interesting one.He grew up in a world where everyone you know is in instant communication with everyone else - where information is no longer hard to obtain. This is a RADICALLY different place than the world the I grew up in where information was essential and a valuable resource - and communications were relatively slow paced.I have no grounds to say that his generation are wrong and mine were right.Truly - there is no objective way to say “This was good - and that is bad”.So - with the current pace of change, we’ve hit a novel point in human development where the rate of change is so steep that each generation lives in an entirely different world than the previous one.Perhaps this is good - perhaps it isn’t - but unless someone can come up with solid reasons why we were the last generation to “get it” - then we should shut up and see where it leads us.",0 followers,Syed Asghar,1K,137,1.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/As-technological-advances-ever-continue-to-evolve-turning-us-into-a-24-7-world-are-we-losing-sight-of-what-everyday-life-should-actually-be-like
