0,5G has horrible latency... Horrible! Even though it will be an improvement to 4G latency its still a Mobile Wireless connection with many users connecting to it!5G would just bring about a better generation service!Its only an improvement to Wireless Generation services!,"9,879 followers",Kenzi Mudge,1.8K,1.3K,8.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Will-5G-technology-bring-about-the-end-of-wired-ISPs
1,"Communications tech gives us better ability to communicate across the full spectrum of EMS. Diagnostic and mathematics have helped us create more algorithms to obtain deeper and quicker assessment and understanding of medical issues and solutions. Items we can carry on our rigs. Less expensive services. Procedures all happen in a lab somewhere long before they make it to the rigs. Occasionally, high tech items like defibrillators are able to be made available to the public to save lives. L.E.D. lights on ambulances conserve energy.

Most mapping systems fall inferior to first responder front end knowledge, yet they are still needed. I sometimes carry a solar charger kit in case I want power when battery’s run out.

That’s the problem.All over Europe and the US, people are dying because authorities are too proud to ask China for assistance.

5,"Well, by “written” can I assume you are referring to typing as well as handwritten? Most people who text are still, technically, typing maybe with only 1 finger but using a visible keyboard, so, they are still spelling out a word and therefore “writing”. If all communication switched to speaking only then it would indeed regress communication thousands of years. Plus, the computer would still have to spell out the message unless instead, it “spoke” it to the receiver. My guess is, slowly we would become incomprehensible to each other. Children would have no organized way to learn to speak corrWell, by “written” can I assume you are referring to typing as well as handwritten?
