The relationship between Aliens and Humans are basically a sci-fi version of traditional high fantasy (Vulcans are basically elves, Klingons are basically Orcs). And because their culture is based on human culture, the oppression and struggle they face are also similar to human.I don't mind this kind of stories. After all, sci-fi or fantasy, at the end of the day, all literature is about human struggle. But Sci-fi is about our future, about technology, about what we as a species might evolve.

From a quick reading of wikipedia, those great minds talk from the perspective of spiritual, psychology, biology, and philosophy.I however, am not interested reading any of those theories, because i have my own theory, about consciousness and life itself.My theory for me is already scary, and i dont want to get depressed thinking more about other peoples thinking of life.Before proceeding, i dont know if this theory has been published somewhere else in the past, if it is, please kindly comment below.First, we need to know where life came from.It doesnt matter what you believe life come from. Wether its from God, biological, simulation, it doesnt matter. Youre here now in this world, living.Second, we need to know what consciousness is.We do not know what other human or living things feels.

Why were you born exactly on 13th of September 2001, or some other dates actually.Is it because the future of humanity figure out what went wrong in the year 2050 that created a nuclear war that almost end the human species?Is it because another species is experiencing life on Earth so they can invade later after knowing the flawness of humanity?And the last part, and probably the most depressing part,What happened if you die? There are no records in the history of human that specify what happened after you die, only speculation.Why people even need to die?Is it because they need to report to their “master” on their experience as human on earth?Maybe you will finally experience what is hell or heaven.Or nothing, just nothing. Dark. Nothing.At the end of the day, the only absolute thing that we know about life, and consciousness is just speculation.Thats why thinking about those things are dangerous, because it led to nothing, you cant get any absolute answers, only speculation.So what?

Maybe proof of my previous identity (birth certificate, passport, medical and dental records) could be found on whatever has replaced the Internet by this point.

I'd read up on the last 100 years of history, but I would avoid learning anything about my own life or family.
