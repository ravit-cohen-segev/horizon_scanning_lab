As technology improves and people become more accepting of this type of instruction, I think it will almost completely replace instruction as we practice it today.",867 followers,Eric Leow Yu Quan,5.3K,95,3.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Can-Smart-Technology-Boost-Student-Engagement-and-Happiness-in-Higher-Education
1,"In secondary school, I had a friend who was one of the laziest students I've seen. During class, he'll either be sleeping, writing a diary or reading a book, whilst paying no attention whatsoever to the lecturer or content taught in class. He wasn't a “closet mugger” too (a contemporary term to define those who appear lazy but study hard behind closed doors) and unsurprisingly did poorly in standardized tests. As a friend, I dutifully urged him to study hard because our school has an over-excessive focus on academics. He never listened, continuing with his flippant attitude.We soon parted waysIn secondary school, I had a friend who was one of the laziest students I've seen. During class, he'll either be sleeping, writing a diary or reading a book, whilst paying no attention whatsoever to the lecturer or content taught in class. He wasn't a “closet mugger” too (a contemporary term to define those who appear lazy but study hard behind closed doors) and unsurprisingly did poorly in standardized tests. As a friend, I dutifully urged him to study hard because our school has an over-excessive focus on academics. He never listened, continuing with his flippant attitude.We soon parted ways after graduation, and gradually lost contact.A few years till today, I was browsing through LinkedIn and chanced across his profile. Having preconceived notions about his current life based on my past interactions with him, I honestly thought he would have transferred to poly or started to work since Singapore’s cookie-cutter academic system evidently wasn't for him. Imagine my surprise when I saw his credentials “Studying Law in Stanford University” – a prestigious course that only the cream of the crop can enter!I contacted him, asking him how he has been all these years, and expressed my curiosity at how he managed to cope with academics in Junior College despite doing poorly in secondary school. After all, you don'tIt turns out that heHe confessed to me that he had this dream of becoming a lawyer from an early age, but never really saw the usefulness of the syllabus he was studying – Singapore is well known for its science-oriented studies instead of the humanities. During his free time in secondary school, he'd spend most of his time reading books on law and legislation, philosophy and making notes on what he had learnt. Showing me his notebook compiling all that he had written, I was awed by a sight of him I've never seen before – diligence. However, once he realized the need for perfect grades as a pre-requisite for his dream course, he placed more focus onto his studies, working diligently to rebuild his weak foundations.It made me realize the bitter truth, thatMy friend, conversely, was lazy becausePeople are lazy when they don't prioritize what they are doing. They procrastinate, do other things they are more interested in, and only come back to the task when it becomes urgent, or they finally see a need to get it done. My friend only saw law studies as his priority early on, but after realizing the need for stellar grades, began placing his other subjects as top priority. Everything he didAnd that's what a smart worker does.",32 followers,Neeva Vithalani,9.6K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Can-Smart-Technology-Boost-Student-Engagement-and-Happiness-in-Higher-Education

Our team at Grammarly has compiled a handy list of common grammatical errors to help make your writing accurate, clear, and professional.Ambiguous (“Squinting”) modifiersA squinting modifier is a misplaced modifier that, because of its location in a sentence, could modify either the phrase that precedes it or the one that follows it. In the example sentence, is the subject listening to music slowly or slowly getting a headache? To correct a squinting modifier, move its position in the sentence to clarify to the reader which word you intend to modify.Misuse of lie/layIf you plan to place or put an object somewhere, such as a plate on a table, you should use “lay.” If you intend to stretch out on a bed for a nap, you should use “lie.” The verb “lie” is an intransitive verb, which means it does not need an object. The transitive verb “lay” requires an object.It may take some getting used to this “lay” or “lie” business; after all, misuse of these verbs is common. But if you remember to lay down your fork before you’re full, then you won’t have to lie down later from overeating.Comma splicesHe was very hungry, so he ate a whole pizza.To splice means to connect or join. When a writer joins two independent sentences with a comma instead of separating them with a period or coordinating conjunction, that’s a comma splice.The comma has its jobs to do, but connecting two independent sentences isn’t one of them. Besides, the period gets testy when his sister, the comma, steals his thunder. Periods have their jobs, and so do commas, but never the twain shall meet—unless it’s in the form of a semicolon. Semicolons can also take the place of a coordinating conjunction, such as “and,” “but,” or “so,” among others.Run-on sentencesRun-on sentences, also known as fused sentences, occur when two complete sentences are squashed together without using a coordinating conjunction or proper punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon. Run-on sentences can be short or long. A long sentence isn’t necessarily a run-on sentence.To avoid run-on sentences, see if there is more than one idea communicated by two or more independent clauses. In our examples, there are two complete sentences:Example:Example:Both sentences are complete ideas by themselves; therefore, use a semicolon or a period to indicate that they are separate independent clauses.Using “could of” instead of “could have”“Could have” is always correct; “could of” never is. Writers probably make this grammar gaffe because, when we speak, the contraction “could’ve” sounds an awful lot like “could of.”TautologiesTautologies express the same thing twice with different words. In our example, the word “made” implies that Jack used his own two hands to create the pail. The prepositional phrase “with his own hands” creates a redundancy. Once you know what they are, it’s fun to discover tautologies: dilapidated ruins, close proximity, added bonus, large crowd...The list goes on and on!After reading through this list of common grammatical mistakes, you might be wondering how to remember all these rules as you write.
