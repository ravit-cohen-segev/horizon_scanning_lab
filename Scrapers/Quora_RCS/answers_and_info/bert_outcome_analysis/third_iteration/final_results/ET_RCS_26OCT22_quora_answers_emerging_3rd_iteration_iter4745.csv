Here is a list of my cherished moments from an unforgettable era.1) 10 o'clock was very late in the night.2) The tape recorder was one of the greatest inventions for you as a kid.3) You would go to your neighbor's house to watch tv and not to forget you would use their phone for both incoming and outgoing.4) You would collect the stamps of all the letters that usually your NRI cousins wrote.5) Cool drinks and ice creams were occasional.6) Summer holidays meant visiting relatives. Either you visited them or they visited you.7)How could one describe the beauty of growing up in the 90s in words.

Never had to worry about home work much.12) Your teachers really taught you.13) You would watch following cartoons on Star Plus after school. Duck Tales, Talespin, Chip and Dale, Goof Troop, Gummi Bears, The Little Mermaid, Mickey Mouse and friends, Small wonder, aladdin and on saturdays and sundays usually it was Spiderman. All of that in hindi.14) You never really bothered about time much.15) You really respected and feared your elders.16) You loved playing those 16 bit video games.17) You loved flying kites.18) Sundays usually meant having a hair cut and washing your hair with ""Clinic Plus"" Shampoo. Then watching rangoli, Mowgli back to back on Doordarshan.19) Your granny would put you to sleep by telling you stories that really had a moral in them.20) Knowledge was always with the old and wise you would learn a lot from them each time they told you something.21) You rarely heard the word ""tension.""22) This was one of your proud possessions23) You loved your pencil box.24) You probably sipped a cool drink with a straw more than once.25) If somebody had a mobile phone with them you know they were really rich.26) You have fond memories of Doordarshan news and Doordarshan.27) You have had an endless struggle to maintain an ink pen correctly but you loved it.28) The only way to book a railway ticket was by standing in queue.29) You loved watching this show in hindi on Nickelodeon. The legends of the hidden temple.30) We all saw a little bit of ourselves in Dennis.31) And at the dawn of the new millennium the biggest superstar of Indian cinema hosted a T.V show which would go on to win the TRPs and hearts of innumerable Indians across the world and yea the roads were empty once it was 9 pm.32) You also wanted to represent your school in the Bournvita quiz contest.33) Owning a Maruti 800 was a luxury and a dream for the upper middle class.34) You know the value of 25 paise and what you could once buy with it like aamkut.35) You sometimes substituted your urge for a cola with this:36) Hamara Bajaj. The ride for the middle class then.37) This show was very funny and you loved it.38) Just recollect how may times have you watched this song on tv and tried to dance like him.39) The iPod of the 90s40) The moment you realized magic is all about the coat. You probably watched this song many times on TV.41) You really know what a joint family means.42) This was the only meaning of a tablet back then.43) You know that there was something called as a black and white tv once.44) You definitely operated a tv which didn't have a remote.45) Siblings spoke to each other when they were in the house not with their respective boy friend or girl friend or for that matter even friends.46) Pictures were memories and were in a private album not in a public space. Each picture then would tell a story of its own.47) You waited for a particular time everyday to watch your favorite song on music channels. Some times you got lucky and didn't have to wait.48) How about playing a video game for 5 minutes with 1 rupee?49) How about some radium in your pencil box? A wrist watch with a radium dial?50) A wristwatch was cool if it had light in it and of course showing it off your friends in the dark made it even cooler.51) This was the baap of all dance shows then and the hosts made you laugh like hell.52) For many of us this was one of the best animated movies ever growing up.53) All of us love this54) How about some Rasna?55) You have listened to plays or dramas on radio at least once.56) How about watching a movie with your whole family including your granny in the theater carrying your own bottle of water? Was only possible back then.57) How about searching for your hall ticket number in a newspaper anxiously? If you haven't experienced this you have at least heard stories about this.58) Most of your general knowledge was either gathered by reading a book for general knowledge or English newspapers.59) Time for ""Pepsi"" everyone60) Most of us first interacted with a computer in our school's computer lab.61) How about a family dinner where all the members of the family ate at the same time at the dining table talking to each other instead of looking at their mobile phones despite repeatedly saying that one shouldn't talk while eating?62) How about watching Mahabharat on DD nationalwith the whole family on a sunday morning from 9:00 am – 10:00 am? You can't get its title track out of your head.63) We loved our sunday mornings. That was the day when people switched off everything else and got glued to their tv sets. The channels would put their best content up on this day. We miss it a lot now. The whole culture of sunday mornings has disappeared somewhere in the fog of modern television.64) You can't stop your lips from singing these tracks every time you see or hear them65) You usually met a lot of strangers while travelling and actually had a conversation with them without being lost in your smartphone or laptop or whatever.66) Border was one of your favorite movies then and you love this song.67) You have heard about the ""Kargil"" war but you were too young to understand what was really happening. But at the end of it you were very proud that India won the war.68) This song redefined patriotic songs and patriotism for an entire generation and we were among the first ones to hear it. It is so awesome that even today there is no republic day or independence day without it. Pure A.R. Rahman magic.69) This is most likely the first ball pen you ever wrote with.70) This was a movie for the families, of the families and by the families. You may have watched this movie with your family.71) The whole nation got obsessed with this Hollywood movie like no other back then.72) This movie was a cult and you might have had to watch it; courtesy your cousins or sisters or bothers.73) This song was a rage and the whole nation fell in love with it. Yea74) You know that there's clothing brand for men called ""Kumar's"".75) All the jobs except the watchman's were mostly from 9 to 5. People on these jobs were people not resources.76) How about getting your favorite song recorded on a cassette?77) This daily soap was hard to ignore given the sheer popularity of this show amongst the women in every house and yeah it had a very catchy title track too. At 10 right after KBC all the women in the house gathered to watch this:78) Almost every house had a beautiful guest which would come uninvited. Today its difficult to even spot them. ""The Sparrow""79) The girls loved their iconic BSA Lady bird. Evenings meant cycling for a lot of kids back then and girls enjoyed their ride on the ladybird. Though the cycle has undergone a lot of transformation it is still edged in our hearts.80) How about our very own superhero tv series? Sounds too far fetched huh? But this guy was there on tv sets every sunday at 12:00 pm. Yeah on popular demand. The one and only shaktimaan.P.S.I have added a few more points, some of them courtesy the wonderful comments.

The period from 1992–94 was especially breathtaking. It was a time icons were made. It was the time India was made. It was also a time India faced massive threats [Babri Masjid and its fall out, Mumbai blasts, plague scare, Harshad Mehta, Kashmir terrorism, collapse of USSR, Gulf war].Think of Sachin Tendulkar, Aishwarya Rai, AR Rahman - all thoseThere have been so many cricketers in India’s sporting history - Gavaskar, Vengsarkar, Pataudi - but none captured the imagination of masses like Sachin Tendulkar. Go to any part of India, you would find a Sachin Tendulkar imagery. Poor, rich, religious, irreligious, urban, rural, north, south - all those differences vanish in Sachin’s fandom.I remember coming home from school with excitement to watch Sachin’s first centuries - in the autumn of 1994. There was nothing as joyful in those boyhood times as watching Sachin score a century. Even by his first century he was a national sensation. In 1996, he would be joined by two more icons - Ganguly and Dravid. We would have bets on who would finally beat Desmond Haynes who had an insurmountable 17 ODI centuries.There have been many great musicians. However, almost all of them were local brands. Ilayaraja was superb, but known only to the Tamils. Then came AR Rahman - a national brand who made India sing to the same tune. Roja was a sensation. In theaters, the flag burning scene always had a standing ovation. Indians started gelling far better.There have been so many Miss Worlds and Miss Universes. No one else could create the sensation like Aishwarya Rai did. It was as though sheer beauty India’s differences. She was a sensation well before the victory [remember those Pepsi ads]. I remember my close friend in 6th standard agonizing over Rai losing Miss India to Sushmita Sen.Harshad Mehta and his buddies had made stock markets really attractive. We lived in Delhi in a housing project for “lower income” people, but most of those aunties would busily chat about Reliance and Dabur shares. I was in 6th standard when I could go through every stock IPO and help my father by Oriental Bank of Commerce IPO. We were flipping stocks like crazy.I remember when Coca Cola was allowed to come into India in 1993. My dad took me to the shop to buy a chilled bottle of iconic Coke and told me something along the lines of “this is how freedom tastes like”. The sugar was taking Indians to a high. I remember holding my first bottle of Coke - that brilliantly designed glass bottle and still can’t believe how much that stupid sugar water is so addictive.Manmohan Singh made budgets a sexy affair. I remember my parents, uncles and other adults glued to the television like a world cup final. Cricket itself became sexy in the 1990s - Sharjah, Hero Cup and the various innovations from Packer in Australia made the sleepy sport sensational.TV became very sexy. In a very short time in early 1990s we got whole of world channels piped into our home and it was a shock after watching the staid state owned Doordarshan. The blatant nudity of HBO movies & FTV was a massive shock to Indians corrupted by Victorian era morals. They reacted as though they never seen nudity in temple walls.We collected Big Fun chewing wrappers and the idea was that the runs in those wrappers amounted to something. We bought trump cards [especially WWF ones and I always wanted Undertaker card when he was Rank 3] and played like maniacs. My principal once seized my pack and my friends theorized that maybe he didn’t want to buy one for his son ;-)Besides watching WWF [later WWE] we watched lots of Cartoon Network once we came home from school [it is not like you could watch cartoons on phones back then]. On DD there was the Superhit Muqabla [sort of like MTV billboard] with random albums by Baba Sehgal, Alisha Chinai etc besides Bollywood songs. The tour of Michael Jackson in 1996 was also a massive sensation. My dad was a big fan of MJ but even the live telecast at the Chennai beach was expensive.In a very short time we went from this:to this:By mid 1990s we had the Internet. I remember the iconic reception Bill Gates got in India to launch Windows 95. Even the regional magazines were full of things about Bill Gates [maybe Microsoft PR did a lot of spending]. Internet was a rage in the late 1990s. A school teacher of mine started teaching Java. One month he taught and next month he was gone. Some company in California vacuumed him paying 50 times the salary he got as a school teacher at my school. People joked that they would call their BCom degrees as B[dot]com.I was reading about Internet for a long time and in 1998 I finally got to browse my first page. It was crazy expensive - Rs. 60 for 1 hour of browsing [that is like Rs 300 now]. I had 10 rupees and a super slow modem, thus had only enough time to create my first email account that I use to this day. The next two years, as the prices crashed my school friends and I would spend a lot of time on the Internet [while we would start researching search engines and science projects eventually we would end up askingI bought my first domain name in 11th standard, but didn’t realize those addresses are not permanent. Plenty of my pages over time ended up in the trash bin. It was an age of optimism.The early 1990s manic action gave way to a brutal hangover in 1995–96. Narasimha Rao completely lost it and was mired in huge scams. He was not born to be a revolutionary and could not get comfortable in his new shoes. Unlike in the case of Deng Xiaoping in China, his revolution was less planned and accidental. The iconic Agni missiles were sent to cold storage and the economic reforms were gone. Markets crashed and real estate prices went through a long fall.By 1996 all we could hear was bad news. Taliban was taking over Afghanistan and we would get horror news from them. In 1997, South East Asia went through a massive market crash. As Pakistan started testing increasingly large ranges of missiles they bought from North Korea, there was a fear of a nuclear war. There was ethnic cleansing of Pandits in Kashmir valley and there was a massive indecision in governance.In 1995, we went to J&K for pilgrimage and I remember fearing terrorist attacks anytime. It was a time when terrorists would bomb at will and kidnap tourists. In 2–3 years they removed all western tourists from those idyllic hills. At the same time, the Punjab terrorism was in wane. We went to Ludhiana to have a large glass of Lassi as though to celebrate that end.While the early 1990s was a renaissance of the southern cinema with the rise of Manirathnam, Rahman, Shankar etc, in Bollywood it was a fall. The Kapoor/Bhachhan era gave way to the Khans and in the early days they were acting out cheesy romantic flicks with super long names - KKHH, DDLJ, HAHK...With Hindi industry making such flicks, India’s oscar nominations in that decade were primarily dominated by Tamil - Anjali (1990), Thevar Magan (1992), Kuruthipunal (1995), Indian (1996), Jeans (1998) and Hey Ram (2000). [Since then no Tamil movie got the honour].Quality Hindi movies became rare in 1990s and that came at the turn of the millennium with Lagaan - when the Khans moved to more serious stories. If 1990s Bollywood has to be summarized it is that “Boy loved girl. Then girl loved boy. They all danced”.In late 1990s there was the Y2K scare and many serious people thought that the world would come to an end when the nuclear missiles would go berserk as they move from 99 to 00 [oh those crazy fears and conspiracies].Overall, the 1990s packed action, fear and excitement. It was like being in a theme park.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,6.3K,5.6K,427.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-was-it-like-to-grow-up-in-India-in-the-1990s

I recall fighting with my brother to play Mario.We had a local video game shop where we played Mario at 50 ps per chance.Literally ‘Ice, Water’. In this game, there would be one ‘den’ who would set out to ‘freeze’ his opponents.In Sanskrit, Vish means ‘poison’ and Amrit means ‘Nectar.’ This game was also known as Lock and Key.In this game, one person is chosen as the denner. The denner chases the other players and gives them vish by touching them and saying aloud Vish. As soon as vish is given to a player, this player freezes in his position until his other teammate comes and set him/her free by giving Amrit. Amrit is given by touching the stationery player and shouting out Amrit. The game continues till all the players are given Vish by the denner and no one is left to give Amrit.The game is played by one player chosen (designated as being ""it"") closing their eyes and counting to a predetermined number while the other players hide. After reaching this number, the player who is ""it"" calls, ""Ready or not, here I come!"" and then attempts to locate all concealed players.ADVERTISEMENTAshish Choudhary (Then)Was really obsessed by the girl in that ad.Commercial 1:Commercial 2:TV Shows back then…Malgudi DaysBoogie Woogie ..

They also bring in famous ASK ME ANYTHING guests who want to reach their audience which attracts new traffic to the site.So . . . the first thing is a straightforward, robust, easy to use, platform that makes conversations easy to find and participate in. Second is get a great conversation started with the kind of people who are online all day and who engage in reading and writing all day.Long ago I co-founded Yahoo Group for Writers that went big in a matter of hours which set itself apart because I said writers were free to talk about their own work as long as they weren't just posting pitches or ads.  I liked hearing about their books and characters and creative decisions. Readers liked the site, writers liked the site, and it just grew all by itself.  We didn't have to do anything really.Monetizing that traffic was a bit more complex . . . as Digg, Reddit, StumbleUpon or Fark illustrate. People are getting the content they want without having to buy anything . . . When you fill their page with ads or try to implement any costs, the friction makes them think about taking their eyes elsewhere.",47 followers,Deepak Mishra,958,2.4K,138.4M,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-future-of-education-considering-so-much-digital-transformation-with-technology

They want to share, tell stories, look awesome to their friends/family, etc. So building sharing/inviting into the Flickr platform was just a way to enable users to do what they wanted to do with their photos anyway.I highly recommend watching/studying Dave McClure's presentations on ""Startup Metrics for Pirates.""

54,"That's the science fiction scenario everyone believes in, but when the Persian Empire invaded Greece, many Greek city-states fought on the Persian side. And when the European colonial powers invaded the Americas, some First Nations sided with them against their traditional local enemies. That's how the Hurons were completely wiped out, for example.So I think that's a bit of wishful thinking.

To build an army and send it to conquer another planet?We are talking about technology that would make even our greatest technology seem like bronze swords and shields.We humans would be the Spartans… They would be the T-888 of the Terminator movies.That is how big of a gap would be our technological level.In a matter of fact that always was the War of Worlds story, greatest flaw. Where they are incredibly more advanced than us and then they get defeated by an Earth virus.The actual reality would be this…An invasive alien species would want our planet or us.And I say “us” because what was shown in the movie Skyline isn't that far fetched. Where some alien AI wants to expand itself and thus it is sending forces throughout the cosmos to collect the brains of intelligent species.If said alien species came for our planet then the best way to go about it, is not to duke it out with the humans or hunt us down. Nope!The best method of approach would be to kidnap some humans. Study human physiology. And then make a virus with a 100% death rate to wipe us all out.This is reality! This is what they would do.Why spent resources wiping us out with giant robots, spaceships, or hunting us down one by one when they could easily send a virus to kill us all.Now… If they wanted us. Or something from our bodies. Now that would make sense that they would invade with several machines.But what it doesn't make sense is to kill off your resources. So those aliens would need to have means of making so humans could not fight them off.Be it some virus that would mess with our brains making us completely docile or powerless to react. Or by simply creating some sort of signal that affected human brains placing all humans in a state of coma.That way they could simply arrive, collect all the humans and be done with it.Movies show us having a chance because if humans were always kicking the bucket in those invasions, then no one would go see those movies.So fiction has given this illusion that if an alien species has the technology to come here then we could still fight them off.That is sheer insanity! That is human ego taken to an absurd level.They can travel dozens, hundreds, perhaps thousands of light years, and they would be taken out by bullets and missiles… (Ô.o)?!? No one in their right mind can believe in such nonsense.There is only scenario where humans would stand a chance.That scenario being that they aren't that much more advanced than us, only slightly more. And they didn't come here to fight us but are instead an alien refugee race. That for whatever reason escaped from their homeworld and they just happened to set their course towards our planet.In that scenario, we would be faced with a M.A.D scenario. Basically… Mutual Assured Destruction.Where if they tried to destroy us we would destroy them.And if we tried to destroy them they would destroy us.Lose-lose scenario essentially.As for the world coming together to fight them… Do you live in this world? In this planet?We can hardly agree on anything.If the aliens came. Each country, each city, each person, would need to look after themselves.For one, the world would never agree on who should lead the fight. Each nation would have their strategy to deal with them. So there would be no common ground.Humanity would only perhaps come together, after it had already been mainly wiped out. Where there would be no more nations, no more religions, no more ethnicities, no more race… We would be humans looking out for other humans.Take the recent fires of the Amazonian Rain Forest. Most of the world were at odds because each separate nation had their own views of how things should have been handled.And that's just one example amongst many.",47 followers,Patrik Tsar,1.7K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-was-it-like-to-grow-up-in-India-in-the-1990s
