The larger the organization, the more likely it is that a team of 20+ engineers can already handle the heavy lifting and wouldn’t need more than a meeting a couple times a month or an occasional brief with the technical leads.Come to think of it, the last 4 CEOs I’ve worked for were engineers and didn’t spend more than 2–4 hours a month on the technical stack (and usually reviewing roadmaps or high-end architecture planning, less hands-on). But they have also supported the tech department when we have been understaffed or overworked - facilitating the technical project management, answering some strategic technical questions, doing technical support or even programming as needed.We employ over 30 people and my day-to-day now is mainly related to management, strategic planning, improving processes and coordinating requirements with different team leaders; reviewing performance, talking to clients, making sure that we’re on track with milestones and so forth. I used to spend all of my time programming over the first year or two, dropped down to about 50% for the next year or so.Nowadays I spend a couple of months annually on active programming (during peak periods and holiday seasons when lots of folks are off) or a couple days a month on deployments, designing technical architectures, reviewing technical tools or code reviews when the workload is normal.","12,051 followers",Noah Kagan,10.1K,103,3.4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Who-are-Top-10-tech-CEOs

Conversely, there are those who have a great 10 year plan, but are going to be out of business in about 10 months. And then there are those who can get short term results in conjunction with a vision for the future. Those are the good ones.”I have worked in companies with excellent CEOs whose limit of ability peaked out at a certain level, usually between 50 and 100 million dollars annually. They were great up til that point but they could never master the skills to get beyond it. In one company he was the home-grown CEO and founder. He was brilliant and smart but his vision failed him at the 50 - 100 million dollar mark and the company languished. By the time everyone realized this it was too late, the market passed us by and we were on the slow road to Hell. I also worked at companies where the vision of the President was far-reaching and all-encompassing. This was John Chambers, the man who ran Cisco. When he first got there, Cisco was on the verge of bankruptcy. Within ten years it was the undisputed market leader. He was able to ride the technology wave and harness it to propel future growth. He wasn’t afraid to sacrifice yesterday’s award winning but now creaky technology for something new. I also worked at a company where the CEO and founder was more fond of riding his bike in road races than running the company. He was a smart man in every way, but vitriolic, petty and small and the company never exceeded ten million in revenue and was sold for scrap eventually. I’ve worked at companies run by technology gurus who thought their little science project would alter the world. They zoomed up the revenue ladder while they sat back and let everything go stale, forgetting that today’s cutting edge technology is tomorrow’s blunt instrument. Everything changes and you have to be on top of it every day. It’s okay to fail as long as you keep moving and keep trying — sooner or later at least one of your ideas will take off (hopefully). But standing still, as Thomas Watson of IBM once siad, it’s “death knell of any business.” So there is no one answer to your question. I want the CEO who is going to propel me to success through the success of the company. I like the idea of a good ole boy who started the thing riding it to success — but that doesn’t always work. Riding a company to success by the seat of your pants is rare no matter what you hear of Musk and Zuckerberg. The road to success is often littered with formerly great names of companies that believed in one man and rode his vision into obscurity — WANG and DEC come to mind.",256 followers,Priyal Gupta,9.7K,0,0,2016,https://www.quora.com/Who-are-Top-10-tech-CEOs

An ambulance arrives, the EMTs strap him to a stretcher, and the lead EMT asks him, “Are you comfortable?”The Jew shrugs and says, “I make a decent living.”* * *OK, now that I've gotten that off my chest, here's my answer to your borderline antisemitic question. A lot of people will say we do it the same way as everyone else, which is about 95% true, but the real reason for Jewish financial success is that after centuries of being denied access to traditional occupations, Jews became expert in finding unexploited opportunities in Gentile economies.Jewish involvement in banking arose because Gentiles were forbidden by their religions to lend money at interest. As soon as they overcame their moral objections to usury (and overcome them they did, with a vengeance), the Jews were pushed to the sidelines by Christian bankers.Similarly, Jews became involved in the diamond trade because the product was small, valuable, and eaily concealed on the person or in the luggage of a traveller.Jews more or less invented modern basketball as a commercial concern. In the 1930s, most of the players and owners were Jews. As in so many instances, Gentiles saw Jews making money at something they had disparaged and swooped in to take control and, often credit.But the best example is the motion picture industry. In the early 20th century, Edison's invention was seen by Gentile businessmen as a novelty at best, certainly not something worth investing in. The Jews begged to differ. We found in Hollywood a cheap, sunny place to make movies and got busy. Jews still have undue influence in the movies because our involvement in the early stages were so expansive and, frankly, this one is our baby of which we are justifiably proud: a whole new artform, midwifed and brought to maturity almost exclusively by Jews.Gentiles wonder why Jews tend to be more successful on average than them; we wonder why Gentiles are so unsuccessful. The answer is that Judaism is centered on the community and has a mutual aid society mentality that ensures that no one gets left behind. Gentile society is based on the haves exploiting and mistreating the have-nots for their own personal benefit. It is competitive and essentially predatory in concept.In Judaism, beggars on the street are aAdd in the “crabs in a bucket” attitude of the Gentile underclass, with individuals striving to keep others at the same level of distress they're experiencing rather than striving to help each other succeed, and it's no wonder Western Gentiles experience significantly worse economic outcomes than their Jewish counterparts.The same is true for other groups with similar cultures and traditions—Indians, Chinese and other East Asians, immigrants from the Caribbean—but for some reason the only successful group with whom Gentiles take issue is the Jews.

They were now quite impressive.It had taken more than 120 years to collect the first thousand asteroids, since the discovery of Ceres, largest of these tiny worlds, on the very first day of the nineteenth century. Hundreds had been found and lost and found again; they existed in such swarms that one exasperated astronomer had christened them “vermin of the skies.” He would have been appalled to know that SPACEGUARD was now keeping track of half a million.Only the five giants—Ceres, Pallas, Juno, Eunomia, and Vesta—were more than two hundred kilometers in diameter; the vast majority were merely oversized boulders that would fit into a small park. Almost all moved in orbits that lay beyond Mars. Only the few that came far enough sunward to be a possible danger to Earth were the concern of SPACEGUARD. And not one in a thousand of these, during the entire future history of the solar system, would pass within a million kilometers of Earth.The object first catalogued 31/439, according to the year and the order of its discovery, was detected while it was still outside the orbit of Jupiter. There was nothing unusual about its location; many asteroids went beyond Saturn before turning once more toward their distant master, the Sun. And Thule II, most far-ranging of all, traveled so close to Uranus that it might as well be a moon of that planet.But a first radar contact at such a distance was unprecedented; clearly, 31/439 must be of exceptional size. From the strength of the echo, the computers deduced a diameter of at least forty kilometers. Such a giant had not been discovered for a hundred years. That it had been overlooked for so long seemed incredible.Then the orbit was calculated, and the mystery was resolved—to be replaced by a greater one. 31/439 was not traveling on a normal asteroidal path, along an ellipse which it retraced with clockwork precision every few years. It was a lonely wanderer among the stars, making its first and last visit to the solar system—for it was moving so swiftly that the gravitational field of the Sun could never capture it. It would flash inward past the orbits of Jupiter, Mars, Earth, Venus, and Mercury, gaining speed as it did so, until it rounded the Sun and headed out once again into the unknown.It was at this point that the computers started flashing their “We have something interesting” sign, and, for the first time, 31/439 came to the attention of human beings. There was a brief flurry of excitement at SPACEGUARD headquarters, and the interstellar vagabond was quickly dignified by a name instead of a mere number. Long ago, the astronomers had exhausted Greek and Roman mythology; now they were working through the Hindu pantheon. And so 31/439 was christened Rama.For a few days, the news media made a fuss over the visitor, but they were badly handicapped by the sparsity of information. Only two facts were known about Rama: its unusual orbit and its approximate size. Even this last was merely an educated guess, based upon the strength of the radar echo. Through the telescope, Rama still appeared as a faint, fifteenth-magnitude star—much too small to show a visible disc. But as it plunged in toward the heart of the solar system, it would grow brighter and larger month by month; before it vanished forever, those orbiting observatories would be able to gather more precise information about its shape and size. There was plenty of time, and perhaps during the next few years some spaceship on its ordinary business might be routed close enough to get good photographs. An actual rendezvous was most unlikely; the energy cost would be far too great to permit physical contact with an object cutting across the orbits of the planets at more than a hundred thousand kilometers per hour.So the world soon forgot about Rama. But the astronomers did not. Their excitement grew with the passing months as the new asteroid presented them with more and more puzzles.First of all, there was the problem of Rama’s light curve. It didn’t have one.All known asteroids, without exception, showed a slow variation in their brilliance, waxing and waning in a period of a few hours. It had been recognized for more than two centuries that this was an inevitable result of their spin and their irregular shape. As they toppled end over end along their orbits, the reflecting surfaces they presented to the sun were continually changing, and their brightness varied accordingly.Rama showed no such changes. Either it was not spinning at all or it was perfectly symmetrical. Both explanations seemed unlikely.And with that, Arthur C. Clarke kicks off","2,140 followers",Sammy Lahr,911,91,1.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Who-are-Top-10-tech-CEOs

This isn’t at all to say that it is a junior or youth-intended novel.In fact, Card said in the foreward ofAlso, I was also that one kid who readEnder’s GameIt has won the Nebula Award for Best Novel, Science Fiction Chronicle Reader Award for Best Novel, and Hugo Award for Best Novel, the most prestigious award in Science Fiction, held by greats like Ray Bradbury forPerhaps the greatest thing about the book is the fact that—from a third-person limited perspective—the main character is a ruthless, calculating psychopath. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth, and this is found through a deeply profound and, honestly, beautiful, insight of the protagonist (Ender) through his eyes.It takes place in a setting with aliens and spaceships and somehow manages to make all of that a backdrop for a brilliant psychological character study and an observation of group dynamics.3)I stopped counting how many times I readIt is a deeply intimate coming-of-age story of a brilliant boy, and the not-so-brilliant scenarios he becomes involved with. It is the brainchild of Patrick Rothfuss, a perfectionist who has worked music into his words. Each page has a subtle grace, an incredible intricacy that can leave you laughing, crying, or clenching the book in rabid anticipation.It is written impeccably—in such a fashion that the intelligent will experience a depth rarely found in the fantasy genre, yet balances it with action-packed scenes and rollicking story-telling.If you give it the time, it will reward you greatly.The worldbuilding is amazing, the characters three-dimensional, and the words are like magic. Truly a work of art; a song in everything but name.10/10 would recommend.4)I would highly recommend theIt has the grander scope of5)I have yet to finish this series, but the first three have been on-par with any book I’ve read. Unlike, say, works by Rothfuss or Sanderson the magic system is considered “soft-magic”, meaning less detailed, more mystical. Despite that, the story and characters are anything but soft.This book is deeply engrossing; it’s characters possessing all of the dimensions that so many other books lack. This is the book that revolutionized the fantasy genre, inspiring other grim-and-gritty fantasy series like:6)This book has—hands down—theThe author plays with your emotions like a bard would his lute—that is—often and with great skill. This book is not for the faint of heart, but for those who can stand the substantial cut of7)Read this if you want a bit of a break but still a very good story. You won’t read anything you haven’t before, but the way it is written and relayed is extraordinary. The word choice is very good, and the worldbuilding remarkable. As I said, some consider this cliche and closer to a video-game than a book, but I still recommend it if you have free time. 7–8/108)This vividly-written book takes the fantasy genre in a new direction. The main character is not a hero by any means, (the opening chapter shows him leading a gang of thieves to pillage a town), but you find yourself sympathizing with him all the same.This book is dark, brooding, and extremely well-written. It is fast-paced while balancing a great story-line. I found myself mesmerized by Lawrence’s first-person narrative yet horrified at the person I was reading about. But, beyond any doubt, this is a book that every fantasy fan should read at least once — and many will read over and over again.The teaser is as follows:“When he was nine, he watched as his mother and brother were killed before him. By the time he was thirteen, he was the leader of a band of bloodthirsty thugs. By fifteen, he intends to be king...It’s time for Prince Honorous Jorg Ancrath to return to the castle he turned his back on, to take what’s rightfully his. Since the day he hung pinned on the thorns of a briar patch and watched Count Renar’s men slaughter his mother and young brother, Jorg has been driven to vent his rage. Life and death are no more than a game to him—and he has nothing left to lose.But treachery awaits him in his father’s castle. Treachery and dark magic. No matter how fierce his will, can one young man conquer enemies with power beyond his imagining?”The series is currently six books long (all best-sellers) and will keep you busy—locked in morbid, adventurous fascination—for some time.9)As millions of fans can claim, this book is magical in more ways than one.After reading the series numerous times, I can still open up to any book and feel a rush of happiness. Enthrallment in the story-line, passion for the style of writing, and love for the characters themselves.All of this goes to show that Rowling is astonishingly wise. She took this fantastical, unachievable world, and filled it with actualThat is something so rarely achieved in fantasy, and it makes me happy to read over and over again.She immortalized this book in our hearts and minds as something real. With interactive elements and an entire world at your fingertips due to the extended franchise. It opens up role-play, movie watching, dedicated discussion groups. It offers something for the old and the young, introverted or extroverted. Reading over the course of the series, you get to see old friends grow up a world away. You get to know every aspect of them and grow to love them while having never seen them in your life.It is, in some ways, the perfect book.I may have outgrown it a bit, and look upon it less and less as the years go by, but it still never fails to make me smile.“After all this time?”10) I have yet to find a series with better worldbuilding thanAs of yet, there’s only three books—but over threeSanderson’s magnum opus has a richer world than nearly any other you will come across. Every detail is extremely vivid, each description gradually peeling a dust-cover away from the vast, colorful tapestry that is the world withinThis book has everything an avid and intelligent reader of fantasy could want. It has constantly evolving characters, massive battles and action, and subtle political intrigue. It is a story of assassins and artists, warriors and scholars, kings and the slaves that rule under them—all at the same time. It is told from many different perspectives to offer broad and contradicting views to the same events that occur.It takes Tolkien-level detail and combines it with heart-pounding action sequences and battle scenes, all written by an author with hands down the best magic-systems I’ve ever witnessed. It incites emotions and storms of thought to ensnare you, pulling you into a world of physical tempestuous turmoil and people full of suffering. Internal and external conflicts mix into an amalgam that paint the world into a breathtaking adventure.Mystery hides in every shadow—the line between history and myth blurring as intricate organizations throughout the world are revealed, their plans and purposes dubious at best.This is one of the best things I’ve ever read, hands-down. The author releases books far more often than some other known fantasy authors (not complaining, I swear, but *cough* Patrick Rothfuss. *cough*) so you’ll never wait too long for the next volume.If you want a book that will enthrall you, make you a better writer, and present you with thought-provoking philosophies at the same time,I heartily recommend it.11) Another personal favorite of mine is the British-authoredAlthough the main character is just 13 in the first book, he is mature and ages quickly with the series, (ends with protagonist at 17 years old) making it likable for all ages. The premise is as follows:“CHERUB agents are highly trained, extremely talented--and all under the age of seventeen. For official purposes, these agents do not exist. They are sent out on missions to spy on terrorists, hack into crucial documents, and gather intel on global threats—all without gadgets or weapons. It is an exceptionally dangerous job, but these agents have one crucial advantage: adults never suspect that teens are spying on them. “It might sound a little childish—but honestly—I freaking love this series. The drama is perfectly executed, and the series as a whole is very realistic. It’sCHERUB has everything: heart-pounding action, excellent character development/flaws, romance, and just that cool spy element. Highly recommend.12)Even if you normally dislike the science-fiction genre, you’ll love this book. It focuses less on unlikely future technology so much as the internal struggles of a man millions of miles from everything he’s ever known, and those people so far away who are trying to get him back home.And though this book seems on the surface to be a deeply introspective, novel, it’s hilarious. The main character has an evident sense of humor, utilized as a coping mechanism. One chapter, you’ll be clenching your side in laughter, and the next, gritting your teeth in animalistic anticipation.The teaser on Amazon says:“Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars.Now, he's sure he'll be the first person to die there.After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he’s alive—and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive.Chances are, though, he won't have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old ""human error"" are much more likely to kill him first.But Mark isn't ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills—and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit—he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?”This book is a step in the right direction. You’ll find no laser-guns here, but the message and emotional theme will be just as cutting.13)This book takes your favorite classic story elements and utilizes them to flip the fantasy genre on it’s head. It’s a hybrid epic fantasy heist story with a focus on political intrigue and powerful action scenes.As Sanderson was writing this book, he wanted two central themes at the foundation:1) He knew he wanted a heist story, like2) And this is the interesting part: He wanted a story where the good-guysThe author’s teaser is as follows:“A thousand years ago, the prophesied hero from lore rose up to overthrow a great and terrible evil. Only, he lost, and the Dark Lord took over and has been ruling with an iron fist for a thousand years.Ash falls from the sky in this barren land, and mists come every night, deep and mysterious. In this setting, a gang of thieves decides that the prophecies were all lies and that they can’t trust in some fabled hero to save them. They decide to take matters into their own hands, and plan a daring heist of the dark lord himself, planning to use the emperor’s own wealth to bribe his armies away from him and take over the empire.”However, this book is far from a “wham bam, thank you ma’am” type of novel. Although the heist is important, it takes a back seat to the development of the characters. Vin: distrustful orphan who spent her life on the streets. Unwilling to recognize what she is.She takes the typical flat orphan character and evolves it into an immensely complex and realistic person with thoughts and feelings outside of the fantasy norm.Kelsier: Charismatic group leader. Scoundrel, rogue, but a perfect person, right? Wrong. His flaws are slowly revealed, showing you his horrifying past while still bonding you to the character.Sanderson is a genius with building fantastical worlds that an ordinary person can still relate to, and characters who are more than their stereotype. As Orson Scott Card (Author of“It’s rare for a fiction author to have much understanding on how leadership works or how love really takes root in the human heart. Sanderson is astonishingly wise.”This book is amazing. It wraps you up in the storyline, and makes you stay for the characters. With Sandersons’s hallmark intricate magic-system and prodigious worldbuilding combined with an innovative theme, this series will be one you’ll read again and again.…Writing about this has given me the indubitable urge to re-read this book…Au revoir!~~~Edit :Edit II:","102,699 followers",Andrew Weill,733,24.3K,175.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Who-are-Top-10-tech-CEOs

Books about entrepreneurship are all BS. Entrepreneurship is about fighting a war in the trenches. Bad things happen. Scary things happen. Deeply personal things happen that you’ll never admit ever again to anyone because of the shame you feel.Ok, I got that out of the way.The question says “entrepreneur” but I don’t even like that word. Everyone is an entrepreneur now. If you are an employee, it still means you have to manage your life the way an entrepreneur manages a business. You have to deal with customers, bosses, shareholders, and all the things that screw with life that happen every step of the way.So these are books a person should read as they try to achieve peak performance in life. As they try to find freedom, as they try to succeed in the relationships around them, as they try to build competence in the areas they love - and even find what those areas are.Here is a curriculum I would build for such a person. Note: these are not the BEST books, or the most mind-expanding books. But these are books for someone who wants to improve their lot in life.A) MASTERY. Read all of Robert Greene’s books.Particularly, “Robert Greene does years of research on each book. He studies the psychological nuances of almost every act of victory and failure in the history of the human race. He pieces together not just the event but the underlying psychology.As an aside, if you are truly fascinated with the study of peak performance, read “Peak” by Anders Ericsson, who is the original scientist behind the phrase, “The 10,000 hour rule”.Read these books and think about them. I’ve read them all three or four times.B) DO.There's a little known series I am finding short and beautiful and useful. A friend of mine designed all the covers so I started reading them. The “Do” series.To be honest, they are a recent discovery by me. But here’s why I love them: entrepreneurship is about solving a problem.What annoys you? What betrays you? What is unsatisfying in life? For instance, waiting for a cab on a rainy day when I have no umbrella annoys me. Thank god now for Uber.The same issue occurs for an artist. The problem is: I see something beautiful, and I want to bring it to life with my hands. Just like an entrepreneur.The Do books are about birthing beauty into the world. Either through art, story, performance, speaking, etc.Entrepreneurship, at its heart, is art. The DO books tell you how to create.C) ME. I don’t mean to self-promote. And to be honest, I make a total of $0 off of these books.But I wrote three books to help me solve my own problems in entrepreneurship. The problems that nobody sees. The actual things that I couldn’t deal with and had to learn the hard way.“Choose Yourself”It was really hard for me to feel deserving of success when I left the normal “standardized world”. And then I failed horribly whenever success flirted with me.I was ashamed and embarrassed until I realized I can, in fact, choose myself for success. In these books I document in detail how I did it - from suicide and depression to success and freedom.Don’t buy the books if you don’t want to. But after 600,000 copies sold of Choose Yourself I know they are helpful to people.You can only be a sell-out if you are selling.D) CURIOSITY. Brian Grazer is a mega movie prodycer. Apollo 13, a beautiful mind, splash, arrested development, etc etc. 15 billion in box office revs.He wrote a good, simple book that can be read in just a few readings -If a young man wants to rise up in life to the top he should cultivate the curious mind the young, but seriously dyslexic, Brian grazer cultivated.I was so interested in the book, I flew out to LA to visit Brian in his offices and talk about the book more. He was playful, curious, full of advice, and he listened. He was unlike anyone I had ever met, which is why he’s probably one of the most successful people I’ve ever met.E) EGO. Pair the above withALL FAILURE I have ever experiences is when my ego got in the way of my rational self. At heart we are just trying to survive. We’ve been given a sliver of light between two infinite and dark infinities.There’s no reason for ego. As Ryan puts it, “Alexander the Great” doesn’t care if Alexandria is named after him.Use the fact that everyone else has ego to your advantage. Become the nimble and creative person who challenges everyone and rises to the top before people see it coming.F) KNOWLEDGE. Don’t forget about getting basic knowledge.Entrepreneurs don’t need to know about how to read a profit and loss statement. I still don’t know anything about accounting.But know history. Know the history of knowledge. Know the history of great people.Here are some parting thoughts on books that I think are must-reads.“Modern Times”“The Rational Optimist”“Sapiens”“Socrates”“Grit”“Tiny Beautiful Things”By the way, this is only the beginning. The successful person makes reading a daily habit. I am not always good with this habit but I try. Today I finished “No Country for Old Men” by Cormac McCarthy and I started “The Fight” by Normal Mailer, a beautiful book about the Ali-Foreman fight in 1974.On my list is “Magic and Loss” by Virginia Heffernan about the relationship between the Internet and Art. And also on my list is “The Sun and the Moon and The Rolling Stones” by Rich Cohen.Every book try to get one takeaway. You can’t absorb all of a book. It’s too hard. One takeaway form each book, a solid reading habit, and good books, and you will be ahead of 99.999% of the human race.But it’s not a race. There’s no finish line. There’s only joy and well-being and the pleasure of absorbing the lives and gifts of these great authors. I hope you like this list.","33,141 followers",Susanna Viljanen,761,10.7K,164.7M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Who-are-Top-10-tech-CEOs

You gotta say,So when the mum comes back they have a porridge party and go to bed with full stomachs for the first time in a good while.The next morning, the girl goes out to play in the forest and the mum wakes up and says,“Cook, porridge, cook.”She has herself a feed but starts to panic when she sees this pot is starting to overflow and she doesn't know how to turn it off. She runs around trying to shout stuff at the pot like,“KNOCK IT OFF, POT! FARK!”Unfortunately, none of her guesses work.When the daughter returns, she sees a river of porridge bubbling out of the Hut, and mum standing on a chair screaming,“SHIT WON'T TURN OFF!”The daughter shouts, “STOP, PORRIDGE, STOP!”The cooking subsides and these poor daft babes now have to eat through the massive flood of porridge that has taken over their home.The end.I really liked this story when I was little because I loved porridge and I'd close the book and think, “Wow. Problems I'd like to have.”","7,395 followers",Derek Correy,1.1K,238,11.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Who-are-Top-10-tech-CEOs

It’s basically a philosophy of destruction and self-glorification. And it isn’t even written well or readable.This sums it up well:“There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old’s life:One is a childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes, leading to an emotionally stunted, socially crippled adulthood, unable to deal with the real world.The other, of course, involves orcs.”-John RogersI was, without question, part of the Tolkien tribe.",3 followers,Renuka Rajendran,670,82,762K,2020,https://www.quora.com/Who-are-Top-10-tech-CEOs

To pretend to be a character in someone else’s story.I think if you can find even one takeaway in a book that you remember afterwards, then it’s a great book.Remember:Time is the ultimate judge of wisdom. How you bounce back from misery and despair in order to thrive. I hope I learned that from these books.Ugh, I’m not even halfway done. And I’m past 40 books.When I read any of these books, I feel like a vampire. Like I’m sucking all of the blood out of the author. I’m stealing his soul and consuming it.Thank you, author, for giving me your soul. For giving me immortality.One of these days someone will eat my soul also.
