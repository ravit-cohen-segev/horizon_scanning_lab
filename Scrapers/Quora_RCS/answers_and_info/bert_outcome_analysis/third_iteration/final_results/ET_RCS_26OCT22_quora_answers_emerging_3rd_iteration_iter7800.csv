0,"Mostly because its fun in the story.Certainly none of the current fusion reactors we are designing could be overloaded in this manner - in all our current fusion reactor designs, if anything goes wrong you’d almost instantly lose containment, which would cause the pressure and temperature to drop dramatically, thus ceasing fusion altogether. The containment failure would quite possibly damage the interior of the reactor, making it impossible to restart without extensive repairs - but by no means should it give off more energy than the reactor would while running under normal conditions.That’sMostly because its fun in the story.Certainly none of the current fusion reactors we are designing could be overloaded in this manner - in all our current fusion reactor designs, if anything goes wrong you’d almost instantly lose containment, which would cause the pressure and temperature to drop dramatically, thus ceasing fusion altogether. The containment failure would quite possibly damage the interior of the reactor, making it impossible to restart without extensive repairs - but by no means should it give off more energy than the reactor would while running under normal conditions.That’s not to say that building a fusion reactor that WAS designed to overload and produce a large fusion explosion is impossible, but it sounds difficult to say the least, and there’s certainly no reason to imagine that most craft - even military ones - would be designed in such a way. It would be much simpler to just detonate any of the actual fusion warheads on board if you want to instantly and thoroughly scuttle your ship.So we have to imagine that something about the fundamental design of the reactors in The Expanse - which in the show are depicted as some kind of laser-confinement reactors - lends them to suffer this kind of overload by simply tweaking their operation parameters. Again, not something any of our current designs could or would accomplish.","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-fusion-reactors-cannot-be-overloaded-then-how-do-ships-overload-the-reactor-in-The-Expanse-like-the-Donnager

4,"I used to work on fusion simulation codes (particle in cell) with the US National Labs when I was at NVIDIA, and I was very interested in seeing if we could solve the problems with fusion and picked the scientist and engineers' brains endlessly.

From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that thereI used to work on fusion simulation codes (particle in cell) with the US National Labs when I was at NVIDIA, and I was very interested in seeing if we could solve the problems with fusion and picked the scientist and engineers' brains endlessly. My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",55 followers,Jeff Suzuki,1.3K,4.4K,7.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Are-the-fusion-difficulties-solved-yet

I have no idea which of the dozens of fusion reactors Mr. Anonymous is referring to, but there are several running for a lot longer than milliseconds, and for a lot more than one time. They are not yet running continuously, nor commercially, but within a decade ….!Sorry, Todd, but what you are saying is misleading, if not downright false. You do not need “absolute zero temperatures for magnetic fields”. Most existing experimental fusion reactors today still use copper-based magnets and do not require such cooling. Although low-temperature super-conducting magnets do require near-absolute zero (+4°K), the use of HIGH-temperature super-conducting magnets, which can be used at liquid nitrogen temperatures (+77°K) is much more likely. The plasma temperature of 20–40 million degrees you mention is way off - it needs to be 100–150 million!

The problem is that such reactors will be far too expensive for useful energy supply. Such reactors will also need expensive maintenance due to Neutron radiation damage to the reactor.Ideally, fusion is great. But such reactors may just be far too expensive. ITER will cost over $10 billion. But other options are available and lessons learned from the ITER reactor may be invaluable.For a lower cost and in much shorter time Generation 4 nuclear FISSION reactors may be developed cheaper and sooner. Such reactors could be far safer than current safe fission reactors. Next Generation fission reactors are highly resistant to meltdowns. And have significant other advantages.Gen 4 fission reactors could give us vital options for cheap, low carbon power. Cheap is vital. They need to be competitive with fossil fuels to be successful. They are a much better short term option to fusion power. Potentially small, transportable reactors could be in production within 10 years. Given enough support and investment.A number of different types are available. The next step is the construction of prototype reactors. To prove they are safe and efficient. China is leading in the construction of Gen 4 reactors.China has just started operation of a gas cooled, pebble bed reactor prototype fission reactor. It uses sphere fuel pebbles protected by layers of highly heat resistant material. Including ceramics, silicon, carbides, graphene and carbon materials. Able to tolerate temperatures of over 1000 degrees. Much hotter than the operating temperatures of PWR, Pressurised Water Reactors, using metal fuel rods and Uranium fuel pellets.These gas cooled reactors can operate at temperatures that would melt solid fuel rods. These reactors are also far easier to operate. Even without coolant, pumps or electrical power these reactors can cool effectively with natural air convection cooling. The fuel can be burnt far more effectively. The pebbles are easily removed, checked, reused or replaced without closing down the reactor.Other possible options are Molten Salt Reactors and sodium-cooled reactors. These reactors can also use a variety of cheap and abundant fuel. Cleaner and cheaper than enriched Uranium. They can use nuclear or mining waste as well as un-used weapons material. Actually reducing the amount of material available to make nuclear weapons. These reactors are also smaller, cheaper, safer, easy to operate and transportable. They also produce much less waste. The fuel and fission products can be thoroughly burnt up as energy.

7,"In the 1950’s, experiments at Princeton, Livermore, and Los Alamos showed that magnetic confinement of plasma had a problem of “instabilities”, in which the plasma, which is electrically charged, creates electric fields that can cause itself to drift out to the walls of the containment vessel.

Your question is enormously broad. I have previously been discussing answers in a theoretical realm of technically valid concepts.Now let's step out of our nice, air conditioned train cabin of the possible, with no other constraints. We're going into the real world now of “ implied , preexistent human constraints., will it ever become a .sustainable source of power to provide the service, the utility of residential power for the public? NO. NO PERIOD. Please read to the end, following the logic trail.Now, I am free to put real world constraints on the answer to your question. After all, fusion already is a “sustainable source of energy”, right here on planet. It has been developed, tested and available, in a steady supply and demand for this “source of energy,” I.e., the Hydrogen bomb. Thanks in part to Dr. Teller, fusion has been successfully harnessed in the frighteningly usable hydrogen bomb.Now, if you meant fusion as a sustainable source of energy, that is, energy that is used for the peaceful process of providing a public service , namely residential and commercial electricity, the probability gets smaller. The cost of developing the technical design, fabrication and construction of that would be enormous. As far as I can see from history, any such a massive undertaking only occurs with a GREAT incentive , namely either war, or profit, $. We of course already have it for war, first, ( just as we did with the nuclear FISSION process.) So what is the incentive now? Only money is left. Since it is not even conceptually clear we could accomplish it, from a technical perspective, some entity is going to have to fund the enormous, huge R&D costs of translating conceptual design into prototypes, and testing ,and validation.After that, it will have to pass the hurdle rate for ROI. It is difficult to entertain the commercial possibility of that. What is the incentive? “ Green power “… hard for me to believe this. Current fission reactors provide 20 % of the nations energy, and yet 45 % of our carbon free energy, yet we haven't been able to build a new one, and are prematurely shutting down existing ones. Why on earth would we spend that we spend the many billions of dollars to develop sustainable fusion, and absorb those tremendous costs into the energy market, if we don't value 45 % of our carbon free source now?Unfortunately, fusion provided us more than enough of the necessary energy to provide hydrogen bombs, there is no war incentive. That leaves only pure greenbacks, and that is not looking good. It's a “buy high, sell low “business strategy..Given that, I say without radical changes in the electricity power industry, economic policy, public education, nuclear regulatory processes, ad etc, the answer is no, fusion will not be a sustainable source of electricity in the foreseeable future. Our War use is satisfied, and there are a whole lot of ways a lot less costly energy can be used now, economics does and always will drive the bus. I’m afraid that, I apologize up front to the global warming advocates, fossil fuel is here to stay. For a very long stay. The singular mostsignificant, transformational event in the energy market within the past 3 Decades, was the advent of easily obtained shale gas. “ Spark Price” drives the market. Shale gas owns it.Shale gas is of course, a fossil fuel. The transformational event which made supply enormous now, and drove energy prices down, has had powerful effects on the world. In the US, gas (NG), is no longer used to power “ Peaking units,” gas turbine generators to supply supplemental power to the grid ( The ISO), for short periods of times, e.g.,very hot summer days. Baseload was supplied by massive nuclear and fossil generating stations. With NG so abundant, these peaking units are being replaced by massive gas driven turbine generators,( TG), 800MW or more). Nuclear plants can't compete with the operational costs of a massive gas TG, running with around 25 people, vice 1000 for nuclear. Baseliad is fossil. Peak load is fossil. Nukes are being prematurely S/D, and no successful new plants are on the horizon. The energy market is a fossil market. Solar and windmill contribute an almost negligible amount to the total energy needs of the USA.Overseas, gas is being used the same way. 20 years ago, Wall Street would have laughed at you, if u said u were going to make money shipping gas overseas..(by turning it into a liquid, LNG)Now that is exactly what is happening. Fossil fuels rule the world, because money is the incentive, and supply and demand dictate market share. Countries that claim to be “ Green, like Germany, are simply buying a large portion of their energy from neighboring countries, ( like France…80+%nuclear), and shutting down their own nuclear plants ironically. Nuclear is green, and a non CO2 contributor.My forecast, as a physicist, business executive in a large energy company with a diverse energy supply ( nuclear, gas, coal, oil, hydro), knowledge of the energy trading market and 10 year forecast energy costs, is :Gas will rule. Fossil wil rule. Little fission in USA, though growing elsewhere, fusion simply not worth the money, and will only exist in academic research facilities, to further development of particle physics and fusion.If global warming really is an “ Inconvenient truth”, it's not looking so good.

In the DT reaction 80% of the energy released goes into fast neutrons, whereas in the DD reaction the fraction is only 34%. DD fusion therefore permits the transfor­mation of a larger portion of the energy released directly into electric energy by magnetohydrodynamic power conversion. Moreover, in case of DD fusion, the neutron energy is only 2.4 MeV, whereas in DT fusion it is 14 MeV. The much larger neutron energy in DT fusion increases the material problems resulting from neutron bombardment of structural parts in a DT fusion reactor.A multi-stage DT-DD pure fusion device would use the minimum amount of Tritium to get fusion started in the pure fusion primary while allowing the smallest feasible laser to be used to initiate fusion by using Tritium in the fusion primary which has the characteristic of reaching ignition at the least demanding combination of conditions (temperature, confinement time, and plasma pressure).Could nuclear fusion be sustainable?Deuterium fusion and its ultimate potential for worldwide sustainable energy generation -D-D Fusion Can Provide Clean Sustainable Power Longer than the Earth has Existed or the Sun will BurnThe complete conversion of deuterium nuclear fuel releases an energy content of 250 x 10^15 joules per metric ton of deuterium.The quantity of deuterium in the world’s oceans is estimated at 4.6 x 10^13 metric tons. Deuterium present in seawater will yield around 5 x 10^11 TW-year of energy.In the year 2018 the entire planet consumed around 17 TW-years of energy, which means that the energy content of the deuterium in seawater would be enough for 29.4 billion years of energy supply.To give all 10 billion people expected to live on the planet in 2050 the level of energy prosperity we in the developed world are used to, a continuous average use of power of 6 kilowatts per person as is typical in Europe, we would need to generate 60 terawatts of energy as a planet—the equivalent of 900 million barrels of oil per day.The time since the earth first formed = 4.54 billion years.The time until the sun burns out = 5 billion years.The deuterium in the sea is capable of completely powering planet earth at a level of 60 Terawatts for 8.33 billion years(longer than the earth has existed or the sun will burn)Nuclear fusion may not be considered by some as being renewable, as it depends on the fusion of Deuterium taken from the world's oceans which while very abundant, is limited. Fusion energy should however produce reliable, dispatchable power on demand longer than renewable wind and solar.The very earliest successful energy producing fusion reactors will probably use the first generation fusion reactions (DT and DD fusion). Over time, technical advance will allow second and third generation fusion fuels to be utilized for commercial power generation and powering transportation applications (ships, cars, planes, and even power tools) over the course of the next 200 years.The ultimate potential of D-D fusion is very very great.The original proposal for fusion in the earliest days of the fusion program (late 1940s and 1950s) was to produce power through the self-fusion of deuterium — the D-D reaction. This reaction produces with equal probability, either the light helium isotope with two protons and a neutron (He3) or the heaviest hydrogen isotope, tritium (T) with one proton and tow neutrons. Both reactions release energy, generally measured in millions of electron volts (MeV).D + D —> He3 + n + 3.2 MeVD + D —> T + p + 4.0 MeVThese reaction products can themselves react with deuterium and will either be “burned” in place or recycled.D + T —> He4 + n + 17.6 MeVD + He3 —> He4 + p + 18.3 MeVBecause the fuel for the last two reactions is generated in the ﬁrst two, only deuterium need be supplied externally. The ﬁnal reaction products — ordinary helium and hydrogen — are benign, but the energetic neutrons can damage and induce radioactivity in the structure of the reactor. This neutron activation of reactor structure is a manageable problem that nuclear engineers can reduce and minimize by using low neutron activation steels and materials in the fusion chamber. Further improvement in solving neutron damage and fusion chamber neutron activation problems can be obtained by employing a neutronically thick falling wall of molten salt loaded with a neutron absorbent that absorbs fusion neutrons before they damage reactor structure and also safely carries away heat from the fusion reaction.Additional practical considerationsThere are reasons to believe that ICF laser fusion power plants will be stable and reliable sources of power right from the first days of operation while early complex MCF fusion power plants will struggle to produce reliable power and will actually produce energy for early decades in short, unpredictable, bursts of under a minute or so before the plasma goes unstable and the MCF power plant has to be shut down.It is considerably easier to create and then sustain fusion conditions for sub-gram samples of fusion fuel for a few nanoseconds in laser Inertial Confinement Fusion experiment than it is to stably maintain intense precise magnetic fields forming a stable plasma bottle or trap for indefinite amounts of time in Magnetic Confinement Fusion tokamak and stellarator devices.While MCF fusion devices are frequently described and marketed to the public as nice stable continuous fusion plasma burning energy producing devices, the truth is that such stable energy production has never yet been achieved even once for more than a second or two at significant power levels in more than sixty years of hard research effort The current record for MCF pure fusion power generation was demonstrated using the JET tokamak in 1997 while burning DT fuel where JET produced something close to beak-even power for a bit less than a second - producing about three quarters the fusion energy as output as the electrical energy that was drawn from the local power grid to bring fusion plasma to fusion conditions. The facts are that to date all MCF fusion experiments have produced short irregular and unpredictable amounts of power in short unpredictable spits and spurts - usually of less than a second length before the plasma goes unstable and the run in the experimental MCF fusion device must be shut down.It is considerably easier to do something hard like creating and then sustaining fusion conditions in DT or DD fusion plasma for nanoseconds than it is to continuously maintain fusion conditions in MCF fusion devices continuously and indefinitely.As a result, small ICF based fusion power plants will tend to be safe, stable, and reliable power generators right from the beginning once they are commercially introduced while complex, large Magnetic Confinement Fusion devices like tokamaks and stellarators will struggle to produce fusion energy in irregular, unpredictable spurts of power for at least the first couple of decades of operation of first generation MCF fusion power plants.","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Are-the-fusion-difficulties-solved-yet
12,"RemarkablyNot because we’re going to get working fusion power in the next few years or even decades but because of the scale of the challenge involved.

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but itThere’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), andI hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be. It should be considered like the Manhattan project or Apollo programme but way,It should be awe inspiring, and I hope I’ve conveyed a little of that awe.Here’s a photo of the pit in which they’re building the core at ITER. For scale, there is a person standing on the extreme left of the image about halfway down (9 o’clock position). The pressure vessel (the first section of which is complete and slowly making its way into this pit) will contain more steel than the Eiffel tower. Once running, the core will be the hottest place in the solar system, in fact it’ll be hotter than anywhere within around 100 light years of Earth as only blue supergiant stars get this hot at their cores.And ITER is just the small scale prototype. A final generating power plant will be significantly larger.I hope that blows your mind at least a little.","29,977 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.7K,250M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Are-the-fusion-difficulties-solved-yet
