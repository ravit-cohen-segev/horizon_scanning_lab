The first great and indisputable works in the field were published in England (Shelley’sScience fiction finally got its name in the first sf pulp magazines, which were published from 1926 and on. Their typical reader was a teenage boy; many of their early writers were knowledgeable in the sciences, but inept writers. And what the readers liked best, and the kind of stories that so came to dominate during most of the 1930s, was pseudoscientific adventure stories with little sense but huge spaceships, superheroes and galactic conflicts.The situation began to improve during the 1940s, when new editors (first and foremost John W. Campbell atSo, getting back to the question: there is sf written in the 19th century which has aged well. I would at least say that H.G. Wells is still eminently readable, that some of Jules Verne’s novels are very readable, that Hoffmann and Poe can still mesmerise. But from the time when science fiction more or less became a primarily American mass literature, the overall quality of writing diminished considerably and although some authors who never wrote for the magazines published impressive – and still very worthwhile – work (I think of dystopias such as Yevgeny Samyatin’sFrom a purely technical literary point of view, I’d say that a fair amount of the sf published since the mid-1950s is at least as satisfying to read as, let’s say, most of today’s popular crime novels, thrillers, multi-volume fantasy novels, or romances. By the 1950s, most science fiction writers had learned to be adequate craftsmen. Some were much more; a few were literary artists (Edgar Pangborn is an example). However, a lot of sf during this period as well was mainly action entertainment, and most of the most intellectually satisfying sf speculated primarily in technological changes, sometimes in political changes, but almost never in changes in basic social norms. As late as 1970, a once very prominent sf author (A.E. Van Vogt) could write in a novel set centuries in the future: “The hundred delegates to the [technological] conference swelled out of the hall. There were also several wives present.” But by that time, Van Vogt was not typical. At the end of the 1960s, authors like Joanna Russ and Ursula K. Le Guin had introduced a gradually strengthening feminist consciousness in science fiction; at the same time, Samuel R. Delany became the first leading black sf writer, while openly gay authors like Thomas M. Disch as well as Joanna Russ also tore down other barriers.This is more than long enough. To anyone genuinely interested in intelligent speculative fiction, and who can bear to read literature written when social attitudes were different than they currently are, I believe a fair amount of sf from earlier decades is well worth seeking out. But remember that many of the famous classics were actually written by very young men with little literary background; a modern reader trying Isaac Asimov’s famous “Foundation” stories will, I suspect, by amazed at the amateurish writing, the absence of not only women but any living beings at all except white males, and probably also at the silly made-up names most of the cardboard characters have. On the other hand, a writer like Theodore Sturgeon did write about people of colour, of women, even of gays, already during the 1940s.So what does this boil down to? “Modern” sf, if by that we mean the labelled field that started a little less than a hundred years ago, initially was written as boys adventure stories by often only slightly older boys. It turned into a field still aimed at less sophisticated readers, but with a serious interest in science and technology. And still later, it turned into a sometimes impressively sophisticated form of literature trying to explore the human condition, or mores, traditions, social fabric and possible futures. The stuff written during the first period (1926–1940) is today virtually unreadable. From the second period (1941–1965) most is more or less painful to read while some is brilliant. From the last fifty years, around the normal percentage in any literary field is first-rate, but probably as much as half is at least acceptable.",169 followers,Rohit Shinde,582,307,2.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-technology-oriented-futuristic-books-from-the-last-10-years-It-can-be-hard-sci-fi-novels-as-well-as-non-fiction-visions-of-the-future-directed-towards-emerging-foreseeable-technology-and-its-impact
