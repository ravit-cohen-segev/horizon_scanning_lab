0,"The majority of tribal nations in the US were able to recover and expand their populations after early 1900s.Although, some were able to expand more than others, and this was due to many factors. In the case of Choctaws, they were traditional agriculturalists and also engaged in a free trade economy. And they adapted to new technologies quite fast. So, after a sharp population decline from disease, warfare, and removal in the early 1800s, they eventually stabilized and started growing again.",123 followers,Ben Waggoner,667,5.5K,42.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Choctaw-population-manage-to-recover-and-grow-while-other-Native-Americans-didnt
1,"When most of us Native Americans died from disease, warfare, and starvation, it took out 1/5th of the world population. How's that for failing to reach huge populations. Mexico alone reached in the millions. South America had many more. The cities down south had more people living in them than Europe and most cities at the time. The main reason for this misconception of a small population was because Americans only moved in after our societies were crumbling. Most were already dead. The rest were fighting on several fronts against the U.S. and other tribes around them, and newcomer tribes.

I am not revealing any high profile detail to civilians so please don't sue me for that.(Btw I am a civilian too)1> ScenarioLet's say that one more terrorist attack occurred in India. This time, India decided to attack Pakistan instead of any counter-terrorism operation. An Air Strike is planned on the nearby PAF Baseand GoI approved to launch the operation. Indian Air Force planned to enter Baltistan and bomb the PAF Base Skardu. It is rumoured that PAF has deployed a JF-17 squadron there. Few sources claiming the “Check the map below and you can see how close Skardu is to Srinagar Air Force Station.It is a Forward Operating Base (FOB). FOB provides support to military in case of any military operations or conflicts. FOBs are also heavily guarded with troops.Pakistan started heavy preparedness drill to tighten security against Indian action. Regular Combat Air Patrol (CAP) of JF-17s and F-16. Karakoram Eagle and Erieye AEW&C for regular surveillance.More factors affect the scenario like presence of SAMs or No. of jets involved etc. Here, I only tried to compare the characteristics with equal competition like No SAMs and equal no. of jets involved. Plus no AWACS support.2> ArmamentMirage 2000 chosen as the trustworthy aircraft for the operation. Let's say 4 Mirage 2000I aircrafts are going to commence the operation. 2 for bombing and rest 2 for cover. Meaning 2 of the attack package will be armed with Laser Guided air-to-ground weapons like Griffin or SPICE 2000. Or other configuration can be of standoff weapons like Popeye. Rest 2 are in complete air-to-air engagement configuration. Armed with both MICA RF that is suitable for medium range or Beyond Visual Range and MICA IR for Within Visual Range.Pakistan Air Force, with alertness against possible Indian action, flew regular combat air patrols. Jets are loaded with both BVRAAM and WVRAAM. Jf 17 is performing patrol with its armament of PL 12 as a Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air Missile and PL 5E as Within Visual Range Air-to-Air Missile.Now the Mirages entered Baltistan and proceeding to Objective. Skardu picked up signals and scrambled JF-17s that were in Intercept configuration. 2x PL-12 BVRAAM and 2× PL-5E WVRAAM and 3× Fuel Tanks. (7 hardpoints of JF 17)Mirage 2000 are in air-to-air engagement configuration and carrying 4x MICA RF, 2x MICA IR and 2x Fuel Tanks. (8+1 hardpoints of Mirage 2000)BEYOND VISUAL RANGE (RANGE) COMBATJF 17 radar and Mirage radar started tracking each other. Strike (bombing role) Mirages descended to low altitude to avoid any engagement. Aggressor (Air-to-airoffense role) Mirages decided to engage JF-17s.PL-12 vs Mica RF•PL-12 (aka SD-10) is a Chinese development but carries similar technology of R77 with little indigenous modifications that can be noticed in the shape and propulsion system. It is primarily used by the fleet of JF-17 Block II aircrafts. Very few information is available on the internet but after researching about the missile, I came to know that this missile can only engage the targets under the range of 70-75km and has a speed of Mach 3.5–4. Enough for BVR engagements against potential threats.MICA RF is the BVRAAM used by Mirage 2000 fleet of Indian Air Force. It is the active radar guidance variant of MICA missile family. MICA is one of the renowned weapon for Europe with state-of-the-art capability. It is widely adopted by various other Air Forces around the world. Maritime Rafale are usually spotted with MICA missiles during sorties. It is capable of operating in ""lock-on before launch"" and ""lock-on after launch"" modes. A Thrust Vector Control (TVC) system fitted to the rocket motor gives a significant boost to the missile’s agility. In case of range, it has an advantage over PL-12. It can engage targets under the range of 80-85 kms with a speed of Mach 4.Speed, Range, Agility, in all three factors, MICA RF has a significant edge over the Chinese counterpart and hence, I believe that JF 17 can't withstand in front of Mirage 2000 in BVR engagement. Both JF 17s will be shot down if they come under Mirages’ radar.WITHIN VISUAL RANGE (WVR) COMBATLet's say somehow all 4 Mirage 2000 managed to keep a low profile and flied really low to avoid SAMs. In this case, WVR engagement is possible if JF 17 made a Visual Contact. Aggressor Mirages turned to engage while Strike Mirages are still on the course.PL-5E vs MICA IRPL-5E is primarly used by Pakistan Air Force JF-17 and F-7PG. It is said to be a reverse engineered AIM-9 featuring AA-10 technology. It carries a 6kg warhead with laser proximity fuse detonation system. It has a speed upto Mach 2.5 and can engage targets under the range of 18 kms. PL-5E features a double delta canards, a 40 degree off boresight capability, and 40G manoeuvre capability .MICA IR is primarly deployed on IAF Mirage 2000. The Solid-propellant rocket motor provides a max speed of Mach 4. MICA IR works on Imaging Infrared guidance system giving it an effective precision. MICA IR is also guided by Imaging Infrared system that can interpret the different parts of a target aircraft and hit the most appropriate section. Imaging Infrared guided missiles are also very hard to fool with hot flares and much more precise than standard heat-seeker (infra-red) missiles, therefore, MICA IR is more accurate and trustworthy than PL-5E in any close range dogfights. A thrust vector control unit fitted to the rocket motor furtherincreases the missile’s agility. The missile is capable of Lock-On After Launch (LOAL) which means it is capable of engaging targets even when outside its seeker’s at-launch acquisition range.Hence, a clear winner here is MICA IR! The JF-17 PL-9 will be outgunned and Mirage 2000 will surely rise as a winner.(FYI, during exercise ATLC 2009, Rafale locked on a F-22 with its MICA IR. It was a simulated close range dogfight and it displayed true potential of MICA even against a 5th gen fighter)Therefore, one can easily conclude that Mirage 2000 is all-time capable to engage JF 17 with dominant side.3> Performance of jetsArmament is not the only key to win battles and that's why there is a term calledJF 17 features a Chinese radar, that is KLJ-7V2 Pulse Doppler. The radar can reportedly track 10 targets and engage 2 of them at a time under the range of 120–125 kms.Mirage 2000 has a redundant Fly-By-Wire Automatic Flight Control System (FBW AFCS), providing electronic smarts to compensate for the aircraft's inherent instability, two-piece elevons on each wing; and automatic, full length, two-segment leading-edge slats. That gave the Mirage 2000 a high level of agility.(Above Line copied from:All-metal stable aerodynamic structure of the airframe that causes RCS of 5m2 that is not much high but also not much low. It can be detected by radars of hostile. Also the maneuverability of the jet is questionable when compared to other aircrafts in the same league. Lack of Helmet Mounted Display and Sight system also causes trouble when it comes to precise targetting during combatMirage 2000I also features indigenous Samtel-Thales TopSight-I Helmet Mounted Display and Sight (HMDS). Refer the 2 pictures below:All this combines to give Mirage 2000 an edge over JF 17 even in Performance.After both armament and performance comparison, we can conclude that Mirage 2000 can easily shoot down JF-17 in air combat. But it is all upto the pilot. A skilled pilot has more chances to score a kill than an amateur pilot. But by going through the stats, we can say that IAF Mirage 2000 is better and JF-17 can't defeat it.Better luck next time JF 17(Scene from Sherdil movie)Thanks for Reading!",21 followers,Rishav,762,77,2.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Choctaw-population-manage-to-recover-and-grow-while-other-Native-Americans-didnt
5,"I rate the chances 0/100. Once again, it is a question of time and space.There is no way an F-86 Sabre can shoot own a MiG-21. But we lost one MiG-21 in 1971 to a PAF Sabre because the pilot did not see the Sabre and even though he was at 1050 kph, he flew through a fusillade of 200+ 0.5″ bullets fired by six small machine guns.It is different today. No ac can come up undetected. No ac can launch a missile that will not be picked up and evaded. So the more maneuverable ac with better combat presence will win-ergo, one JF-17 down.",21 followers,Rishav,1.4K,77,2.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Choctaw-population-manage-to-recover-and-grow-while-other-Native-Americans-didnt

In fact, they pay you while you do your masters which is pretty unheard of elsewhere.The first rule of BS detection is … If it feels too good to be true, it probably is fishy. The Lab doesn’t charge you anything because you as the grad student happen to be their employee.So let’s talk about what is like an open secret here at Media Lab. The lab isn’t interested in changing the world, nescessarily. It acts as an ousourcing research lab for over 80 companies who can spend money on the Lab to hire these grad students as contractual minions to work for them. These minions are made to believe that they are changing the world and what they do is so damn important. The biggest disclosure however is this : the IP of all the student projects done in the lab belong to the sponsors, i.e. if you make anything worthy of value in the lab, the lab owns it. This statement is neatly hidden behind all the flowery things that Media Lab advertises.Well, Media Lab is a celebration of capitalism. Where the money lies, the ‘research focus’ rolls there. It is not something Media Lab nescessarily hides but it is not talked about as much as ‘changing the world’ jingoism is talked about.Everything in the lab is an open advertisement : from the glass walled classrooms for visitors to look at the classes or the carefully designed display areas to lure their attention. Media Lab like most of the tech companies help in making normal work sexy.If Media Lab really wanted to solve the cutting edge problems of the world, it would be focusing on the UN’s sustainable goals or working in the developing countries, trying to make democracy rigid strong, help create entrepreunial activites, etc. There recently was an earthquake in Mexico and many people lost their lives. The Media Lab which claims to be putting their brains to make people’s lives better did nothing about it.But the research is strongly incentivised by what the First world considers to be profitable or popular. Hence you will see so much work happening on social networks, neurobiology, AR/VR since Twitter, Microsoft and other bgshot companies are spending millions on ensuring that the minions at the Media Lab work on their future goals.The projects in the lab are designed to lure the attention and thus lack an in-depth effort and rigor required in research. The focus is on the branding material generated out of a project - the videos, the featured articles, posters, etc. The work of Media Lab is designed for the short-attention-span-internet-browsing-corporate-marketers who get lured by sugary pop-culture research and are tempted by the brand name of MIT.You will not see any other ‘research’ organization try so hard to brand itself on social media like the Media Lab does. The strongest point of the Media Lab isn’t its technology or even design but its power of branding underneath which lies work not worthy of the attention it gets.Having said all this, I don’t think there is anything Media Lab should be ashamed of, they are doing business like many other capitalist businesses are doing. However, some of their claims of trying to change the world, do great things for the world and all other things on that line is bunch of advertisement crap and that should be discussed more than it is.Among the MIT circle, say among the researchers of MIT’s CSAIL and others familiar with the workings, Media Lab isn’t taken very seriously.The Lab has missed out on the AI train and is trying hard to keep the illusion of impact-through-shiny-expensive-technology going. The focus lies on making everyone think that they do cool things than actually doing impactful things. When one tries to display their cleverness over actual innovation, what they produce will only satisfy the creator’s ego and that is what has been happening at the Media Lab.Bottomline, if you aspire to do solid impactful research, the right places are in reality the humble modest place that are filled with intellectuals ideating on the complex dynamics of the world problems. At the Media Lab you are more likely to find polished businessmen and businesswomen disguised as research professors making their minions play with fancy gadgets to somehow come up with business deals for their shiny corporate empire.","2,707 followers",Grammarly,934,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Choctaw-population-manage-to-recover-and-grow-while-other-Native-Americans-didnt

You can’t do that if you’re publishing in obscure journals that only your peers read or if you’re not able to explain or show what you’re doing. I think the “tries to appear cool” may be the way some people would interpret our desire to communicate outside of our area of focus.As for actually solving problems… there is a pretty long list. One notable shift is that we’re doing more biotech and hard sciences these days.

Our team at Grammarly has compiled a handy list of common grammatical errors to help make your writing accurate, clear, and professional.Ambiguous (“Squinting”) modifiersA squinting modifier is a misplaced modifier that, because of its location in a sentence, could modify either the phrase that precedes it or the one that follows it. In the example sentence, is the subject listening to music slowly or slowly getting a headache? To correct a squinting modifier, move its position in the sentence to clarify to the reader which word you intend to modify.Misuse of lie/layIf you plan to place or put an object somewhere, such as a plate on a table, you should use “lay.” If you intend to stretch out on a bed for a nap, you should use “lie.” The verb “lie” is an intransitive verb, which means it does not need an object. The transitive verb “lay” requires an object.It may take some getting used to this “lay” or “lie” business; after all, misuse of these verbs is common. But if you remember to lay down your fork before you’re full, then you won’t have to lie down later from overeating.Comma splicesHe was very hungry, so he ate a whole pizza.To splice means to connect or join. When a writer joins two independent sentences with a comma instead of separating them with a period or coordinating conjunction, that’s a comma splice.The comma has its jobs to do, but connecting two independent sentences isn’t one of them. Besides, the period gets testy when his sister, the comma, steals his thunder. Periods have their jobs, and so do commas, but never the twain shall meet—unless it’s in the form of a semicolon. Semicolons can also take the place of a coordinating conjunction, such as “and,” “but,” or “so,” among others.Run-on sentencesRun-on sentences, also known as fused sentences, occur when two complete sentences are squashed together without using a coordinating conjunction or proper punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon. Run-on sentences can be short or long. A long sentence isn’t necessarily a run-on sentence.To avoid run-on sentences, see if there is more than one idea communicated by two or more independent clauses. In our examples, there are two complete sentences:Example:Example:Both sentences are complete ideas by themselves; therefore, use a semicolon or a period to indicate that they are separate independent clauses.Using “could of” instead of “could have”“Could have” is always correct; “could of” never is. Writers probably make this grammar gaffe because, when we speak, the contraction “could’ve” sounds an awful lot like “could of.”TautologiesTautologies express the same thing twice with different words. In our example, the word “made” implies that Jack used his own two hands to create the pail. The prepositional phrase “with his own hands” creates a redundancy. Once you know what they are, it’s fun to discover tautologies: dilapidated ruins, close proximity, added bonus, large crowd...The list goes on and on!After reading through this list of common grammatical mistakes, you might be wondering how to remember all these rules as you write.

It took a while to find its groove.[Historical note: There’s an interesting counterpart in MIT’s Center for Advanced Visual Studies - a group of artists who work closely with the engineering community - using technology to create experimental art. The artists drive things, while the engineers often ask “why would you possibly want to do that?” The result is sometimes interesting, sometimes horrible art; and as a secondary effect, sometimes the state of the technical art is pushed in service of meeting the artists’ requests.]My observation is that the Media Lab has somewhat moved in the direction of CAVS - doing interesting “media stuff”Overall, as a technology group, again IMHO, the Media Lab is unimpressive.
