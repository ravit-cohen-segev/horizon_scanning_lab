For any rocket propulsion, since the kinetic energy of exhaust goes up with velocity squared (kinetic energy = ½ mv2), whereas the momentum and thrust goes up with velocity linearly (momentum = mv), obtaining a particular level of thrust (as in a number ofThe Orion concept detonates nuclear explosions externally at a rate of power release which is beyond what nuclear reactors could survive internally with known materials and design. However, since weight is no limitation, an Orion craft can be extremely robust if built intact in outer space in zero gravity. AnThe high performance depends on the high exhaust velocity, in order to maximize the rocket's force for a given mass of propellant. The velocity of the plasma debris is proportional to the square root of the change in the temperature (The shape of the bomb's reaction mass is critical to efficiency. The original project designed bombs with a reaction mass made of tungsten. The bomb's geometry and materials focused the -rays and plasma from the core of nuclear explosive to hit the reaction mass. In effect each bomb would be a nuclear-shaped charge. A bomb with a cylinder of reaction mass expands into a flat, disk-shaped wave of plasma when it explodes. A bomb with a disk-shaped reaction mass expands into a far more efficient cigar-shaped wave of plasma debris. The cigar shape focuses much of the plasma to impinge onto the pusher-plate.The maximum effective specific impulse,The smaller the bomb, the smaller each impulse will be, so the higher the rate of impulses and more than will be needed to achieve orbit. Smaller impulses also mean lessThe optimal Orion drive bomblet yield (for the human crewed 4,000 ton reference design) was calculated to be in the region of 0.15 kt, with approx 800 bombs needed to orbit and a bomb rate of approx 1 per second.In late 1958 to early 1959, it was realized that the smallest practical vehicle would be determined by the smallest achievable bomb yield.However, more recently, the use of a magnetic sail to actually power the space ship has bee calculated, and over long distances, the build-up in speed could theoretically reach 98% of the speed of light, without the necessity for a robust shielded space vehicle in the case of ferrying a human crew.A preliminary design for a nuclear pulse unit was actually produced. It proposed the use of a shaped-charge fusion-boosted fission explosive. The explosive was wrapped in a beryllium oxide channel filler, which was surrounded by am uranium radiation mirror. The mirror and channel filler were open ended, and in this open end a flat plate of tungsten propellant was placed. The whole thing was built into a can with a diameter no larger than 6 inches (15 cm) and weighed just over 300 pounds (140 kg) so it could be handled by machinery scaled-up from a soft-drink vending machine andAt 1 microsecond after ignition the gamma bomb plasma and neutrons would heat the channel filler and be somewhat contained by the uranium shell. At 2–3 microseconds the channel filler would transmit some of the energy to the propellant, which vaporized. The flat plate of propellant formed a cigar-shaped explosion aimed at the pusher plate.The plasma would cool to 14,000 °C as it traversed the 25 m distance to the pusher plate and then reheat to 67,000 °C as, at about 300 microseconds, it hits the pusher plate and is recompressed. This temperature emits ultraviolet light, which is poorly transmitted through most plasmas. This helps keep the pusher plate cool. The cigar shaped distribution profile and low density of the plasma reduces the instantaneous shock to the pusher plate.The pusher plates thickness would decrease by, approximately, a factor of 6 from the center to the edge so that the net velocity of the inner and outer parts of the plate are the same, even though the momentum transferred by the plasma increases from the center outwards.At low altitudes where the surrounding air is dense gamma scattering could potentially harm the crew without a radiation shield, a radiation refuge would also be necessary on long missions to survive solar flares and MCEs. Radiation shielding effectiveness increases exponentially with shield thickness. On ships with a mass greater than 1,000 tonnes the structural bulk of the ship, its stores along with the mass of the bombs and propellant, would provide more than adequate shielding for the crew. Stability was initially thought to be a problem due to inaccuracies in the placement of the bombs, but it was later shown that the effects would cancel out.The bombs had to be launched behind the pusher plate with enough velocity to explode 20–30 meters beyond it every 1.1 seconds. Numerous proposals were investigated, from multiple guns poking over the edge of the pusher plate to rocket propelled bombs launched from roller coaster tracks, however the final reference design used a simple gas gun to shoot the devices through a hole in the center of the pusher plate.Exposure to repeated nuclear blasts raises the problem ofOne issue that remained unresolved at the conclusion of the project was whether or not the turbulence created by the combination of the propellant and ablated pusher plate would dramatically increase the total ablation of the pusher plate. According to Freeman Dyson in the 1960s they would have had to actually perform a test with a real nuclear explosive to determine this; with modern simulation technology this could be determined fairly accurately without such empirical investigation.Another potential problem with the pusher plate is that of spalling—shards of metal—potentially flying off the top of the plate. The shock wave from the impacting plasma on the bottom of the plate passes through the plate and reaches the top surface. At that point spalling may occur damaging the pusher plate. For that reason alternative substances, plywood and fiberglass, were investigated for the surface layer of the pusher plate and thought to be acceptable. If the conventional explosives in the nuclear bomb detonate but a nuclear explosion does not ignite, a dud, shrapnel could strike and potentially critically damage the pusher plate. True engineering tests of the vehicle systems were thought to be impossible because several thousand nuclear explosions could not be performed in any one place. Experiments were designed to test pusher plates in nuclear fireballs and long-term tests of pusher plates could occur in space. Several of these tests almost flew.But the main unsolved problem for a launch from the surface of the Earth was thought to be nuclear fall out. Any explosions within the magnetosphere would carry fissiles back to earth unless the spaceship was launched from a polar region, possibly on a barge in the higher regions of the Arctic; or constructed in situ in low earth orbit. An initial launching explosion of conventional high explosive would significantly reduce fallout, subsequent detonations would be in the air and therefore much cleaner. Antarctic is not viable and would require legal changes as the continent is presently an international wildlife preserve. Orion-style nuclear pulse rockets could be launched from above the magnetosphere so that charged ions of fallout in its exhaust plasma are not trapped by the Earth's magnetic field and are not returned to Earth.From many smaller detonations combined the fallout for the entire launch of a 6,000 short ton (5,500 metric ton)However, restrictions of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty would not apply to a possible Project DaedalusThe launch of such an Orion nuclear bomb rocket from the ground or low Earth orbit would generate an EMP (electromagnetic pulse) that could cause significant damage to computers and satellites as well as flooding the van Allen belts with high-energy radiation. This problem might be solved by launching from very remote areas, the EMP footprint would be a few hundred miles wide.An Orion spacecraft could be boosted by non-nuclear means to a safer distance only activating its drive well away from Earth and its satellites. The Lofstrom launch loop or a space elevator hypothetically provide excellent solutions; in the case of the space elevator, existing carbon nanotubes composites, with the exception of possibly Colossal carbon tubes do not yet have sufficient tensile strength. All chemical rocket designs are extremely inefficient and expensive when launching large mass into orbit but could be employed if the result were cost effective.Further reading[External links[Wikimedia Commons has media related to","29,974 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.7K,249.9M,2016,https://www.quora.com/When-the-claim-thorium-reactor-will-be-more-efficient-than-a-uranium-reactor-is-made-what-is-the-waste-being-put-to-work-Aren-t-they-both-just-boiling-water-for-a-turbine

What made Orion so alluring was the enormous lifting capacity the system could be capable of. There were designs for ships up to 400 meters wide, with a ship mass of 8 million tons, and a lifting capacity to LEO of 2 million tons (!)Here’s some perspective for those of you who don’t get the kind of scale we’re talking about here:This is the Nimitz-class Aircraft CarrierORION COULD PUT 20 OF THESE BAD BOYS INTO SPACE. IN ONE LAUNCH.Or here’s another one:This is the Golden Gate Bridge. It weighs about 887,000 tons. ORION COULD LIFT TWO OF THESE, WITH ENOUGH LEFT OVER FOR 8-AND-A-HALF STATUES OF LIBERTY.Now understand, this is the extremely large end of the scale. On the other end of the scale was a small testing ship, massing 880 tons, and despite its small size, it would’ve been capable of orbit. Yes, as far as Orion is concerned, 880 tons—the weight of 11 Space Shuttles, or 7 and a 1/2 Blue Whales—is TINY.In today’s day and age, this sounds completely ludicrous. Lighting off thousands of nukes above ground seems like a recipe for disaster, with global ramifications. However, when you get into the mathematics of how it all worked, Orion would have actually been quite clean (in comparison to everything else they did in the 50’s and 60’s . . . )What most people don’t realize is that Orion’s drive bombs were actually quite small. I know the 10,000-ton version used bombs in the 0.15 Kiloton range. By comparison, Little Boy, the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, was 15 Kilotons—at least 100 times more powerful than the drive bombs of Orion. Starfish prime, as described by Max Jones, was in the 1.1-1.4 Megaton range, almost a 100 times more powerful than Little Boy, and overIn addition, Physicist Freeman Dyson calculated that the fallout of a single Orion launch, massing somewhere in the 10,000-ton range, would produce as much fallout as a single 10-megaton nuclear explosion. I know off the top of my head the Castle Bravo nuclear test generated 15 megatons of force, so a single launch of an Orion would be equivalent to a large nuclear test, which was fairly the norm for the time period.In order for an Orion-style launch system to be effective, it would have to be built BIG. The only way to do this effectively and cheaply is on the ground. Orion is so powerful, ground launches are completely viable.In addition, with modern materials and methods, not to mention intelligent planning, an Orion launch can leaveAllow me to explain:The main problem is earth’s magnetic field. If we tried a ground launch from most places on earth, the radioactive particles would get trapped by the magnetic field, and return to earth. HOWEVER, there are two natural holes in the magnetic field, at the North and South poles. If Orion launched through those, the radiation should float off into space.Also, to reduce fallout even further, make the first shot with conventional explosives, just to get the ship into the air.Any explosions after that, even nuclear ones, should be very clean, due to not being in contact with the ground. That’s where 90% of fallout comes from, after all. Air-bursts areAnother point is the bombs themselves. Normal nukes unleash all their energy in every direction . . . that’s how bombs work. However, Orion toyed with the idea ofIt would put 90% of the bomb’s output into a single direction, which would vaporize either a plate of Tungsten, or some kind of Beryllium. It would be instantly converted into a plasma, which would then hit the pusher plate at several thousand miles an hour and severalBecause of how small the bombs were, and the fact they were shaped to deliver most of their energy in one direction—not to mention the fact modern nukes are significantly cleaner—the launch of an Orion would be very efficient, clean, and leave hardly any radiation at all.Max Jones did hit a valid point with the EMP threat. However, there isn’t much human habitation near the Poles, and if you immediately went into an escape trajectory upon launch, not establishing orbit, you could avoid the EMP threat entirely. A few polar satellites would get fried, but the human population should remain unaffected.The only reason Orion was never built and flown was small-minded people being afraid of the whole “It runs on A-bombs?!” idea, and rushing to make it illegal with the Test Ban Treaty. Orion can lift an insane amount of cargo, and deliver it anywhere we want. With proper designing of the bombs AND an intelligent launch location, a single launch could leave a very small radiation footprint.The trade-off is a potential Mars colony lifted in one go. Hell, forget Mars, an entire JUPITER colony could be lifted with one of these behemoths.And if the radiation is too much of an issue to ignore, no matter how small it is, that’s fine—we only really need one Orion. With a max lifting capacity of 2 million tons, we’d only need to launch manufacturing equipment. Hook it onto an asteroid rich in metals, and we could begin turning that into more ships.With 2 million tons of manufacturing equipment churning out everything we need from nearby asteroids, just one Orion could kick-start humanity’s future in outer space. That would MORE than justify building and launching one of these behemoths.Or . . . Well, you know . . .. . . we could prevent the extinction of all life on Earth via Meteor.(Imagine this happening in a large city, like New York, or Hong Kong, or London.)

A nuclear weapon only requires about a microsecond or less. A power plant requires long term continuous operation with control of the output.Fusion also has another issue that is great for nuclear weapons but terrible for power plants.The high energy neutrons from fusion are great for splitting ordinary uranium in the tamper and radiation case of a weapon which is typically responsible for as much as 70 percent of the yield.They are the bane of existence for a power reactor. They rapidly degrade the structural integrity of materials and render them temporarily highly radioactive.So even if you succeed in creating a stable fusion plasma or imploding enough fuel capsules with a laser array you face the problem of preventing the neutron flux from turning your fancy reactor into a pile of radioactive waste.These problems are so difficult that many experts believe that barring some way to harness gravity like electromagnetism fusion power will remain a pipedream.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

14,"One reason fusion experiments have difficulty controlling the fusion reactions they use to produce fusion power derives from the fact that the easiest form of fusion to get working, Inertial Confinement Fusion, that mankind currently has Mastered and has been available for now more than 70 years, is systematically ignored and not given even a moments consideration as a practical means of producing peaceful commercial electrical energy.It is often suggested that here are two types of fusion —Is there in reality two types of fusion?It isOne reason fusion experiments have difficulty controlling the fusion reactions they use to produce fusion power derives from the fact that the easiest form of fusion to get working, Inertial Confinement Fusion, that mankind currently has Mastered and has been available for now more than 70 years, is systematically ignored and not given even a moments consideration as a practical means of producing peaceful commercial electrical energy.It is often suggested that here are two types of fusion —Is there in reality two types of fusion?It is widely perceived that in controlled nuclear fusion, the vast energy of fusion reactions is released steadily so it can be used for peaceful purposes, say, for nuclear fusion reactors.It is said that in uncontrolled nuclear fusion, vast amount of energy are released in uncontrolled manner, causing destruction only—the hydrogen bomb is an example.Thus uncontrolled nuclear fusion is not viewed as something of use for constructive purpose.But is there really a differenceor is it just a perception unsupported by fact?Is it perhaps true that there is really only one type of fusion and depending on the technology and the amount of fuel you use, you get a more or less rapid release of fusion energy.While the smoothness and the time of release of energy from fusion may be different, the fusion reactions (Deuterium Tritium or Deuterium-Deuterium) are all the same and the waste products produced (helium and neutrons) are all the same.Is it perhaps true that there is really only one type of fusion and depending on the technology and the amount of fuel you use, you get a more or less rapid release of fusion energy?All Inertial Confinement fusion approaches use small controlled nuclear bursts or explosions to produce commercially significant amounts of energy (Gigawatts level) from fusion.Mankind currently is in possession of a practical working fusion technology.(A fusion driver producing X-rays irradiates a D-T filled beryllium micro-sphere on the left, which initiates D-T fusion which in turn launches a radiative shock detonation wave down a pressurized liquid deuterium-filled tube.)It is widely perceived that commercial forms of nuclear fusion are currently ~50 years away (and always will be) - but the reality is that such widespread and excessive pessimism about fusion isSome claim that fusion has never produced any useful net-energy.Ivy-Mike Inertial Confinement Fusion Energy Gain -Break-even energy and well beyond was successfully achieved in the very first LASL ICF fusion experiment called Ivy-Mike conducted on the Marshall Islands Pacific test range in 1952.Fusion is fusion, the fact fusion was first achieved by mankind in a weapons context does not change the fact that it was fusion (same fusion reactions as are employed at ITER, W7-x, and other fusion experiments around the world).The Engineering fusion energy gain factor achieved in the Ivy-Mike D-D fusion test shot when consideringFor the purpose of this calculation, Qe, Engineering Fusion Energy Gain factor is defined asfusion energy output / electrical energy required to trigger and operate the fusion deviceQe = 1.004 x 10^13 kilojoules (fusion) / 0.8 kilojoules (electrical)The fusion energy gain produced by mankind’s very first Inertial Confinement Fusion experiment (Ivy-Mike 1952) from fusion alone was in excess of(which is more than Qe = 1 which would be energy break-even)(Sidebar) -Stanley Steamer continuous combustion versus Ford Fusion internal pulsed power productionAt the dawn of the age of automobiles, there was a real contest between cars fitted with steam boilers that were powered by continuous combustion of gasoline or kerosene in external burners and cars that used spark ignited internal combustion engines that extracted power from thousands of small controlled gasoline explosions inside of a steel engine block. This was a real contest at the time, and both technologies were tried and each had some commercial success. At the time, some early auto customers might have been skeptical that a vehicle powered by thousands of small explosions inside the confined volume of an engine block would be safe and there was doubt that an engine based on producing thousands of carefully timed explosions would be reliable and hang together and be practical in the long run. Over time, the public came to feel that internal combustion engines, even though they depend on thousands of small explosions, can still be practical and safe, and the Stanley Steamer, and other model continuous burning steam powered vehicles, were abandoned as not as efficient.In the next couple of decades we may see a revisitation of the debate over smooth burning Diffuse Plasma Magnetic Confinement Fusion versus Inertial Confinement Fusion featuring a succession small controlled fusion bursts of between 100 - 250 GJ per shot. It is a harder job to keep reliable containment of a plasma at fusion conditions on a magnetic confinement device like a large tokamak that does a continuous plasma burn - the containment tends to fail and the reactor has to periodically be restarted. ICF fusion has already been demonstrated to reliably produce energy on demand (in fission ignited fusion - first-time every-time).","220,639 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,783.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/When-the-claim-thorium-reactor-will-be-more-efficient-than-a-uranium-reactor-is-made-what-is-the-waste-being-put-to-work-Aren-t-they-both-just-boiling-water-for-a-turbine

The fusor does fusion, no doubt about it, but the number of reactions are much too few to be of any practical use.“Okay, so why are fusion reactors so hard to make?”Because that in order to make a self-sustaining fusion chain reaction on a large scale, you need extreme pressure and/or temperature (*), while fission reactions on a large scale can take place at Normal Temperature and Pressure.Essentially the hard part is this: how do you hold contained a fuel that is so hot that it makes everything it touches not just melt but turn into plasma, no matter what material you use?

A laser accelerates the ionized hydrogen proton into a B11 target. The current problem with H-B11 fusion is that the laser cannot produce the proton beam density (or proton energy?) necessary to create a net gain of power.So, why isn't everybody excited?

18,"Cheap fusion power is thirty years off. Always has been, always will be.Said in jest, but unfortunately as true now as when it was first coined.I do not think the current torus-based fusion models will lead to commercial fusion. I think it is probably possible, but I think it will need a conceptual breakthrough to make it happen. However, there is no way to force that to occur. In the meantime, I think we need to keep attention on the subject, and plodding ahead with ITER is the only way we have, at the moment, to do it.","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/When-the-claim-thorium-reactor-will-be-more-efficient-than-a-uranium-reactor-is-made-what-is-the-waste-being-put-to-work-Aren-t-they-both-just-boiling-water-for-a-turbine
