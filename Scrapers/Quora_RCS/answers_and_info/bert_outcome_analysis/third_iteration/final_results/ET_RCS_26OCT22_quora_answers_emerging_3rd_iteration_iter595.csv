But as any other device or industry, success goes for those who actually solve a real need and also boost a common vision.Of course, the design plays a major role to gain the preference of a specific audience but what obtains the big audience is, the user experience.

But as any other device or industry, success goes for those who actually solve a real need and also boost a common vision.Of course, the design plays a major role to gain the preference of a specific audience but what obtains the big audience is, the user experience. I mean, whatever the wearable does, it must be controlled by using the normal composition of the clothes, watch, glasses, etc.Otherwise it’s just a screen device embedded in a thing but it's not a wearable. With that said, the next big wearable device will be the one which has a true vision, solves a real need, it’s beautifully designed and applies skeuomorphism in the UX of the device.I invite you to take a look at my project, it’s called Wiggly and it’s a wearable jacket for kids with the vision of keep children active and with a positive state of mind, through a fun reflexes coordination challenge with music and instructions.

1,"They don’t. They need “Engineers”.They are solving business problem.None in the upper management wants to hear : “Oh but you know albeit that is the perfect solution to our business problem - we just are not the expert for that specific tech, and hence.. sorry.. can’t do.”NO. That does not work.So, they hire Engineers - who given a problem learns, and solve the problem right then and there, and it stays solved. If tech did not exists, they create their own.That is what Engineers trying to do.They do not just use tech. They invent them, if need be.",256 followers,Priyal Gupta,9.7K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-5-wearable-technologies-today
2,"To fully understand the answer to this question, let’s first talk about the goal of the .NET Framework (aka Classic), the one that was created at the beginning of the millennium.Microsoft looked around, and saw Java. Java was (and still is) a very good language, well thought of, and well designed. It offered a great and easy to use libraries, and was vastly better than VB6, which was Microsoft’s offer for development platform at the time.But Java was a huge threat for Microsoft, because it was a Write-Once-Run-Anywhere platform, and that means that programs written in Java DON’T NEED WINDOWS TTo fully understand the answer to this question, let’s first talk about the goal of the .NET Framework (aka Classic), the one that was created at the beginning of the millennium.Microsoft looked around, and saw Java. Java was (and still is) a very good language, well thought of, and well designed. It offered a great and easy to use libraries, and was vastly better than VB6, which was Microsoft’s offer for development platform at the time.But Java was a huge threat for Microsoft, because it was a Write-Once-Run-Anywhere platform, and that means that programs written in Java DON’T NEED WINDOWS TO RUN ON. And that was something that Microsoft, the then-Windows-oriented company, couldn’t tolerate.And so .NET was conceived. It was, at the beginning, almost a carbon-copy of Java, with some great additions such as WinForms (which was taken almost as is from VB6) and WebForms (which was, for its time, a really innovative web platform), and, of course, the best IDE ever created - Visual Studio.The main selling point of .NET was how easy and robust it was, and what great desktop and web features it has. The main motivation, from Microsoft POV, was that .NET could run ONLY on Windows. So you have to purchase Windows licenses in order to run your .NET apps, and this is exactly what Microsoft wanted.But times have changed. Microsoft is no longer a Windows-Only company. In fact, most VMs created on Microsoft’s cloud, Azure, are actually Linux machines. Microsoft and the open-source community are now BFF, and Microsoft openly supports and participates in various non-Windows initiatives.And in this brave, new world, .NET became a liability rather than an asset. Microsoft had a hard time explaining why its major dev platform supports only Windows, while the company touts open source, the Linux foundation and more.And so, a decision was made to build a new development platform, that will align with the new Microsoft values - open source, cross platform, nimble. And in order to not alienate the huge base of the .NET Framework developers - it must be as similar as possible to the original framework.And this is how .NET Core was created.","16,212 followers",Trausti Thor Johannsson,2K,12.9K,44M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-are-some-of-the-top-product-based-companies-who-use-C-and-Net-at-the-center-of-their-technology-stack

6,"Many new technologies were added to our daily lives and business activities in the year 2021. Other solutions that were already in place, like working from home, became more popular than ever.

Other solutions that were already in place, like working from home, became more popular than ever. Lastly, the NFT boom and the announcement of the metaverse are just two examples of how our world is changing in a way that can't be changed back. Let's take a look at some interesting tech trends that are likely to grow in 2022 and the years after that.Metaverse platformsIt shouldn't be a surprise that global giants like Microsoft or Meta will have a big impact on the tech trends of 2022. They are putting a lot of money into the metaverse, and Meta has raised $10 billion to help build it. There is no need to say that these investments come with a big marketing budget. And that's what makes the metaverse as a whole so popular.Virtual Reality is Becoming Increasingly MainstreamBecause of the low resolution, frame rates, and general graphical quality, many individuals had conflicting opinions about VR. Adaptive resolution and other technological advancements have changed that. Virtual reality is also more accessible. Hardware is improving, becoming more affordable, and offering a wider range of options.Finally, more people are becoming aware of VR's potential and practical applications. As one can expect, growing public awareness of virtual reality and related sectors leads to increased popularity. And, as people who believe in the future of virtual reality, we're doing our part to help spread the word.Gaming that is truly immersivePeople used to be suspicious about immersive games that used VR and related technology. Some people were critical of the sloppy graphic design, which was primarily a hardware issue. Others pointed out other technological flaws, such as the limited amount of room you could roam around in or the lack of advanced input devices. Technology, on the other hand, is continually evolving.Hope you find this answer useful!Connect With Aeologic Technologies for more!","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-are-some-of-the-top-product-based-companies-who-use-C-and-Net-at-the-center-of-their-technology-stack
