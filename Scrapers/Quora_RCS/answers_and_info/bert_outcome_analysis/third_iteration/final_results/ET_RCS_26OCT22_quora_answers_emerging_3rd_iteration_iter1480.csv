What if currency were regulated by mathematics rather than by any governments?Cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin etc..) are a digital form of money that run on a totally new monetary system, one that is not regulated by any centralized authority or tracked by some regular institution. Each digital currency is supported by a decentralized peer-to-peer network called the blockchain. Blockchain technology ensures that all cryptocurrencies are kept track of, regardless if they are being held in a digital wallet or being used in trading.The running of such a system effectively, however, requires an infrastructure that ensures that cheating and gaming the system isn’t possible. Bitcoin was the first to market, setting up a system in which two people - the sender and the receiver of coins - must sign off on payments to create a digital signature. Each person has a public and a private encryption key, which makes this possible. Every transaction is verified for accuracy, and the system is anonymous and totally transparent. At the center of this infrastructure is the ledger. So let’s dive into how that works.The Ledger: How Does It Work? & Who Owns It?A cryptocurrency has a ledger, where all transactions are made public so that total visibility is provided. Having a ledger forces everyone to ""play fair"" and takes away the risk of double spending.The ledger is a list of entries in a database that nobody can change without fulfilling specific conditions. Nobody owns the ledger or the cryptocurrency blockchain; instead, it’s decentralized meaning self-run and self-governed without the interference of outside parties.Verifying Transactions & BlockchainLet’s say that you want to invest in cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, through a major cryptocurrency exchange. After purchasing it, you decide to spend it. What happens now? At first, the transaction is unconfirmed, which means the transaction is not yet official, and it doesn’t become ""set in stone"" until it goes through a verification process. Once confirmed, the transaction becomes part of a record of historical transactions housed on the blockchain.Cryptocurrency Miners verify the transactions and then add them to the public ledger. They use powerful computers to solve complex math problems that are the key to the verification process. Cryptocurrency Mining is open source, so anyone can confirm a transaction, and the first miner to solve the problem gets to add a block to their transaction ledger. This process is called the ""proof-of-work system.""After adding a block to the ledger, the miner is given a reward for their efforts, which varies based on the cryptocurrency. For example, Bitcoin originally awarded 50 BTCs, but that award halves at preset times and today has decreased to 12.5 BTCs.","31,158 followers",Phillip Remaker,1.7K,11K,78.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-learn-Angular-React-and-Node-js-on-my-own
