Or indeed any modern scientist needs to learn English, you can summarize why that is from the same graph.Nazis simply used this preexisting system of scientific and technological excellence to their advantage. They inflicted considerable damage through forced emigration of brilliant minds and all the nastiness around the war and whatnot, but they had enough of an advantage for their scientists to be at the forefront of innovation all the same.That said, they were also incompetent enough not to be able to use them all that well. The British weren‚Äôt far behind and they made far better use of their technology. It turns out technology is a tool and a good tool used well is superior to an excellent tool used poorly.","29,960 followers",Toma≈æ Vargazon,3.9K,7.7K,249.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-areas-of-science-and-technology-that-were-pioneered-by-Nazis-ex-nazis-and-those-associated-with-them

6,"The Chinese had many great inventions. Just mentioning one will not be enough, so I will mention all the inventions in which without it we will not live in the world we know of today. In this answer, I will mention the most important Chinese inventions that most people do not know we invented.Though guns are frequently regarded to be a western invention, they actually originated from the eastern civilization of China. During the Song Dynasty an unknown man managed to make a smaller version of the cannon and create the first firearm. Today, in every war, you will find the gun.2.

During the Song Dynasty an unknown man managed to make a smaller version of the cannon and create the first firearm. Today, in every war, you will find the gun.2. PorcelainPorcelain. A glass-like material used to make dishes, vases, cups etc in China. During the Han dynasty, the first porcelain grew to become the materials for great works of art and also for cups, teapots, plates, vases, and more. In most of history, demand for Chinese porcelain had always being high. It was, and still is, one of the most profitable things the Chinese empire has every created, with thousands of wealth entering China from the ancient days for the humble porcelain. China was so famous for it‚Äôs porcelain that porcelain had a nickname called China.3. Mechanical ClockDuring Tang Dynasty, the first mechanical clock was created, which is the ancestor of the digital clock that wakes you up every morning. The first mechanical clock was operated by water in the warmer months, and liquid mercury in winter. The water turns a series of cogs and mechanisms which operates the clock, though it doesn't count as a water clock as the water does not tell the time.4. AlcoholThough the invention of alcohol is frequently attributed to Arabs, a discovery in 2013 of pottery containing traces of alcohol from 9000 years ago passed the title of the first alcohol brewers from the Arabs, to the Chinese, who discovered this 1000 years earlier than them. Today, this drink is extremely popular in the modern society, perhaps too popular.5. RocketsMany people, especially westerners, do not know that the rockets, the invention that took us to the moon and beyond, came from Song Dynasty China, one thousand years ago. Though it was used as a weapon, this invention became one of the things that the west used to assert it‚Äôs dominance over science and technology in modern times. But this invention was not western at all, it came one thousand years ago from far off China.6. ToothbrushThe toothbrush. The object that helps keep our teeth shining white and stop them from falling out. This invention originated in Ming Dynasty, it was bought to the west via the silk road and form then on has been keeping the world with shining white teeth.7. BanknoteThe banknote, the thing we use to pay for our items we buy. This originated from Tang Dynasty China, from then on, the whole world has been printing them over the centuries.There are countless inventions the Chinese made, and they all helped shape the world.","3,411 followers",Louis Vaught,4.8K,1.2K,13.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-areas-of-science-and-technology-that-were-pioneered-by-Nazis-ex-nazis-and-those-associated-with-them
