3,"Transfer learning in ML models.Humans are really good at generalizing. We only have to see a few dogs before we can recognize a dog when we see one.Machines are not. ML models require millions of examples before forming a reliable classifier, and that classifier is very specific to the data on which it was trained. If your training data doesn't include dogs with three legs, the model won't recognize them. A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one.

It's hypothesized that the reason humans learn so quickly is that we are fitting new examples into our existing knowledge rather than forming entirely new categories. If we could teach machines to do the same, they would learn exponentially faster and apply that learning more effectively.Transfer learning is a very hot topic in AI research right now, so I expect major breakthroughs in the next few years. I think this may be sufficient to achieve artificial general intelligence, but even if not, it will dramatically extend the range of tasks that machines can accomplish.",0 followers,Glen Boston,655,71,1.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Will-the-next-big-thing-be-more-technology-based-rather-than-a-network-effect-like-Facebook
4,"The next social network, as many have already pointed out here, won’t be a social network as we all know and love to hate. Using a first-principle approach, we can see that there are only 2 parts that can shift in a social network: 1) Social and 2) Networking. To see where the potential for change exists, we’ll have to unwind the paradigm by looking at it in reverse.The next social network, as many have already pointed out here, won’t be a social network as we all know and love to hate.

14,"I will answer this question , but by using the word “marvels”, you are not referring to anything related to comics.To answer the question, there are many technological developments that are today’s present but not accessed by everyone.For example,Use of drones,common in parts of the US but probably nil use in Djibouti. So talking about the next century,within the first 30 years, those technological developments the world has seen today will be a part of normal lives. We can expect new inventions like even smarter televisions and phones.Discoveries of more elements is expected.

We can expect new inventions like even smarter televisions and phones.Discoveries of more elements is expected. More eco-friendly ways of energy production to come up, like nuclear fusion to generate power would be done on a major scale. Ways to cope up with global warming to be developed. And very interestingly, we’ll find some other planet which would sustain life, reach there and it might become a new earth. My personal opinion says that aliens exist, technology would definitely be developed as much as to contact them, who knows,we might reach them in next hundred years! The invention or development of time travel technology seems highly improbable, a minute of thought would say,if the time machine is to be invented in future, why didn’t anybody come from future till date! Although there’s some speculation which says that time travel is possible. It’s expected that land won’t be the only viable place to live on, there will be floating cities in future. More efficient ways of production of cereals would be developed else checking the rate of decrease in number of farmers and farming areas and the devastatingly growing population, its clear that hunger could be a major problem in future which will be probably dealt with by improving efficiency of crops.There’s a lot more.

15,"The ones that no one can predict at this time. (In 1949, someone on the radio [we didn’t have a TV out in the woods where I heard the claim] claimed that by the end of the century, “in just 50 years”, we’d be able to put a satellite into orbit. Then came 1957 - just 8 years later. Within 20 years, we had gotten to the moon.)Don’t try prediction - it never works. We don’t all fly in personal planes. We don’t live on the moon.
