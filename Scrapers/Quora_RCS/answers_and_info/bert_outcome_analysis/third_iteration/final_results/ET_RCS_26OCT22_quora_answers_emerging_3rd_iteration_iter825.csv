We do not believe SuperIntelligence can explore the universe more thorough than we will yet - curiosity is an interesting thing, we have not recreated curiosity yet - because our AI is built based on our creation, practically, our AI is living on our scale for now - I do not see superintelligence have the need to expand its own existence beyond this scale though - because as we learn and making more conscious decision on resource usage and conservation, superintelligence does not necessarily need unlimited resources to expand - what is the reason for superintelligence to spend huge amount of resources to observe the universe further? what is the logical benefit-cost justification? If it’s illogical, why would superintelligence do it?So our curiosity should give us some tailwind - I don’t know how long will it last, but likely it will give us some breathing room.As long we keep the “modern Western” life philosophy - pursuing happiness is the ultimate goal of human lives, AR/VR could be the holy grail of achieving that goal without burning the earth down. Lots of sensation were evolved in the wild when resources were scarce. Modern society had made it a priority to alleviate the resource scarcity, however, our desire could not adjust to the plentiful of resources fast enough, we still long for things that were useful in the wild, but harmful when it’s too much - like sugar and fat. AR/VR could give us lots of stimulation without actual atoms - we can have the sensation of enjoying anything we want without burning fossil fuel, or kill a cow. And I think this is going to be lead by humans, at least until we can’t tell the difference.Now, it’s questionable, if superintelligence can do some of those things - we know superintelligence could use a different approach to tackle some problems - maybe a “brutal force” type of trying trillions of different methods - and see if it can crack some of the mathematical problems - somewhat similar to computer-generated human faces. I’m not convinced this is going to work efficiently.The imperfect knowledge-based machine learning is not a known methodology to create new mathematics theorem, while traditional logic operation based Turing machine is known to have limitations in the intuition “department”.One school of thinking is we have to advance ourselves - defy the slow natural selection process - not only in the sense of ensuring each individual’s wellbeing but also in the sense that we need to evolve and catch on, once we know super AI exists - either because of our fear, or distrust of handing our fate to machine, or because we simply have a new goal to inspire newer generations.How to do this? It is very very controversial. Two schools of thinking - genetic modification - this is really dangerous because we are not “circumventing natural selection”, rather, we are interfering with it - this means there can be the whole bunch of unexpected, unknown, unprecedented effect on the gene manipulation - and as it “leaks” to general public, what if some “advanced” genetic feature on the testing subject turns into horrendous features in their offsprings?The other school of thought is to create “borg”. A human-machine combination - the fear here is who is then controlling whom? Is that “combo” dominated by the human side, and machine serves the desire of the human mind? Or the machine dominates, and the human side became “prisoner of its own creation”?It is very likely the second because the assumption is superintelligence is more intelligent than a human, right?Oh well, I generally do not want to write negative things about technology, but I admit, this is a good question, thought-provoking - I wrote a lot about AI and its implication on human society, but to think “what’s next after AI”, is indeed a great thought experiment.Thanks for a great question.","135,507 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Will-there-be-another-communications-revolution-after-the-Internet
2,"Silicon brains or micro brain after modern and cuantum processors. It is not AI, but a computing system with a choice of calculation methods that will come up temporarily (these calculation methods will not be written by someone in advance).If someone thinks AI will be a threat, then victory over AI lies through these silicone brains.","1,090 followers",Mouhyemen Khan,671,98,1.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-big-tech-trend-after-Ai
3,"I think that trying to predict the next revolution in technology after an explosion in intelligence, either caused by human-machine hybrids or AGI, is largely futile, since we don’t know what superintelligent beings would do, much less discover. It will likely be far beyond our current technology, but that’s about all that can confidently be said.","45,623 followers",David Seidman,790,3.6K,85.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-big-tech-trend-after-Ai
4,"You are focussing on the wrong thing.You should improve your problem solving ability (Maths, Data Structures, Algorithms) first. While doing that, you can pick any language to code.Learning a new language, tool, platform, framework, etc in itself should not be the end goal. What problems are you eventually going to solve and how is what matters.You don’t pay doctors for they studied for 30 years. You pay them because they fix your headaches. Software engineers are no different. What problems can you solve using computer science?","29,918 followers",Barry Rountree,702,7.3K,39.8M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Will-there-be-another-communications-revolution-after-the-Internet

7,"There was an avenue of “video games” that reached a dead end or at least morphed into something else. It's never seen anymore. It nevertheless played an important part in the evolution of the games. I was a fan. It's called Text Adventures. It was very much audience participation. It was like a textual maze you had to find your way out of, without the benefit of graphically seeing the maze.

It was like a textual maze you had to find your way out of, without the benefit of graphically seeing the maze. All with continuous obstacles and challenges in your way.The adventure story was told and “you” were the protagonist. When a situation arose where a decision needed to be made, you were prompted to type in what you would do. There were no multiple choice options, you'd just tell it what action you'd take, and it would continue the story based on your actions. It was quite amazing and entertaining. The variety of consequences to your written actions seemed endless. Sometimes you'd find yourself trapped in a cave or something and it might take days before you figured out what needed to be done to escape. There were instances where an adventure would take weeks to figure out how to finally end the adventure by reaching the goal in the end.It was similar to the “you choose” books with alternate ending, but the options weren't endings… it just went on and on. And the shifts in the story seemed limitless.This was before Mario Bros and Frogger. Before Doom. Just before graphics had reached that sophistication. When graphics came on the scene, everyone left text adventures behind. But I remember them fondly. It was an important step towards today's amazing video games. This was right around 1992 or so. Forgotten tech history, I believe. It really made you think. Excellent brain exercise. Not mindless at all, the way so many video games are today.I spent a shameful number of my bosses hours playing text adventures in my office when times were slow. Eh… I was in my 20s.

11,"There can be little doubt about this. Both machine learning and the robotization of manufacturing processes are disrupting the way businesses operate as we speak.In March and April, Amazon hired 175,000 workers to manage a surge in online shopping. Firms offering products to facilitate telemedicine and online learning also took on scores of new employees. Many of these will stay, just as many pandemic-linked lay-offs will become permanent. There has been a surge in expected job reallocation from January to April, with 42% of lay-offs linked to the pandemic likely to prove permanent. Similarly,There can be little doubt about this.

There has been a surge in expected job reallocation from January to April, with 42% of lay-offs linked to the pandemic likely to prove permanent. Similarly, the shift to remote work prompted by covid-19 will leave a lasting impression. Of the hiring managers surveyed by Upwork, 62% say their workforce will be more remote than before the pandemic. (Source: The Economist)Ideally, these changes should allow humans to focus on the more creative and fulfilling aspects of work, delegating the more humdrum activities to machines, freeing us up to work less and focus of more rewarding and satisfying pursuits.Sadly, that is not how things work under the current dispensation. Businesses will simply look for ways to eliminate workers and subject their employees to a survival of the cheapest in a downward spiral. Without direct ‘government of the people’ intervention, the best ordinary citizens can hope for is some type of minimal universal basic income designed to stop us calling in the tumbrels.The majority of people need to have a job for their own self-esteem as much as to earn a living. Without meaningful work, emotional and psychological problems are likely to skyrocket.This is a conversation we should be having now, rather that blithely sitting back and hoping for the best.","246,828 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-big-tech-trend-after-Ai
