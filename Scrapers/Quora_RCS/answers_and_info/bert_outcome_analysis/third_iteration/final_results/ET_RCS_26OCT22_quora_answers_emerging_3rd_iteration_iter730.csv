I almost never get the question:With the changing dynamics of markets and human behaviors, it seems difficult to predict the right choice. However, we can predict things that will stay with us and choose what to invest on. Let’s look at Jeff and Amazon. For him the thing that will stick with his brand will be timely delivery and low cost. No one in 10 years would like late delivery times and super expensive stuff. So he invested his time and money on improving that and today we see Amazon, a leader in the online market.The secret that Jeff threw at us to find the ‘The Next Big Thing’, is not by looking at something that will drop from the blue but something that will stick with us. That’s where you make money.As to answer the question in relevance to Bitcoin.

1,"I believe that beyond the initial phase of Bitcoin, running decentralized nodes are going to become of the upmost importance. The newest blockchains are not designed to replace Bitcoin as much as it's complimenting it. Similar to how the internet has many protocols, blockchain will have layers and layers of decentralized networks.Each of these networks will need compute power provided by the public in order to operate. Proof of Work might be disappearing, but the race for decentralized networks is just beginning.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-technological-boom-after-Bitcoin-which-one-could-capitalize-on

TRX is yet to unfold their major project in Asia. Justin Sun is building a serious team full of experienced developers and creating a massive blockchain platform and digital currency for the entertainment and gaming space. What they are creating is unique and entirely new and revolutionary. What they are trying to invent threatens US tech firms like Facebook, Apple, Twitter and Google. Hence the FUD is huge.Price is currently being manipulated by whales who realise the potential of this coin. They know that once their product is out this coin will hit double figures. When is another question. This manipulation is a well-crafted campaign for these whales because once price shoots up, which it will, they will have a good chunk of TRX ready to be sold or kept for a much greater price.I'd recommend Tron for a long-term hold. Buy it and forget about it. I believe we'll be seeing TRX around $0.30 - $0.50 by June 2018 and heading towards $1 - $3 by end of year 2018. If TRX lays out it projects upfront and re-build the trust of investors the figures quoted could easily be doubled.This coin will be back. Remember what their ultimate aim is. It ain't easy competing with the big US tech firms. They seem to be working diligently and taking their time to execute properly.For Buying and Selling of Cryptocurrencies Visit Sragy.","1,772 followers",Thomas Y Graham,639,55,4.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-technological-boom-after-Bitcoin-which-one-could-capitalize-on

I find that it has a really nice UI and support.NOTE: I recommend the consultation of a financial professional who would have a perfect knowledge of the financial and patrimonial situation of the recipient of this message and would be able to verify that the financial products mentioned are adapted to the said situation and the financial objectives pursued. This above mentioned is based on my own experience dealing with CryptoFXnetwork.Bitcoin, altcoins, bankcoins, stablecoins; all have a place in global economy. Some will be used strictly as store of value, others as Inter-bank currencies, others as cross-border liquidity.Eventually, all currencies will be cryptographic, and even if you hate Bitcoin, you'll have to accept your pay in bankcoins or stablecoins. More than likely, most people will store their pay on their smartphone in a cryptographic wallet, with a choice of having insurance for your wallet if you want it.Phone wallets are evolving fast. And if you are only storing a week's wages in it, I don't see the difference between it and the present ATM cards which hold hundreds of dollars on them at any one time. I am sure banks are already working on this technology as we speak, allowing bank customers the peace of mind knowing their money is insured while being able to instantly send that money to anyone anywhere.I can see Bitcoin having a place in the future long term, but it is quickly evolving into a store of value and nothing more.If you consider China, where the government refuses to allow Bitcoin use as a commercial currency, it is possible that they may eventually utilises a stablecoin to support their Wechat app which has effectively replaced fiat notes and coins. This stablecoin could then interface with cross-border altcoins in Russia, India and possible the U.S. But this is drawing a long bow into the future.Most banks and Western governments are jumping into cryptos, particularly stablecoins. These coins provide greater liquidity and stability and provide centralization of control, which banks and governments have historically needed for security. Recent political actions show just how concerned banks and governments are about removing financial control of currency from traditional legal tender.","1,613 followers",Carpenco Dima,1K,66,2.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-technological-boom-after-Bitcoin-which-one-could-capitalize-on

All forms of invisibility like electronic invisibility, heat signature, light, everything. “All warfare is based on deception.” is the first thing Sun Tzu put in his book “The Art of War”.

China is actively developing AI as fast as they can, which includes them stealing technology from the US military and US tech firms. It’s what most of China’s military is working on, at least when it comes to electronic warfare. It will be the deciding factor in near future conflicts, and it will have an even bigger impact than the atomic bomb did. I mean, War is a game, and AI’s are good at games. So it’s easy to predict what will happen when that day arrives. It will win.What would be really terrible is developing an AI that is good at differentiating people as well as killing them. The moment that becomes active, world domination will be achieved for whoever controls the AI.
