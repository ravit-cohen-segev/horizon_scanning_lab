0,"I'm not really sure if there is a systematic approach to this (probably is, but I just don't know of it!)You really need to look at the innovators in the field and how much money is being invested into it.Good sources to find them are universities.What type of research is being funded more?This could be a good indicator as to what may be the next big thing.Personally I think it'll be 'smart foods' - products like Solyent will be more and more desired.","358,974 followers",Sean Kernan,9.1K,5.6K,727M,2013,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-indicators-that-emerging-technology-is-ready-to-be-commercialized

2,"Two. Artificial Intelligence and Genetic engineering. Humans are in for an existential change. These technologies will merge 'big time' out of China.If the public knew what was coming, it would dominate 75% of news reporting. As it is, they are side topics with less discussion than sports.Our grandchildren are going to live in an unrecognizable world.","90,367 followers",Alisha Talks,4.7K,910,103.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-indicators-that-emerging-technology-is-ready-to-be-commercialized
3,"I learned this years ago from a Flight Attendant who literally sat in the back of a plane near me and chatted it up, and I thought we were flirting, only for her to tell me she had a boyfriend at the end of the flight.She was a tease or I was a guy misreading the signs. Probably the latter :):|When these masks drop down.They aren’t actually connected to oxygen tanks.Those masks have a tube of chemicals connected to them. They refer to them as “oxygen candles” that burn for about 15 minutes and provide you a source of oxygen.Also - these people in the picture are wearing the masks wrong.

4,"Sweet hairy hell yes. I am stunned by the ineptitude of people's knowledge about even basic first aid.I am also stunned that for a supposedly advanced country, so few people are taught how to do it from a young age. Especially CPR. It saves lives. End of. If children were taught it from a young age and given a basic exam in first aid management (basic dressings, CPR, bleeding management, choking etc). Nothing strenuous. Nothing too complicated, just enough to give people confidence in managing it. I have little doubt lives would be saved and we would get called to less rubbish.I recently was cSweet hairy hell yes.

His wife had an amazing first aid kit….sealed…..she had bought it but had no idea how to use any of it. She had no idea what to do.

5,"If you mean the smartphones as emerging technologies, yes American and Korean/Japanese companies have pretty much own the whole market. But in other fields, especially the machinery, German companies still have the lead. But I get your point. It might be due to military, since most technologic investments are first done for military purposes then come to civilian life, and Europe is pretty much a demilitarized zone compared to how it was 70 years ago. No European country actually bears a functioning, good funded and working military. Britain might be an exception but it is too struggling to keIf you mean the smartphones as emerging technologies, yes American and Korean/Japanese companies have pretty much own the whole market.

No European country actually bears a functioning, good funded and working military. Britain might be an exception but it is too struggling to keep the small one it has, budget cuts all the time. Another explanations would be the aging population, increasing socialism which leads to mass laziness and death of creativity, rather stuffy and conservative views on new technologies from many European industrialists, and USA and Japan(later Korea and Taiwan) seizing the whole industry before anything is left to Europe.",570 followers,Christian Benesch,1.5K,2.3K,3.1M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-indicators-that-emerging-technology-is-ready-to-be-commercialized
6,"'We' aren't, It all depends on what you regard as emerging technologies and how you're qualifying your statement.If you want to look at computing look at the work being done by the  ARM chip in your phone, that's from a small company in the UK, or some of the world leading graphene work in Manchester. Look at the world first in Germany and France by Airbus charging the aerospace industry. Airbus flew this year the 1st electric aircraft across the channel (E-Fan very exciting). There was also the lab-grown meat this year in the UK and some of the worlds most cutting-edge tidal power work is be'We' aren't, It all depends on what you regard as emerging technologies and how you're qualifying your statement.If you want to look at computing look at the work being done by the  ARM chip in your phone, that's from a small company in the UK, or some of the world leading graphene work in Manchester.
