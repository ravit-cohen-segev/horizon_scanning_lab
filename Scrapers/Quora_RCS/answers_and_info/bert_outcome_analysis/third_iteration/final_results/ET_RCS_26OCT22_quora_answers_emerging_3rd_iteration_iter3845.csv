0,"You can best protect your children by bringing them up to be cherished, emotionally resilient and educated on the dangers.Most kids online have seen the predators.  They recognize the obvious ones and reject them.  The subtle ones look for the lonely kids, the ones who are unsure of themselves.  They validate them and use that to snare them in.  Somebody who knows these tactics and who doesn't need a stranger to tell them what they want to hear isn't so vulnerable.And sometimes it's easy to fall into paranoia around this.

But as bad as he was, how could we be certain that killing him would make things better? While he is the figure most attributed to WW2, he needed a whole lot of people like him to get anything going. Couldn't any number of them have accomplished his attrocities without him?And what if they don't? Then, perhaps, there is no imminent drive for the Americans to develop their super weapon, and they never do enough to figure it out. Quietly, some other tyrannical leader gets enough time to have research done and becomes the first to develop it. He only wants world domination, and has multiple nuclear strikes performed all around the world in short order to convince the survivors that they have no chance. They cower to his power as he continues to torture and slaughter his subjects randomly just for the fun of it. Doesn't sound like we really made things better, does it?WW2 certainly was horrible, but it also left us with some valuable historical lessons. Stopping it from happening removes those lessons with no guarantee of making the world a better place. Similarly, stopping a genocidal murderer from being capable of committing the acts (which I know will happen based on a hallucination) by killing him is no guarantee that anything will be made better. Massive killings like that simply cannot be carried out by one psychopath, regardless of how much we want to pin them on an individual.Then what's the alternative? Maybe, this person doesn't have to die in order to be stopped. Maybe she just needs a conscientious caring person to help guide her on a better path. If I truly was so certain of my apparition, I would do anything I could to be that person.Killing bad people is the quick and easy solution to try to make things better. Helping them to be good people is the right solution.","9,867 followers",Kenzi Mudge,1.8K,1.3K,8.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/If-children-are-constantly-immersed-in-technology-then-how-can-we-protect-them-from-the-dangers-of-the-ever-advancing-technology-How-can-we-keep-them-from-being-over-run-by-online-predators

9,"It is true, and it is a mistake to assume that it matters. Humans didn’t depend on all the things we use today for most of our civilization, and we are extremely good at altering our behavior to conform to available resources.The Club of Rome wrote “Limits to Growth” in 1972. The failure of the predictions in the book to materialize has been a mocking point for Republicans just about ever since. What the Club of Rome failed to recognize is that the definitions of resources they used were far too narrow.

Humans didn’t depend on all the things we use today for most of our civilization, and we are extremely good at altering our behavior to conform to available resources.The Club of Rome wrote “Limits to Growth” in 1972. The failure of the predictions in the book to materialize has been a mocking point for Republicans just about ever since. What the Club of Rome failed to recognize is that the definitions of resources they used were far too narrow. They didn’t understand how good we would become at using lower quality ores, fossil fuels, and most of the other minerals.So the least precise word used in this question is “eventually”. We can be confident of having an advanced technology capability for many times longer than human civilization has lasted before any of the limits matter. We’ll stop using stuff because better stuff will be identified and used better.The best example is fossil fuels. Most of the concern about scarcity for rare earths is fossil fuel industry efforts to make people uncertain about sustainable energy. Most of it is just short term delays in developing new production facilities. But we are past the point of no return as far as fossil fuels go. We haven’t clearly passed the world peak of oil consumption, but it is coming soon, by default, because electricity is cheaper and better. We are past the point of peak coal consumption. Coal advocates claim we are heading for a new peak, but that is a risky assumption given how the world’s manufacturing of wind, solar and natural gas generation are going.We can’t show that natural gas consumption isn’t rising, but in the U.S. and many other major economies total fossil fuel consumption has already been declining for a decade or more, so natural gas is rising, but at the expense of coal, and the total pool available for fossil and nuclear to compete in is shrinking.Don’t worry, be happy, but don’t be a dimwit about the issues. Laypeople can tell who is lying and who isn’t. Just be sensible and read carefully. Climate change is real. The shortage of lithium is not. Nor is lithium the only path to storage.Our future includes abundant cheap electricity made from sources that will persist for millions of years. Even if that isn’t “forever” it is pretty good.I’m skeptical about our ability to get out of the solar system, but it isn’t my role to work on that.

10,"The answer is in your If. As resources become scarcer, their price goes up and alternatives become feasible.Let’s say we run out of oil. As it becomes harder to find/extract, the price goes up and other energy sources now become economic - nuclear, solar, batteries for cars, etc. Aircraft could operate with hydrogen derived from water + electricity, or a synthetic fuel made from coal.Other scarce resources get recycled more diligently as the value of the recycled materieal goes up.As the cost of having kids goes up, people will use contraception more and the population will stabilize and maybeThe answer is in your If.
