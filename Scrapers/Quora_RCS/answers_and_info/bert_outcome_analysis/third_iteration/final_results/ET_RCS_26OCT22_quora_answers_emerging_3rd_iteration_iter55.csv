I was working at the Apple Store and I wanted a change. I wanted to start building the tech I was servicing.I started looking into Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).There’s so much going on in the field.Every week it seems like Google or Facebook are releasing a new kind of AI to make things faster or improve our experience.Don’t get me started on the number of self-driving car companies. This is a good thing though. I’m not a fan of driving and roads are dangerous.Even with all this happening, there’s still yet to be an agreed definition of what exactly artificial intelligence is.Some argue deep learning can be considered AI, others will say it’s not AI unless it passes the Turing Test.This lack of definition really stunted my progress in the beginning. It was hard to learn something which had so many different definitions.Enough with the definitions.How did I get started?My friends and I were building a web startup. It failed. We gave up due to a lack of meaning. But along the way, I was starting to hearing more and more about ML and AI.“The computer learns the things for you?” I couldn’t believe it.I stumbled across Udacity’s Deep Learning Nanodegree. A fun character called Siraj Raval was in one of the promo videos. His energy was contagious. Despite not meeting the basic requirements (I had never written a line of Python before), I signed up.Three weeks before the course start date I emailed Udacity support asking what the refund policy was. I was scared I wouldn’t be able to complete the course.I didn’t get a refund. I completed the course within the designated timeline. It was hard. Really hard at times. My first two projects were handed in four days late. But the excitement of being involved in one of the most important technologies in the world drove me forward.Finishing the Deep Learning Nanodegree, I had guaranteed acceptance into either Udacity’s AI Nanodegree, Self-Driving Car Nanodegree or Robotics Nanodegree. All great options. I was a little lost. “Where do I go next?”I needed a curriculum. I’d built a little foundation with the Deep Learning Nanodegree, now it was time to figure out where I’d head next.My Self-Created AI Masters DegreeI didn’t plan on going back to university anytime soon. I didn’t have $100,000 for a proper Masters Degree anyway.So I did what I did in the beginning. Asked my mentor, Google, for help.I’d jumped into deep learning without any prior knowledge of the field. Instead of climbing to the tip of the AI iceberg, a helicopter had dropped me off on the top.After researching a bunch of courses, I put a list of which ones interested me the most in Trello.Trello is my personal assistant/course coordinator.I knew online courses had a high drop out rate. I wasn’t going to let myself be a part of this number. I had a mission.To make myself accountable, I started sharing my learning journey online. I figured I could practice communicating what I learned plus find other people who were interested in the same things I was. My friends still think I’m an alien when I go on one of my AI escapades.I made the Trello board publicThe curriculum has changed slightly since I first wrote it but it’s still relevant and I visit the Trello board multiple times per week to track my progress.Getting a jobI bought a plane ticket to the US with no return flight. I’d been studying for a year and I figured it was about time I started putting my skills into practice.My plan was to rock up to the US and get hired.Then Ashlee messaged me on LinkedIn, “Hey I’ve seen your posts and they’re really cool, I think you should meet Mike.”I met Mike.I told him my story of learning online, how I loved healthtech and my plans to go to the US.“You may be better off staying here a year or so and seeing what you can find, I’ think you’d love to meet Cameron.”I met Cameron.We had a similar chat what Mike and I talked about. Health, tech, online learning, US.“We’re working on some health problems, why don’t you come in on Thursday?”Thursday came. I was nervous. But someone once told me being nervous is the same as being excited. I flipped to being excited.I spent the day meeting the Max Kelsen team and the problems they were working on.Two Thursday’s later, Nick, the CEO, Athon, lead machine learning engineer, and I went for coffee.“How would you like to join the team?” Asked Nick.“Sure.” I said.My US flight got pushed back a couple months, I’ve also got a return ticket.Sharing your workLearning online, I knew it was unconventional. All the roles I’d gone to apply for had Masters Degree requirements or at least some kind of technical degree.I didn’t have either of these. But I did have the skills I’d gathered from a plethora of online courses.Along the way, I was sharing my work online. My GitHub contained all the projects I’d done, my LinkedIn was stacked out and I’d practiced communicating what I learned through YouTube and articles on Medium.I never handed in a resume for Max Kelsen. “We checked you out on LinkedIn and we were impressed.” My body of work was my resume.Regardless if you’re learning online or through a Masters Degree, having a portfolio of what you’ve worked on is a great way to build skin in the game.ML and AI skills are in demand but that doesn’t mean you don’t have to showcase them. Even the best product won’t sell without any shelf space.Whether it be GitHub, Kaggle, LinkedIn or a blog, have somewhere where people can find you. Plus, having your own corner of the internet is great fun.How do you start?Where do you go to learn these skills? What courses are the best?There’s no best answer. Everyone’s path will be different. Some people learn better with books, others learn better through videos.What’s more important than how you start is why you start.Start with why.Again, no right reason. All are valid in their own way.Start with why because having a why is more important than how. Having a why means when it gets hard and itGot a why? Good. Time for some hard skills.I can only recommend what I’ve tried.I’ve completed courses from (in order):They’re all world class. I’m a visual learner. I learn better seeing things being done/explained to me on. So all of these courses reflect that.If you’re an absolute beginner, start with some introductory Python courses and when you’re a bit more confident, move into data science, machine learning and AI.How much math?The highest level of math education I’ve had was in high school. The rest I’ve learned through Khan Academy as I’ve needed it.There are many different opinions on how much math you need to know to get into machine learning and AI. I’ll share mine.If you want to apply machine learning and AI techniques to a problem, you don’t necessarily need an in-depth understanding of the math to get a good result. Libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch allow someone with a bit of Python experience to build state of the art models whilst the math is taken care of behind the scenes.If you’re looking to get deep into machine learning and AI research, through means of a PhD program or something similar, having an in-depth knowledge of the math is paramount.In my case, I’m not looking to dive deep into the math and improve an algorithm’s performance by 10%. I’ll leave that to people smarter than me. Instead, I’m more than happy to use the libraries available to me and manipulate them to help solve problems as I see fit.What does a machine learning engineer actually do?What a machine engineer does in practice might not be what you think.Despite the cover photos of many online articles, it doesn’t always involve working with robots that have red eyes.Here are a few questions an ML engineer has to ask themselves daily.I borrowed these from a great article by Rachel Thomas, one of the co-founders ofFor more, I made a video of what we usually get up to on Monday’s at Max KelsenNo set pathThere’s no right or wrong way to get into ML or AI.The beautiful thing about this field is we have access to some of the best technologies in the world, all we’ve got to do is learn how to use them.You could begin by learning Python code.You could begin by studying calculus and statistics.You could begin by learning about the philosophy of decision making.Machine learning and AI fascinates me because of this intersection of fields.The more I learn about it, the more I realise there’s plenty more to learn. And this hypes me up.Sometimes I get frustrated when my code doesn’t run. Or I don’t understand a concept. So I give up temporarily. I give up by letting myself walk away from the problem and take a nap. Or go for a walk. When I come back it feels like I’m looking at it with different eyes. The excitement comes back. I keep learning.There’s so much happening in the field it can be daunting to get started. Too many options lead to no options. Ignore this.Start wherever interests you most and follow it. If it leads to a dead end, great, you’ve figured out what you’re not interested in. Retrace your steps and take the other fork in the road instead.Computers are smart but they still can’t learn on their own.

How indeed does one prepare oneself for a (research or otherwise) career in machine learning, in particular in terms of familiarizing oneself with the underlying mathematics? I’m going to resist the temptation of trotting out some standard books, and instead, focus on giving broad advice.There’s some bad news on this front, and it’s best to get this out of the way as quickly as possible. Having spent 35+ years studying machine learning, let me put this in the most direct way possible: no matter how much time and effort you devote to it, you can never know enough math to read through all the ML literature. Different parts of ML use a variety of esoteric math. There’s just no way one person can know all of this math, so it’s good to be forewarned.OK, with that out of the way, how does one prepare oneself? Think of the process analogous to conditioning your mind and body to run a marathon. It’s a gradual process, of improving your fitness, your ability to run for longer and longer distances, your breathing technique, your mental focus, and dozens of other dimensions. Working in ML is not like running a 100 meter sprint, where the race is pretty much over in a single breath. It’s much more of an endurance sport, where you have to constantly work at it to remain in shape, and there’s no point at which you can relax and say: OK, I know it all! Because no one does!An example from my recent work will clarify the issues involved. One of the major challenges in machine learning is that there’s never enough training data to tackle every ML problem that presents itself. Humans are especially adept in solving this challenge. I can get on a flight from San Francisco and within a few short hours find myself in a dizzying diversity of new environments, from the glitzy subways of Tokyo and the bleak winter in Scandinavia to an arid savannah in Africa, or a swampy rainforest in Brazil. There’s no way I can ever hope to collect training samples from every possible environment that I can encounter in life. So, what do we do? We transfer our learned knowledge from places we’ve been — so, having taken the BART subway in San Francisco, and subways in New York and London, I can try to handle the complexity of the subway in Tokyo by drawing upon my previous experience. Of course, it doesn’t quite match — the language is completely different, the tone and texture of the visual experience is completely different (attendants in gloved hands show you the way in Tokyo — no such luxury is available in the US!). Yet, we somehow manage, and plod our way through new experiences. We even cherish the prospect of finding ourselves in some alien new culture, where we don’t speak the language and can’t ask for directions. It opens up our mind to new horizons, all part of the charm of travel.So, what’s the mathematics involved in implementing a transfer learning algorithm? It varies a lot depending on what type of approach you investigate. Let’s review some approaches from computer vision over the past few years. One class of approaches are so-called subspace methods, where the training data from a collection of images in the “source” domain (which conveniently has labels given to us) is to be compared with a collection of unlabeled images from a “target” domain (e.g., “source” → NY subway, “target” → Tokyo subway).One can take a collection of images of size NxN and using a variety of different methods find the smallest subspace that the source images lie in (treating each image as a vector in N^2 dimensions). Now, to understand this body of work, you obviously need to know some linear algebra. So, if you don’t understand linear algebra, or you took a class way back when and forgot it all, it’s time to refresh your memory or learn anew. Fortunately, there are excellent textbooks (Strang is usually a good place to start) and also something like MATLAB will let you explore linear algebraic ML methods without having to implement things like eigenvalue or singular value decomposition. As I usually told my students, keep the motto “eigen do it if I try” in mind. Persevere, and keep the focus on why you are learning this math. Because it is important and essential to understand much of modern ML.OK, great, you’ve managed to learn some linear algebra. Are you done? Ummm, not quite. So, back to our transfer learning example. You construct a source subspace from the source images, and a target subspace from the target images. Umm, how does one do that. OK, you can use a garden variety dimensionality reduction method like principal components analysis (PCA), which just computes the dominant eigenvectors of the covariance matrices of the source and target images. This is one subroutine call in MATLAB. But, PCA is 100 years old. How about something new and cool, like a ooh la la subspace tracking method like GOUDA, which uses the fancier math of Lie groups. Oops, now you need to learn some group theory, the mathematics of symmetry. As it turns out, matrices of certain types, like all invertible matrices, or all positive definite matrices, are not just linear algebraic objects, they are also of interest in group theory, a particularly important subfield of which is Lie groups (Lie → “Lee”).OK, great, you have a smattering of knowledge of group theory and Lie groups. Are you done? Hmmm…actually not, because it turns out Lie groups are not just groups, but they are also continuous manifolds. What in the blazes is a “manifold”? If you google this, you are likely to encounter web pages describing engine parts! No, a manifold is something entirely different in machine learning, where it means a non-Euclidean space that has curvature. It turns out the set of all probability distributions (e.g., 1 dimensional Gaussians with a scalar variance dimension and a scalar mean dimension) are not Euclidean, but rather, describe a curved space. So, the set of all positive definite matrices form a Lie group, with a certain curvature. What this implies is that obvious operations like taking the average have to done with considerable care. So, off you go, learning all there is to know about manifolds, Riemannian manifolds, tangent spaces, covariant derivatives, exp and log mappings, etc. Oh, what fun!Getting back to our transfer learning method, if you compute the source covariance matrix C_s and the target covariance matrix C_t, then there is a simple method called CORAL (for correlational alignment) that figures out how to transform C_s into C_t using some invertible mapping A. CORAL is popular as a transfer learning method in computer vision. But, CORAL does not actually use the knowledge that the space of positive definite matrices (or covariance matrices) forms a manifold. In fact, it forms something called a cone in convex analysis. If you subtract one covariance matrix from another, the result is not a covariance matrix. So, they do not form a vector space, but rather something else entirely. Oops, it turns out the study of cones is important in convex analysis, so there you go again, you need to learn about convex sets and functions, projections onto convex sets, etc. The dividing line between tractable and intractable optimization is not linear vs. nonlinear, but rather, convex vs. non-convex.I hope the pattern is becoming clear. Like one of those legendary Russian dolls, where each time you open one, you find it is not the end, but there’s another one inside it, so it is with learning math in machine learning. Each time you learn a bit of math, you find it opens the door to an entirely new field of math, which you need to know something about as well. For my most recent paper, I had to digest a whole book devoted entirely to the topic of positive definite matrices (it’s like the old joke, where the deeper you go, the more you know about a specialized topic, until you know everything about —- nothing!).Any given problem in machine learning, like transfer learning, can be formulated as a convex optimization problem, as a manifold learning problem, as a multivariate statistical estimation problem, as a nonlinear gradient based deep learning problem, etc. etc. Each of these requires learning a bit about the underlying math involved.If you feel discouraged, and feel like tearing your hair out at this point, I sympathize with you. But, on the other hand, you can look on the positive side, and realize that in terms of our analogy of running a marathon, you are steadily becoming better at running the long race, building your mathematical muscle as you go along, and gradually things start falling into place. Things start to make sense, and different subfields start connecting with each other. Something strange happens. You start liking it! Of course, there’s a drawback. Someone who doesn't understand any of the math you get good at using asks you to explain your work, and you realize that it’s impossible to do that without writing equations.Most researchers find their comfort zone and try to stay within it, since otherwise, it takes a great deal of time and effort to master the dozens of mathematical subfields that modern ML uses. But, this strategy eventually fails, and one is always forced to get outside one’s comfort zone and learn some new math, since otherwise, a whole area of the field becomes alien to you.Fortunately, the human brain is an amazing instrument, and provides decades and decades of trouble-free operation, allowing us to continually learn over 40,50, 60, years or more. How precisely it does that without zeroing out all prior learning is one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in science!",3 followers,Sridhar Mahadevan,1K,177,6.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Does-specializing-in-machine-learning-at-a-masters-level-make-sense-for-job-prospects-at-top-technology-companies

But overThe partners all keep 20% of the gains, or $20m in total ($100m gains x 20%). Each partner has a 20% stake in that 20%, or $4m each ($20m x 20% to each partner) paid outOver 10+ years, that’s $400k per year per partner in annualized gains on a 2x $100m fund, which is decent results on a not-tiny fund.If you areFor this reason, some LPs (the folks that give VCs money to invest) get a little nervous about general partners that are too rich. They know they may check out.Yes, big funds can make a lot more money than my math above. And also, if you raise say 3 funds over 9 years … that math triples (and the timeline lengthens).But even just one fund takes time. 10+ years. Of endless meetings. Of LP pitches. Of board meeting after board meeting after board meeting.You can scale up the math and see Really Rich People may not see the full appeal in venture.…So VC is a very, very good job. And pretty darn cushy (although stressful — you are judged every single day on your results).But being a super-successful founder?Much harder.

I say.I was not involved in that particular set of interviews. However, I was involved in many, many interviews at Google, because the recruiters liked me, and because I was pretty consistent in my recommendations vs. calibration of candidate quality, and because the hiring committee did not ask them to stop getting interview results from me, because they were pretty happy with that.When you interview at Google, you actually get 5 or 6 one hour sessions, and you get a “casual lunch”.And if there are statistical outliers — for example, if a candidate did well in every interview, except for one, where he got stuck inverting a binary tree, and had problems with it.And the engineer conducting the interview rated the candidate at a “1” so that the hiring committee wouldn’t confuse a “0” with “the interviewer forgot to rate this candidate”.That result would be thrown out, and not considered in the interview “score”.“Google understands statistics, and that even an interviewer can have a bad day, once in a while?!? The hell, you say!”Yes. I say.Blowing a single interview will not impact you getting hired.Max wasn’t hired because his overall “score”, throwing out the binary tree inversion question entirely, was still below 2.5.And given that he was “Google sometimes does “charity hires”.They’ll hire someone in the Open Source community to “work at Google”, but they really mean “continue to work on your Open Source project, without worrying about not being able to pay your bills”.It’s a Googley™ thing to do. Google hires people who Do Googley™ Things, and they, in turn, throw money at some things — and people — because they feel that it’s the right thing to do.That was (apparently) not why they were interviewing Max.OK, that was “gloves off”; let me take my shoes and socks off, too.Homebrew is pretty much crap code.There is plenty of crap code that people use every day, and as long as they don’t run into a performance issue, they will continually and happily use that crap code, until the heat death of the universe.I know this, because I also wrote crap code.Back in 1991, I wrote the 386BSD Patchkit.You may or may not have heard of it, but you’ve probably heard of some of the things that resulted from it:It was a reallyBecause if you got them out of order, you’d getMostly, this was because Larry Wall (yes,OK, since my socks are off: it wasn’t justBecause I did such a crappy job at building this source code control system, one of the consequences was the FreeBSD/NetBSD split.Because only one person could own that monotonically increasing integer, and there was a sort of an argument, when that one person “didn’t move fast enough”, when things sort of snowballed, and that snowball rolled down hill.The point is…It was crap code, and I knew it was crap code.I’m not sure that MaxIt’s good enough to do the job that it needs to do, and it’s no better than that.I did worse, and when I did it (in 1991) I could have inverted the binary tree; hell… I was doing topological sorting in a shell script.I didn’t do better, because I didn’t plan ahead for things snowballing —And that’s why “Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew) …” is true.And it’s also why this statement is true:“Just because you wrote ‘Homebrew’ doesn’t mean you’re a good engineer.”And that’s how we get to the second half of that tweet, “…but you can’t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so fuck off.”.Max didn’t just fail inverting the binary tree on the whiteboard.He had to get an average of a weak “wouldn’t hire” signal on 4–5 more interviews.So let’s put the socks back on (my feet are cold, anyway).You asked:Why are so many software engineering interviews just ridiculously and unnecessarily difficult (not just Google)?And I’m going to say straight out.They aren’t.They areAnd maybe 10–20% more than that,And if you can’t pass the interviews, because they are too difficult for you?Study harder, if you’re still in school.If you aren’t in school, consider going to work in a small software company, or as a contractor, or in a job shop, where this sort of thing doesn’t matter as much.And while you are working there… go to night school, and get a little formal education under your belt.And if you pass those classes…You’ll probably pass the next interviews.And you won’t find them “ridiculously and unnecessarily difficult”.They won’ t beAnd they won’t beI’d write more on this topic, but it’s not so easy, tying your shoelaces, with gloves on.
