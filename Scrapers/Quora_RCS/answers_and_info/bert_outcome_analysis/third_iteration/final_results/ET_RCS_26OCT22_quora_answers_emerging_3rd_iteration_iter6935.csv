2,"No.The worst case would be if we continue to react as stupidly as we are now to our various threats - climate change, growing debt, growing income inequality, global tensions, unsustainable industrial agriculture, and eventually fossil fuel exhaustion. My estimate is that if we don’t get our act together, we will see a cascading collapse around 2050. Starvation, war, and epidemics will reduce the population by about 90%. The remainder will live in conditions somewhere between the dark ages and the stone age.If we get on the stick right now we still have the ability to prevent all of this and bNo.The worst case would be if we continue to react as stupidly as we are now to our various threats - climate change, growing debt, growing income inequality, global tensions, unsustainable industrial agriculture, and eventually fossil fuel exhaustion.

The most likely event that can lead to it, would be a collision with a big object from space.If a new technological species emerges near to our time, it might be somewhat more difficult for them to get through some stages of industrialization because humans are depleting easily accessible resources like oil or coal. It wouldn’t set them back for too long, as this sort of issue plays out on the scale of hundreds of years and not millions. They might even find some artifacts and lost knowledge that we left behind that would give them clues on how to advance faster in some aspects. Hopefully not too fast so that they don’t destroy themselves prematurely in nuclear armageddon.The question was: If there was another extinction-level event, what are the chances of another human-like race forming?

It comes packed with a bunch ready to implement solutions , which basically means it solves most of the common problems you’d encounter in building a backend in house. It comes with a tonnn of features out the box and there’s probably no backend related problem django doesn’t have a solution to.what does this mean for a developer?time of development reduces drastically.although, this means you give up flexibility and end up following The strict structure Which Django provides And ultimately this means you have less room to mess up.ofcourse there are lots of other advantages and disadvantages of both frameworks but I feel these are the most potent in deciding which to go with.at the end of the day it’s your choice as a developer to make the decision as to what tool would be most suitable for a job, so don’t see one as better than the other, rather see all as tools to solve problems.I personally would advise to go with django ;)","224,564 followers",Gayle Laakmann McDowell,7.4K,1.2K,49.8M,2022,https://www.quora.com/How-long-do-you-think-it-will-be-until-Earths-next-extinction-level-event-What-do-you-think-will-happen-and-do-you-think-humans-will-develop-enough-to-find-a-method-or-technology-to-survive

You still know all the methodologies and fundamental software engineering principles. You’ll just apply them in a different language (or languages).I learned Pascal, C, C++ and Assembly in college. I used C++ exclusively for the first few years of my career. Then I learned Java. Then HTML and CSS (not programming languages, but technologies). Then C#. Then JavaScript. Then SQL. Then Python.Learning Pascal was the hardest. The others came easier because they were all just languages.
