1,"Absolutely, NASA does much more than just gravitational studies and manned space flight. They study the entire space environment which includes (but not limited too) plasma physics, astronomy, cosmology, Earth weather, geology, solar system formation, planetary science, and solar physics.In addition to the science, they develop new technologies that benefit everyone. This runs the gamut from more fuel-efficient aircraft to higher yield  crop production.Check out NASA.gov, in 15 minutes you'll see for yourself how important they are.",5 followers,Jake Williams,9.9K,3.2K,76.6M,2014,https://www.quora.com/Newton-discovered-so-much-without-going-into-space-do-we-really-need-NASA

Which is, in a way, understandable. But for those of you who want to know why it’s disturbing, I’ll try my best to explain as I LOVE this game and have been permanently scarred.SPOILERS AHEAD (And graphic content)The game is divided into 4 acts. Act 1 is pretty innocent and expected, it’s an anime-style dating simulator visual novel where you are welcomed into the literature club at your highschool by 4 beautiful anime girls- Sayori, Yuri, Monika and Natsuki.Sayori is your childhood friend and very upbeat and positive. She always puts a smile on people’s faces.Yuri is a more quiet, timid girl who loves reading and writing. Her poems are usually very symbolic and she tends to like darker themes.Monika is… just Monika. She’s the club president and seems nice enough but strangely, doesn’t get her own route.Natsuki is a small tsundere type girl who likes baking and cute things, though she’ll never admit it.Love these girls? Good! Now watch them all die horrible painful deaths.Sayori’s death is first. You learn one night that she has horrible depression and has had it her entire life. She only wants others to smile. You can confess your love to her if you so choose. The next morning, you decide to let her sleep and walk to school without her. After seeing Sayori’s newest poem, you realize you should probably go check on her.(Sayori’s latest poem, “Get Out of my Head”.You walk into her house to see her dead, hanging from the ceiling. Her lifeless body dangles and you, the main character, begin to panic seeing that your childhood friend has just killed herself.Since it’s a visual novel you can reset, right?Sayori is now out of the game and you enter act 2.I won’t go into… TOO much detail since I’m not sure what would be crossing the line on Quora here but basically it gets more and more twisted as you go along.Monika screws with Natsuki and Yuri’s files. They get more and more screwed up. 1/3 gameplays get the animation of Natsuki snapping her neck and running towards you with glitched eyes. Yuri becomes more and more obsessive, eventually confessing to you and stabbing herself repeatedly immediately afterwards.Then you can spend the weekend with a dead body.Fun.Eventually it’sMonika knows she’s in a game and wants only you.You end up having to delete Monika’s ‘file’ to end it all. Then you can replay the game with everyone BUT her. If you did everything correctly, Sayori will become self-aware and thank you for trying to make everyone happy.If not, she’ll become self-aware, go insane and try to take you for herself.The deeper you look into this game the worse it gets. It encourages the manipulation of files and leaves you petrified for days.Delete Monika before starting the game?Sayori becomes self-aware, goes insane, screams to “make it stop”, and hangs herself immediately.Delete Sayori before starting the game?No cutscene. Just hanging.The music also messes with you. Instruments get distorted or stop completely. When the music stops, you better prepare yourself cause something screwed up is going to happen.On the bright side, it ends with the credits playing an actually amazing song sung by Monika herself.So because of the music, story and incredibly graphic deaths, Doki Doki Literature Club is an insanely disturbing video game.*Big thanks to whoever suggested the edit (I forget the name, sorry!)",152 followers,Alex Mann,2K,2K,102.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-books-or-video-games-have-the-most-politically-complex-interesting-worlds

In this game you play in part a visual novel, but mostly you have 3D sexual interactions where you actively choose what to do to the girls.This is about the son of a rich politician who likes to molest young women and when he touched a high school student on a train ride, she just screamed for help and reported him to the police, the guy ends up in jail but only shortly as his rich politician dad got him out of jail quite fast.He now wants revenge on the 17 year old student who embarrassed him and he came up with a master plan.He will rape her and her mother and her little sister.He first rapes her little sister who is about 12 years old in a public bathroom, you actually get to fondle her during a train ride and then take her in the bathroom, i.e. the actual game play.He then moves on to the mother.He finally kidnaps both mother and sister and blackmails the teenager into a gangbang.This is not the worst, from thereon, the actual game really is starting, you choose to have sex with each of them whenever you want and rape them as you like. The objective is to break each of them, one by one, by making them enjoy the raping, so you break them little by little into anal sex, group sex, public sex, oral sex, swallowing, etc. until you break them completely and they now love you and beg you for sex, they are sex slaves and you are their master, they now love being sex slaves and crave sex all the time.Once you break all of them, they will now do whatever you tell them to do such as group sex involving each other, yes, mother-daughters sex, sister-sister sex, you can have threesomes, foursomes and even gangbangs where you call your buddies to have sex with them all.And even worse is you can knock them up and have sex with them while they have a pregnant belly, and even force them to abort the child.Very disturbing really.How do I know this?

After that it was discussing strategies with building cities in SimCity, or squad combat tactics in X-Com. We also had a Nintendo, and a Super Nintendo a few years after that came out. We would take turns playing games like Mario, Metal Gear, and a helicopter sim that I dont remember the name of anymore. This continued into my teenage years, where I now regret not spending more time with him.We also did plenty of outdoor activities. He taught me how to fish, tried to get me into golfing at a young age, and went to baseball games and practices. Looking back I think it was a good and healthy balance.My dad died unexpectedly 12 years ago when I was only 18. I'm now 30, and my wife is 4 months pregnant (yay!). One of the things I'm most excited about is being able to play games with my child, reliving those moments but this time as a dad. I miss those times with my dad the most, and can tell you they made me a better person.Keep a healthy balance with some outdoor activities, and enjoy that bonding time over video games. If the worry is on your child not figuring out solutions on their own, I'm sure you already provide guidance, but let them do the thinking and leg work until they need a hand.

It was a solid computer, and we used it for hours on end for Minecraft, Kerbal Space Program, that evolution game, I forgot what it’s called, Scrap Mechanics. For the most part, I tried to use it for video games both of us can learn from and enjoy.But then I needed the cash and I listed our very precious, very expensive, very dear computer on Craigslist.Someone messaged a few days later. “Computer still available? Can I come get it today?”I worried, as you might expect, that it would be some shady person who would leave without paying “accidentally” or who would pay but would pay but take my electronic baby and let it collect dust in the basement, less the occasional need for full graphic rendering of porn clips. I don’t know. I didn’t have a good feeling about it.But the guy who showed was very handsome and young, twenty-ish. He looked at the computer and we got to chatting. Then he told me something that took me aback. He was recently diagnosed with throat cancer and his dad wanted to buy a gaming computer, so they could play games together. His dad was the one who paid for it. His dad just wanted the chance to spend some quality time with his kid. Who was no longer a kid really, and was very sick.I was glad then for all the hours I spent trying to get my Kerbal into Orbit, to follow a map on whatever Minecraft realm. In a way, I wished I could go back and play more games with my son, instead of leaving him to it alone, for far too long.",UNKNOWN,Ernest W.

23,"It would be best to play with your child outdoors and with as much physical activity as possible. There will be plenty of time to be inside due to weather or time of day. The outdoor activity doesn't have to be sports related. It can be adventure role playing, much like the video game you describe, but get out and move.9",17 followers,Justin Choy,1.2K,0,0,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-books-or-video-games-have-the-most-politically-complex-interesting-worlds

I think the best thing you could do would be to find interesting, fun things to do that are engaging. Playing with a ball isn't it, unless there is a more complex, interesting game to it.

It sounds like your son is probably of above average intelligence and requires more intellectual stimulation from his playtime than you get from many of the ""normal"" kid toys. Maybe try some board games like mouse trap  oir operation that are quirky and engaging at the same time, and look into hobbies that would seem ""cool"" to a kid that happen outside. My father built model rockets when I was a kid, the kind that you could actually fire up into the air with fireworks-style engines, then a parachute popped out and they came back down to earth. He always took me out to the fields to fire them off and we'd often end up playing outside and such while there. Similar technical hobbies that lead, perhaps indirectly, to outside play might be necessary to get his attention.

Many people call this 'big' data and is essentially about processing data volume (see the person who said 'big data just gets bigger'). Most people still try and get rectangles out of Hadoop!The next phase of data is coming. It is about a shift in the way we think about data: breaking out of rectangles.The next phase of data is defined by 3CsChaordic (Combining the best parts of Chaos and Order). Easy way to think about this is that Rectangles are 'only order' and Hadoop is 'only chaos'. Semi-structured solutions are much more Chaordic.Consilient (literally 'Jumps together') where data from different sources can be combined and create a new valid set. Schemas block Consilience when applied to Tables, Json or Xml.Connectionist (Nodes and Edges are a good way to think of this). Essentially focusing on the connections between entities rather than the relationships between tables.So, there we have it: we are already moving beyound 'Big Data' as the 3C's come into play!","45,770 followers",Jeff Hammerbacher,1.6K,1.3K,6.1M,2014,https://www.quora.com/Newton-discovered-so-much-without-going-into-space-do-we-really-need-NASA
