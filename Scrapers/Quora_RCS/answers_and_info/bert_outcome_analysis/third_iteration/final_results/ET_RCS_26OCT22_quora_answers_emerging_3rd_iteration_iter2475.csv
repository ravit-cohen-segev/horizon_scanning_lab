It’s always worth reminding ourselves in this tech obsessed world, when we are inundated daily by breathless media stories about this AI program or that ML robot beating humans at some (usually quite boring and idealized) task that we all possess between our ears the most sophisticated computing machine ever created, one whose inner workings is still largely a mystery despite a century or more of concerted effort and hundreds of billions of dollars of funding.So, why is the “human brain considered more powerful than a computer”? As I type this reply, I’m listening to a beautiful Indian classical music recording by the Hindustani singers, Rajan and Sajan Mishra. Here’s a sample recording of theirs on You Tube, not the one I’m listening to, but it will serve to make the point. As you listen to these magnificent musicians, even if you don’t understand the lyrics or the genre of music, you can still make out the melody, the harmony, the rhythm, the sound of the drone in the background, the emotion of the singers etc. In short, our brains effortlessly unpack all this information as easily as we breathe. Yet, even with a billion GPU machines, you would not be able to extract the same level of information.Part of the magic here is that the human brain is orders of magnitude more sophisticated than the most complex deep learning network ever built, most of which use cartoon like representations like RELU gates as the basic computing unit. Here’s are some sample activation units used as the building blocks in modern deep learning networks.These are all childishly simple compared to the complexity of one single neuron in the human brain, shown below. I spent a whole semester studying the workings of a single neuron. Some researchers in neuroscience spend their entire careers on this topic. A single neuron is fiendishly complex, and its behavior has been modeled by a complex set of partial differential equations that tries to capture neuronal dynamics. Hodgkin and Huxley got the Nobel prize for their model of a single neuron.Now, here’s the kicker. We have roughly 100 billion of these neurons, and each neuron is connected to as many as a thousand other neurons in a highly structured but complex three dimensional network. The new field of connectomics is trying to accurately model the 3D structure of every neuron in the human brain and it’s a hugely challenging task, even if you restrict yourself to a simpler insect like a common housefly (which has a million neurons). Here’s the connectome of a house fly.But this is the just the beginning of the challenge. Unlike the smooth activation functions used in the toy deep learning models, which bear no resemblance to the real ones in our brains, neurons in biology are largely based on spike trains, communicating with their neighbors with what looks like a complex version of Morse code. In short, simple ideas like backpropagation used everywhere in deep learning are profoundly wrong. The brain cannot work using back propagation and this fact has been known for more than three decades.So, the hundred billion neurons in our brains are all chattering to each other in this mysterious language that we are unable to decipher. So, like the drunkard who’s looking for his car keys under a street lamp not because he lost it there, but because there’s light there, AI researchers in deep learning study cartoon models of the human brain that are simply wrong at every level. They do this out of frustration, largely because it’s too hard to model the real brain. We just don’t have good models of spike train dynamics to be useful in deep learning research, yet this is probably the single biggest reason why the brain is so efficient in terms of power consumption. The brain has more computing power than the most sophisticated super computer ever built, yet unlike these behemoths which require gigawatts of power, the brain happily runs on a few watts of power. The spike train design is the biggest reason why our brains are so efficient.Now, the mysteries of the human brain are much much deeper than the sheer number of neurons using complicated inter connectivity and spike train dynamics. The whole human body, including the brain with all its 10^{15} connections, has to be encoded in the human genome, which is about 30 billion base pairs of letters — A,T, C and G for the four amino acids that encode hereditary information. We know the genetic language really well but not well enough to know how it could possibly encode connectivity information that is billions of times larger than the bits in the genome. It’s truly a miracle. It’s like you buy a computer from Apple, but you don’t get the computer, just a tiny strip that you put in a solution when you get home, and watch as it turns into a highly sophisticated supercomputer!The mysteries of the brain only get more puzzling and more insurmountable, the deeper you dig into its workings. It turns out that as the brain develops and grows, neurons are born and move physically to their designated final location. Even more bizarre, many of them don’t survive this trip. How could this design ever work? The computing elements are created, transported and a lot don’t survive the trip.So, in short, the puzzle we are trying to figure out is how to build the most sophisticated supercomputer there is, which runs on ten watts of power, which grows from a single cell, uses complex spike train dynamics to convey information that simply rules out gradient descent type learning models, where individual computing units are a million times slower to respond to changes in input compared to those used in this iPhone on which I’m typing this answer, and yet can effortlessly understand auditory, visual, language and motor control behavior than any computer ever designed by humans.It’s the mystery to end all mysteries. If we understood the human brain, we would posses immense power, both for good, and sadly for evil as well. Perhaps that’s why nature guards her most precious secrets so carefully. Perhaps some mysteries are best left unsolved. We understand what’s happening in galaxies a billion light years from earth, can study the dynamics of black holes colliding and releasing more energy than that produced by all the trillions of stars in the observable universe. But we don’t know the process by which this porridge like substance between my ears, centimeters from my iPhone, decided to turn my thoughts into (hopefully coherent) Quora replies.Perhaps that’s as it should be. We can understand the physical universe around us, but not the mental universe inside our heads. Understanding the physical universe has given mankind colossal power, and as the number of wars, each with more destructive power than the previous ones, have shown, we have still not learned to master our instincts for wanton destruction. Imagine the power we could unleash if we understood the mental universe as well.",562 followers,Yashwant Marathe,5.6K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-human-brain-the-most-advanced-technology-on-Earth

While some parts are thought to be ""mapped out"" for us, that doesn't mean they don't work together in ways we can only imagine.The human brain is a technology in that it provides us with a complex system that is still very much unknown. It can be argued that the human brain is still a nascent technology compared to other known technologies, like fire.Even though we are starting to unravel some of the secrets of how our brains work together, one part, in particular, seems to be intentionally shrouded in mystery: the pineal gland.The pineal gland, also called the ""pineal body"", is a small cone-shaped endocrine gland in the brain, about 1 cm in length and located near the centre of the head. It produces a hormone called melatonin that regulates sleep patterns and seasonal cycles involved with visible light.This pineal gland aims to produce melatonin that works as our bodies internal clock for when we fall asleep. It does so by following natural light or day cycles which lets it know whether it's appropriate to release melatonin or not. This can be thought of as one of our innate timepieces because it helps us maintain a proper internal rhythm and other things like temperature regulation and sexual function.The pineal gland has been an essential topic of study in contemporary spirituality and holistic health movements. The point activated by the Kundalini process is at the skull base, where the enlarged medulla oblongata and anterior pituitary meet. A hole exists at the back of the head that leads into hyperspace at this location, near.It has been suggested that the pineal gland acts as a transducer for external electromagnetic frequencies, converting them into nerve signals and then to chemical-electrical signals within our brains that can create visions and other effects.New research has raised the controversial possibility that the human brain may be a nascent form of technology evolving under special conditions and combining information from many sources.According to neuroscientist Dr Jean-Pierre Changeux, a growing body of evidence concerning the function of groups of neurons in the cerebral cortex suggests that these cells possess ""collective computational power"" that may be comparable to that of computers. This property is responsible for developing intelligent behaviour, which would be impossible in a more conventional brain without it.""There's a sense in which the brain, like our computing and communication technologies, is a nascent technology that evolved from previous versions to become what we see today,"" he said. ""Our brains have been selected because of their enhanced computational power.""Changeux made his remarks while delivering the Royal Society's Vanuxem Lecture on March 16 at its headquarters in London.""This property of the brain, the fact that it can process information from multiple sources, has a lot to do with our ability to construct symbolic representations,"" he said. ""The neurons have this exciting function where they can combine multiple inputs into one output.""What is interesting about this research is that it suggests there may be a new way to think of the human brain. Instead of simply being an organ for our body, what if we could start viewing it as something more? What if the brain evolved alongside other technologies and has its form of intelligence? This credence to Dr Changeux's theory that brains are just nascent forms of technology developing under particular conditions.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-human-brain-the-most-advanced-technology-on-Earth
7,"The reason why human brain developed to be so advanced compared to any other being has to do with the existence and location of the NOTCH2NL genes.Scientists for long have been baffled for explanations to this question why human brains evolved so much over the last million years while many other beings just didn’t cut it through. The question would inevitably lead to surprising answers as our closest relative chimpanzee shared about 99% of our genome.

The question would inevitably lead to surprising answers as our closest relative chimpanzee shared about 99% of our genome. It was always going to be daunting to find out which one of the remaining 1% made 99.99% of the difference in the brain size vis-a-vis other creatures - How did human brain alone evolve with such a high cognitive abilities?Several dozens of ‘human-specific’ genes have been found in the human genome, but their role has often remained unknown. Many of these genes are thought to be non-functional or redundant and are not even appropriately annotated in genome databases. Since we share so many of our genes even with simple organisms like worms, it was concluded that genes in themselves can’t account for all of the answers we are looking for. Gene duplication may have led to outcomes like novel genes in species which resulted in outsized rapid emergence of human specific traits like increased size of brain cortex.Looking for the answer, Scientist Pierre Vanderhaeghen and his team hypothesized that NOTCH2NL genes could act as species-specific regulators of brain size. Remarkably they found that Notch2NL can expand human cortical stem cells and thereby increase the number of cortical neurons.Reason for this hypothesis is also the location of these genes: on the first chromosome, in a region that had previously been linked to disease-related changes in brain size, such as micro and macrocephaly. American scientists led by David Haussler analysed DNA of patients with these conditions and concluded that, indeed, origin of these conditions corresponds with the region where NOTCH2NL genes are located.Basically, a unique gene and its perfect location are the two accidents of nature which later evolved to the complex human brain we have today. The complex brain which is more complex than the least known regions of the deepest ocean; We each have something approaching 100 billion nerve cells – neurons – in the human brain (more than the number of stars in the Milky Way). Each of them can be connected directly with maybe 10,000 others, totalling some 100 trillion nerve connections. If each neuron of a single human brain were laid end to end they could be wrapped around the Earth twice over. All because of a small difference in what we started off with vis-a vis other beings.So next time you think of evolution, forget the Pareto’s principle or 80/20 rule. As far as evolution is concerned, it is just 0.01% which over time in millions of years which makes 99.99% of the difference in evolution - A single grain of sand among trillions which moves and brings down the entire sand castle.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-human-brain-the-most-advanced-technology-on-Earth

Given that most Jet fuels have an energy density atound 9.6 kWh/kg, such batteries would be able to supplant fossil fuels in all applications.The technology to mass produce carbon nanotubes of arbitrary length would allow us to produce both superior thin wiring, as well as materials of incredible strength, from next generation body armor to space elevator cables.Interestingly there’s some evidence that we’re close on this one; adding short nanotube filaments to water given to spiders seems to have dramatically increased the strength of their webbing.Live gene editing; the ability to alter the genome of an already living and mature creature would be hugely impactful. This would allow us do everything form cueing genetic diseases, to ordering limbs to regenerate, to rebuilding our telemeres (a part of our DNA which shields us form ageing) and even conduct superficial changes to our appearance.Developments in CRISPR this level of genetic mastery may be closer than you think.Full brain emulation starts to get into the stranger stuff. If we could fully emulate a human brain on software, we would not only be close to human immortality, but we would also have the ability to create a sort of superinteligent AI; a human mind run on a substrate which can think faster than neurons are capable of.Similarly Ai, even weak Ai in the forms of non-sentient complex algorithms could, and already are changing our lives. The algorithms suggesting files in your facebook feed, youtube selections, or Quora suggestions are already given to you by algorithms generated by other learning programs. There is no actual human who fully understand how it works. Even if we keep these algorithms highly constrained as they currently they can shape huge changes in the world (like messing with commodity prices on the stock market). And these are only going to get more advanced and widespread.",78 followers,Rajan Singh,1.5K,360,25.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-human-brain-the-most-advanced-technology-on-Earth

Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party. Because radiation from nuclear accidents is apparently scarier than way more people dying of regular pollution constantly and the total annihilation of all life on Earth as the oceans boil away.","74,721 followers",Tiny Nair,776,689,28M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-human-brain-the-most-advanced-technology-on-Earth
19,"Will the human life span be increased by improved technology in the next 1-2 decades or not?The average can be increased by reducing risk, by finding ways folks can make acute problems chronic, by using new therapies to cure chronic ailments, and so forth. That’s certainly likely over the next few decades, at least in the developed world.Then there’s the question of actually arresting or slowing aging — antigeria. That’s doable, but it involves deeper knowledge of genetic mechanisms than we have today, and of course initial trials will involve a great deal of risk. I don’t expect that so soon.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-human-brain-the-most-advanced-technology-on-Earth

This has recently hit another rise which could be cited as an example. Another argument might be that it merely deflected what was going to be a steamroller anyway though under different ideologies, economics and politics if that is considered relevant. There was and is a moral concern over human rights and how technology can become adverse.Philosophers predated both and might try to initially simplify things by motives. Science was the means to an end and now it is challenged by this. If science is after truth, is there another way to get there? Is intelligence the limiting factor? Is there a better form of it? Is the mind something that could be duplicated? And could that be tuned for all practical purposes, like toward science? Or is it all changing under them? Does it end up putting all of the attention on itself instead since it becomes the only way of knowing?Mathematicians go after axioms and come up with new domains. Sometimes that research can be applied. This has led to computational devices which run rules to see what they lead to like natural patterns.Scientists might talk about transparency or raising intelligence levels across the board. How could this approach itself be put into the terms of the method so it could tested? Or is it going to always meet failure by redefining itself so it is not objective or absolute like nature had seemed to be? Does that fall under evolution or are they independent? Or are the concerns that it will usurp measures and controls valid? If it were about health, that would be like a contraindication, so would it affect or change the species in other ways?Technology is then at stake. Who is going to be advancing it? Are there boundaries that humanity needs to maintain for its own sake? Will these systems combine? What are the chances they become autonomous? Or if they are probing by trial and error, what are the consequences? So far the truth has been that life was fairly localized, so what happens to that? Or can they only observe? Then how is that going to spell out a new tech? Or is it going to be a new form of intelligence in effect? Or do they run all of these in emulation and present them to someone as options?Look across the fields now and see which are getting early benefits. Search on machine learning news, for example, and there are announcements.
