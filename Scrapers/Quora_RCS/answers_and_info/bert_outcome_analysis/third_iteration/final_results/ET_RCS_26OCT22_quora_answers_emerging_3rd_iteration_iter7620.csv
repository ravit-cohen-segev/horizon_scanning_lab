It can also transact in a few seconds, not the 10–60 minutes required by BTC.There’s a load of videos on YouTube explaining how HBAR achieves this, and to be honest, I’m surprised it isn’t far bigger than it is.",0 followers,Glen Boston,655,71,1.7M,UNKNOWN,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-such-a-thing-as-green-mining-cryptocurrencies

There are countless blockchain startups listed across a wide-range of crypto exchanges around the world. Your ROI will greatly depend on the risk you are willing to take, and never invest what you aren’t willing to lose. Catching a great startup in its early stages is difficult, but the reward of finding a future top-200 or 300 coin is what has so many traders researching underrated projects with low marketcaps. If you can get in early, you can accumulate a large amount of coins before it goes mainstream, and profit from latecomers who suffer from a fear-of-missing-out. In these trading environments, research is your best friend, and can diminish the risk to your investment. Important factors to look for include the coin’s use-case, brand, team and community.One microcap project that I am bullish on, and have been accumulating for weeks, is VEY. They are developing the first paid-survey platform for cryptocurrency, and they are severely undervalued.Vey . ioTheir service will provide the market research industry with instant, zero-fee survey transactions, connecting survey creators and participants without a greedy third party. This is a huge upgrade, in profitability and efficiency, compared to the paid survey businesses around today. VEY is currently trading at an evaluation around $70k, and if you read up on them, you will understand that this is a tiny fraction of where they should be. VEY is one of my longterm holds.
