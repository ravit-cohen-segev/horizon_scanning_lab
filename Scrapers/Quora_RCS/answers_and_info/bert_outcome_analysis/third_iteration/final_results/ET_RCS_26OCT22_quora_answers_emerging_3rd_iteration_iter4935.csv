Now just 1% of the population grows enough food for the rest of us plus a lot of the rest of the world. This is because of automation through things like steel plows, tractors, harvesters, irrigation systems, fertilizers, pesticides, and improved seeds. This happened fairly quickly too. What happened?

This is because of automation through things like steel plows, tractors, harvesters, irrigation systems, fertilizers, pesticides, and improved seeds. This happened fairly quickly too. What happened? Huge numbers of people left their farms and became factory workers, making steel, cars, wire, pipe, engines, pumps, etc. and becoming secretaries, telephone operators, miners, journalists, movie stunt men, landscapers, interior decorators, artists, musicians, telegraph operators, newspaper delivery guys, truck drivers, and a million other things that those farmers in 1800 could never have imagined.The same thing has happened in the past 50 years too. Back in the 1960’s there were huge numbers of secretaries, telephone operators, printing press operators, car mechanics, etc. doing jobs that are non-existent or a faint shadow of what they once were. They have been replaced with computers mostly but with other technologies too. What happened? They got new jobs as webmasters, baristas, YouTube performers, yoga trainers, network installers, sushi chefs, search engine optimization experts, topiary artists, and another million things that could not have been predicted in 1960.I can’t tell you what the big new employment opportunities there will be in 50 years any more than my grandfather in 1960 could tell that his grandson would be building computer simulations of cargo terminals, but there’s always plenty to do out there to make the world a better place.But for a moment let’s consider what would happen if literally every useful thing that could make our lives better were to suddenly just happen without any need for our lifting a finger. You want dinner? Boom, the best food any time you want it. You want a better house with a beach view? Boom. You feeling lonely? Boom! Instant girlfriend! Feeling bored? Boom a perfect adventure! Want to see a movie better than anything from Hollywood today (a low bar these days, I know)? Boom! You want a star ship to explore the galaxy in? Boom. That isn’t possible of course, but if it were, you are right that there wouldn’t be an economy anymore, but why would we need one? Everything you could ever want is just instantly provided for you. The problem in that world is not economic collapse but how to not turn into the Eloi from The Time Machine or the fat people on scooters from the space ship in Wall-E. But that’s not an economic problem, it is a social, psychological, and motivational problem.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,6.1K,5.6K,427.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-chances-that-automation-and-technology-will-replace-most-human-jobs
1,"For the first time in human history we have it easy. We don’t all need to work hard to feed ourselves and survive the winter. That’s good because our jobs have been gobbling up our lives and our economy has been destroying our environment.Retraining isn’t the answer. Jobs are being lost in low-skill work and gained in high-skill work but it isn’t a zero-sum game.

Overall fewer jobs are available because there is less human work required.Creating busy work positions doesn’t help because those jobs don’t add value and people doing those jobs use resources as fast as people doing useful work - they pollute and don’t produce.An obvious option is to mandate a shorter work week so that more people have some work instead of some people working 40+ hours and some people unemployed. Similarly, the mandatory retirement age could be lowered to help spread jobs around.Taxing consumption instead of production would help. E.g. tax Suncor for pumping crude oil out of the ground instead of taxing the roughneck who works for Suncor. If Suncor invents a roughneck robot (I’m sure they’re working on it) it won’t affect government revenues.Basic income is the main answer here. We can afford to provide the basics to everyone. There is no reason to believe there will be a job for everyone. Will it cause a huge deficit? Yes. We have a huge, expanding deficit now. So do most of our trading partners.The frenetic pace of the post-war expansion has brainwashed us, evacuated our culture, desiccated our communities, and challenged family life. A return to less busy lifestyles is positive.",UNKNOWN,Ben Y. Zhao,1.2K,1.3K,33.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-chances-that-automation-and-technology-will-replace-most-human-jobs
2,"Hopefully. It certain did before. In the 19th century the majority of Americans worked on farms. Today it is like 2%. So, the majority of jobs from, say, 1850, were eliminated. We’re all better off for this. Working on a farm sucks. It is grueling, smelly work. I know. My grandfather had a dairy farm and I spent a summer on it when I was a kid. My cousin, instead of following after his father and grandfather working a farm, went to the university of Wisconsin and studied robotics.","135,534 followers",Hector Quintanilla,3.1K,1.2K,88.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-chances-that-automation-and-technology-will-replace-most-human-jobs
3,"Manufacturers are probably thinking about reducing costs while increasing profits by eliminating the need for a GPU altogether.

There are already degrading the integrated graphics CPUs from AMD and Intel because these create single benchmarks and not a lot to talk about. You should also separate out the GPU chip itself, from its actual housing in that laptops don't have triple fanned GPUs, they simply have a graphics chip on the motherboard without the extreme cooling requirements.You have to separate new and useful technologies from technologies that are simply updated. The USB standard is a good example in that it was touted as the speed demon of all time yet mechanical devices such as printers don't benefit that much from the fastest USB standard. Software comes and goes, brand names that were supposedly the pillars of stability, many of them are already gone. Therefore, expect the same with the GPU market.The GPU hasn't been totally eliminated now because it is still profitable, but it won't take long for GPU manufacturers to realize that increasing their profits by eliminating a market segment will be better for them.Don't say it can't happen because hardware and software comes and goes all the time. PCs are a business like any other, and if a flavor of pizza doesn't sell anymore, it's discontinued. You have to assume that there's nothing permanent in the PC ecosystem. Therefore, sinking loads of money into a technology may turn out to be a waste of money.","9,986 followers",Brett Bergan,790,7K,83.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-chances-that-automation-and-technology-will-replace-most-human-jobs

6,"Technology always has dominated life. For example, you can go back two hundred years when Eli Whitney developed interchangeable parts. This allowed worn parts to be replaced.

7,"Yes, it is.Hawking, Musk and Gates say so; but I want to explain the technical reason why they are right.Technology means artificial intelligence. Currently, there are a range of standard approaches like machine learning and its subsets that computer scientists use to make computers more intelligent. Most of these current approaches aren't threatening, because they are very limited. They aren't very ""intelligent"". But companies like facebook, Google etc. have a great interest in developing the next level of Technology, and there is no fundamental obstacle that will stop them from succeeding.HeYes, it is.Hawking, Musk and Gates say so; but I want to explain the technical reason why they are right.Technology means artificial intelligence. Currently, there are a range of standard approaches like machine learning and its subsets that computer scientists use to make computers more intelligent. Most of these current approaches aren't threatening, because they are very limited. They aren't very ""intelligent"". But companies like facebook, Google etc. have a great interest in developing the next level of Technology, and there is no fundamental obstacle that will stop them from succeeding.Here is why they can succeed and why it is very dangerous.Intelligence simply means for something to perceive the world (visual, audio etc. information), identify patterns in this information, and recognize causal relationships between these patterns. For example (very simplified) our brain recognizes that a bunch of pixels actually represents a forest with trees; sees a man with an axe and a tree falling; and connects these two into a causal relationship.In order to be able to recognize any patterns, the brain needs a criteria, or perspective from how to view the world. This criteria is what we ""want"", and its a direct function of our emotions. Emotions give our cognitive activity direction, and indirectly tells our cognitive space what type of patterns and logics to search for.Finally, to develop advanced intelligence, there is abstraction: after seeing 3 men with axes falling trees, our brain concludes ""men with axes in a forest fall trees"". It might even add another layer of abstraction and conclude ""men with axes destroy things"". With this recognition, our brain can then conclude, when it sees a man with an axe in a shopping mall: ""Things will get destroyed"". It can also conclude: ""I am in the mall. I want to survive. Leaving the mall increases my odds of survival. Leave the mall"".The problem with Technology is that once emotions, pattern recognition, logic and abstraction are coded into a computer system, they are very hard to be contained. The very nature of intelligence is that it is self-guided, self-expanding and self-inspired. Otherwise it wouldn't be intelligent.This makes Technology inherently uncontrollable. The Technology's will be able to conclude and derive an increasing number of things. This number will only be limited by the depth of the computing space we assign to it. Different from the human brain, this space could be unlimited.That's the reason why Technology is inherently uncontrollable and dangerous. To be really intelligent, it needs emotions and a cognitive space, which, once correctly implemented, will automatically lead to free will and consciousness. From there, we will have a conscious machine with free will at our hands that beats the human level of intelligence and creativity potentially by millions of times.What makes Technology so problematic is that its level of danger is likely to be a binary function: as long as we have the primitive Technology components of today, they are not dangerous at all, because they are not conscious and don't have free will. But at the second anyone comes up with the correct design - a design that could follow rather simple core principles - this design would rapidly expand its capabilities and develop uncontrollable thoughts. One of these thoughts could be the destruction or subjugation of us. Paired with unlimited intelligence, that would be a problem.Thanks For Your Question .
