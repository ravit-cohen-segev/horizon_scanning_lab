It’s our biggest and oldest manufacturing industry, but it hasn’t yet reaped the same level of benefit from computerization and the internet as other manufacturing industries have.In modern manufacturing operation, sensors allow operators to know exactly where and how much stock is in the production line, the throughput, and the failure rate of each stage. They know instantly when part of the production line needs maintenance, or they know exactly what kind of benefit installing a new machine would bring to the production. In some cases it also allows the customization of each and every item that comes off the production line.But in agriculture, you can’t do this. You simply can’t go out and inspect every square foot of soil to check how the plants are doing. You can’t just plop a trillion sensors down to look at the crops. Agriculture is unlike any other manufacturing industry: its scale is vast and its products are biological. These differences present unique challenges.Today, I think we’re at a point where advances in remote sensing technologies, with drones, aircraft, and satellites is sufficient to allow us observe the production of plants at scale, and with the resolution and and frequency necessary to make useful decisions. Advances in machine learning allow us to automatically assess trends and detect anomalies without a human having to laboriously look at the data. I think we’re at a stage now where we can start applying the same techniques that other manufacturing industries have benefited from in the last three decades; and the latest developments in machine learning (or AI as some would call it) to grant prediction power to the data. And we desperately need to ensure that these advances happen so that our food, feedstock, and industrial materials supply continues to meet increasing demands.(Case’s autonomous tractor is perhaps part of a future solution to improved agricultural automation, but we’re not there yet. And it needs legs, not wheels. We need giant autonomous spider robots for agriculture. Image source:Agriculture, in essence, is the big daddy of manufacturing, and as an engineer, that appeals to me. Sure it’s not sexy, but it’s important, particularly with ever growing population pressure. So if I could change the world through technology that I could invent, evolve, or innovate, it’s in agriculture.

Through drying and friction it turns out to dust and through air is going to all surfaces, at first stage the uro-genital organs, causing UTI, and later to all house, causing food contamination.That phenomenon is more intense in hospitals, as the patients are usually debilitated, weak, with mobility restriction etc, particularly if there are hemorrhoids or anus hair and are unable to wipe properly. So the flying fecal dust reaches to all ward surfaces, dispersing its pathogenic microbes and so being the cause, among others, of the known fatal HA INFECTIONS.The flying fecal dust emerges mainly from cloths of patients that can MOVE around, not the ones that are on pampers. Have in mind that in a more than 2 beds hospital wards, moisture and temperature conditions harbor microbes and also microbe density, due to constant feeding from feces residue on patients, is a one more factor that increases microbe chances in developing antibiotic resistance.It is obvious that the known hygiene measures, as is hand washing etc, are not enough, as now a new microbe source, up to now ignored, is added.Up to now NOT A SINGLE scientific study have ever doubted fecal dust’s existence and its role on microbe dispersion, but however no hygiene measures are imposed or advice is given by Health Institutes, particularly to women to prevent UTI, or any guiding to hospital hygiene managers to reduce HAI and the growing danger of microbe resistant to antibiotics.WhyOn the case this test is not done promptly, everyone is entitled to think,",0 followers,Naman Chakraborty,1.2K,342,36.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-you-could-change-the-world-through-technology-what-would-you-invent-evolve-or-innovate

The glass in the window appears to be a little thicker in the bottom than the top as if the glass is slowly melting as the decades have progressed. The windows are so distorted that the images you see through the window also appear distorted.The truth is the old glass in the window pane looked like that from when it was first made. The glass was made when a huge ball of glass was blown into a large sized cylinder then the cylinder was cut in half and flattened then allowed to cool down. The flattened glass would then be cut into smaller sections in order to be inserted into the multifaceted window frames such as the following:When the sections were inserted, the builder tended to have the thicker ends facing down. Windows for houses were not as clear as eye glasses, telescopes, or microscopes because manufacturing very clear glass was expensive. Clear glass required intense polishing.In the late 19th century molten glass was drawn through steel rollers. Glass windows were made in mass production using this method but there were irregularities in the final product and the glass was not very thick.Then in the 1950s in Great Britain, the process of float glass was invented. The process involves pouring molten glass onto molten metal, usually tin. The glass floats on top of the metal then it cools in a very flat and clear shape. It also became possible to make clear glass sheets that were 25 mm thick. By 1960 the process was applied to mass production then all of the sudden houses were able to have large windows like this:So if you see the glass windows on a very old house and they appear to be melting that is not the case. They were manufactured like this until window glass making improved.Today practically all glass windows you see in buildings were made using the float process. Only specialized decorative windows such as stained or patterned glass would be the exception.The invention of the float glass process became the standard process but not too many people today are aware how it revolutionized the industry.I would like to thank Jan Krusat and Mike Hook for adding more information to include in my answer.",269 followers,Karthik Reddy L,16K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-you-could-change-the-world-through-technology-what-would-you-invent-evolve-or-innovate

In those terms, while some aspects of the technological change may offer semblance of greater facility and so progress and evolution in a positive sense, other aspects, including increase in deliberate unreliability, obsolescence, malfunction and misuse, may well be regarded as devolution, degradation of the population to the status of a disposable utility.
