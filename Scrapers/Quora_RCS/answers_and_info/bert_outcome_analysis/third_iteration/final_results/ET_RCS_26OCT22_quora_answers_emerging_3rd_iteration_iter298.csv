The effects on the ocean ecosystem are already being felt because of how many species have dropped with an average of 90% reduction in population with some species reaching a reduction of 99%.

Sharks maintain the health of coral reefs, a healthy reef is one in which there is alot of apex predators who are hungry, and the smaller fish living in fear and breeding rapidly. The “perfect” reef with only a few predators and a massive population of not scared smaller fish is how reefs end up in poor health and get destroyed.https://oceana.org/sites/default/files/reports/Predators_as_Prey_FINAL_FINAL1.pdf","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/With-all-the-advanced-technology-and-knowledge-we-possess-today-why-have-they-not-developed-an-effective-shark-repellent
