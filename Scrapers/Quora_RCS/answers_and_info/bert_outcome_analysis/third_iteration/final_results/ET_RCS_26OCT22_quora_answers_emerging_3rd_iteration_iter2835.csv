Her name was Elspeth, and because she lived in a little cottage with her cat, all the people of the nearby village believed her to be a witch.She was not a witch, but a prophet—a seer who, in her crystal ball, could see far into the future. Fearing that she would not be believed if she told the villagers of her visions, she made up rhymes that encapsulated their message, and taught those rhymes to the children.One day, in her crystal ball, she saw a vision of an ugly little fat boy who would one day be known as Donald Trump.She saw that, in a land beyond the ocean, in a time beyond the present, there would be a great nation. Many people would live in that land and it would prosper.But there would come a time of hardship. Wicked people would exploit the poor and would grow fat on their labours while many of the poor lost their homes and their employment. Vast areas of the land were turned the colour of rust, and the people grew restless.The princes of that land belonged to two great houses, the Donkeys and the Elephants, yet neither could restore prosperity to these people. While they were wise enough to see how the problem could be solved, they were afraid to anger the dukes and the barons who supported their houses with money. So they did nothing and the people in those rust areas suffered.Then a champion arose, a land-owner, a demagogue! He was a man of poor character and saw his opportunity to become even more wealthy and powerful, so he told the people that he would make their land great again.The rust people, desperate now, for they had received no help from the great houses of the Donkey and the Elephant, believed him. They rallied behind him and made him their king.Alas! it was to no avail. The king sat on his Resolute throne in the Oval Palace where he plotted and schemed, sometimes even collaborating with his country’s enemies.Little by little the people despaired as they realised that their new king had even less regard for their plight than the two great houses that preceded him. But then, there came a glimmer of light. Just two years after he was admitted to the Oval Palace, the House of Donkey won ascendancy over the House of Elephant, and very rapidly began to expose his crimes.The fat man was brought to justice, his power crumbled, and the government of that land returned to its previous state. Alas, the rust people were forgotten and things continued as they had for decades as the rich grew richer and the poor grew poorer.This is the rhyme that Elspeth wrote that predicted such dire times:Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,","36,839 followers",Sylvain Saurel,1K,6.2K,265.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-aliens-offered-President-Trump-advanced-technology-in-exchange-for-a-few-million-free-range-humans-would-he-accept-the-deal

There will hardly be any partial differential equations  or tensor analysis or advanced calculus to study, unless you become an academician and researcher and delve into theory and new methods of analysis like the Finite Element Analysis which was quite a rage with Academicians in the sixties and early seventies and which gave a boost to the study of Matrices. Earlier the analysis of plates and shells required advanced math. So in that sense, the academic burden on you during your undergraduate studies will be less. One civil engineering friend once told me jokingly that after being in the field for a decade, he found that all the math he required was the ability to count simple numbers, and multiply and divide them.A lot of Civil Engineering is learned from being in the field and from experience.Your knowledge will never get outdated. Unlike those who enter the software profession, where their expertise in any skill set is likely to get outdated in a few years and where they are constantly under threat from those half a decade or two younger, Civil engineering is like Medicine and Law where with each passing year  you add another layer of experience and become even more sought after and looked up to by the younger generation. The best surgeon in a hospital is not the young doctor who has just finished his internship. The lawyer who argues the cases of large companies in the supreme court is not the young brilliant young boy who just passed out of National Law school. But a high tech software company, gets most of their work done not by grey haired veterans in the company but by youngsters in their mid or early thirties who have the right combination of youth and experience and the latest software skills.My teachers told me that the best book on civil engineering is nature. He advised me that when I travel by train, I must look out of the window and observe (not just see) everything around me. At the railway station, look at the roof while standing below on the platform and see how the roof members are configured. Observe the steel truss bridges and feel the thrill of going into a dark tunnel . At construction sites, don't just see a mess of concrete, stones, steel bars and cement bags. Rather 'observe' what is happening there and ask  and find out ""why"". A lot of what happens at site during execution is not to be found in text books. Even now, I am fascinated by some awesome structures. I see grand temples (like the Madurai Meenakshi temple) The Taj Mahal  and wonder how they built them, without Autocad/cranes/steel/cement.My heart swelled with pride when I first saw and walked along the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.Conclusion: Civil Engineering is not hard, and neither is it easy.

Chemistry started as alchemy; astronomy from as astrology; Pythagoreans laid down some fundamental concepts for mathematics.A more moderate estimation would be to note that sometimes science has a rocky start. One could say that psychologists are the magicians of modern “science”. And by paying attention to how this fledgling field develops, I think that one could see a parallel with other mature sciences, as they might have come into being; and maybe how a scientific discipline could retrofit it’s history, to ascribe it to older origins. For example, the field of psychology has dug into religious rituals for tools. Psychology is in it’s tweens (in my humble opinion), from dosing folks with LSD and interpreting Rorschach blots to hypnosis and neuro linguistic programming, their tenacious method of learning skills and discarding them keeps them grifty. And I imagine that eventually they will change the name from Psychology to something more mature… like psychiatrics, or something. And tales of psychologists will be the stuff of lore.And it occurs to me that older concepts such as, magic crystals (like the transistor), crystal balls (or any other device with a screen), magic wands (or remote controls), love potion (ecstacy or similar pharmaceuticals), spells (Alexa, playNow when I count backward from 3, you will obey my every command. 3, 2, 1.DON’T upvote this answer (reverse psych)!",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,520,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-human-behaviors-are-still-relatively-primitive-considering-how-far-we-have-advanced-technologically
