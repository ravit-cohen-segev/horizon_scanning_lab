Perhaps if Microsoft had included an HD-DVD player in the 360 (and not try to sell an expensive attachment),By the time of the XBox One, Microsoft had converted to Sony’s Blu-Ray system. DVDs were obsolete when it came to video games, especially when many games started reaching over 20 gb later in the PS3’s life. File sizes were large on the PS4 and Xbox One. They just keep getting bigger with the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.In general, digital downloads, whether tv shows, movies, or video games have become the norm. Why have a bunch of boxes cluttering your living room when it can be all downloaded onto a single device?

1,"Blu-ray disks are an independent storage medium that does not require any type of networking to function, so I can’t imagine any type of networking service replacing independent media.The other problem with streaming services is that their content is not permanent, so you might be able to watch specific movies in 2019, but in 2020 those movies might be gone. With a static blu-ray discs you have permanent access to the content you own, and you can watch them anywhere in the world.","9,984 followers",Brett Bergan,994,7K,83.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Will-streaming-video-totally-replace-DVD-and-Blu-Ray-in-the-next-decade

Once they sense a nearing neighbor, the growing process halts, ensuring that light can penetrate the canopy and photosynthesis continue.Another possible explanation is that this is a defense mechanism against leaf-eating insects. The gaps mean bugs wouldn't be able to reach other trees, impeding their spread.The next time you're out walking through the forest, take a moment to look above you and you might be pleasantly surprised by what you find.Edit 1: Thanks Robert Taylor for the correction.Edit 2: Thank you all for your love, affection, and kind comments.",241 followers,Sonali Kerketta,22.4K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/Will-streaming-video-totally-replace-DVD-and-Blu-Ray-in-the-next-decade

If we could teach machines to do the same, they would learn exponentially faster and apply that learning more effectively.Transfer learning is a very hot topic in AI research right now, so I expect major breakthroughs in the next few years. I think this may be sufficient to achieve artificial general intelligence, but even if not, it will dramatically extend the range of tasks that machines can accomplish.","220,553 followers",Franklin Veaux,586,47.3K,782.4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-little-known-upcoming-technology-that-you-see-being-massive-in-the-future-like-the-internet-cell-phones-streaming-etc

But they would have an abundance of material on Earth, especially of carbon, which would likely be the building blocks of such an assemblers. If you were carrying a jar of them and tripped and they spilled out, and they had no limit, they would quickly devour the entire earth with no way of stopping them.But here is where things get interesting: These tiny robots would have the ability to construct molecules from atoms, giving them the ability to produce amazing materials like graphene, cubes of apple, and even brain material.With advanced nanotechnology in the form of self-replicators, the entire world would experience a revolution. Think for a second about what wouldn’t change in the face of machines that can produceProduction jobs would cease. The price of every item ever created would be lowered massively. Supercomputers and experiments regarding brain material would become almost commonplace. Terraforming other planets would take years if not months.

11,"Yes and no…When the guys at Nintendo made the first Mario Kart, they did their research by going to a go kart place and played and played go karts. They did this so they can feel what a real go kart felt like.They came to a realization that if they make their game too realistic, it won't be fun anymore. So basically, we got Mario Kart which isn't realistic not because we don't have the technology to make it more realistic, but because it focuses on fun rather than realism.

If we make games too realistic, they won't be fun anymore.So in games, game developers purposely remove the portions that aren't fun and exaggerate the stuff that makes it fun :).In 1995, a company developed “Desert Bus.” Its a driving simulator for the Sega Genesis. You drive a bus from Arizona to Las Vegas for several hours (as it realistically takes hours to get to Las Vegas). The road is mostly clear, and the bus doesn't move at a racing pace, as most buses realistically should.So yes, this one became realistic in the sense that it takes several hours to drive to the destination and in real driving, there is nothing really noteworthy or exciting in this route. Needless to say, this has been voted as the worse video game in many websites.So yes, we have the technology to make video games realistic, but it might remove the fun out of the games.Realistic “video games” do exist. They are very prominent in the airline industry, where airlines use them to train their pilots. These are called “simulators.”They are so realistic that playing these can count as real flying hours. But they aren't fun for most of us. I mean, first you have a really complicated control panel with all sorts of confusing buttongs, levers, and panels. Then you will have to set a course and stay in course for around 6 hours with nothing particularly noteworthy happening most of the time. It's not fun.There is a car driving version of these simulators used by driving schools and for driving certifications too.There are also versions of these which simulate large ships which are used by schools that train people who work in ships.I've read that the US military is also developing or also using a video game combat simulators to train soldiers.These video games are much more realistic than the ones on your game consoles or PCs. But they aren't fun to play. They don't have exciting music and sound effects, they don't come with exciting mission scenarios, they don't have extra lives, no high scores, etc.So the games that you get in your consoles and PCs removed the boring aspects of the real thing and exaggerated the stuff that make gaming fun. This is why you don't get realistic video games at home. If ever you did, it would might as well be voted as one of the worse, just like Desert Bus.By the way…There is also the reverse incidence when the real stuff becomes closer to video games…Image credits:Here the US Navy discovered that instead of buying a multimillion submarine controller from Lockheed Martin, they can just connect the sub to an Xbox controller to control it. They found that since the soldiers are already accustomed to playing video games, they were also much more familiar and learned to control the sub much more easily using the game controller. So yeah, instead of the video game becoming more realistic, let's make the real stuff more video gamey.",UNKNOWN,Adrian J.

Act 1 is pretty innocent and expected, it’s an anime-style dating simulator visual novel where you are welcomed into the literature club at your highschool by 4 beautiful anime girls- Sayori, Yuri, Monika and Natsuki.Sayori is your childhood friend and very upbeat and positive. She always puts a smile on people’s faces.Yuri is a more quiet, timid girl who loves reading and writing. Her poems are usually very symbolic and she tends to like darker themes.Monika is… just Monika. She’s the club president and seems nice enough but strangely, doesn’t get her own route.Natsuki is a small tsundere type girl who likes baking and cute things, though she’ll never admit it.Love these girls? Good! Now watch them all die horrible painful deaths.Sayori’s death is first. You learn one night that she has horrible depression and has had it her entire life. She only wants others to smile. You can confess your love to her if you so choose. The next morning, you decide to let her sleep and walk to school without her. After seeing Sayori’s newest poem, you realize you should probably go check on her.(Sayori’s latest poem, “Get Out of my Head”.You walk into her house to see her dead, hanging from the ceiling. Her lifeless body dangles and you, the main character, begin to panic seeing that your childhood friend has just killed herself.Since it’s a visual novel you can reset, right?Sayori is now out of the game and you enter act 2.I won’t go into… TOO much detail since I’m not sure what would be crossing the line on Quora here but basically it gets more and more twisted as you go along.Monika screws with Natsuki and Yuri’s files. They get more and more screwed up. 1/3 gameplays get the animation of Natsuki snapping her neck and running towards you with glitched eyes. Yuri becomes more and more obsessive, eventually confessing to you and stabbing herself repeatedly immediately afterwards.Then you can spend the weekend with a dead body.Fun.Eventually it’sMonika knows she’s in a game and wants only you.You end up having to delete Monika’s ‘file’ to end it all. Then you can replay the game with everyone BUT her. If you did everything correctly, Sayori will become self-aware and thank you for trying to make everyone happy.If not, she’ll become self-aware, go insane and try to take you for herself.The deeper you look into this game the worse it gets. It encourages the manipulation of files and leaves you petrified for days.Delete Monika before starting the game?Sayori becomes self-aware, goes insane, screams to “make it stop”, and hangs herself immediately.Delete Sayori before starting the game?No cutscene. Just hanging.The music also messes with you. Instruments get distorted or stop completely. When the music stops, you better prepare yourself cause something screwed up is going to happen.On the bright side, it ends with the credits playing an actually amazing song sung by Monika herself.So because of the music, story and incredibly graphic deaths, Doki Doki Literature Club is an insanely disturbing video game.*Big thanks to whoever suggested the edit (I forget the name, sorry!)",105 followers,Lyana Shah,933,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-anticipated-future-technology-for-video-games
