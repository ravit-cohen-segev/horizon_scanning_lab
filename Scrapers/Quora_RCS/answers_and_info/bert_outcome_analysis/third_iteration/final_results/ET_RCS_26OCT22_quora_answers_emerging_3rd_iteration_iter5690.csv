2,"I would like to add just a few thoughts to all the other excellent answers here. In 2001, when I was shooting a $2,000,000 US budget film, We were quoted $150,000 for a good sound track. With the right people, we did it for just over $100,000. Today, we could do it for $30,000.As far as historical precedent in other areas, in 1995, the computer you really wanted cost $4,000 US.

Now, advancements and equipment specifically for phone-based filmmaking may democratize film even further by allowing phone users to get the same, high-production-value feel you'd normally only get with expensive camera equipment. If it's hard to imagine an entire, feature-length movie shot on a phone, don't worry—it's already happening. Just look at the Sundance hit Tangerine.Digital Re-creationCreative editing and the careful application of technology have been used for post-mortem performances plenty of times before (just look at Tupac Shakur's appearance at Coachella in 2012 or Oliver Reed in Gladiator). That said, the ability to digitally re-create faces, bodies and even dialogue is experiencing some dramatic improvements. Digital effects have progressed to the point where it is possible to create a stunningly lifelike facsimile of just about anyone. While this ability represents a tremendous technological advancement for film and stage performances, it does raise several moral and ethical dilemmas. Not all performers are comfortable with continuing to make appearances post-mortem, extras are concerned that the ability to digitally create people will cause them to lose work to cheaper digital puppets, and we may no longer be able to rely on the truth of video evidence.Virtual RealityWhile current 3D technology allows for a more immersive, exciting film experience, virtual reality is poised to be the wave of film's future. With new projects like Two Eyes VR, it's possible to create a finished product that utilizes full 360° recording to allow us to watch films the same way we see the natural world. Like any new advancement, however, the potential widespread adoption of VR does come with a downside—not every viewer can tolerate a virtual reality environment for the length of the average feature film, so more conventional cameras may not be going the way of the dodo just yet.DronesBefore long, award-winning cinematography might be courtesy of an algorithm. Drones are already pretty great at capturing shots that are difficult, if not impossible, for a regular cameraman to get. Now, imagine the mobility of a drone combined with an algorithm that allows it to autonomously avoid obstacles and employ different filming techniques. Not only will drones be able to go where regular cameras can't, but they'll also know how to maintain the framing of aerial shots with little input needed from the ground.Algorithmic Video EditingDigital editing is one of the most tedious, if important, aspects of producing a polished, finished film. Right now, MIT researchers are developing ways to help automate and streamline the process. Facial recognition technology has already improved by leaps and bounds in just the past few years, but computers may soon be able to follow scripts, automatically label every clip, and apply jump cuts and other editing techniques to enhance the feel of a scene. While nobody wants video editing to take more time and effort, it does raise some interesting questions about the concept of art in filmmaking—can a film still be artfully made if computers are programmed to handle the technical parts?Past advances like green screens, animation, and camera stabilization allowed filmmakers to bring their creations to life in ways that their forebears could only dream of. Now, modern advancements are largely geared toward streamlining the editing process and improving the availability of the","246,862 followers",Dushka Zapata,2.9K,8.5K,232.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-new-technologies-in-film-production-equipment-software-etc-that-are-emerging-now-or-in-the-next-few-years

Yesterday the multi-page websites were popular, today the trend for simplicity brought single-page apps back on the top, so I'll tell you a couple tips aboutProgressive Web ApplicationsThe world first heard about progressive web apps in 2015. The next year we met the pioneers of this technology, and in 2017 progressive Web Applications seem to have become the major competitor of native mobile apps.Progressive web appsOnline customer support2016 was the year of chatbots. 2018 will be the year of helpful chatbots. Since there are thousands of bots out now, the quality of their services will be the next web development trend.The prediction is that 85% of all customer interactions will proceed without human assistance till 2020.A customer service chatbot becomes a must on almost every website. Whether you are selling electronics, crocheted toys or software development services, you should have a chatbot.Static websitesYou definitely remember the concept of a static website from the early years of the World Wide Web. All the first websites on the Internet were static.But then the era of dynamic websites began.Websites became more functional and easier to update even for people with no technical background. At the same time, the development process became more complicated, as the extended functionality required communication with the server, so backend development got involved. Modern CMSs are the actual dynamic websitesNowadays, the web is returning to its roots. Static websites are becoming the web development trend of 2018 again.Single-page websitesAnother web development trend for simplicity is single-page websites. This solution allows putting all the content onto one long scrollable page, removing any clutter.One-page websites have a bunch of advantages. They don’t challenge the visitor with complex navigation, multi-level menu, and tons of text. The essential information is all on one page. The user only has to scroll to it.Of course, the use-cases of single-pagers are limited. This type of website will not suit e-commerce projects and blogs. At the same time, businesses can significantly benefit, presenting their services in a simplified and more engaging manner.Push notifications for websitesMobile apps notifications turned out to be a highly efficient means of user re-engagement. And recently this idea has been implemented for websites and is becoming new web development trend.The workflow looks quite simple: the user visits a website and is offered to enable push notifications. The user will then be notified of any changes on the website (like a new blog post or a private message), even after he has closed the tab with that website.The major benefit of such a technology is obvious - you can keep the user engaged without big efforts.Flash to HTMLIn 2010 Steve Jobs published hisThe major weakness of this technology is the incompatibility with mobile devices. An enormous amount of traffic is lost just because of the outdated technology.Motion UISimplicity is the trend in recent years. This is also true for web design. Users are already tired of crazy GIFs and flashing ads, that’s why websites with moderate design get more appreciation.At the same time, sophisticated motion UI is becoming more popular. Animations allow to add more style and enable you to distinguish your website from the thousands of others with the static UI.There are several ways to add some life to your minimalistic website. Consider page header transitions, nice hovers, animated charts, background animations and modular scrolling. These and many other elements may make your web presence much more enjoyable for users. The true artwork!JavaScript - Angular 2 and Angular 4JavaScript is the number one programming language for web applications. With dozens of JS-related technologies already existing and still in development, it will even strengthen its positions. The highly anticipated release of the last years Angular 2 becomes highly appreciated in modern web development.We met Angular 2 in 2016. It is a complete rewrite of the AngularJS framework. The main advantages are improved modularity, app architecture scalability,PHP 7.x - Laravel 5.xPHP remains the popular choice for website backend development. This programming language has improved its positions even further after the release of version 7.x. The latest update of the PHP framework Laravel 5.x is a recognized web development trend in 2018.Laravel is the most popular open-source PHP web framework. All the benefits of it can be fully experienced on dynamic websites with complicated backend.Laravel offers ready solutions for complex tasks. The variety of existing packages makes the development process faster and more reliable. Regular updates ensure that the framework complies with the current needs of the website owners and the requirements of the time.Also I decided to describe the anti-trends of the year as well.

This dramatically affects both quality and efficiency.You can’t run a technological revolution on the power of pretend. China gets away with it because they mostly steal the technology they have from other countries or force the companies who want to sell there to hand them their schematics, which they have a right to do if they want, I don’t dispute that.That’s not a basis for innovation. It will get them caught up, and good for China, it clearly works, but it won’t make them a world leader in tech innovation unless they turn it around and start producing domestic R&D at a large scale.When India and China reach full technological parity with Europe, they would need to surpass European technology, and prevent it from spreading back to Europe, in order to actually leave European companies behind, and make them uncompetitive.I don’t see that happening.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-new-technologies-in-film-production-equipment-software-etc-that-are-emerging-now-or-in-the-next-few-years
