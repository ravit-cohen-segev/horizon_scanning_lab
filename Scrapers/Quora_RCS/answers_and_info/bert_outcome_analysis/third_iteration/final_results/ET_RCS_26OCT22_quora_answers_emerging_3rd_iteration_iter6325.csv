1,"Yes. That started with the discovery of fire and the technology of cooking. Cooking releases more nutrients from food, enabling larger, more nutrient-hungry brains.

However, two things you need to bear in mind when confronting a fox…never corner him..most foxes will change from what you see above..to..In an instant. They don't want confrontation but do so at your peril. Secondly foxes are very quick and very agile, if it's a hungry fox with cubs to feed she will sink those fangs into you and when she does she will send you to hospital.

9,"Original Question: Is it true that humans almost went extinct?Yes, it’s quite true, not once but twice.The first time was around 150,000 years ago during what’s catchily called the Marine Isotope Stage 6 period (named in part because of analysing oxygen isotopes from deep-sea sediment samples).

Basically, it was a specific type of ice age when not only did the polar caps and glaciers around the world expand, but deserts did too, due to the atmosphere effectively having moisture sucked out of it by the ice.The atmosphere became very dry right across the world, but from our perspective, this affected significant parts of central, eastern and southeastern Africa where, at the time, all known humans lived. It’s estimated that the human population at this time could have dropped down to under 1,000 people.The second near-extinction event was around 70,000 years ago following the eruption of a Sumatran volcano called Toba. Rather, it wasn’t just an eruption but it was a super-eruption, where so much ash and gasses are thrown into the atmosphere that their environmental effects threaten life.It’s estimated that the Toba super-eruption ejected roughly 10,000 times more ash and gas than the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption did and was big enough to significantly dim the sun globally for up to 6 years, resulting in worldwide cooling and a massive dying of vegetation from both cold and poor light. This again brought the human population down, perhaps to somewhere between 1,000 and 5,000 people.This was also the time that early humans began their migration out of Africa and around the world, it’s believed because once the ecosystem had stabilised following the eruption a ‘green corridor’ right the way up the east side of Africa and along the Nile Valley opened up, enabling our ancient ancestors to cross what had formerly been an impassable desert.","284,852 followers",James Altucher,992,878,91.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-are-human-beings-going-to-evolve-going-forward-when-we-have-no-necessity-to-do-anything-due-to-technology

Alice borrows some money from Bob and Bob writes it on a piece of paper signed by Alice. After some days Alice denies the existence of such document and claims that Bob has forged that piece of paper. Bob would now find it difficult to prove that Alice actually owes him Money.In this example Alice and Bob are two nodes.Now assume the same scenario, but among a society. So there are ’k’ pair of people transacting with each other. And the only proof that each pair has, is that piece of paper. Looking at this scenario, one person, Kate comes up with a solution. She suggests maintaining a common notebook of transaction for entire society. She designates town hall to be the place where every exchange takes place. In the common notebook, every pair writes the transaction and then the notebook is kept safely. People rejoice and accept Kate as their leader.That notebook can be called aBut one day, somebody spills wine on the notebook. This makes the notebook illegible. Taking the advantage of this situation, Alice again denies taking money from Bob.This is the problem databases face -Irritated by this problem, Kate comes up with another solution. She suggests maintaining multiple notebooks. She chooses some trustworthy people from the society and gives them a notebook each. Now every time a transaction or exchange takes place between two people, Kate instructs some of those trustworthy people to mention the transaction in their notebooks. So the data is repeated in the notebooks. Now, even if one notebook is destroyed, chances are that all the data regarding transactions are still present in the combination of other notebooks.This is aBut next day, another problem arises. Kate has a friend named Bert who owes a lot of money to some people in the society. He asks Kate for help and she agrees to help him. She instructs all the people with the notebooks to remove the entries where Bert received money. Now Bert doesn’t owe any money based on the notebooks.This is theWhen the people from the society come to know of it, they remove Kate from the leadership.So, well. This is the easiest example I can think of to explain Blockchain. Blockchain is a decentralized, peer to peer, immutable storage network which is censor free and regulator free because of the absence of one single controlling entity. Every transaction that is written is voted upon by a majority of nodes and changing something which was written before in the chain is computationally very difficult.","31,157 followers",Phillip Remaker,1.7K,11K,78.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-are-human-beings-going-to-evolve-going-forward-when-we-have-no-necessity-to-do-anything-due-to-technology
