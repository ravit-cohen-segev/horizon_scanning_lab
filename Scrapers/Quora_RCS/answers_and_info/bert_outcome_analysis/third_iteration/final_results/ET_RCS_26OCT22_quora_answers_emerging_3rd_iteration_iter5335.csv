Yes your question is genuine it offcourse takes away few jobs but it will create new jobs too.When computer was introduced initially, this same questions was bubbling around but result is present at everyone higest number of jobs is currently in services sector.According to me emerging technologies only change nature of jobs but not take away jobs.If you want to read more about emerging technology and it's applications you can search TECHNOLZIA in Google and refer to multiple articles on this SITE.",UNKNOWN,Ben Y.

1,"I feel compelled to answer this question, because I disagree with most of the answers here.The common answer here seems to be: yes it will kill jobs, but only the jobs low on the food chain, and it will create more jobs to at least offset the jobs it does kill.I disagree. I think AI will kill jobs, and over time, AI might kill most “jobs” as we know them. I think that people are somewhat complacent in regard to the economic impact of AI, and will likely be ill-prepared for the changes we have to adapt to in the not-so-distant future.First, let's start with the comparisons to machinery and autoI feel compelled to answer this question, because I disagree with most of the answers here.The common answer here seems to be: yes it will kill jobs, but only the jobs low on the food chain, and it will create more jobs to at least offset the jobs it does kill.I disagree.

I think that people are somewhat complacent in regard to the economic impact of AI, and will likely be ill-prepared for the changes we have to adapt to in the not-so-distant future.First, let's start with the comparisons to machinery and automation. They did indeed put factory workers out of work. In that respect, I agree AI today is similar in many applications, replacing workers who have less specialized skills, perhaps call center operators, office assistants (in a limited extent), and maybe soon, taxi drivers and truck drivers. But I would argue that AI is fundamentally different from machinery or most of the other analogies commonly made when answering this question, because AI is growing and is unlikely to stop growing. It's growing in breadth (of applications and industries), in geographic and economic scope, and in power (it's capacity to address increasingly complex tasks). A more fitting analogy would be machinery in an automobile plant that not only made the parts one day, but then learned how to assemble them the week after, and then how to design cars a year later.I think that there is little that is out of reach for advanced AI of the future. Let's leave the question of the AI singularity alone for now. Instead, I think that deep learning efforts at Google and elsewhere are making AI systems learn faster and faster, with a growing rate of acceleration. Advanced AI can now address increasingly complex tasks including medical diagnosis, stock market trading, weather prediction and human behavioral modeling. Very soon, it will be able to take the place of certain types of teachers, and find a role in education. It can already deal with complex systems in software and mathematics, and seems to be only limited in applications that require interactions with the physical world (sensors are still imperfect), and with people.So without projecting too far into the future, we can ask the question, what jobs will NOT be killed by AI? Jobs that involve labor are already (or soon to be) replaced. Jobs that require logical reasoning are being replaced, albeit at a slower rate. What are the qualities that humans have that cannot be captured by AI? Perhaps creativity, emotional responses? So perhaps researchers in academia will survive longer than most, and artists (though AI stylistic mimicry is already quite impressive and their results enjoyable), and counselors/psychologists/case workers, and decision makers like CEOs who cannot be predictable or error prone. And hopefully software engineers and algorithm designers who develop AI systems.This leaves a very, very small portion of today's jobs intact. Many say: we just need to train people to fill higher level jobs created by AI, e.g. Programmers, ML researchers. But this is no easy feat. The US educational system is struggling to meet the demands created by advanced technology today. This failure is in part responsible for the economic divide plaguing the country today. The challenge of educating the public for a job market that is both decreasing in scope and increasing in complexity, is nothing we've ever faced before.I am far from original in this opinion. But if I had to guess, I would say that AI will put far more people out of work than we can (re)train in time. That will have significant economic repercussions as corporations seeking to minimize cost will do so at the cost of rising unemployment. There will need to be dramatic changes in social policies in order to avert large scale economic disaster, first dramatic rises in minimum wage, then eventually some type of universal income/welfare. It's the kind of change that requires significant leadership in our government, something that seems woefully absent today.",726 followers,Prashant Saikia,7.4K,349,1.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Will-emerging-technologies-take-away-job-opportunities
2,"These jobs were replaced by computers; robots so primitive they didn’t even have arms and legs. OK the automobile plants used actual robots.Expect the jobs that will be taken over first by computers to be those jobs that don’t require dexterity or moving around, jobs likeAfter that, it’s “everybody”.","135,544 followers",Hector Quintanilla,3.1K,1.2K,88.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Will-emerging-technologies-take-away-job-opportunities
3,"If the locals wouldn't get the job even if foreigners are removed from the country, would you still call it stealing? What job would an average American that didn't study STEM in college get? I'm sure there are plenty of McDonald's jobs available, so this complaining can't be about that.Honestly, if someone complains to me about me stealing their job, I'd just ask them, “Oh really...",0 followers,Laxman Lokhande,634,116,11.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Will-emerging-technologies-take-away-job-opportunities
4,"The experience curve for conventional (flat plate) solar power has been going down rapidly and continues to do so: this is a combination of new technology, supply chain evolution, product design and manufacturing technology. The trouble with ‘emerging’ technologies is that they emerge i.e. they start with an early adoption phase where they’re barely noticeable and if they’re sufficiently advantageous and manufacturing technologies also ‘emerge’ to support them they become common but there’s also a chance that they fizzle, even when showing early promise, or are just over-run by yet another emeThe experience curve for conventional (flat plate) solar power has been going down rapidly and continues to do so: this is a combination of new technology, supply chain evolution, product design and manufacturing technology.

You have to be old to remember when encapsulant discoloration and delamination and high prices for ‘white’ glass were problems yet to be dealt with but then how many panels you could batch in a laminator and how little time at pressure would work (in short, how many Watts worth of laminates a machine could produce per hour) were also something to dealt with. Somewhere, in chemistry labs someone was playing with polymer chemistries that would yield ‘superior’ laminating films but until they were proven and available in quantity at a ‘reasonable’ price, they weren’t even thought of as emerging technology.Anyway, here’s a few guesses:","3,671 followers",William Mook,1K,9.3K,12.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Will-emerging-technologies-take-away-job-opportunities
5,"The KEY technology that would make it all work (as well as unlock several other renewable generation technologies, plus viable electric transport systems, and others) would be a practical, scalable, energy-dense, economically feasible way to store electricity.THAT is the missing piece of this, and several other puzzles. Batteries aren’t good enough, and can’t even possibly *become* good enough, to solve this issue — we need almost an order of magnitude improvement in our ability to store electricity.",78 followers,Mike Hillsgrove,1.5K,4.2K,1.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Will-emerging-technologies-take-away-job-opportunities
