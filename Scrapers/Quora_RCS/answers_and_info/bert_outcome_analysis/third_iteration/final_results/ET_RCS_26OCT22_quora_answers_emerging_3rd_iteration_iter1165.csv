This represents 14 billion tons of CO2 per year entering the atmosphere. 6 billion tons enter the ocean and change water pH by increasing CO3 in the ocean. The balance, 20 billion tons, ends up in plant material and isn’t harmful.So, we must cut our CO2 emissions by half without causing the economy to crash.Now we are running short on oil. We have been in a covert war against the world to maintain control over the remaining oil since 1963.We need to ignore the needs of the oil and gas businesses and create an alternative energy source adequate to our industrial and environmental needs.This is supplied most simply by burning hydrogen instead of hydrocarbon fuels in stationary thermal plants since hydrogen burns under the same conditions as these fuels and easily replaces them.The easiest way to produce carbon neutral hydrogen is with my hydrogen producing solar panels. The easiest way to store hydrogen is in depleted gas well. The easiest way to distribute hydrogen is by high pressure pipelines along rail road rights of way.Here the full solar spectrum is used to convert rain water run off into hydrogen and oxygen via electrolysis using concentrated photovoltaics with sunlight focused by water filled lenses.Once that is done I;* use hydrogen producing solar panels located in depleted surface mines to produce 26 kg/m2/year of hydrogen from rain water and sunlight to produce 1.91 billion tons of hydrogen which replaces fuels used at all stationary thermal plants, avoiding the use of 7.7 billion tons of coal per year ending all coal CO2 production in the generation of electricity. Ending the production of 22 billion tons of CO2 - achieving our target of 50% reduction without any changes in the oil or gas business.Food & WaterFood & WaterWe must reduce our environmental impact and use of arable land. This means increasing the efficiency of food production. Since we use more land to feed animals than humans, we need to focus on that. The tip of the spear is dairy. To this end we use single celled plants, microalgae, to process waste water into feed fuel fertiliser and electricity for a dairy farm, reducing the area needed to support a cow to 1/400th the area by traditional methods. We also reduce water use and costly inputs, lower production cost.Zeecol Design for Value [ https://www.scribd.com/document/364483977/Zeecol-Design-for-Value ]Reducing Methane Emissions with Giant Domes [ https://www.engineering.com/DesignerEdge/DesignerEdgeArticles/ArticleID/13736/Reducing-Methane-Emissions-with-Giant-Domes.aspx ]This is a first step toward cities that contain and recycle all pollution.And eventually leaving the surface of the Earth altogether, allowing future humanity to ‘re-wild’ the surface and return it all to a pre-industrial condition.Which are derived from technology first used on other planets like Mars and Venus to build self sufficient cities there.On Venus Earth air is lighter than Venus air, and Venus air is the right temperature and pressure at 50 km altitude. So, look for floating cities to be built on Venus at this altitude.We are experimenting with domed cities today.This was first proposed by Buckminster Fuller in 1961.Which was a perfection of his Dymaxion living concept developed in the 1930s. During the Great Depression, a consequence of World War One according to Milton Friedman, Fuller felt humanity should spend money on livingry to create wealth more efficiently and not weaponry so avoid war rather than fight it more efficiently.For this to work we must recycle everything efficiently. This problem has been solved in the early space colony studies. All we must do is apply it to real world needs.Energy that is used by an organism to live is not available for harvest. So, single celled organisms are far more efficient than multi-celled organisms.We can grow plants far more efficiently in photobioreactors, and efficiently clean up water, and produce needed biomaterials.With plant material we can grow animal cells.Then assemble the cells season and cook them to perfection to produce high quality food item.So, our floating habitats and self contained habitats will house photobioreactors that grow microalgae. This microalgae is processed to produce agar which is used to grow cell cultures that are then 3D printed into finished food items.Dwarf animals and plants grown in ideal conditions have cell cultures swabbed from them and these cells are used to maintain vital cell cultures that are supported by algae production and then used to assemble finished food items.Legacy SystemSun→ 2.5% → Grass → 2.5% → Cow → Cheeseburgers & MilkshakesNear Term System - 14x LegacySun → 35% → Algae → 2.5% → Cow → Cheesburgers & MilkshakesFinal System - 196x Legacy...",5 followers,Jake Williams,7.9K,3.2K,76.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-big-thing-in-climate-adaptation-technology

5,"3D is far from a ""dud."" It's developing and will eventually replace the current screens over the next ten years, just as 3D films are becoming more prevalent in the theaters. The struggle right now is glasses versus no-glasses and improving the quality of the experience. The biggest change in TV technology right now, however, is people dropping cable connections and using a VGA cable to connect a computer to their flatscreen so they can watch content on demand via the internet rather than surf 1,000 channels (most of which they have zero interest in).",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2011,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-big-thing-in-climate-adaptation-technology

Pay per use/consumption models.  The days of bundling a bunch of channels together in order for me to get the 5-10 I actually watch are coming to an end.  As Steven started to address, people are dropping cable providers and streaming the content they want, and continued advances in connected TVs will push this growth much further.  In addition to that, I believe cable providers will (or should) respond by breaking their business models and offering pay per channel or consumption based pricing.  I think providers could get consumers back to $50-$100 per month in revenue by offering totally customizable offerings based on consumption with a lot more success than they will be able to keep me from dropping their largely unwatched bundle package.  (And I am days or weeks away from dropping them and going with my homemade Boxee unit + Netflix and/or Hulu Plus. )2)  Mobile device as OS.  If you've been watching the many products from iHome or Sonos, you'll notice that the mobile device is becoming the operating system. These largely 'dumb' devices turn an ordinary iPod speaker into a fully connected and app-driven alarm clock, local weather station, and in the case of Sonos, a wireless streaming music platform and more.At CES, Motorola unveiled it's laptop dock designed for AT&T's Atrix.  The phone turns the dock into an  almost fully functional laptop, offering the benefits of a larger keyboard and a better screen and viewing experience - particularly helpful with video.I think this is just the tip of the iceberg, and I don't see why it cant reach into TV as well. As mobile device storage capacities increase and mobile network speeds climb, the phone has become the central nervous system that is redefining how we work, connect, and play.  Netflix's streaming service let's me watch wherever I am.  We take our content with us, and more and more our mobile devices are becoming the hub of our digital experiences.  I expect (and hope) to see TVs that let me plug in my iPad or other mobile device and watch or stream my content just as I would when I'm on the go.Who wants to start the next generation 'cable' (read: content) company?;-)","135,532 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.6M,2011,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-big-thing-in-climate-adaptation-technology
