1,"I don’t think this will happen in a near future. And this because SSDs are slowly decaying. Let’s take for example my Intel SSD SSDSC2BW240H6 equipped with MLC cells which are considered reliable. Its health dropped in July to 91%, and now looking I see that it dropped to 90%. Considering that I’m using it for an office PC at work it seems to be a fast decay.You aren’t aware of this if you don’t monitor it. You will just see one day that your computer isn’t booting anymore.It’s the case of another SSD that I have in my computer, a Samsung MCBQE25G5MPQ of 25GB that I bought back in 2009 or so,I don’t think this will happen in a near future. And this because SSDs are slowly decaying. Let’s take for example my Intel SSD SSDSC2BW240H6 equipped with MLC cells which are considered reliable.

Considering that I’m using it for an office PC at work it seems to be a fast decay.You aren’t aware of this if you don’t monitor it. You will just see one day that your computer isn’t booting anymore.It’s the case of another SSD that I have in my computer, a Samsung MCBQE25G5MPQ of 25GB that I bought back in 2009 or so, which is approaching a critical value of it’s life period:It is used just to store some files that I rarely use.For comparison, any other hard drive I have, have a perfect life status:I know, they have less hours, but I have other older hard drives with more hours which have a perfect life status.Also it’s worth saying that the hard drives were used more than the SSDs to copy and transfer, replace data, all the time.In my opinion the SSDs are good for the OS, but it seems that their reliability in time is not that good, and the capacity is smaller. Also I saw that they made recently some new SSDs with even less reliable cells, that are sold at a very small price. If this Intel SSD with MLC cells which cost me almost 100$ 3 years ago is already at 90% life, I can imagine how reliable are these SSDs with cheaper memory cells.Another thing about the SSDs is that they decay faster the more they are filled with data. I can fill a HDD up to 90%, and the life of the HDD will not become shorter because of that. But if I would have a SSD of 1TB used the same way as I use the HDD, filling it to the maximum with recovered data from the clients, deleting the data and copying another files, and so on as a daily routine, it will become trashed very soon.Interestingly enough, my old SSD from 2013, Intel SSDSC2CW120A3 has 100% life, despite being used for the operating system for more than 3 years. It didn’t lost a single percent of its life:Initially I wanted to sold it, since I considered that it’s small, but now I’ve changed my mind, I will keep it.Answer: when the SSDs will become really reliable to multiple read-writes, and won’t be any difference in their life expectancy whatever if they are filled 10% or 90%.—————————————————————————————————————12 October update: It seems that my Intel 240GB SSD life has lost another percent.3 December update: my SSD life is reaching now 87%. Unfortunately I only have IDE and RAID options for the SATA ports.I am also wondering why the TRIM feature wasn’t advertised properly, so every user to be aware of it? I’m wondering if I change the motherboard with a newer one which has AHCI, if this SSD which cost me approximately 100$ in 2015 will stop going down?Update 23.01.2021: meanwhile I’ve replaced the motherboard, and I activated AHCI and TRIM features. I replaced the old Intel SSD with a bigger SSD, of 480GB. Still, these days I observed that it also dropped to 1% of its life.Update march 2021: Windows and any other application is starting terribly slow, Windows takes about 6 minutes to load, in contrast with those 20–30 seconds 3 months ago when it was fresh installed. I have 49GB free on C from 119GB, which should be more than enough. I have to reinstall the OS along with all my purchased software, it remains to see when I have time for this, by then, my PC is the slowest I’ve seen in the last period in loading everything, it takes 2–3 minutes to start Microsoft Word for the first time after booting.Update 26.07.2021:Update 08.08.2021:Update 01.08.2022:Meanwhile the SSD life droped to 87%.",4 followers,Stephen Kendall,776,273,1.6M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-innovation-will-replace-Solid-State-Drive-in-the-future

3,"Lots of rosy fantasy answers to this question.But the workplace automation revolution has been going on for roughly half a century, so our starting point for predictions should be based on what has actually happened so far.Which is that every advance in computerized workplace automation has been accompanied by the people who used to do the work getting fired, along with the people who supervised them. Nearly all of whom then had to take much lower-paying jobs in the service sector, or have no jobs at all.The incomes of the richest men in America has steadily soared in this period, while that oLots of rosy fantasy answers to this question.But the workplace automation revolution has been going on for roughly half a century, so our starting point for predictions should be based on what has actually happened so far.Which is that every advance in computerized workplace automation has been accompanied by the people who used to do the work getting fired, along with the people who supervised them. Nearly all of whom then had to take much lower-paying jobs in the service sector, or have no jobs at all.The incomes of the richest men in America has steadily soared in this period, while that of most everyone else has stagnated or even sagged (in the case of most unskilled laborers, in part due to competition from illegal immigrants).First to go was repetitive manual labor and management of same. Next has been repetitive mental labor, then non-creative computational mental labor.Of course smart people can find other avenues of work. But most people aren’t smart, by nature’s design, so to speak. Excess brainpower can actually be deleterious to productivity in most work people did as hunter/gatherers, and it was true even moreso in early agriculture. A few people with smarts were needed for emergencies, for the rare unexpected danger/challenge. Hence the bell-shaped curve of intelligence, along which each succeeding generation has been born for over 200,000 years, and continues to be born this way:You aren’t going to be retraining people in the fat part of the curve to be computer programmers.There have been workplace revolutions before, of course. The industrial revolution saw zillions move from farms to manufacturing plants in cities. But in previous revolutions the IQ needed for the new job wasn’t any higher than the IQ needed for the old job, and lots of workers were still needed.Today the “demand curve” for employment in advanced nations is that bell-shaped curve…inverted. The labor market still needs dummies to push brooms and knowledge workers to, well, work knowledge. But it doesn’t need all that many skilled manual laborers with just high school diplomas.And watch what happens when truck and cab driving get automated. I live near Google and see robot cars driving around here constantly.Now of course the richest men in America could decide to give their workers 30 hour work weeks, full medical insurance and pensions. If they belonged to a different species maybe. Instead they’ve kept all the productivity gains of workers for themselves.There is still a market for the cream of the non-college crop. Germany has done a great job of private/public partnership apprentice programs with such people.But no matter how you slice it, the “free market” doesn’t need more than 50 million Americans, and within decades won’t need 100 million or more Americans. It will take aggressive government policy to deal with this, but the richest men in America purchased one of our two major political parties and currently owns both the federal government and a majority of state governments. So don’t look for change there.The scary thing isn’t workplace automation but the sophistication of right wing propaganda and campaign finance laws and other laws that make it easy for the richest of the rich to convince all those diplaced worked that libruls and foreigners done it to them. Tyranny no longer has to stand behind lots of guns. Instead it uses a giant bullhorn coupled with the susceptibility of Joe Lunchbox to appeals to his biases and fears.Note that Donald J. Trump has never said one word about computerized workplace automation. I doubt he even knows it exists…So I strongly suspect the future is full of frustrated people of average mentality forced to do work that’s too dumb even for them, but with their resentments continuously misdirected at precisely the people who are trying to save them.So instead of this…we’ll get this…because","44,314 followers",Kurt Guntheroth,575,13.7K,167.3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-innovation-will-replace-Solid-State-Drive-in-the-future

5,"Almost any repetitive task from mowing lawns to separating and washing clothes, much less production line work can be automated. Humans will still create new things and modify their environments, but then with better tools. At some point we will realize that our technologies are just tools to creating a better life and not a replacement for human contact or intelligent conversation.","135,539 followers",Hector Quintanilla,3.1K,1.2K,88.6M,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-jobs-in-the-next-10-years-where-technology-will-start-to-replace-humans
6,"Well as I got a chance to work on some automation projects in my past company I guess I can answer this to some extentBasically my goal ( so called POC in corporate world) was to automate report generation and some T code executions depending on scenarios and conditions in SAP. It was complete work flow automation ( company was planning to terminate around 5 FTEs who were doing this manually)So working for few months in that domain,the very first Job which will get affected is Data entry jobs( that could be from simple Excel update to various SAP activities).Generally I can say in next few yeaWell as I got a chance to work on some automation projects in my past company I guess I can answer this to some extentBasically my goal ( so called POC in corporate world) was to automate report generation and some T code executions depending on scenarios and conditions in SAP.

As it is so evident that 70–80% work is going to be automated.
