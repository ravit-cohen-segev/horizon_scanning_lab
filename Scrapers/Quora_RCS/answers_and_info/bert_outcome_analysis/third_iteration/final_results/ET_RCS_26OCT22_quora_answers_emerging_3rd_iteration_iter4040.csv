The exact armor thickness is classified, but we can certainly infer that it’s impenetrable to a Tank from 1939. As even the Abrams own 120mm cannon has immense trouble penetrating its own armor when tested.Let’s take aOh boy, that’s a hell of a hypothetical isn’t it?!Okay, let’s begin.First of all, we will only be discussing the “Army”, not the Air Force, or the Navy.So really, this is one branch of the US military, against the entire world in 1939.The modern US army looks like this:The US Army has access to the best Tanks in the world, the M1 Abrams, which weighs a staggering 68 short tons. The exact armor thickness is classified, but we can certainly infer that it’s impenetrable to a Tank from 1939. As even the Abrams own 120mm cannon has immense trouble penetrating its own armor when tested.Let’s take a look at an individual infantryman, his equipment, and his body armor:As we can see here, the average US infantryman is very well protected for a firefight in this day and age, let alone 80 years ago.US soldiers are well protected around vital areas, such as the chest, where most main organs are located.The head is also well protected, being able to withstand a direct hit, and protecting the skull from trauma by wearing an ECH.We can also see that various protective inserts are located from the legs upwards, to protect the pelvic region and other high risk areas.Some US infantrymen also carry a sidearm, in addition to their rifles. The rifle may have a GL attached, for extra firepower.Okay, we got that out of the way! Give yourself a pat on the back for getting this far.Let’s take a look at the numbers now:The US army size is estimated to be 1,018,000 soldiers, including of course, Army reserve personnel. (Which we will need when fighting off the entire earth in 1939)But the best is yet to come.Unlike many other nations that completely segment their forces, The US Army has access to their own aircraft!There is an estimated 5,117 aircraft in service in the US army.This includes:The coveted BlackhawkThe reliable ChinookThe dangerous ApacheThe super-duper transport hero, Globemaster IIIWith just these four aircraft, we are able to transport, mechanize, and attack.We could, theoretically, get a 50,000 man force deployed anywhere in the world in under 24 hours.Important to note however, that just because we have certain aircraft, we may not have the pilots to fly them. We’ll need the Air Force for our globemasters!Now let’s get down to theCould the US army defeat every military on earth in 1939? Let’s answer it.These are some common tanks from the era:The Panzer IIThe HotchkissThe KV-1These tanks, in comparison to the M1 Abrams, have around 3% of the armor, and 5% of the firepower. That’s being awfully generous.But there’s a ton of tanks!Adding up all the tanks in the world in 1939, we would be left with an absolutely tremendous force ofThis is of course excluding American tanks during that time. (No parallel realities here)Adding up all the tanks within the US army in 2020, we would be left withAs for tank warfare, it would be:244,460 vs 18,000Not one tank from 1939 would be able to penetrate the armor of an M1 Abrams, but our M60 tanks may get penetrated very, very rarely.It is safe to say, that from a mechanized standpoint, given enough ammunition and fuel, our 18,000 tanks could defeat every single tank with minimal losses.It would take an enormously long time, we’ve never seen tank warfare on such a scale.As for Infantry warfare, it would be (roughly):63,135,175 vs 1,018,000This is a tough one; Our soldiers in general are better trained in this day and age, but having to go up against a force at a ratio of 63:1 is very challenging.All the Armor in the world isn’t going to protect you as an infantryman, and even though your weapons are superior, I doubt you would be able to hold off such a substantial number. You’d be able to kill more efficiently, when your up against bolt action rifles and the like. But 63:1? No.If it was head to head, our paltry 1,018,000 infantry would be overrun very quickly, if they are supported by US tanks, there’s a small chance that they may hold their ground. Even with unlimited ammunition, combating an endless wave would prove next to impossible.As for Air warfare, it would be:30,000–40,000 vs 1,350This would be a crushing defeat, as the US army has access mainly to helicopters and drones which wouldn’t be available.We have excellent air defense systems however, and surely, most aircraft from 1939 could be shot down with relative ease.I estimate large casualties on our side however, as Helicopters are easily taken down regardless due to the exposed rotor, just like any other rotor craft. Flak of the time would make extremely short work of our choppers.As for Naval warfare, it would be:5,000–7,000 vs 0It’s a difficult to pill to swallow, but the army has no chance in this match up..Of course, The US army has access to attack craft, but we don’t have access to Battleships, Aircraft Carriers, Destroyers and the like.While we may be able to take down a few ships here and there with artillery, or tanks, chances are the enemy fleet will be bombarding the US forces constantly.If a 200mm shell happened to hit an M1 Abrams, chances are that Abrams won’t exist anymore. More than anything else, the massive fleet could wipe us out gradually, while we are focusing on infantry, tanks, and planes coming from every and any direction.There’s simply only so much you can shoot!Okay, so,Based on all the stats, all the evidence, the sheer amount of forces. It’s my opinion that the Modern US army would NOT be able to take on every military on earth in 1939.Even with unlimited munitions, we would most definitely be wiped out by artillery the likes the world has never seen, we simply do not have enough firepower in one branch, to fight everyone else.Our infantry would beOur aircraft would beOur tanks may stand a chance, and might be our only hope. There’s a chance they wouldOur artillery would put up a good fight, but in the end, would beThere’s only so much a person can do, they can’t fight 24 hours a day, and would require rest, would require medical attention, all sorts of things. The enemy would be relentless because it has the numbers.In the end,SORRY AMERICA!Something to remember!** 70% of army weapon and communication systems rely on external satellites. No GPS, No drones, No cross map missile locks, no magical pixie rockets. Further, even if the US army brought a few satellites along with them, they have no way of launching them.

These served as a focal point for their social lives as well. They met all their friends, romantic partners, and business connections through these organizations.As a result, they knew their neighbors intimately. They were often willing to do more favors for their neighbors and go the extra mile for them, not simply because of residential proximity but because their lives were interwoven through other aspects of the community, as well.They voted in record numbers. The public was actively engaged in political discussions, which kept voter apathy low and prevented radical activist minorities - as opposed to the common citizen - from dominating political discourse.They often had a strong sense of loyalty and attachment to a particular geographic location, and the people who resided there. Strong familial and community ties kept people rooted in one place and made them less likely to be mobile.An excerpt from an article on this topic reads:Americans who came of age during the Depression and World War II have been far more deeply engaged in the life of their communities than the generations that have followed them. The passing of this ""long civic generation"" appears to be an important proximate cause of the decline of our civic life…Evidence for the decline of social capital and civic engagement comes from a number of independent sources. Surveys of average Americans in 1965, 1975, and 1985, in which they recorded every single activity during a day--so-called ""time-budget"" studies--indicate that since 1965 time spent on informal socializing and visiting is down (perhaps by one-quarter) and time devoted to clubs and organizations is down even more sharply (by roughly half). Membership records of such diverse organizations as the PTA, the Elks club, the League of Women Voters, the Red Cross, labor unions, and even bowling leagues show that participation in many conventional voluntary associations has declined by roughly 25 percent to 50 percent over the last two to three decades. Surveys show sharp declines in many measures of collective political participation, including attending a rally or speech (off 36 percent between 1973 and 1993), attending a meeting on town or school affairs (off 39 percent), or working for a political party (off 56 percent).Some of the most reliable evidence about trends comes from the General Social Survey (GSS), conducted nearly every year for more than two decades. The GSS demonstrates, at all levels of education and among both men and women,The community-minded, club-going, politically engaged people of the 1950s had a much higher degree of social trust. They trusted their institutions, they trusted their elected officials, they trusted law enforcement, they trusted everybody in their community, and they trusted strangers. They were far more willing to show friendliness and do favors towards strangers, for instance.A pastor at a Southern church I attended once illustrated it this way, ironically to a congregation of mostly empty pews: “When I was a kid everybody knew each other, and my mother would send me over to the neighbors - any neighbor - for a cup of sugar. No matter who they were, they’d always give me the cup of sugar, or flour, or whatever else we needed when we were poor. Nowadays if I were to send my kids out for a cup of sugar, they’d get shotguns pulled on them or have dogs sicced on them.”With the erosion of Civic America came the erosion of public trust. People now hate and fear their government, and they actively distrust each other. They do not trust law enforcement, they do not know who their neighbors are, and they are naturally suspicious of strangers.An old relative of mine, who was born and raised in the US during the 1930s and was a working man during the 1940s and 1950s, once pulled over to investigate a group of motorists who looked like they were in distress. He found out that one of their group had fallen into the nearby river and was drowning. Nobody else could swim, so he stripped down, leaped into the river, and carried that man to safety. Without question, without concern for his own safety or legal status.This relative’s son, who came of age during the 1970s and 1980s, frequently passed groups of motorists who looked like they were in distress throughout his adult life. He ignored them. One time I was in the car with him, and suggested we pull over to lend assistance. He told me that if we lent assistance, we might be sued for any injury/dilemma that occurred after we intervened - or for exasperating any preexisting injury/dilemma that was already a problem when we got there. He then went on to say sometimes people by the side of the road pretend to be in distress to attempt carjackings.There was a huge, huge gulf in the degree of social trust between the two men only one or two generations apart, and this in turn reflected on how they lived out their lives.Senior joined lots of clubs and is well-respected and well-known in his church and community. Older people everywhere in that small town where he lives know his face. He coached little league, his wife served on the school board, and both were active participants in a variety of local organizations. A veteran, he speaks highly of the public institutions - especially local government, where the officials are all people he has come to know through church or school.If my preacher’s boy showed up requesting a bowl of sugar, Senior would not only give it to him, but invite the kid inside and sit him down for a chat while he phoned his parents to make sure they knew where he was.That was the Greatest Generation.Junior has never joined a club as an adult, or been a member of any church, or participated in any community activities. He doesn’t know his immediate neighbors, and nobody in the community really knows who he is or what he looks like. Junior speaks cynically about the political process and hates the government, which he regards as almost anti-American. He has a deep loathing for people with different political beliefs.If my preacher’s boy showed up requesting a bowl of sugar, Junior wouldn’t answer the door because he didn’t know who it was. He’d immediately assume the kid was casing the home for a burglary.This is the modern cynical man (or woman). It’s the culture shift that indicates where most Americans are today, compared to where they were in say 1955.Where did it all go wrong?Above: Freedom of speech, by Norman Rockwell.
