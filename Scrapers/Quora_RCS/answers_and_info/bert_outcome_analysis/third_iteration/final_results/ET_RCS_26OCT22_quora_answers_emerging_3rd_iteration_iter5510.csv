0,"Never repeat a mistake. That’s as fast as you’ll get.Quick example: you name your variables a, b and c. You learn that it is important to name them more descriptively. You rename them to firstName, surname and dateOfBirth.You never name anything a, b, c again.What’s hard about this is how many poor practices there are. You inevitably will repeat mistakes through lack of knowledge.But every time you learn a better way, build it into every piece of code you write.","20,848 followers",Alan Mellor,3.9K,12.3K,63.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-new-emerging-technologies-and-or-programing-languages

There are a few JVM languages I’m quite interested, such asLikewise, while I’m not the biggest fan of JavaScript, it is proving to be a rather interesting platform for language development. I believe this is largely because JavaScript is unavoidable on the web, but people are desperate to avoid it.I think this division of labor is something that we’re going to see continue very much in the future of language design: There are going to be low-level but abstract compiler targets, and then there’s going to be the languages built on top of them. I also think we’re just going to keep seeing static analysis tools getting better and better and provide “zero-cost abstractions” for what used to be considered very high-level language features.","9,706 followers",Tim Mensch,626,3K,18.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-new-emerging-technologies-and-or-programing-languages

7,"It’s down to how the technology works.A REAL-WORLD-SITUATION:As I was driving about 450 miles yesterday - it was raining hard - I was driving at about 45mph on a four-lane divided highway, passing some roadworks that had shut down the right hand lane. Just as the roadworks was coming to an end, I saw a deer standing in the center median. Because I was concerned that the deer might run out in front of me - I had to make a snap decision as to whether I could quickly move into the right lane (because the roadworks had MAYBE just ended maybe I’d clip a traffic cone or something) or whether to brakIt’s down to how the technology works.A REAL-WORLD-SITUATION:As I was driving about 450 miles yesterday - it was raining hard - I was driving at about 45mph on a four-lane divided highway, passing some roadworks that had shut down the right hand lane. Just as the roadworks was coming to an end, I saw a deer standing in the center median. Because I was concerned that the deer might run out in front of me - I had to make a snap decision as to whether I could quickly move into the right lane (because the roadworks had MAYBE just ended maybe I’d clip a traffic cone or something) or whether to brake hard (risking aquaplaning on the wet road) - or whether to just continue to drive ahead, only slowing more gently and hoping that the deer didn’t move.I did the latter…but that’s not important here.SO HOW CAN A SELF-DRIVING CAR KNOW WHAT TO DO?So think about how the software to make a car that drives itself could be programmed to deal with that situation?If the software was written conventionally - by computer programmers - the odds are VERY good that they’d never have thought of this very specific three-way choice situation. The software wouldn’t be able to cope with it for sure.So that’s NOT how self-driving car software works.Instead they use Artificial Intelligence techniques - where a very generic piece of software called a “Neural Network” kinda emulates the way that human and animal brains work.Neural Networks have to be trained by example. So, the “Pluribus” AI software that recently ANNIHILATED all six of the world’s best Texas Hold’em poker players learned how to play by watching millions of games of Texas Hold’em played by real humans - and learning by example.TRAINING DATA:So self-driving cars have to be trained too…and that means feeding them video captured by cameras and other sensors on real cars being driven along real roads by human drivers.So, when Google (now Waymo), Uber, Apple and others started to work on self-driving cars, they built a handful of cars - fitted them out with cameras and such - and hired a bunch of people to drive them around to capture examples of people driving.Trouble is - you might drive your ENTIRE LIFE and never see a deer, in the median, with traffic cones to your right while in the pouring rain.Waymo have now gotten about 6 million miles of real-world driving data with which to train their AI software. I very much doubt if a situation sufficiently similar to mine ever happened to them in all six million miles they drove. It might take billions of miles of driving for a sufficiently similar problem to show up.That’s a very serious problem. Paying people to drive even millions of miles is a costly proposition.WHAT TESLA DID:When Tesla started out - they had a cleverer solution. They’d make cars that couldn’t self-drive - but which had the computers, cameras and sensors to ALLOW them to do that once the AI software was sufficiently well trained.They started selling cars with only VERY limited self-driving abilities - hoping that people would trust them enough to pay extra for all of that stuff - with only a promise that self-driving would become functional and useful sometime in the future.That might not have worked if the cars weren’t pretty decent all-electric cars to start with…but it worked.So as Tesla sell more and more cars (about 300,000 per year right now) - and people are driving tens of thousands of miles in them - they are collecting about a BILLION miles of actual driving data every year.Next year - when they sell their 600,000’th car - they’ll collect TWO BILLION more miles.Every year - they’ll be gathering data a thousand times faster than their competitors in the self-driving field.This enables them to train their AI software on more and more obscure situations…and it’s very likely that they saw my Deer+Rain+Roadworks situation yesterday and that their AI software is already starting to learn about what to do.Over the next few billions of miles of road data - they’ll probably see many more similar situations and see how many other human drivers react to it.Ultimately, sometime in the next year or two - their AI will be able to handle that exact situation without problems.CHASING THE 9’s:Tesla have described this process as “chasing the 9’s”. Their current self-driving software only works on freeways - and it requires a human driver to be ready to take over at any moment if there is a problem.Nobody believes that self-driving cars will ever be 100% safe - but they don’t need to be. So long as they are significantly safer than human drivers - that’s “good enough”.I would say that - as of today (Nov. 2019) - that software is probably 99% likely to be able to drive safely for one mile along a freeway without a human jumping in to help. I drove about 100 self-driving miles on my car yesterday and had to intervene just once when it started changing lanes back and forth for no obvious reason. I don’t let it self-drive around roadworks yet though…so it wasn’t involved with the ‘deer incident’…and waiting just in case the AI might make a mistake is kinda nerve-wracking - more exhausting than just driving the car myself, so I don’t self-drive for most of the time.But 99% is nowhere near good enough! Neither is 99.9% or 99.99%. Fatal accident rates on freeways are about 12 deaths per billion miles driven - so the AI has to be significantly better than that - but is it 99 and eight more 9’s or do we need ten or twelve more 9’s?CONCLUSION: SO WHEN WILL WE HAVE FULL-SELF-DRIVING CARS?The problem spins three ways:All three of those things have to turn out just right - and predicting when that will all come together is hard to say.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,2.6K,996,156M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-new-emerging-technologies-and-or-programing-languages

Horse heads (people that were really into modding horses, not the actual horse heads themselves) were outraged. They saw the rickety, raucous buggies bumbling along, smoke billowing and owners cursing, and were convinced it was all hokum. Unrelated and decades later, a host of thoughtful, intelligent scientists and engineers announced that few people would ever own a computer. They were the size of a room, the cost of a house, and less useful than a canker sore.The impossibilities of yesterday are stacking up as the common of today. We continue to find that if physics doesn’t explicitly limit something, it’s likely going to come to pass sometime. The moon? Been there. Test tube babies? Common. Artificial body parts? Coming along slow, but steady (humans are tough to experiment on). The list keeps growing.Let’s face it, if we could make cars ever safer, climbing that linear path toward mishap-free conveyances that anyone can operate, afford, and maintain, we’d be doing that. That’s not happening. These last 10 years are as safe as we’ve been in almost the last century, but we have continued to kill and maim at high rates. We’ve modified and improved every aspect of the vehicle save one: the operator. Until we do that, we’re going to continue to condemn millions every year to death or debilitation. Unfortunately, no one is willing to invest in better mandatory, periodic training and harsher penalties for transgressions (which is understandable when 75% of people consider themselves superior drivers). When you look at the amount of resources being thrown at the computer side of the problem, it’s astounding that so many people are pessimistic about the outcome. We live in the age of miracles! Of course, we also live in the age of the Kardashians and Twitter trolls, so I can see how it might be easier to just assume the worst.Since we don’t have very good auto-driving systems now, it’s easy to be blinded by the slow progress. This might be rooted in our view of the past. Progress has been going at a certain pace, so it’s natural so extrapolate that, making it look like a linear climb. But that’s not how progress works. It’s exponential. People in ancient Greece would likely fit in pretty well with those living in the 17th century, but our founding fathers would freak out if you dropped them into 1945. A couple decades ago my grandparents couldn’t even get their VCRs to stop flashing 12:00. Today, our kids don’t have to plan anything, because they can text and access maps on the fly in real time.Auto driving is not only going to be “the future,” (echo-y voice), but it’s going to come quicker than most realize. Once cars can drive around on nice streets on clear days (meaning right now), they are going to really learn what driving is like in the real world. There may be times when the conditions are such that they have to pull over, but that’s only going to be because they are programmed better than we are and have a realization of the risks at every point in the drive. They aren’t going to pound a few beers and head home based on having done so dozens of times before. They aren’t going to forget to look left and just pull out absentmindedly due to changing the radio because it’s the Perry Como hour. They aren’t going to have this inherent optimistic blind spot that we have (“I just assume that person coming at me sees me, too, and will stay in the other lane”).I love to drive (and I’m better than average at it). Of course, IThe adoption is going to be slow at first, like everything else, then rise rapidly, curtailing off toward the top as the hold-out Luddites pay to drive on private roads (whichAs soon as I can get in my electric car and tell it to take me to get pancakes and sex, I’ll know I’m living in the future.I’m adding the bad stuff below the fun comic. During this change, because Autos are going to adhere to the rules of the road and safety aspects, traffic is going to get worse. The early adopters, especially, are going to have a rough go at it. Drivers will be cutting them off, boxing them in, and shunting them farther and farther back in traffic. There will eventually need to be laws that restrict the most egregious actions, like teams of drivers boxing in and stopping Autos for a lark (maybe even to highjack them, but with all the cameras, it’s going to be well-documented). It’s going to be ugly and if you think the large trucks “icing” electric charging stalls and “","527,819 followers",Adam D'Angelo,1.1K,990,33.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-new-emerging-technologies-and-or-programing-languages
9,How much technology may be emerged its just emerged out of human brains. A person must have ethics and values as it rules their lives and decisions they take but technology would not rule a person's life.
