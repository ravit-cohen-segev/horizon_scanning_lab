2,"By the time of Galileo it had already been known for at least some 900 years that Earth had a spherical shape. Around 240 B.C. a Greek mathematician named Erastothenes measured the circumference of the Earth to an accuracy of some tenth of km. Accordingly he already knew it was spherical. The measurement had the bonus that it confirmed the spherical Earth. He did it by simply knowing the Sun shone down a perpendicular well on the summer solstice in Syene.

By calculating or measuring the angle of the shadow to some 7°, he knew the angle between Syene and Alexandria at the core of Earth also was 7°. Knowing the distance between Syene and Alexandria and also knowing that 360°/7° is 50, he just had to multiply 50 by the distance and he got the circumference of the Earth and also Earth’s radius to some level of acurracy.Actually the philosopher,The historic rumour is that Pythagoras, some 600 B.C. was the first to come up with the hypothesis.

You know the mountain is BIG, likely big in proportion to its own trees.

The people that hindered this thinking were peopleThe Greeks (300 BC) knew the world was spherical, and tested a hunch by traveling to different latitudes and checking out the angle of the Sun at precisely measured times each day. No compass? The Sun has three built-in points, the high point of its arc (noon) and the location (which changes each day, except at the equator) at which it rises and sets. And at night, it has a handy antipode - Polaris, which is almost at 90 degrees. So the sun is higher at noon in Egypt than in Venice. Columbus (1492, etc.) had a globe*. Galileo (born 1560 or so) came after.*Lacking modern clocks to figure out longitude, the old boys’ globes tended to be too small, hence Columbus’ error.People have long been fascinated by the fact that ships’ sails appear before the rest of the ship, hinting at a slight curve in the waters. And doubtless you will hear from many others with bits and pieces of how people just knew the earth is round.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-did-people-in-olden-days-such-as-Galileo-come-to-the-conclusion-that-the-Earth-was-spherical-without-very-advanced-technology
