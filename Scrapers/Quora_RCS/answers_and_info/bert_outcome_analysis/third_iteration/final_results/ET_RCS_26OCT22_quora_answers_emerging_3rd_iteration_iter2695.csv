All objects that someone (you?) categorize as “guns” disappear, and this is reapplied to any new objects created, but physics and humanity remain otherwise unchanged.3. The human capability to understand and employ projectile weapons is removed, such that humans cannot understand concepts more complex than running up and stabbing their enemies.4.

2,"Interesting question if a bit naive. But let’s rework the basis just a tad. All firearms (that I’m aware of ) use gunpowder enclosed in a shell/cartridge with a primer to cause detonation. Dry primer material is very sensitive to shock and other forces. Lets assume that we work out an electromagnetic pulse which causes primers to ignite. Guns wouldn’t disappear as much as they would become live grenades in the holder’s hand which can be detonated by an opponent with a electromagnetic pulse generator. Call the pulse generator some military pseudonym. Larger versions could be towed under aircrafInteresting question if a bit naive. But let’s rework the basis just a tad.

Lets assume that we work out an electromagnetic pulse which causes primers to ignite. Guns wouldn’t disappear as much as they would become live grenades in the holder’s hand which can be detonated by an opponent with a electromagnetic pulse generator. Call the pulse generator some military pseudonym. Larger versions could be towed under aircraft or helicopters (also A/C). Smaller hand held versions could be carried around by individuals and used as a “Buckler” against gunmen. So the Buckler carrier armed with a modern sword presses a button and any gunman within some range has all their bullets/cartridges go off. If they’re carrying the gun in their hand they lose the hand. If carrying it as a rifle the shrapnel takes them out. And then they’re faced with a man/woman with a sword/axe/spear.Now about more advanced technology. Do we want to kill the opponent? or would simply disabling them be adequate? Think taser mounted on a modern epee. And touches are made by pushing the taser pins into the opponent’s body, limbs, neck, head. Would chainsaws become modern melee weapons? Cross bows with magazine and fast reload capabilities would quickly become research items. Or we might dispense with gunpowder and go to electric propulsion systems in analogs of current firearms.",93 followers,Juan Paolo Tarroja,1.7K,562,919.7K,2017,https://www.quora.com/If-somehow-all-guns-disappeared-and-modern-armies-were-forced-to-revert-to-melee-weapons-what-would-they-be-like-with-more-advanced-technology
3,"Thanks for asking for my answer-here it comes.If firearms went away ( which they never will-being at their most basic 15th Century technology), the weapons available would be four kinds, “cutty”, “pointy”, “impact” and “ballistic” ( the bow and arrow And crossbow and quarrel). These weapons are essentially 13th century technology, and not a lot could be done to improve them except perhaps make then stronger, lighter and more resistant to damage. Swords, lances, pikes and spears, clubs and mace/ morning star, plus bows of various types Would still be pretty much the same.As for the battlefield?Thanks for asking for my answer-here it comes.If firearms went away ( which they never will-being at their most basic 15th Century technology), the weapons available would be four kinds, “cutty”, “pointy”, “impact” and “ballistic” ( the bow and arrow And crossbow and quarrel).

By his own admission, he had an embarrassingly bad memory.It was so bad that he resolved to fix it and he did.He knew it was a real problem, but he didn’t know what to do.It was his wife who came up with the solution. What was it? It’s laughably simple.Every evening he would recount his day to his wife, in detail. It only took about 15 minutes. He would tell he’d met, what he’d ate, the conversations he’d had, what he’d read, important thought, anything, everything and nothing.At first it was a tremendous struggle to remember.After a few weeks he could remember things easier.After a few years he could remember almost everything.I’ve personally borrowed this method for myself and I do it on a daily basis with my children. I’ve done it with them since they were six years old.At first it was a huge struggle. They couldn’t even remember what they had for lunch. They couldn’t recount the subjects they’d learned that morning.Now, years later, they can recount their days with ease. They also have near perfect grades.Don’t have someone to tell your day to? Tell your phone! Go for a walk and make a daily recording, recounting your day.After a few weeks, memory will no longer be an issue.After a few months, to push your memory further and make it more challenging, recall the previous day. After a year, change it to the day before yesterday.If you need to remember specific things, then ensure when you are recounting your day, that you focus on those things.Want to remember word for word what you’ve read, then at the end of each day, in your 15 minutes, focus on recalling word for word what you’ve read.It will be incredibly hard at first, but don’t give up.Want to remember the names of people you’ve met, then focus on the names of people you’ve met that day.POSTSCRIPT:After a decade of exercising my memory in this way and I suppose, if I needed to, I could recall yesterday’s events with near perfect clarity. I can visualise each moment and relive it.What I’ve realised is that this level of memory is not so important. The mind already holds a perfect recollection of every event we’ve experienced in our life. One of our brains main jobs is to consolidate the memories that are most relevant and important to our personal narrative.Definitely do these exercises, but realise that finding your focus in your life will help your brain naturally retain the things related to that focus. The more clarity you have in your interests and passions, the more you’ll be able to recall related facts, figures, ideas and thoughts.","1,732 followers",Heath Weaver,2.6K,471,4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-somehow-all-guns-disappeared-and-modern-armies-were-forced-to-revert-to-melee-weapons-what-would-they-be-like-with-more-advanced-technology

Is this a joke or something? Do you even have any experience of handling clients?”Reading this reply, his head got numb.Finally after a few stupid messages, client ended the conversation and reported to his boss.That was the end of his career with the company.When his boss called him in the cabin, he had made a big mistake.But who doesn't make mistakes? Most people do make mistakes at work.There were minor chances that he would again make a mistake too soon to piss off his boss.But he was so overwhelmed by boss's warning that he lost control on his mind which instantly declared that he would be laid off and started wandering towards the consequences.It is obvious that when you give up even before fighting, how would you continue the struggle?His boss gave him a warning, fine, it was definitely a matter of stress and a moment to introspect.He should have sat alone for a few minutes, accepted his blunder, thought that he will try his best once again and not lose this job just like that, and if it is written in fate to lose this job he would still leave fighting.And then would have returned to work with a better mindset.The outcome would have most probably been much better.Answering this question-Whenever your mind over thinks.Stop whatever you are doing for a while.Identify the cause of stress.Think what best you can do in this moment.Create a target, focus your attention and start working.Also accept from an open heart that there may be a “very negative outcome”Tell yourself that “what will be will be” but you won't give up without giving a tough fight.And please, never forget, no circumstance, job, interview, relation, result is bigger than your life.There is always a life above all failures!Thanks for A2A Poulomi Roy.",326 followers,Anubhav Jain,4K,4.4K,123.7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/If-somehow-all-guns-disappeared-and-modern-armies-were-forced-to-revert-to-melee-weapons-what-would-they-be-like-with-more-advanced-technology

Books, that if read widely, would change a billion lives.I like reading books where I feel my brain have an IQ orgasm. Like, I literally feel my IQ go up while reading the book.Before I give my list, I want to mention there are three kinds of non-fiction books:- BUSINESS CARD BOOKS: These are books like ""How to be a leader"". They establish the author as an expert. The author then uses this book to get speaking gigs or coaching or consulting gigs.These books usually suck. Don't read one. But nothing wrong with writing one.- BOOKS THAT SHOULD BE CHAPTERS:A publisher will see an article somewhere like, ""12 ways to become smarter"" and say, ""that should be a book"".Then the write mistakenly says, ""ok"" and he has to undergo the agony of changing something that was a perfectly good 2000 word article into a 60,000 word book.Those books suck. Don't read one. And DEFINITELY don't write one. Unless you want to waste a year of your life. I wasted 2004-2009 doing that.- BRAINGASM BOOKSHere's my top 10 list of braingasm books. Books that will raise your IQ between the time you start and the time you end.By the way, there are more than 10 of these books. This is just my TOP 10. Although not really in that order. It's hard for a small mind like mine to order these.""Mastery"" by Robert GreeneThis book is like a curated version of 1000 biographies all under the guise, ""how to become a master at what you love"".""Bold"" by Peter Diamondis and Steven Kotler""Outliers"" by Malcolm GladwellGladwell is not the first person to come up with the 10,000 hour rule. Nor is he the first person to document what it takes to become the best in the world at something.But his stories are so great as he explains these deep concepts.How did the Beatles become the best? Why are professional hockey players born in January, February and March?And so on.""Where Good Ideas Come From"" by Steven JohnsonAlso add to this: ""How We Got to Now"" by Steven Johnson.Basically: don't believe the myth of the lonely genius.Ideas come from a confluence of history, ""the adjacent possible"" specific geographic locations, etc.The connections Johnson makes are brilliant. For instance, The Gutenberg Press (which, in itself, was invented because of improvements in sewing looms), made everyone realize they had bad vision.So the science of lenses was created. So microscopes were eventually created. So germs were eventually discovered. So modern medical science was discovered.And so on. Johnson is a thinker and a linker and tells a good story.""Man's Search for Meaning"" by Victor FranklI'm at a loss for words here. Just read it. Don't read it for the holocaust. Or psychological theory. Read it because when you're about halfway through you will realize your life is no longer the same.""Born Standing Up"" by Steve MartinAnd while you are at it, throw in ""Bounce"" by Mathew Syed, who was the UK Ping Pong champion when he was younger.I love any book where someone took their passion, documented it, and shared it with us. That's when you can see the subleties, the hard work, the luck, the talent, the skill, all come together to form a champion.Heck, throw in, ""An Astronaut's Guide to Earth"" by Commander Chris Hadfield.""Zero to One"" by Peter ThielThere's a lot of business books out there. 99% of them are BS. Read this one.So many concepts really changed my attitude about not only business but capitalism. Thiel, the founder of PayPal, and first investor in Facebook, is brilliant in how he simply shares his theories on building a billion dollar business.""Quiet"" by Susan CainProbably half the world is introverts. Maybe more. It's not an easy life to live. You feel as if you can't move, you can't talk, you can't go into a room and spread a vision you might have.Quiet shows the reader how to unlock the secret powers that probably half the world needs to unlock.""Antifragile"" by Nassim TalebAnd throw in ""The Black Swan"" and ""Fooled by Randomness"".""Fragile"" means if you hit something might break.""Resilient"" means if you hit something, it will stay the same.But Nassim discusses ""Antifragility"" - building a system, even one that works for you on a personal level, where you if you harm it in some way it becomes stronger.He discusses Antifragility throughout history, up to our current economic situation, and even in our personal situations.""Mindset"" by Carol DweckAgain, I am fascinated by the field of mastery. Not self-improvement (eat well, sleep well, etc) but on how can you continue a path of improvement so that you can really enjoy the subtleties at a very deep level of whatever it is you love.Carol Dweck, through massive research and storytelling, shows the reader how to continue on the path of improvement and why so many people fall off that path.These are not books I'm picking so I can look smart. These are books that I feel have made me smarter.If I die now and I've only read these books I'm fine with that.","284,852 followers",James Altucher,10K,878,91.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-somehow-all-guns-disappeared-and-modern-armies-were-forced-to-revert-to-melee-weapons-what-would-they-be-like-with-more-advanced-technology

One form consists of a circular pipe enclosing a helix and inclined at an angle of about 45 degrees to the horizontal with its lower end dipped in the water; rotation of the device causes the water to rise in the pipe. Other forms consist of a helix revolving in a fixed cylinder or a helical tube wound around a shaft.The Archimedes Screw is still used today in some limited applications (usually electrically-powered), and can range in size from a quarter of an inch to nearly 4 meters (12 feet) in diameter. A large screw or banks of screws may be used to pump rainstorm runoff or to lift water or wastewater, for example.2.THE BATTERY-The Baghdad Battery, sometimes referred to as the Parthian Battery, is a clay pot which encapsulates a copper cylinder. Suspended in the centre of this cylinder but not touching it is an iron rod. Both the copper cylinder and the iron rod are held in place with an asphalt plug. These artifacts (more than one was found) were discovered during the 1936 excavations of the old village Khujut Rabu, near Baghdad. The village is considered to be about 2000 years old, and was built during the Parthian period (250BC to 224 AD). Although it is not known exactly what the use of such a device would have been, the name ‘Baghdad Battery’, comes from one of the prevailing theories established in 1938 when Wilhelm Konig, the German archaeologist who performed the excavations, examined the battery and concluded that this device was an ancient electric battery. After the Second World War, Willard Gray, an American working at the General Electric High Voltage Laboratory in Pittsfield, built replicas and, filling them with an electrolyte, found that the devices could produce 2 volts of electricity. The question remains, if it really was a battery, what was it used to power?3. THE CALENDAR-Research carried out last year on an ancient site excavated by the National Trust for Scotland in 2004 revealed that it contained a sophisticated calendar system that is approximately 10,000 years old, making it the oldest calendar ever discovered in the world. The site at Warren Field, Crathes, Aberdeenshire – contains a 50 metre long row of twelve pits which were created by Stone Age Britons and which were in use from around 8000 BC (the early Mesolithic period) to around 4,000 BC (the early Neolithic). The pits represent the months of the year as well as the lunar phases of the moon. They were formed in a complex arc design in which each lunar month was divided into three roughly ten day weeks representing the waxing moon, the full moon and the waning moon. It also allowed the observation of the mid-winter sunrise so that the lunar calendar could be recalibrated each year to bring it back in line with the solar year. The entire arc represents a whole year and may also reflect the movements of the moon across the sky.4.STEAM ENGINE-Heron Alexandrinus, otherwise known as the Hero of Alexandria, was a 1st century Greek mathematician and engineer who is known as the first inventor of the steam engine. His steam powered device was called the aeolipile, named after Aiolos, God of the winds. The aeolipile consisted of a sphere positioned in such a way that it could rotate around its axis. Nozzles opposite each other would expel steam and both of the nozzles would generate a combined thrust resulting in torque, causing the sphere to spin around its axis. The rotation force sped up the sphere up to the point where the resistance from traction and air brought it to a stable rotation speed. The steam was created by boiling water under the sphere – the boiler was connected to the rotating sphere through a pair of pipes that at the same time served as pivots for the sphere.Some old steam engines are still used in certain areas of the world and in antique locomotives. However, steam power is still heavily used around the world in various applications. Many modern electrical plants use steam generated by burning coal to produce electricity.5.Earthquake Detector 132 A D -Earthquake Detector 132 A D According to court records of the later Han Dynasty, a seismograph was created by the brilliant inventor Zhang Heng (78-140 AD) in 132 AD. Its function is to determine the direction of an earthquake. In 138 AD, this instrument indicated an earthquake occurring in Longxi a thousand kilometers away. It was the first time that mankind to detect an earthquake. Modern seismographs only began development in 1848 in Europe.6.Paper Money 9th century A.D.-Paper money were first developed by the ancient Chinese, who started using folding money at the end of the 8th or beginning of the 9th century AD. Paper bills were originally used as privately issued bills of credit or exchange notes. A merchant could deposit his cash in the capital, receiving a paper “exchange certificate” which he could exchange for metal coins in other cities.Thanks for scrolling,Sandip bhatnagar.",720 followers,Sandip Bhatnagar,629,321,1.4M,2015,https://www.quora.com/If-somehow-all-guns-disappeared-and-modern-armies-were-forced-to-revert-to-melee-weapons-what-would-they-be-like-with-more-advanced-technology

That leads us to my second questionWhile it is true that India has advanced immensely in the last 20 years, the real question is has this made us more dependent on other countries? Most notably the United States and recently China?Despite having a population of 1.3 billion people and being touted as the software superpower (thanks to the IT services industry) not so long ago, India does not have self-reliance when it comes to technology. China created companies like Ali Baba, Baidu and Tencent a parallel to the American tech giants while India (even India’s telecom minister recently) takes pride in being the largest consumer of Whatsapp, and Facebook! Yes almost everyone has a mobile phone in India today and therefore the opportunities for growth is tremendous. But the real question one should ask is, who will be the beneficiaries of these opportunities? The mobile phones used in India are Chinese phones and the software used in these phones are U.S owned. Basically all our data, from our shopping habits to our entertainment preferences are in the hands of foreign technology companies. Now we know IoT is catching up fast and that means more control to these companies and India will be a proud consumer supplying data.One of the many important aspects discussed in Rajiv Malhotra’s latest book “Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Power, Five Battlegrounds” is India’s military dependence on foreign technology. While the manufacturing of Rafale jets will happen in India, the technology is owned by the French and let’s understand when such technology transfers occur between countries, the supplying country will always provide a technology that is one generation behind to the consuming country. That means we are technologically and militarily advanced compared to our previous generations but we are at least one generation behind the innovating countries! In certain areas like military that is not good newsMy last point on this is our pride in our Human resource and how skilled we are! Yes as individuals many Indians are CEOs of big foreign tech giants. But how does that benefit India as a nation? Do we have a stake in the intellectual property of these products? Can we say for instance Sunder Pichai as Google’s CEO holds the same clout in his company as Mark Zuckerberg holds in Facebook? Certainly not! Let’s not confuse individual brilliance with technological advancement as nation.For India to have a grand standing in the world stage as a technologically advanced nation, we need to come out of our consumer mindset and to quote Rajiv Malhotra’s words “be producers of knowledge and technology”.","46,514 followers",Avadhesh Khanna,9K,272,11.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-advanced-technology-that-humans-havent-used-again-like-the-Concorde-airplane
38,"The US can think what they like, Aussies really don’t care you know lolFeeling like they’re “the best” seems to be important to Americans, so easiest just to let them believe that. They have a hard life over there, if that belief makes it just that little bit easier to get through each day, then why shouldn’t we let them feel like they are “the best”?

39,What does that mean exactly? Is Australia planning a war with the US?Are Australian troops going to land in California? Or Hawaii? I assume they will be polite.Will Hugh Jackman and the Hemsworth Brothers be in the vanguard? I hope Margot Robbie is.And Olivia Newton John. I know she’s 73 but hey I use to have her poster in my childhood bedroom. In fact I still have her poster.Now I’m off to watch BMX Bandits and listen to the Xanadu soundtrack.What does that mean exactly?

46,"In simple terms, Australia is and will continue to be a successful free enterprise country, that is what the people want. I believe that all our major and minor political parties are competing to achieve this outcome. If they achieve that, they usually become “THE GOVERNMENT”.If you want to live under an umbrella of good housekeeping and engage in a successful life in Australia, you are required to share, not all but some of your bounty to help and support the weak, the underprivileged, the out of work, the sick, the aged, struggling single mothers and fathers and all those in need.

Yes, we sometimes find that some people manage their life by living off the public purse. We don’t like it we just grin and bear it. We pay a bit more taxes. Most Aussies are happy with our lot. I LIKE TO CALL IT COMPASSION. I am really privileged to call myself an Aussie, 30% or 40% of Aussies are not born in Australia and that’s OK. To me all are welcome.

47,"Don’t laugh, but my first real introduction to Oz was Paul Hogan's ‘Crocodile Dundee.' The images in that movie resonated with me as a teen in 1980s Texas. To me, Australia appeared to be hot, arid, and tinged with swagger and lots of cultural traits that a kid from Texas could readily identify. Paul Hogan was even wearing a cowboy hat and boots, for crissakes!And later came Steve Irwin. - Same spirit, same bull-by-the-horns high energy and easy-going non-abrasiveness.

What red-blooded young male wouldn’t like to kick up his heels at the local pub with a mate with a penchant for wrestling crocodiles?I was in the U.S. Air Force when I got my chance. I received word they were looking for a few guys to go to Alice Springs for a few months. I quickly made my way to my squadron headquarters; before I even knew what I’d be doing there. ‘Screw it. I'll figure it out,’ I thought. “By the way, where's Alice Springs, exactly?” I said on my way out of the office.“Oh, it's right in the middle of ‘everything,’ I heard someone say. -Probably with a bit of sarcasm that I didn’t pick up on.Now, if you are as naive about Australia as I was, you frame Oz with the aforementioned croc-hunters, and a whole slew of silly-looking animals that are either exceptionally cute or exceptionally deadly. If you’re more clued-in, you may even throw in Hugh Jackman, Kylie Minogue , the Hemsworth brothers, or if you’re old-school like me, the whole 5-feet tall AC/DC clan. Maybe you even picture beautiful Sydney with that iconic opera house too. But again, these were mostly pre-Internet days. It still wasn’t apparent to me where I was actually going.I was back to my office when an office-mate inquired: “Why are you so happy?""“I'm going to Australia""“Where in Australia?” He asked.“Alice Springs. It's in the middle of everything."" I quoted.“You mean it's in the middle of nowhere! Dude, that place blows! There's nothing there! You'll be bored out of your skull!""My heart sank. I raced to the local library after work to get on the Internet. Yep. Smack-dab in the middle of nowhere. Trying to find a silver lining, I decided to see how I could use my off-duty time in Alice Springs to go sightseeing in Sydney. That would have been nice, until I realized that Alice Springs is a full 1700 mile drive from Sydney, and just about anyplace else. I thought I was going to be snapping pictures of the Sydney Harbour bridge, but I was actually on my way to ‘Walkabout Creek.’ Ugh.I was relieved when I landed in Brisbane. In my naivete,' I didn't know much about it. But it was BIG. - A lot bigger than most Americans probably know. However, I was going to be there only a few hours before I left for Alice Springs, so I toured the Airport and bought a few silly, cliche’-driven tourist trinkets for the family; a refrigerator magnet with a kangaroo, and a shark-having-tourists-over-for-lunch t-shirt, etc.You may laugh, but I couldn’t believe how everybody sounded Australian. It was like I was in a movie! You see, Australia is delphic and Australians are elusive to many Americans to this day, because stars like Mel Gibson, Nicole Kidman, Eric Bana, Iggy Azalia and Keith Urban hide their accents so damn well. Australians in Hollywood are sneaky chameleons…But alas, I left Brisbane for the netherworld of Alice Springs. Now, you may think I was going to tell you that Alice Springs was a sparrow-fart town in the middle of nowhere compared to Brisbane. And you'd be right. But everything that I dreaded about Alice Springs was everything that I ended up loving about Alice Springs. I got to travel to Ayers Rock, do a couple of horseriding tours, and even found a comfortable seat at the local pub. I learned that kangaroos, endearing to most Americans, can be pests and road hazards. The few crocodiles I saw in the Northern Territory were as small and lethargic as the gators in the Florida Everglades. I never saw one of those legendary funnel web spiders either, though I persisted in searching my shoes for one every morning, lest I become the ‘Stupid Dead ‘Yank’ who Didn't Check his Shoes’ in the local newspaper…As for the local people, there weren't near as many wearing cowboy hats and boots in the Northern Territory as I believed there would be. But everyone was really cool. There is a rugged, independence about the people of ‘Alice’ that I really enjoyed. Even if you live in a city in the Outback, you have to be a bit of an outdoorsman on the side. The people there seemed blissfully ignorant of life along the coast, and wouldn't have it any other way.Had a few mates at a local pub that liked to talk American politics, but they soon bored with that. I didn't defend well because I had no interest in it. They also picked at me a bit too, but I had learned long ago to avoid negative reactions to that stuff. That gets you respect, and they soon embraced me (not literally). The conversation soon became like any local watering hole I knew in Texas. -Sports, women and favorite beers. They got a good laugh at the ‘Fosters is Australian for beer’ tag line that was popular in the U.S. commercials. Seems that any self-respecting person in Oz didn't agree.My four months soon passed and I said goodbye to ‘me mates’ with a firm handshake; heading out the next morning on a Qantas red-eye flight to Honolulu. My stint in Oz was among the most memorable times in my life.I saw 56 countries and lived in seven of them in my Air Force career, not including the 4 months I spent in Oz. But there was only one country to which I ever seriously contemplated immigrating during my time abroad. -Australia. About a year after I left, I found out about a program to get people to immigrate there, but in the end, I decided to stay in the States to be nearer my family. It was a promise I had made to my mother throughout my 23 years in the U.S. military.But I'll never forget the friendships I made there, and I often wonder whatever happened to the people I knew there. All of the movie-driven cliches were eroded by my time there, and I was left with a different perspective. So, what do I think of Australia?Well, it’s a damn fine country.",146 followers,Jeff Headley,3K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-somehow-all-guns-disappeared-and-modern-armies-were-forced-to-revert-to-melee-weapons-what-would-they-be-like-with-more-advanced-technology
