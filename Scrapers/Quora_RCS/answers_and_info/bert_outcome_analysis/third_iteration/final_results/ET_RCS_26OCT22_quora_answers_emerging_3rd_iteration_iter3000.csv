2,YES. Mjolnir Is a highly advanced technology forged by Eitri the Dwarf weaponsmith that was also Worthy enchanted by Odin.,327 followers,Anh Le,8.9K,85,384.7K,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-Mjolnir-a-magical-weapon-or-some-weapon-using-some-very-highly-advanced-technology-from-Asgard
3,"“If Mjolnir is a 1-handed weapon, then what does Thor use his off-hand for?”Y’know, three decades of reading Thor comics and I can honestly say it’s something I’ve never really gave much thought…Generally though, he’ll just tend to use it both offensively and defensively.What I mean by that is such as here, from his fight with Gorr the God Butcher;As you can see there, he’s both using it defensively to hold Gorr back but, at the same time, also offensively in that he’s setting him up to be twatted with Mjolnir.Likewise, he’ll use it to grasp at an opponent’s striking arm as well, like here;Or,“If Mjolnir is a 1-handed weapon, then what does Thor use his off-hand for?”Y’know, three decades of reading Thor comics and I can honestly say it’s something I’ve never really gave much thought…Generally though, he’ll just tend to use it both offensively and defensively.What I mean by that is such as here, from his fight with Gorr the God Butcher;As you can see there, he’s both using it defensively to hold Gorr back but, at the same time, also offensively in that he’s setting him up to be twatted with Mjolnir.Likewise, he’ll use it to grasp at an opponent’s striking arm as well, like here;Or, alternatively, to give them a punch of his own;I guess another reason which might be overlooked somewhat would be just to simply either balance himself or use it to aim;Of course, sometimes he’ll use both hands to hold Mjolnir to give himself a little extra wallop with his swing as well but, yeah… I’d say the above covers what he uses his off-hand for depending on the circumstances at the time.","20,087 followers",Ben Kolber,11.1K,324,21.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-Mjolnir-a-magical-weapon-or-some-weapon-using-some-very-highly-advanced-technology-from-Asgard
4,"It's as powerful as Stormbreaker. At the end of the day, they're all Uru. The only difference comes in when it comes to who wields them. For instance, Thor from Thor 1 wielding mjolnir won't be as powerful as Odin or Bor wielding Mjolnir. This is due to Uru’s innate energy channeling capabilities that allow it to absorb, store, expel, change, and direct differing energies. Thus, Odin’s or Thor's power level would have a direct correlation to the kind of power the weapon would produce.Secondly, another thing that makes these 3 weapons above distinction is the enchantments put on them, as part oIt's as powerful as Stormbreaker.

Whereas Mjolnir was basically training wheels for Thor (the worthiness enchantment, the basic flight, energy shooting, and energy dampening abilities) Gungnir is automatically imbued with a direct link to the Odinforce. That puts it above Mjolnir already, which is a rather finicky hammer, too. Gungnir and Stormbreaker are King-level weapons, like Mjolnir with the child-lock off. They have additional enchantments to aid their wielder, like control of the bifrost (I’m sure Gungnir could do the same thing stormbreaker does, being a weapon made for the King of Asgard. The only reason it's not shown is due to the writers/directors not having clearly thought it all out. When IW came along, the concept of imbuing the Rainbow bridge into a weapon was fleshed out, as evidenced by Stormbreaker, and Heimdall’s sword Hofund allowing him to whisk Hulk away to earth, while they were on the statesman.) it probably also had the whole ‘fly into thine hand’ enchantment too. I don't know how it works in the MCU. It must be an innate enchantment cast onto the weapon during the casting on Nidavellir, which explains how Stormbreaker flew to Thor's hand minutes after being made. It's most likely a ease of access thing for the battlefield.Lastly, the shape also helps. Gungnir is a spear. It's sharp. Whereas it's meant for throwing, stabbing, and slicing, mjolnir is the opposite. You ever try stabbing somewone with a block of metal? All you can do is just bludgeon them until they stop twitching. Stormbreaker learnt from Mjolnir’s limitations, and includes a larger whacking end, as well as a sharp edge to slice and dice.",3 followers,Matthew Lei,583,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-Mjolnir-a-magical-weapon-or-some-weapon-using-some-very-highly-advanced-technology-from-Asgard
5,"In the MCU we are led to believe that Norse culture in and of itself was an offshoot of Asgardian culture, or at the very least heavily influenced by it. Therefore it's likely the previous weapons were named in Asgardian, not Norse.Thor has in many ways rejected Asgardian culture. He has taken the role as champion of Earth, dismissed his right to the throne and immersed himself in Earth culture and Politics.We can assume that Stormbreaker was named by Odin, as in the comics Odin himself designed the weapon.

Mjolnir being essentialy a training weapon means plans would have been put in place for a replacement once it has fulfilled that purpose.Odin knew the weapon would likely be wielded by Thor after he had either died or abdicated, so he would naturally choose a name that better reflected the modern king.It's also worth considering that names have power. The name of Odin’s weapon Gungnir (The Swaying One) would suggest that none could stand against him once he unleashed it. The name Stormbreaker tells the Earth and all who come to it what awaits them should Thor be called to battle. I can't imagine too many Earthly enemies would be wary of a weapon named VeorBresta.
