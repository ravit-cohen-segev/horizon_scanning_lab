It seems that Covid19 has not impacted IT by any means, however some companies management or HR team are just making rumour that it has impacted IT to save appraisal cost, get more work done from employees and lay-off non-performers. For better job hunting you can check LinkedIn job section where you may observe spike in openings. All companies understood that their employees can remain productive via Work from home, but still they are not that much confident to commit for permanent remote working. companies in India will not adopt remote working culture for atleast next 2–3 years until they get good confidence. I am eagerly waiting for remote working culture in IT, so that I can move to my village and doing farming in weekends and experience life of a farmer :). Remote working culture will impact a lot to IT Hub cities, as people will be not buying high budget flats or settling there, the real estate business will be impacted, it will ultimately reduce pollution or traffic problems in metro cities. Also IT people will have good savings once they work from their native places and there will be development across whole country as these IT crowd will be investing their money in their Native places, which will be a great positive development for whole country.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,1.7K,996,155.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-hard-would-it-be-to-get-a-new-IT-job-in-a-post-COVID-world

You cannot click on that submit button and get guaranteed results.It’s a very human process. As suchOnly if you follow these three steps.Whether you are a new immigrant or a fresh graduate living in Canada, the level of difficulty you face will dependGoing After the JobApplying for a job online is not like using Netflix or Amazon. You cannot click on that submit button and get guaranteed results.It’s a very human process. As such, you need to cut in line of the competition and get the attention of the decision makers.When I landed in Canada, I got 3 job offers in two weeks. I am in the IT industry, an in demand field no doubt. But there is a lot of competition too. Plus, as a new immigrant I had no experience and no network in Canada at all.Here is a quick summary of how I got the job. After I customized the resume, researched about the company and the recruiter, I contacted the recruiter on LinkedIn.She replied, stating that she is NOT the recruiter for this position. The company made a mistake, and so she gave me the contact of the actual recruiter. She emailed him and told him that I contacted her.The new recruiter called me and spoke to me, and we had a great conversation. He setup the interview, and I got the job.One year later, I bumped into the recruiter again at a training session. He remembered me, and I asked him “How come you called me? Didn’t you get a lot of applicants for this job?” He replied “Yes I did, but to be honest, I only called you because the first recruiter who was mistakenly put on the job application emailed me directly with your interest in the position.”For my other two jobs offers, I took a similar approach. I emailed directly, picked up the phone and called, and even snail mailed my resume. I customized my resume to the job description for each and every application.You must be thinking, to get three job offers in two weeks, I must have applied to 100s of jobs. Nope! I only applied to 14 jobs in total.Now I’m not stating that everyone will have the same results as me. Also, if you are applying for a regulated job, you have to undergo training and bridging programs to be able to practice in that field.My point is to highlight the difference between an active job search strategy, and a passive one.Most people take the passive route - endlessly machine gunning their resume to online job boards (this is called “spraying and praying”). To make matters worse, they will upload generic resumes.Take note that your resume is not being seen by human eyes. It’s being scanned by a machine - a software called “Application Tracking Systems”. This means that if your resume is not customized to the job description, it’s not going anywhere.Those that take an active approach know that applying for the job online is merely a formality. The real work starts AFTER the submission, but contacting the hiring executives directly.Understand Canadian work culture (for new immigrants)The top 5 nationalities of new immigrants to Canada today are:One of the biggest mistakes new immigrants make when arriving to Canada is not taking the time to understand Canadian work culture.For example, in India, a lot of importance is placed on technical skills. So people with bachelors degrees and masters degrees are fully qualified to come to Canada expecting that their degrees will get them jobs, only to be disappointed.You can even see it in Quora - people are asking questions about how to find jobs in Canada while talking about their education in the question - “How do I find a job in Canada if I’m an Indian with a bachelor’s degree in Civil engineering”.Take note of these 3 TOP cultural differences between Canada and these 4 countries for job searching:This is a small sample of many other cultural differences that lead to the national dilemma of “Canadian Experience.” It’s got nothing to do with your technical ability to do the job, but more to do with your grasp of Canadian workplace culture.Real NetworkingSomeone wrote this comment to my answer below:“I started networking by sending connection requests. Yet, most of the recruiters accepted my request and when I told them about my application, they told me if my resume matched someone will call me. Guess what nobody does.”This is exactly what most people think networking is. It’s not!Networking isBuilding: It takes work. It’s something you have to do on a daily basis as a habit. As a full time job seeker, it’s the most important activity of your day.Strategic: You need to connect with the people who have the power and authority to hire you. That’s not recruiters. That’s hiring managers in your industry who may be your future boss (1 to 3 levels up). They are the ones who decide to give you the job. Not recruiters. They are just part of the facilitation process.Win-Win: If you use your network to take-take-take and ask-ask-ask, you will lose them. They are human beings, and just like you, they know when they are being used. Give back to your network more than you take.Relationships: It’s an on-going process. If you connect with someone once and never follow up, they will forget you. You might has well have never connected at all. Don’t connect with someone, unless you willing to commit to the relationship.Your network may not have a job for you in hand right at that moment. But when they do, OR when they hear of someone else inThat is your objective of having a network. So they remember you when the opportunity comes.That won’t happen unless you areAs a job seeker you might be asking yourself “Why should I waste my time helping others when I am the one that needs help?”But deep down, I know you believe that the above makes common sense. Know that most people don’t do this, and if you want to beat your competition, this is the way to do it.Other Resources to Help-Reach for your potential-","90,289 followers",Alisha Talks,21.9K,910,103.8M,2022,https://www.quora.com/How-hard-would-it-be-to-get-a-new-IT-job-in-a-post-COVID-world

The promise of securely doing business anywhere on any device has finally been realized and businesses are pivoting to take advantage of that model.We’re witnesses human capital flight away from dense population centers because of the proliferation of bandwidth; depressed commercial real estate; financial capital flight to technology companies; the rise of labor’s bargaining position for improved wages, labor conditions, and work/life balance.

The promise of securely doing business anywhere on any device has finally been realized and businesses are pivoting to take advantage of that model.We’re witnesses human capital flight away from dense population centers because of the proliferation of bandwidth; depressed commercial real estate; financial capital flight to technology companies; the rise of labor’s bargaining position for improved wages, labor conditions, and work/life balance. These were transitions in labor and work that were already happening - the pandemic just accelerated it.Extrapolating that, we should see corresponding increases in systems professionals, telecom engineers, developers, as we increasingly rely on information assets. Further, we should see fewer low-wage positions managing and up-keeping commercial real estate. We should see restaurants and other models pivot to become distribution centers/centralized kitchens more than a destination, increasing food service margins and wages, but I’d wager that kind of economy of scale will allow us to see labor drop for higher output and profits.From a small business perspective, I’d argue that the pandemic illustrated its dependence upon labor. More nimble, flexible businesses could do the same work without dramatic impact on labor; companies dependent upon labor are feeling it -right now - in terms of their bargaining weakness, inflation, the lack of employees who want their crap jobs. I think astute small businesses will then say, “What can I do to automate - to reduce my dependency on labor - to become more efficient, less slow, less friction?”Again, nothing new, just accelerated. That means a faster reduction of lower-wage workers in favor of more specialized workers requiring more education. The future isn’t about _more_ jobs … it’s about _fewer_ jobs, more labor disintermediation, to where 100% of the worlds goods and services can be produced by just 2% of its labor; just watch what the major fast food companies are going to do with AI to capture drive thru orders rather than a human :) Thus, the answer to your question is kind of a convoluted story of our economic disparity: a few will become enriched; a vast majority will be disintermediated and have no job at all - we don’t need them; the pandemic only made this process faster.R",362 followers,Shireen Jaffer,1K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-hard-would-it-be-to-get-a-new-IT-job-in-a-post-COVID-world

That's because so many super talented people grow way more slowly than their potential.In your first job, you should be growing at least 25%/year.  That means at the end of the first year, you are at least 25% better and by the first three years you are roughly twice as good.  Unfortunately, most people grow way slower than that.When you are old (like me) and presumably at a much higher base, growing at 10%/year is very acceptable (because the raw growth off of the bigger base is so big).   But early in your career you need to grow much faster to get to that very high base.Your compensation change should lag your growth -- but there will likely be a correlation.

Because it’s easier to make money from companies.Since companies are paying the bills, everything revolves around making them happy. So it's easy to see why it takes a candidate six months to land the same job that a company fills in 36 days—there's no incentive for recruitment solutions to help candidates.That unfair practice makes the industry seem one-sided. But if you dig deeper, you’ll see that it’s really a lose-lose situation.It's clear that the recruiting system is broken for everyone, but no one is talking about what’s really causing all of the problems. I want to start that conversation and share the issues I've noticed that clearly show why it's ready for a change.External recruiters who “serve” candidates are incentivized to neglect the majority of applicants.The majority of candidates think it's a great idea to use external recruiters because the services are free. What they don’t realize is that these recruiters are incentivized to serve a very specific group of people in a very systematic way.External recruiters make money by successfully filling a job opening for a company. Once the role is filled, the company typically pays the recruiter 20-30% of the annual salary of the person they hire. Of course, this commission incentivizes external recruiters to work with senior-level candidates. And they have two main motivations for doing so:Unfortunately, this means external recruiters give extra attention to experienced, senior candidates while the less experienced candidates, who really need help, end up being ghosted and left to fend for themselves for months on end.And when recruiters flake out, many candidates turn to what they perceive as the next best option—job boards.Job boards are incentivized to rake in resumes without considering candidates or companies.A job board is a service that hosts open positions and makes money by promising companies a large pool of applicants for each one.To find applicants, they offer candidates handy features like the “one-click” apply. And although job boards claim this helps candidates save time, the real incentive behind the feature is to make it as easy as possible for companies to receive a high number of applicants for a single position. The job boards then monetize again by promising to winnow down huge groups of applicants to a short list of the “best” resumes.This process is just another lose-lose for candidates and companies. Because if 300 candidates apply for a single position, 290 of them will never hear a peep about it. Not only do candidates have to deal with a demoralizing job search experience, but companies have to pay thousands of dollars to sift through irrelevant resumes.Even when candidates do make it to an interview, it may not be for a role they can truly thrive in. Because unfortunately, they’re being evaluated using a resume.A resume—the most popular, yet least efficient tool—encourages candidates to game the system.Just the other day, an internal recruiter told me that in the last month, she reviewed 1,000 resumes, interviewed 30 candidates, and hired 10 people. That’s a 3% interview rate and a 0.5% hire rate.No one can say that’s an efficient system with a straight face.Due to the sheer volume of applicants for every role, companies rely on algorithms to filter out resumes that don’t meet certain criteria. But everyone knows that by now. It’s common knowledge that candidates have to match their resumes to keywords from the job description if they want to beat the recruitment “filters.” Unsurprisingly, that approach incentivizes almostOf course, inaccurate data causes problems for companies that depend on resumes to evaluate candidates. Because even if candidates have optimized their resumes and appear to be the best hire, they aren't always able to explain why they're what the company is truly looking for. And that is valuable time wasted for both parties.To stop the cycle of harmful incentives, candidates need to be supported.After six months of job searching, it's no wonder candidates start to think, “I’ll just take what I can get.” The rent has to be paid somehow, right? But by settling for a job, people keep getting sucked into a vicious cycle of job hopping because they're using the same broken system—fueled by the same bad incentives—to do it.Instead of encouraging this cycle, the recruiting industry needs to acknowledge that people are struggling to find the right jobs because the company has taken precedence over the person.When people come first, the system is focused on the individual looking for a job, not solely on the company looking to fill a position. It aims to understand the true working behaviors of a candidate and route them to a job where they can do their best work long-term. That's why our team atBy shifting strategy to focus on people, recruiting can bring both sides to the table and stop the suffering. Because without change, the vicious job search cycle will only continue perpetuating itself—and doing a disservice to the people who rely on it for their livelihood.If you need help navigating a layoff, a rescinded offer, or other job search challenges during this time, feel free to check out",289 followers,Deepak Mehta,765,3.9K,105.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-hard-would-it-be-to-get-a-new-IT-job-in-a-post-COVID-world
