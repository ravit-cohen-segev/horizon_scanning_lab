India is an emerging major economy and is expected to grow faster in the coming years and subsequently overtake Brittain and Japan soon.India has its interest all over the world , especially in the Indian ocean . 70% of global sea trade happens through Indian ocean where India is the major player controlling the maritime affairs in the region.Being an aspiring super power ,India has been projected to a powerful country in Asia. Malaysia's economy is based mainly on export of palm oil industry and computer hardware ,rubber and tin and some other oil products . India has been the major country where the maximum exports has been receiving from Malaysia and it was a major trade partner ,India is the biggest palm oil market of Malaysia . But the recent issues between the nations made it crucial for Malaysia to export its goods to India as India stopped import of palm oils as well as put restrictions and sanctions on import from Malaysia on the backdrop of controversial statement made my Malaysian prime minister mahathir bin Mohammed. Which provoked India to take some tough decisions over Malaysia which led to sanctions.Malaysia has now realized that the sanctions and restrictions by India has impact on their economy and do not want to be confronted further and wanted to stay away from the boiling issue and send a peaceful gesture that they are not enough to fight a trade war with powerful nation like IndiaThis the reason Malaysia restrained further actions or escalations.Thank you.Also read :Also read :Also read :Top Gun Global AffairsDefense technologyNew Digital technologiesClick on the above linksüëÜFollow these spaces for amazing international affairs , current affairs and defense technology developmentsUpvote and follow me for more details",739 followers,Sreehari Nambiar VV,2.7K,544,3.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-doesnt-Malaysia-want-to-retaliate-against-India

3,"I stayed in KL for 2 months due to a business trip and I can say the Malay population there is becoming pretty fundamentalist.I can recall an incident where I took a grab taxi from the airport to the Bukit Bintang area where my hotel was and as soon as I sat in the cab the driver asked me where I was from. When I said India, his face fell and turned into a scowl. He started asking me about Zakir Naik and whether I knew about him.

When I said India, his face fell and turned into a scowl. He started asking me about Zakir Naik and whether I knew about him. I knew everything there is to know about this hate preacher but my better sense prevailed and I said I had no idea who he was. He then launched into a diatribe against India and how Muslims are being targeted and I could sense he was trying to provoke me into a debate but for my own safety I kept my mouth shut and acted dumb. When he didn't get the reply he was hoping for so he can engage me in a debate he shut up and I started chilling and enjoying the view. After sometime I was almost about to sleep as I was tired when I was woken up by a loud sound coming from the stereo. It seemed like some kind of Islamic preaching or verses. Now he was well within his rights to play what he wanted to in his car but he seemed he was deliberately playing it at full volume to inconvenience me. I kept mum and put on my headphones, when he gestured towards me and asked me if I like it. I replied that it felt peaceful and good though I was obviously lying. Some people might say it's better to follow the Philosophy of an ‚Äúeye for an eye‚Äù but I am the kind of guy who doesn't prefer to argue with radical people as it's meaningless, especially when safety is involved. When he drew into the porch of my hotel, I smiled at him, payed him and as I got out and could see there were Gurkha gaurds outside the hotel, I slammed the car door shut pretty hard as he sat gawking. Now I am not stereotyping the entire makay population there and I met plenty of forward thinking locals in KL but still I could sense creeping Islamic fundamentalism.Edit 1:When this question popped up in my feed and I wrote this answer as I could immediately recall the above incident, I couldn't have imagined in my wildest dreams it will get these many upvotes. Thanks :)To give some context to the above incident, this happened in 2017 before mahathir came to power. I have not been to KL since but my friends there have told me the situation has become worse. I would like to clarify that I am not painting the whole Malay population with the same brush. There are genuinely nice, forward thinking and open minded malays, especially amongst millennials and gen z who are urbanized. In fact it was one of malay friends who was introduced to me by a common friend who showed around Langkawi and personally took me to the famous hotspots there. The day I reached there it was raining, but she still took me around and even patiently took my pics at skybridge even though it was raining as I had to catch a flight back the same day. I also made many Malaysian Chinese friends who are nice people but I got the sense from them that they resented the bhumputera privileges given to Muslim Malays by the Malaysian govt where they got special quotas in college and government jobs. The sad part is the politicians of Malaysia are fishing in troubled waters and created hatred between communities for votes.there.",6 followers,Param Goyal,1K,108,1.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-doesnt-Malaysia-want-to-retaliate-against-India

The Centre has also decided the refined palm oil will be shifted to a restricted category, requiring importers to obtain a licence from Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) to prevent ""harm to the domestic industry"", the note from Cabinet Secretariat says.The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has been directed to notify technical standards for microprocessors by the month-end. To curb unrestricted imports into India from countries like Malaysia, a mechanism for the stringent enforcement of the standards is being worked out. The Customs Department has also been asked to conduct a thorough inspection of microprocessors being imported from Malaysia.Mahathir said in October that India ""invaded and occupied"" Kashmir, a disputed Muslim-majority region also claimed by Pakistan. Last month he said India was stoking unrest with its new citizenship law, which critics say undermines the country's secular foundations.Palmolein is a liquid form of palm oil used in cooking.New Delhi had earlier this week informally asked palm oil refiners and traders to avoid buying Malaysian palm oil.Malaysia is in a lose-lose situation with this ruling,"" said Sathia Varqa owner and co-founder of Singapore-based Palm Oil Analytics, adding ""India will ramp up buying of CPO from Indonesia.""Indonesia traditionally corned around two-third of India's palm oil imports, but a lower duty on refined palm oil helped Malaysia to overtake Indonesia as India's biggest supplier in 2019.Palm oil is crucial for the Malaysian economy as it accounts for 2.8% of gross domestic product and 4.5% of total exports.

As a result, India is planning to impose trade sanctions on Malaysia. For example, curbing the import of palm oil, India is the largest importer of palm oil from Malaysia.Now comes, why Malaysia doesn't want to retaliate with similar measures against India. Fundamental number four might is right. That means India is a big market for Malaysian products, India is a big economy. if we look at the trade for 2018‚Äì19 Malaysia‚Äôs export to India was $11billion and India export to Malaysia for 2018‚Äì19 was $ 6.4 billion. So who is gaining from the bilateral trade, obviously, Malaysia with a $4.6 billion trade surplus with India??Now it would unwise for Malaysia to retaliate against India as this will make no sense because it is Malaysia who is gaining more from the trade. Therefore, realism prevails over idealism in IR.In conclusion, Malaysia should not have interfered with the internal matters of other countries.

In the contemporary era invasions are pretty much out, especially if you are not a superpower. Iraq was many times more powerful than Kuwait when Saddam invaded Kuwait. Saddam and Iraq both paid dearly for that excursion.US could enter into Afghanistan and Iraq only on the pretext of changing an evil regime & getting out. Even that proved to be very, very expensive. Russia played a game in Georgia and got a nose cut. Although they are armed to teeth, many times more powerful than Ukraine and with nuclear weapons, their Crimea excursion was at an extreme cost. This is despite the small size of Crimea and Russia's historical claim.Forget about Indonesia, Malaysia cannot even invade Brunei unless they want to see a repeat of Iraq 1991.

As long as we are willing to take that one short cut in order to reach home sooner, even if we're driving on the wrong side of the street, we are not going to be a significant power, leave alone superpower.The reason is this - we need to be able to trust each other immensely. That's how we win, because we don't have to watch out against each other. Let me give you a cricketing example. If our strike bowler has total confidence in the slip cordon being able to catch every edge, he can swing it outside the off stump and get wickets, and make the team win.Instead, if somebody at mid on keeps shouting, ""You're going to get whacked for six, idiot!"" when he runs into bowl, makes fun of his gait, and the wicketkeeper and fielders all stand around joking, not paying attention, you can imagine how well he is going to perform.When a fielder attempts a run out with a fierce throw, if there's no fielder backing up to prevent overthrows, he won't even throw! India functions like this - for every one step someone takes forward, there are always ten other idiots ridiculing him and taking ten steps back, just to see that one guy looking miserable!When all of us respect our Constitution, pay our taxes and take our responsibilities as seriously as our rights, we will have a semblance of an orderly nation. When we have enough and more reason to trust each other to do the right thing, we will automatically see the benefits of having a nation in the first place.Indians are too freaking absorbed being ourselves. ""We are like this only"" is not going to cut it for attitude if we are to survive and thrive in an increasingly competitive world. Beyond blaming others for everything, expecting miracles, and false pride, our downfall is going to be because we're incompetent, steeped in illegality, corrupt, and uncaring for most part.I haven't seen any big shift in attitude to believe India is going to be any kind of power anytime soon.

So these are my personal views apart from millions of other ways to make India a super power. Now let's see‚Ä¶.What is the primary difference between an emerging economy like India and a super power like USA?You might say these many trillion dollars economy or per capita income of this much compared to India's case blah blah blah‚Ä¶But what you are saying is about Quantitative factors which doesn't explain anything except proving that huge disparity exists in Quantitative terms.What is the qualitative cause of this Quantitative difference ?The answer lies primarily in Know-how or technology or Knowledge (whichever word you choose).India can outnumber USA in the quantity of Shoes produced, Steel produced etc. In fact, China already does that in many quantitative ways but are nowhere close near the super power tag which USA so richly deserves. USSR did that too before its collapse. India produces many stuff particularly Agri products in much more quantity.USA is the super power because of the technological difference in terms of doing things betterSo How do we go about increasing the know-how of our Country?The simple answer is Research. It is the thing which can make us knowledge producers rather than knowledge consumers by just adopting or buying US technology, apps, defence equipments.Now the way to do it is not as simple as allocating more money from the Union Budget to Research for there are equally pressing and urgent allocation needed for Infrastructure, Poverty alleviation, Agriculture etc.Besides, Research is something which gives diminishing returns and one of the most cost-inefficient method is what is practiced by USA probably because only they have the deep pockets to throw away money that way. That explains why ISRO does things cheaply which NASA does at 100 times the cost. Research in general happens and is efficient in a framework of lack as well as genuine restriction and starving of funds is good idea.Now we are in a catch-22 situation! We want to increase research output but can't just throw away money as it will only decrease output per dollar. We can't throw too much money at research nor can afford to ignore it.What is the way out?The way out is to create huge number of research institute and make passionate people work there without adequate funds to put wings to their ideas. A huge decentralized framework will ensure that these research institute are not brimming with funds but are also producing results.The major challenge here being that Scientist look for greener and well paid pastures which again USA provide them. This challenge is not going away anytime soon and will take time. India will become a super power when this brain drain problem is addressed.Apart from the know-how at the topmost level, the distribution of know-how should be also among the lower classes as these are the mass number which can drive up the average knowledge of a country. Our best minds like Satya Nadella, Sundar Pichai and the likes are already competing with the best minds of USA. Our average minds of India still have a long way to go to compete against average American. An average American reads about a 100 times more books per annum than an average Indian although we have bridged disparity at top most level. Skill development and Education should be top most priority to ensure that.Now the second part is regarding the availability of scalability of ideas or know-how which the research centre produce which is a function of economic growth, size and ecosystem. This part if much easier and we are reaching a point where more and more ideas don't die and get scaled to prove it's potential.Till few decades back, it was not the case.What would have happened if Google was invented in India?It would have died down before being scaled and convinced the innovator what a lousy idea it was until an American does the same and scales it up with easy availability of capital.Wait‚Ä¶.Did it already happen? It's scary to think how many good ideas may have bit dust before scaling up to levels where it was feasible. Not all ideas are feasible in small scale.The second part is easier one as the growing economy of any country finds itself lush with easy money to fund almost anything while good ideas in a poor economy may die down for lack of funds. So therein lies the fundamental problem apart from millions others which this great nation faces.The day India has the largest number of Libraries and the day when the Book Publishing Industry in India gets bigger in size than that of USA is the day we can call ourselves Super power.China with it's closed minds and closed governance model can't think nor innovate like USA.India is much nearer to that goal and Nalanda and Takshila of our ancient times can be recreated","84,239 followers",Igor Markov,3.3K,3.9K,49.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-doesnt-Malaysia-want-to-retaliate-against-India

Anyway, China and India share a border of about 2,000 kilometers. But. the border disputes were negative legacies mainly due to former British rule to India.The two neighbors are both big nations and major powers in Asia. We Chinese value ‚Äúharmonious development‚Äù and think we should have harmonious relations between human and nature, among nations, among co-workers, among family members......When we call for ‚Äúwin-win‚Äù cooperation, we are not just taking it as a slogan, instead, we are really hoping so and inserting efforts to do so.Then, to the question:India is recently forging closer ties with the US, Japan, and Australia, etc., trying to form a ‚Äúdiamond‚Äù to contain China‚Äôs development.

Do they have any idea that India is just taken as a ‚Äúchessman‚Äù by others?So, my suggestion would be: whether China will become a ‚Äúsuperpower‚Äù or not, both China and India should first focus in their internal issues, to develop a more completed industry system, to catch up with the new waves of technological innovation, to build better infrastructures, to provide better education and social welfare, to create a sounder international environment...... for the two nations and their people.

Is it our population / the highest democracy / literacy rate / resources / agriculture / industrial development?? The answer would be as difficult as India‚Äôs dream to becoming a superpower in next 2/3 decades. Maybe we are growing on papers but practically the poor is getting poorer. Let me take this opportunity to throw light on some facts:Factors affecting India‚Äôs growthI. Population1) Illiteracy2) Less use of contraceptives3) Reduced mortality rate due to improved medical facilities4) Only certain sections of people following ‚Äúfamily planning‚Äù5) Early marriage system especially in interiors6) Little recreation available in villages / non-urbanized areas7) Illegal migration from neighboring countries like Nepal & Bangladesh8) Population density per area ‚Äì Canada‚Äôs is 3.7 persons per Sq km, India is 382 persons per Sq km (Year 2011)OverpopulationChina enforced ‚Äúone child policy‚Äù for 3 decades by deputing half a million people to make sure it‚Äôs implemented well. Unlike China, Indian Govt & the policy makers are no able to even think of implementing ‚Äúone child per family policy‚Äù due to democracy & vote bank politics.II. Poverty1) Low Agriculture production2) Limited natural resources, underutilized human & capital resources3) Low level of social set-up4) Political factor ‚Äì poor leadership & bad governance5) Malnourished childrenPoverty causes ill-effects like hunger, illness, crimes & wrong upbringing of children who are supposed be future of the country. It is difficult to make healthy & skilled labor off poor. A hungry person cannot think beyond his daily bread.III. Corruption1) Greed for money ‚Äì the funds allotted for development do not reach the poor & needy. Bureaucrats talk big but ‚Äúunder the table money‚Äù rules2) Hunger for power ‚Äì the urge that comes after money3) Mismanagement ‚Äì uncontrolled administration gives rise to corruption4) Tax evasions by rich class ‚Äìpoliticians, businessmen & high salaried aren‚Äôt honest when it comes to pay taxes5) Conflict of interest in people ‚Äì just to quote an example, our PM declared6) Lack of moral values ‚Äì many citizens don‚Äôt follow ethics leaving wrong impression on the younger generationThe corruption leads to loss of national wealth & eventually the people‚Äôs money. Corruption is the biggest threat to development of a country, no matter the country excels in education & technology.IV. Education1) Schools & coaching classes‚Äô nexus ‚Äì parents pay exorbitant fees for coaching classes just to get numbers to qualify for IITs & NITs, making2) Traditional pattern ‚Äì the same old pattern should be changed to exposure of outer world. It‚Äôs high time that skills like time management & personal development should be taught from school level itself.3) Language ‚Äì sudden shift from vernacular school to English medium college turns out to be a nightmare for most students especially the ones from villages. We cannot afford to underestimate necessity of universal language by just stressing on mother tongue. It‚Äôs not difficult for students to be ‚Äúbilingual / multilingual‚Äù if they start learning English at an early age.4) University & faculty ‚Äì Many Institutes & Universities mushrooming in the country fail to maintain their standard even close to international standards. No wonder why over 65000 engineering seats got wasted last year in Maharashtra. Politicians & businessmen are building up spanking college & university structures by investing their money with business perspective, not in noble education. Too add on, there is massive shortage of good faculties & the teachers, who are good, dictate their monetary terms with private coaching institutes.5) Lack of job-friendly education ‚Äì a fresh graduate or even MBA struggles to get job in relevant field. Campus job opportunities are offered only to Engineers from IITs or NITs & MBAs from ITMs.6) Reservation: Caste based reservation kills hopes of many deserving students in the merit list. It was justified during 10 years of independence but now it is turning out to be a curse for open category. It‚Äôs high time that the Govt either puts an end to it or makes itV. Unemployment1) Theory based education ‚Äì our education has with very little or no practical / job orientation.2) Agriculture not encouraged ‚Äì I remember Hindi movies often showing a scene in good-old days where father works in farms seeing off his son, flying out of India for higher studies. Every farmer/labor wants his next generation to be high profile educated individuals.It‚Äôs quite unfortunate that our farmers are committing suicide out of poverty. Indian agriculture is genuinely suffering from natural & administration issues like irrigation, fertilization, technology. Agriculture being seasonal creates unemployment too.3) Economic growth ‚Äì fluctuations in economy do not provide enough job opportunities. It has also leaded to fall of small industries.4) Cyclic nature of businesses ‚Äì low or seasonal consumer demand creates cyclical unemployment.5) Automization ‚Äì unemployment is expected to fall further especially in developed & developing countries. Computers & machines took over most jobs already & robots are poised to rock the industries in future.VI. DefenseVII. Infrastructure, Development & PeopleInfrastructure is the biggest hurdle of country‚Äôs ‚ÄúMake in India‚Äù program. We need much more on road & rail connectivity especially in metro cities. Before announcing new projects, we must complete current projects by deadline. In the past, the money allocated to state municipalities were not used effectively due to lack of capacity & mismanagement. Planning on public health, waste management, sanitation is poor. The best example of unplanned urbanization isTo add there seems to be communal disharmony amongst people in country with some political entities still spewing venom. The crime rate increasing in the capital city itself is not a good sign. The law word is taken very lightly in India with complex judicial system.

The clock speeds are not that much faster than that of any PC and may even be slightly slower to maximize performance per watt, which is the real limit these days on the performance of massive systems since they run out of megawatts before they run out of floor space or money. The huge difference between the power of a PC and the power of the largest systems at NASA, DOE, DOD, etc. comes from operating all the processors in parallel, not from using some kind of single super-processor with huge amounts of memory or disk or high clock rate. The single super-processor approach died out in the 1980s.",9 followers,Andrew McGregor,1.1K,13K,67.2M,2014,https://www.quora.com/Why-doesnt-Malaysia-want-to-retaliate-against-India

They don't really make supercomputers, but they claim to assemble clusters which might be mythical-FLOPS machines. Apple Macs have comparatively little penetration in most of NASA due to some pronouncements in the 1990s by the JSC CIO to try to save money which irked Apple.NASA can barely manage its computer force to stay within the top 10 of the Top-500. It has to compete against the other needs of the Agency. The Space Station only recently switched to Linux despite Unix being suggested back about 1986.Most NASA employees have PCs and a few Macs on their desks which they struggle to keep current (the Federal govt. in general, not a unique problem). NASA is tending to outsource IT services (with an old IBM Federal Systems bias). Most people would be amazed how computer phobic NASA is (it goes back to pilots and their support crews, and a lot of it was analog).I've visited the centers at LLNL, LANL, the CIA and the NSA (the latter 2 especially post-Cold War and pre-9/11 when the IC was on the verge of downsizing) and they all have more incentive and far more powerful supercomputer centers now, and the latter are not accurately noted on the Top-500 list, and people knowledgeable about the organization of the DOD will also notice the NRO and NGA are missing (like the CIA and USAF, IBM shops).",10 followers,Sam Lee,1.3K,387,1.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-doesnt-Malaysia-want-to-retaliate-against-India
36,"The trend in supercomputing is to use commodity CPU's so that actual processors, ram, Ghz, and OS for a single node is really no different from the processors, ram, Ghz, and OS that you can get for a high end desktop machine.

Also one *huge* problem is power and cooling.  Each node consumes 500-1000 watts.  Put 2000 of them together, and you are talking about massive cooling and power issues.The reason for this is economics.  There are not enough supercomputers to justify custom designing a chip for supercomputing.  However, there are hundred of millions of people willing to play video games, and people design chips and CPU's for gamers, and then tweak them a bit, add interconnects, and you have a supercomputer.",0 followers,Sriramachandran,529,0,0,2014,https://www.quora.com/Why-doesnt-Malaysia-want-to-retaliate-against-India

In my 30 year career, I‚Äôve worked in most of the above fields.

Things always change in software development and continuous (more or less) learning is required for a successful career. For example, I learned C in college but studied C++ on my own (C++ was not a real thing in the early 1980s). I‚Äôve learned (and largely forgotten) more languages since college than I did in college. I‚Äôve even seen the downfall of once-mighty COBOL and FORTRAN.","1,399 followers",Kaushal Sen Sharma,12.1K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-doesnt-Malaysia-want-to-retaliate-against-India
