We are still trying to reach another planet that is our neighbor. Reaching a planet that is light years away is a very distant dream and might at all not be possible.So, assume that some aliens manage to reach us. This will mean that they have conquered all the challenges that we are facing in space travel. That means that their technology is advanced enough to allow this!Also, if you generally see around us, ifThanks for the A2A.We as a species are trying to reach the stars for a while now.

Research done in one field can be useful in many other fields. Thus, aliens who have space travel capabilities might have other advanced technologies as well.This is the usual reason we picture aliens are technologically superior, always.",33 followers,Erik Day,9.5K,582,384.3K,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-we-consider-that-aliens-have-Advanced-Technology-than-us
1,"“Technology” may be defined as the methods of applying an art or science. (Excerpted from L. Ron Hubbard). There are a wide variety of aliens.

They may have mastered inter dimensional relocation.The fact that they have not destroyed themselves with this they may advanced tech (assuming along with advanced travel, they have sophisticated weapons) suggests their social structure is such that they have learned not to harm themselves or others. That puts them way ahead of us in social development tech. But, it is possible that they have been roaming the universes for so many eons that while maintaining the travel tech their social skills may have stultified, even deteriorated. Their morals could be as barbaric as they have become living appendages to their spacecraft which they have inhabited for many generations. They depend upon & love their space ship as sailors love their ships. But, that does not make them kindly or socially advanced.Once in space they inevitably have encountered other traveling entities. They have learned to communicate well enough not to hurt each other & to forge alliances or groups like federations for their mutual survival. Again, suggesting highly evolved societies that one expects to go along with very very advanced technology.","220,605 followers",Franklin Veaux,679,47.3K,782.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-we-consider-that-aliens-have-Advanced-Technology-than-us

3,"The answer is WE DEFINITELY HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT ANYTHING PERTAINING TO ALIENS. truth is we know nothing about aliens and never will because they are too far (if they exist). The only thing we can statisticly conclude is that there is a high likelihood that they exist because we calculate there are 100 billion galaxies and each galaxy has 100 billion stars, so they likely exist. It would take 100000 years minimum (if we could go as fast as light) to cross our galaxy, that's how vast it is.",UNKNOWN,Ernest W.

4,"No, it’s not aliens. Shame on you—that’s incredibly insulting to millions of people who work very hard.It’s much simpler than that. As we learn more about the physical world, we develop better and better tools. As we develop better tools, we learn faster. As we learn faster, we develop better tools.No aliens required. No outside help at all required. Just millions of people working very hard to develop better tools, and use those tools to develop better knowledge.",4 followers,Dan Bradbury,635,21.7K,235.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-we-consider-that-aliens-have-Advanced-Technology-than-us

Buy the early 1940s if witnessed are to be believed there was active intelligence operatives bring back pieces of information. This was so disturbing and out of any normal situation and multiply complex and out of anyone’s control that nothing any civilians could do was said to be able to help. Everybody it is said thought general populations should not be told because they would simply become despondent. The toughest part was the experts were never all sure they knew what was going on, so why tell what you are not sure about. The visitors were multiply disorganized themselves and on different agendas, the least of which might be called tourism the scariest was untellable in nice company. Few were immediately affected so why make everybody worry about what could not be certain was even going on. That is collected ideas from thousands of sources for which many fringe insiders had glimpses of but never as they understood it full knowledge. This always seemed to me like the story of the blind men feeling the elephant. As much as I can read and research there was no clarity since countless people I sought out who spent their lives researching told me what they had learned from their contacts and associations. More miss information and uncertainties than real knowable information. Concrete stories were being told people and these repeatedly passed their due dates or were proven by research to be false. Releasing everything or full disclosure would be like starting a major global forest fire of roomer mills when right now most people move forward without any distractions from the few occasional information camp fires isolated by good containment. In the end the science based universe of spontainious creation has taken on a fabrication and even simulation aspect that religions try to hijack as there own belief vindication. But the big man in the sky is looking more like just curious big minds trying to stay entertained in viewing eternity and we are the result of that process. Lucky us for without what ever is going on we would not exist at all and the beautiful art gallery planet as living interacting parts of this art in which we exist would not be happening. I just want to continue working, building, inventing, decorating, eating good food, seeking entertainment and watching occasional sunsets from interesting vantage points. This is my part of participating as an artist inside a vast never ending work of art. Enjoy yourself, do something productive and useful for you and the others around you.

6,"We could make the first UFO-alike airplane/spaceship. After all thousands of people shared their dreams and visions on what such a spaceship should do, directly or indirectly. In fact round the 50s there was a UFO-airplane that could take of vertically and move around. Well… not really. They never achieved to control the thing. But a drone could do the job now.

7,"The US is the most technologically advanced nation there ever was, so obviously not! I had the privilege of living there for 4 years in the 90s. It was a little like a sci-fi movie when someone gets transported to the future - I would just wander about gazing at the technological marvels that surrounded me. Just to pick out some of the highlights:1) Domestic life - I was once visiting a friend’s house and their mother happened to be loading clothes into the washing machine.

It was a little like a sci-fi movie when someone gets transported to the future - I would just wander about gazing at the technological marvels that surrounded me. Just to pick out some of the highlights:1) Domestic life - I was once visiting a friend’s house and their mother happened to be loading clothes into the washing machine. She turned to me and said, “Do you have washing machines in Scotland?” Obviously, I was forced to admit, that no we didn’t. Instead we just went down to the river and bashed our clothes off rocks to clean them.2) Transport - I spent two weeks in the lovely town of Columbia. Missouri. There I amazed the locals with my insistence on using a strange outmoded form of transport known as “walking”. Locals would slow down as they passed in their modern cars, pointing and laughing. To them, it must have been like watching a live action version of the Flintstones.3) Voting – would you believe it, but in the UK we still vote by drawing a little X next to the candidate we want to vote for. No sign of the advanced electronic voting they have over in the states. Indeed, we are so old fashioned that we haven’t even outsourced our voting to the Russians yet!4) Guns – It may be hard for an American to believe but almost nobody in the UK owns their own guns. This means that if we have to rise up and overthrow our own government (currently seems like a good plan) then we will be armed with nothing more than some particularly well sharpened sarcasm.Still, perhaps one day we can hope to be as advanced as the US. And there is some hope, as we now have our very own version of Donald Trump as PM!4K","68,794 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-we-consider-that-aliens-have-Advanced-Technology-than-us
