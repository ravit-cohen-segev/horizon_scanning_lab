People in the United States suddenly were eating sushi and reading ‘The Book of Five Rings’ because they figured there was some mystical Japanese samurai spirit to being successful.We wondered at how these drunk, karaoke singing, badly dressed, submissive worker ants from a tiny country whose ass we kicked only a few decades ago suddenly were on the verge of having the most powerful economy in the world.And Korea was desperately trying to catch up following the Japanese model, but their economy was so weak that the IMF had to take over. If you walked through Seoul in the late 1990s you would see signs on businesses noting IMF pricing. It was like the Red Cross coming to the rescue of catastrophic disaster victims. If you bought something there, it would disintegrate within a week, and you felt like an idiot for not spending the money for the Japanese item first on something you then had to buy twice.Meanwhile China was taking over the bulk of cheap manufacturing. It could have just as easily been Malaysia or the Philippines raking in the cheap manufacturing dollars, but it was China because they had a national plan and strategy. They didn't follow the Japanese model. They didn't worship Japan’s bubble economic success and all that came with it.At first it was all very simple stuff to make, with low quality materials, but now it's your iPhone. In fact now, if you're in Japan, the culturally iconic clothing of kimono, jinbei, geta, and so forth may be made in China because of Japan's desperate labor shortage and unwillingness to accept immigrants working in anything other than low pay, blue collar jobs. Japan resists diversity of talent, ideas, and particularly ethnicity. But not China, because China has always been diverse, has plenty of people.Fifteen years ago consumer technology in Japan was five to ten years ahead of any other country. It was the future. Now the world has certainly caught up, and China has found its second wind.I'm not saying China no longer makes cheap crap, or that the standard of living has surpassed Japan and Korea, but Korea is only about five years into making high quality manufactured goods, Japan has slowed down to a crawl and started falling behind, while Chinese have more new billionaires, has the most people traveling worldwide, and is experiencing rapid growth without the bubble.So maybe Chinese brand products aren't currently top quality, but you shouldn't be surprised if they are in as little as five years, and that they stay that way, because what China is doing right that Japan and the United States have done wrong is raised the overall prosperity of everyone in the country. Japan and the US care about the overall GDP, companies making money, the prosperity of the country itself and its business leaders. China on the other hand would like everyone in China to benefit, for everyone to prosper, so that no one is dependent or subservient to their employer or the state.

Just for the sake of argument, is there a number which if subtracted from its square happens to equal exactly 1, even though the number itself is irrational?  Turns out there is.  We'd write this as:x^2 - x = 1If we solve forAnd there's a bit more.  Before I defined the Fibonacci Sequence as starting at 0.  But in fact, you can generate a Fibonacci Sequence starting with any 2 numbers.  Suppose you start with:19 and 782.  Then the next term is 801, then 1583, then 2384, then 3967.

Start near one end of the board, and line up the 3"" mark on one side, and the 9"" mark on the opposite side. The distance between those divisions is exactly 6"". So, move 3"" from either side and put a mark halfway (6"").Now move the ruler toward the opposite end. Here, you could line up the 6"" mark on one side, and the 12"" mark on the other. The distance between the 2 is 6"", and half that is exactly 3"". Make a mark at 9"". Doesn't matter what divisions you use, as long as you can calculate the halfway point precisely.

25,The four color theorem is one of my favorite. No one can draw shapes on a piece of paper such that you need more than four colors to color them in and ensure no two touching shapes will have the same color. Check it out...or look at any colored map...This comes from graph theory and occurs because all planer graphs must be colorable by 4 or less different colors.The four color theorem is one of my favorite.

But it is no “complex"" computer.EDITAll the computers in the first 3 examples have complex operating systems. The last one (ATTiny85) does not have (a real) OS at all, other than some simple routines to execute a program and maybe collect garbage etc.Displaying stuff is not necessarily an important task of an OS at all. AsDisplay-or-not-display aside, “Are operating systems a must?”, you say. Well, it depends.For “complex” computers, Yes. Because complex computers are supposed to be running multiple complex software programs simultaneously in a multi-tasking manner. And this is where an OS shines. The OS manages all the resources these programs need, loads their machine code to the CPU to run, allocates them the RAM required, re-acquires the RAM when a program quits, and manages all the processes inside the computer etc. This is no simple work.For “less complex” computers, well it depends. 286 computers runs on MS-DOS operating system, which runs programs one by one (non-multitasking). But a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) does not have an OS (yet it display a lot of beautiful things ;). It will run whatever program in the cartridge you insert to the system.For “very simple computers”, No. Like the ATTiny85, these computers are meant to run a single piece of code loaded into the “program” memory space inside the chip. As soon as there is power, the program will run. Not many processes to manage, not much else to do house-keeping.So to conclude","1,886 followers",John Weintraub,655,1.8K,10.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-China-not-make-quality-products-like-Japan-and-Korea-do

So even if you were only going to run a single program, an OS is still useful because it gives you a ready-made library of hardware drivers and the like — services you might want to use in your single program.Screens are just one of the many resources that an OS manages. If your computer is truly “complex” — able to run more than one program — then it needs an OS. And even if it will only run one program, an OS is still useful.The only time I have see a computer seriously run without an OS (I think) was when a PC was booted with a disk that contained a single game (Frogger). The game itself was the operating system, you might say. It controlled disk access, the screen, and all other resources. Those were the days.","29,923 followers",Barry Rountree,702,7.3K,39.8M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-China-not-make-quality-products-like-Japan-and-Korea-do

Excelled in most subjects in school.But I am terrible at math. And I get sick just looking at vertigo-inducing things like roller coasters. So my dreams of becoming an astronaut faded away. So did any hopes of becoming a strong engineer that could support NASA missions, like the people at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Living in the landlocked Midwest, far from any launch sites, my family could never travel to see any launches. To this day, I’ve never witnessed any rocket launch—and not from any fault in trying. My handful of trips to Florida are peppered with launch postponements.So over the years, I could only watch films of past missions, and with others today, streamed videos of a launch.My first space simulator was a Space Shuttle simulator that ran on a 1986 Macintosh Plus computer with an insane (at the time) 1 MB of RAM. It was slow and overly complicated. I quickly lost interest in trying to play it.Decades later, I hear about this Kerbal thing. And one day, I looked it up. It looked interesting, and I heard good things about it. The US $40 price tag was attractive. It supported all kinds of computers, including consoles like the XBox and Playstation 4.I gave it a go.KSP greatly magnified my understanding of orbital mechanics. Rendezvous. Delta-V. Launch windows. Spacecraft design. Deorbiting. Powered descent. Gravity assists. Why going to your innermost planet is an energy stealing pain in the ass. And much more.KSP isn’t a 100% scaled solar system like our own. It can’t simulate the super-complex gravitational influences of the real universe.

So after several iterations of a design I finally settled on a ship that largely used old (and cheap) components with some newer more powerful rocket engines and the mission was underway!Stage 1 of the mission was to ascend to near space and create a stable orbit about 88k kilometers above the planet which I achieved with relative ease.Stage 2 was to align the vessel dubbed “Munshot” so that I could make the trip from Kerbol to an orbit around mun. In this phase it took me several orbits around Kerbol before I could get a good alignment and I burned through far more fuel than anticipated.Back at ground control there was some consternation. I wasn't sure that there was enough rocket fuel to finish the mission. After much deliberation I shrugged my shoulders and decided “Eh… might as well go for it!” Now Herman was very excited, despite the low fuel he had full confidence in his mission as judged by the huge smile in his face, though in hindsight the only thing that outstripped Herman's bravery was his stupidity so he was always pretty confident anyway.Stage 3 was to head for Mun, achieved by reaching the side of Kerbol farthest from Mun and extending the orbit until we passed by the planet's satellite.We reached Mun! Here I flirted with the idea of just letting Munshot return to Kerbol. I only had a few minutes to make a decision and seeing Herman's smiling beaming face convinced me to proceed as planned.Stage 4 was to orbit Mun and gather some observational data by having my daring pilot look out the single window in the command module and describe what he sees. This would have yielded me precious precious science to be used for further technological advances.Stage 5 was return to Kerbol. So when it came time to line up a return trip it was all power to thrusters and… we only got a partial escape from orbit when we ran out of fuel.Stage 6a oh shit oh shit, damn, now what?Stage 6b eject the command module toward Kerbol and cross your digits!Stage 7 how the hell did that work?By this point Herman and the Munshot command module, devoid of any type of propulsion, were traveling at a crawl through space toward Kerbol by sheer inertia. To lift his spirits I set the command module into a spin to amuse him. He seemed to like that. I tried to develop the tech to stage a rescue mission but eventually the Munshot command module made it back to Kerbol on its own and survived reentry without me even noticing thanks to my built in safety precautions. Despite spending 16 months in the Munshot command module after his mission Herman Kerble became the first Kerbol to set foot on Minimus 4 months later.KSP is worth every penny I paid for it.",62 followers,Jonathan Miller,672,854,3.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-China-not-make-quality-products-like-Japan-and-Korea-do
