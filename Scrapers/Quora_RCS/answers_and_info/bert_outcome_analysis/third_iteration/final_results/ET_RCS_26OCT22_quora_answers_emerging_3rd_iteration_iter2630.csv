1,"It could to a certain point yes. In war; training, experience, and moral are for the most part more important than technology. Strategy used properly can and will cripple a more technologically advanced army, it's happened time and time again throughout history. However, history has also shown technology to overwhelm as well, such as in the decline and inevitable defeat of the samurai. So the answer is going to be either yes or no, depending on the degree of the technology and the intelligence/experience of the underdog.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/In-war-could-advanced-technology-compensate-for-poor-inadequate-training
2,"Not really.. particularly, the 3 you mentioned in parenthesis. Most would be of minimal helpful value against the modern US military, particularly since we’re taking it as a given that the rebels have no real training in small unit tactics or in military strategy. In short, their advanced tech would help them gain an advantage if used intelligently for a brief period, then they’d get crushed. The US military is built and trained to be adaptable, down to the smallest unit level.","68,795 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/In-war-could-advanced-technology-compensate-for-poor-inadequate-training
3,"The answer for this question is rather difficult to contemplate, in part because the basic assumption — that religion hindered science — is partially false.It is certain that, in some periods of humanity's history, religion really antagonized and/or outright attacked science and the scientific knowledge.

It is also true that in some instances this antagonism brought scientific inquire and technological advancements to a halt.However it is also true that nearly as often religious organizations — like churches, monasteries, etc. — worked deliberately and sistematically to preserve the technological, scientific and philosophical knowledge of the civilizations of the past as well as the present knowledge.Also it is true that in certain historic periods religious organizations promoted educational and literacy actions, funded educational organizations like libraries, schools, universities and other learning institutions.It is also true that in certain historic periods, these religious organizations funded the research of many scholars as well as gave them a way of living by promoting and paying for their teaching activities and their studies, which the same organizations usually put a fair amount of effort in preserving for posterity.These movements where religion is sometimes pro and some other times against scientific knowledge constantly alternating one another, is recurrent in the history of all human civilizations from the Sumerians 3300 BCE to 21st century western society.It is worth of note that usually the periods where people are more prone to radical and fundamentalistic views are periods where their civilization is plagued by wars and/or in outright decline. Which in consequence are periods where religion takes a more antagonistic, and even violent, attitude against scientifical technological knowledge.I’m no historian, but at least to me, it seems that civilization decline and war are the main drive of movements that halt (and sometimes even destroy) scientific and technological knowledge and development, far more so than purely religion itself.It is naive to think that if we never had religion (or any other simplistic set factors) our scientific and technological development would be far greater than what we have today. Human nature and scientific and technological development are far more complex than that.Both science and religion are social processes that reflect the ins and outs, ups and downs of the society from which they originate, and there is an intrinsic relationship between the social, politic and economic evolution of a civilization and how they originate both the scientific and religious views of that societ.Even if we somehow could have a society devoid of religion and sustain it for 5000+ years, there are no guarantee that our cientific advancement would be greater, because a lot of times conflict (either internal or external) is the main driver of the development of scientifical and technological advancements. If you take out conflict, there's no guarantee that the same piece of knowledge or technology would happen.","2,477 followers",Jahnu Dasa,5.4K,3.3K,4.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/In-war-could-advanced-technology-compensate-for-poor-inadequate-training

6,"Through the extent of recorded history, religion may have hindered science a little. But not as much as you might think.

We can transplant hearts, send things to mars, split the atom now because humankind always asked questions about what we learned the day before. We asked, and continue to ask, questions at a pace that is more limited by what we have previously learned than by what we previously believed.What gets in the way of the advancement of knowledge through time has been and continues to be mankind’s conceit. It seems to stand strong against the torrents of verifiable evidence and sound logic that should quickly reshape our knowledge but cannot.In my opinion, One example of this falls to what I think is one of the fundamentals of advancement in knowledge. It is the standardization of the language of measurement for the purpose of collaboration. You can imagine how difficult collaboration might be if you measured things in kilograms, I measured the same thing in dattles, and others measured it in quams, ginns or boubies.While still imperfect, our Standard International (SI) units go a long way to the aid the advancement of knowledge. We still have some conceitful, anthropocentric basis for our SI, but we now have finally moved away from our arbitrarily defined samples (e.g. the platinum standard for mass) and reduced the bases of measurement to unchanging physical phenomena. This conversion is not old. In fact, the latest conversions will take effect in May of this year (2019).Now let us continue to recognize and eliminate the conceit.",0 followers,Peter,1.9K,43.6K,167.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-religion-had-not-hindered-science-would-we-be-more-advanced-technologically-and-scientifically
7,"Your premise is wrong. Most scientists have a religious back ground. Science is based on the fact that the entire Universe is based on laws and principles that are universal. The Jewish religion first stated this, followed by the Christians and Muslims. Other religions also provided a sense of order that encourages logical thinking. For example look at the history of the Jesuits and Confusism.",0 followers,Peter,1.6K,43.6K,167.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-religion-had-not-hindered-science-would-we-be-more-advanced-technologically-and-scientifically
8,"It’s not so sure that we will be more advanced.Sometimes the willing of “breaking convention, breaking laws” is the best motivational push we can dream of.Maybe something we know today is due to the will of someone to go against a belief that someone wanted everyone to believe, and without that imposition there was not the need to disprove the belief.",5 followers,Jake Williams,3.1K,3.2K,76.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-religion-had-not-hindered-science-would-we-be-more-advanced-technologically-and-scientifically

Villagers asked the magician for 10,000 per monkey and they decided to take monkeys from another village.Again price went high.Magician played a trick.He said his assistant to sell all the monkeys he had for 7, 500 to the villagers.The demand was high.Villagers wanted to make more money selling monkeys at 10, 000 to the magician.So, they bought all the monkeys in ignorance from the assistant of the magician.Now, the villagers had all the monkeys but the magician had left the village with money.Now, there was no demand as the magician had gone.The monkeys were just useless for the villagers.Now, the price for the monkeys was zero.Demand went down, price went down.This is how price of the stock increases and decreases.And some stock market scams also take place this way.Manipulators buy stocks in bulk to show the demand, the stock price goes high.
