So, in the 1960’s and 1970’s, the U.S. had leadership, but only through their corporations.The Space Shuttle was the follow up to the Saturn V, and it led the world in technology for the 80’s and 90’s, except for the single launch of the Buran, which arguably was a superior vehicle, albeit one which the faltering Soviet Union couldn’t afford to maintain.And then in 2011, the Shuttle era came to an end.And, almost without anyone noticing, Russia simply inherited the title.Not through innovation. Lord knows the Soyuz and Progress rockets were both designed in the 1960’s, based on modified R7 rockets initial built from the captured V2 rockets built by the Third Reich in the mid-40’s.To this day, the Soyuz is still launchedThat’s not what I’d call “space-age technology.”The U.S. government, with the end of the shuttle, pushed for the reuse of all the parts used to make the shuttle for the new replacement Constellation program. A program that even the most optimistic estimates put at launching in the 2020’s at a cost of over $40So, Constellation was canceled, except for the Orion capsule. And then they pushed the SLS instead, still re-using the parts of the 1960’s designed Space Shuttle (along with updates from the 90’s and early 2000’s).SLS has now burned through at least $12So, China started developing space flight, and they’ve successfully put astronauts and even two space stations into orbit. But calling them advanced would ignore the fact that they have, almost bolt for bolt, copied the Russian Soyuz capsule and the Progress rocket with its horribly poisonous UDMH and N2O4 hypergolic fuel. Even Russia is retiring that sad old dinosaur.In fact, a lot of the current batch of decades-old rockets are being retired.Why?Because of two corporations. One of them is very public, and one is very secretive, but both of them have taken the Aerospace industry and shaken it to its absolute core.The public one is SpaceX, the private one is Blue Origin. Both of them went out and did what everyone said was impossible. They built new engines from scratch with new technology, put them into new rockets built from scratch with new technology, and launched them.But, more importantly, they landed them.You see, other than one part of one rocket, the shuttle orbiter, no other rocket has ever landed before. (Yes, they re-used the boosters too, but the price of refurbishing them after a dip in the ocean was arguably higher than just building them over every time, and they had to be shipped back to Utah to be refurbished anyway. If you have to take something apart down to parts, swap out half the parts, and then rebuild it — is itSo, this has scared the entire launch industry, worldwide, out of their socks.SpaceX is talking about reusing a Block 5 booster within 24 hours. They’re working on BFR, which they claim can be reused as quickly as you can refuel it.Blue Origins’ New Shepard is a bit of a hobby rocket for sightseers, but it proved out BO’s ability to land a rocket and reuse it. New Glenn is a super-heavy lifter that has yet to fly, but will have the same reusability as a SpaceX Falcon 9.And they’re not stopping there. SpaceX is already on the brink of recovering cargo fairings, which would save them $6M per flight, and they’re about to test second stage recovery, which would mean the entire consumables from a flight would basically reduce to the fuel, and a few plastic covers, a compression ring on the second stage engine bell, and a small amount of ablative heat shielding.We already know that the cost per flight for those goods is under a million dollars.We know the full cost of a Falcon 9 flown in expendable mode, is $63 million.If SpaceX can really refly a rocket 100 times, then your amortized cost per flight drops under $2M. To put 30 tons into orbit. That’s $66 per kilogram to orbit.Current spaceflight averages are in the $20,000 per kilogram to orbit. That means a 300x difference in cost.That’s not just a “leader” in space technology, that’s utterly disruptive to the whole industry.Spending $66 a kilo to put something into orbit is about three times the cost FedEx charges to ship a package overnight. Now you can get to orbit for three times the cost of sending cookies across the country as a care package. That’s going to open whole new industries in space.And no other country is close. Russia is claiming their new Angara rocket will be reusable, but they have yet to build even one.The traditional US companies are claiming Vulcan will be reusable, but they have yet to build even one, and they’re asking for $5 billion in research funding from the Air Force to build it.China is making noise about a fully reusable craft, but as I pointed out, their launch vehicle is based around the same technology that Russia has been using since the 1960’s, and they’ve taken to dropping first stages onto populated cities, which is not exactly going to be helping with national pride.The only competition for SpaceX right now is New Glenn, and that has yet to fly.In fact, their closest competitor might very well be……SpaceX.Their next rocket, the BFR (BigNo one else, no government, no nation, is even close to that.So, yeah, the leader in space right now — it’s a corporation, not a company.Honorable mentions: Rocket Lab is getting ready to send “It’s Business Time” — their latest Electron rocket — into space carrying several hundred kilos of cube-sats into orbit. They’re doing this for $7M a launch (estimated) which is still in line with the $20,000 per kilo launch price, but very few other services cater to micro-sat launches yet, so this is a way to get your own, personal cube-sat into orbit for less than the price of a new car.There’s also about a dozen other companies that are following in Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos’ footsteps and starting private launch companies. The whole industry has been re-invigorated.","68,744 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,1.2K,17.3K,413.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-ten-technologies-that-teachers-should-be-using

It will give you access to some privileges for data access about individuals and companies that is not available to every other LinkedIn users.By looking at LinkedIn profiles of Software Developers you can be able to tell a lot about a Software Developer’s experience, Projects they have worked on before and what they are capable of doing.After making good use of data provided to you by LinkedIn as a premium LinkedIn user, when you choose to engage a particular Software Developer from the Profiles you have identified, you will not be explaining some alien concept to a random Software Developer but someone who has a previous experience on a related project to what you want your ideal Software Developer to help you with.Platforms like LinkedIn do the leg work for you as they already have tonnes of data about millions of profiles registered on their platform and your search efforts is reduced significantly as you are able to narrow down to a pool of individuals who are likely your potential candidates.Another advantage of casting your nets on platforms like LinkedIn is that you find potential hopefuls who are looking to get paired up with folks like you. LinkedIn is much more like the face of a person in the job market so people will try and put out the front that best markets them favorably based on their skill set and experience.So when you ID a Software Developer you would like to work with, you can even talk and discuss a previous project they did and even compare and contrast other previous projects they did with that particular one or what you are seeking to get a helping hand from them.A Software Developer (This is not usually the case when you end up with robots (Let me give you an example about myself. I am a Software Developer but with a bias for developing and integrating Biometric Identity Management Software Solutions for People like You, Companies, Institutions and SMEs on variety of computing platforms including Linux, Android, Web, Cloud, Raspberry Pi and Windows.I can code just about any Software Solution but if it is not a Biometric related project, I just do not connect with it and I will be just another robot that get’s the job done and forget that Project thereafter because I am not passionate about it. Now here is where it gets interesting. I can toil day and night working on a Software Logic in a Biometrics Integration Project even though that Software bit is not the main Biometrics Integration or Biometric Authentication part. It is easier for me this way because I know what I am working on will add onto the grand scheme of things, that is, making the Biometrics Project successful.So as you may have noticed in my sloppy example above, you will also need to get your prospective Software Developer bought into the type of project you are doing and if they are passionate about it, you found the right guys but if they are not getting super hyped about it, they probably will just be delivering the bare minimum and there is nothing you can do about it. I like working on projects where the client believes in me and has taken the pain to learn as much as they could about me and they are not struggling to explain and share with me the big picture of what they want help with so that when we get down to work, we are in sync and reading from the same script. I have also observed over time that it is these types of clients who do not have problems with paying for what they are needing help with.I wonder if I answered this question or I began pitching for business. Hope this helps! Good luck in finding Software Developers you can sync with.Lastly, I do not know if other professionals in the Software Engineering industry are like me but besides having a LinkedIn profile, I also prefer to vlog about part of a solution / project that I have worked on in the past using a very simplistic example onHope this helps.

To attract top talents startups decide to hire a freelancer or a remote team viaThe best option is to hire someone remote, as it will save you money. Here’s another question. Who will deliver higher quality a freelancer or a dedicated team?Here’s my advice.The most significant challenge chief technology officers face when hiring freelancers is that it requires a considerable amount of time and resources to assess the available developer.This approach eliminates the risk related to hiring freelance talents and the expensive full-time developers in your office making it a lucrative option for all. As your startup grows, you can hire full-time developers and continue to work with the augmented team if you like the results.Whether you decide to work with freelancers or an outsourcing company you must figure out if candidates are a good fit for your project. Thus, you should ask them how would they solve the problem similar to the project you have to see their approach and if they would cope with the main task. It would also give developers an insight into what you expect so that they knew if they want this job.When reviewing resumes pay the most attention to the experience and previous projects candidates have worked on. If you are a developer itself, you will be able to select developers on your own, otherwise, I would recommend you get someone technical to handle the interview and help you throughout the hiring process.If you decide to work with the software company that provides dedicated teams or outsourcing services focus on the company culture. Perfect skillset is not enough, your future team must share your vision to implement the right solution for you. Moreover, a healthy atmosphere and relationships among employees will define your relationships with the team you’re going to work and the quality of the product.Feel free to ping me privately or go to inVerita’s website directly if you need help with building a dedicated technology team, would be always happy to give you a hand at that.I hope that helps.",357 followers,Ravii Bisht,37.8K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-ten-technologies-that-teachers-should-be-using

They are celebrating murder of 4 people. A well planned murder by police.I am sure you haven't forgotten how a woman in Hyderabad was gangraped and brutally murdered by 4 devils. There was immense anger in entire country and we celebrated encounter of those 4 rapists by Hyderabad police. We all know it was a planned encounter however instead of questioning police we all thanked them and I personally supported that encounter.Same was the situation in case of Vikas Dubey, in UP. People celebrated a well planned encounter.Now the question, why do we feel happy when criminals are killed by police. Isn't that the gross misuse of power by police?We feel happy because we all have lost trust in our judicial system. People play with our judicial system. It takes years to get verdict and there is no guarantee of justice.Police is generally bribed by criminals to manipulate FIR, charge sheet is delayed and not filed properly, shortage of judges, corruption in Judiciary, criminals use links with politicians to get away. There are thousands of reasons why justice is either delayed or not served.In short, the worst example of corruption in a society is when you want justice and you can't get it becuase even your judicial system is completely corrupt.Now a tough question, how can a person sleeping on footpath with his family get justice if his family is crushed by a rich person under influence of Alcohol. Salman Khan case for an example.It's not fair.Rahul.","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,632,1.5K,2.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Chief-Technology-Officers-What-are-your-best-tricks-and-tips-to-hire-top-developers-for-Stage-1-Startup
