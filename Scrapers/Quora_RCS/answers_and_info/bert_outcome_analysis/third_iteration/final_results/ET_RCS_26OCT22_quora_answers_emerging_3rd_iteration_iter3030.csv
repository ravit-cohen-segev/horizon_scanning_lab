0,"I believe the reason to venture into invention is, first and foremost, competition or natural selection. I wouldn't be as dismissive of the aquatic sentient life: hard tools can be made with stone, bone, or possibly with some kind of oxidation process. Then, they could build primordial factories or work in bubbles of air (just like humans constantly interact with water even to preserve food).However, if the food is plentiful, their population is stable or growing fast, and they are already the top of the food chain, why bother?","224,564 followers",Gayle Laakmann McDowell,8.5K,1.2K,49.8M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-a-highly-intelligent-extraterrestrial-species-may-not-develop-advanced-technologies-due-to-resource-constraints

Take the dolphin (or octopuses, for that matter) imagine evolutionary circumstances which allow development of intelligences equivalent to ours - yet assume the creature remains aquatic.

2,"It’s certainly possible.A highly intelligent race which evolves upon a planet who surface is covered with snow, ice or water may spend centuries developing the tools necessary to simply reach down to the level where minerals could be mined.

A race that evolved on a planet which lacked many types of energy resources might not feel that it had the right to exploit those resources for something as speculative a spaceflight or interplanetary travel. They may also not wish to pollute their biosphere while creating and testing such devices as it could violate core religious tenets that they may adhere to.One thing which is never shown in science fiction is that humanity benefitted from evolving near and around resources that allowed it to advanced. If the human race had been largely confined to what we now call Antarctica, it is possible that we would have been unable to grow to the numbers that exist now and we wouldn’t have been able to make the advances that we have. An alien race that evolved only on a single distant content of a world may not have been able to exploit resources even if they were present.",UNKNOWN,Pallab Roy Chowdhury (GENERAL non Ews),1.5K,357,20.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-a-highly-intelligent-extraterrestrial-species-may-not-develop-advanced-technologies-due-to-resource-constraints

4,"It was nothing to do with Rome itself, but everything to do with everyone else. Rome was advanced for its time since they adopted what other, smaller and lesser well known, but advanced cultures made. The Romans were experts at stealing ideas and improving on them. Firstly, when the Roman Republic was established, they conquered other groups in Italy, most notably the Etruscans, to whom they owe their lifestyle, colluseums, gladiatorial battles and aqueducts.Then, through the conquest of Greece and trade, they picked up Egyptian and Greek influence.

5,Toshiba happened.What do you mean Toshiba happened? What have you been smoking Ken?What if I say Huawei happened?Does that make it clearer?Back in the 1980s the US government complained to the Japanese government. They said that Toshiba had sold the USSR some precision CNC machines. This broke US law. Not Japanese law. US law… (does this start to sound familiar now?). The CEO was arrested (sound familiar?) and the Japanese government ended up sanctioning Toshiba because of the US government complaint.The US government ended up putting 100% tariffs on Toshiba stuff.Toshiba happened.What do you mean Toshiba happened?

8,"Because Japan is no longer “far more advanced in technology” in the field of mobile phones (as well as in many other fields of consumer electronics).I see some answer here suggest that Japan moved into making high-tech components for mobile phones while China takes over the labor intensive and relatively low-tech whole phone manufacturing. Well, that is not entirely true, especially when we’re moving into 2018.According to JEITABecause Japan is no longer “far more advanced in technology” in the field of mobile phones (as well as in many other fields of consumer electronics).I see some answer here suggest that Japan moved into making high-tech components for mobile phones while China takes over the labor intensive and relatively low-tech whole phone manufacturing. Well, that is not entirely true, especially when we’re moving into 2018.According to JEITAIn the mobile phone industry, whole phone manufacturers actually tend to be much more profitable than component manufacturers.In terms of mobile related chip design and wireless tech, Japan is also falling significantly behind China, and that gap is widening every year.While Japan does have Softbank which purchased majority shares of ARM (it provides architecture design to mobile CPU and GPU’s), that’s not the same as saying ARM is now Japanese technology. ARM is still a British-based company with no plan of moving talents or technologies into Japan. Renesas Electronics is a major ic design company that is truly Japanese, but its focus is in automotive electronics and smaller ic controllers rather than the most important mobile phone SoC’s.Yes, Japan still excel in some fields. Sony’s imaging sensors are still dominant, but even high end smartphone sensors are very cheap now (less than $10 usd) compared to the whole phone’s material cost, so it has limited revenue potential despite seizing huge market share. Similarly, Japan played some important roles in upstream semiconductor manufacturing (e.g. SUMCO), but they are so upstream that the global market is small and limited in revenue potential. These companies may hold important links in the mobile phone production chain, but they are not irreplaceable and by themselves they can’t make a big impact to Japan’s economy.So I’d say that Japan is still a major component supplier in the mobile phone industry today, but its outlook is pretty dim except in a few small areas. The main reason is simple:The semiconductor industry is the core of today’s high-tech consumer electronic products, and it is EXTREMELY capital intensive. A single factory making SoC/Screen/Memory (one of them, not all) requires billions, and sometimes double digit billions of US dollars to build, and China plan to build 20+ of these in the next 3–4 years. Only a few dominant global players, sometimes coupled with national level strategic investment, can afford to acquire and maintain these infrastructures. Without the right economic scale, a balance of reasonable hiring cost and abundant human talents, and a disposition to manufacture for the world market, there is no way to play this game. Japan has not shown its resolve to stay in this game, while S. Korea and China did. As a result, Japan has already lost its tech advantage in this field.",719 followers,Sandip Bhatnagar,629,321,1.4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Are-the-many-different-claims-that-there-were-ancient-supercivilizations-with-advanced-technology-that-we-cant-replicate-today-true-or-silly
