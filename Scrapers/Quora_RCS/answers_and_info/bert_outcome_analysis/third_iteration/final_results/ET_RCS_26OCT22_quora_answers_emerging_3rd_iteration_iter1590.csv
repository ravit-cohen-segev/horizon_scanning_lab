Any idiot with a booger picker can wield a gun. Someone who can use a sword or their prowess and bloodlust in a fight is a warrior. Guns are just industrialized tools in battles befitting warriors who also face bombs, chemicals and air to surface bombardment, although that era of “this hallowed ground” is gone I'm sure.What's worse is that guns facilitate the outcast with a tool for terror and airing of really pathetic grievances. I don't care if it's nice to say or not but, outcasts are only supposed to have one way back into society and that's by entering the social contract. These guys will kill because they don't want to be polite or take a bath or brush their teeth to get a mate.For the rest of us, guns are tools to level the playing field when you're already losing. If there's an intruder and you're half asleep, you need a gun. If a man shoves you into your vehicle and proceeds to rape you and you are already losing, you need to grope for the gun under your seat. If you are older and live in a bad neighborhood, bat wielding asshole's can be stopped with a gun.But if you are the aggressor, you're really just showing that you're a loser that has zero skill or value. With a sword or rapier, or even your fists, you can be the aggressor and still retain honor. I know…it's oddly ridiculous that challenging one to a duel over words can be honorable, but skill is the reason that works. Notice something, dueling existed for thousands of years and even critics were careful not to disparage the practice with words that might seem too harsh or passionate. Once guns entered the scene, mockery humiliating taunts, ruined careers, and ribald jokes about a limp phallus flooded the scene. In less than 200 years, dueling was out of fashion. After 10,000 years of accepted practice when the weapons were an insecure man's replacement phallus. The lack of skill is why such a time honored practice plummeted to criminality in such a short time span.Even Abraham Lincoln used the last of the dueling tradition to his favor by scaring the digestive substances right out of Southern men who were supposedly appalled that Lincoln preferred “log splitting and wrestling” to “dueling with pistols.” Their inferiority was on display before anyone had a right to claim it since the war that proved it hadn't begun. The hot tempers, loud mouths, and plump booger pickers spazzing out on a trigger made that reputation a forgone conclusion.Skill, dedication, and labor are still the only real ways to earn honor and substance. I prefer to master things better than conflict. But, should a fight come looking for me, I'm already well acquainted with battle readiness and blood lust. I smell fear or see the vein chugging away in someone's neck and I get hungry and ready. My hands itch and old aches throb and long to be scratched with friction and warm split skin. I come from a long line of savage, furious, loud, and boisterous red haired women and our hands don't match our light and unmarked freckled skin and soft curves. Our hands look like iron workers hands who fought on the weekends for cash in amateur matches. I might choose a mace or hatchet on a medieval weapons rack but I'm far more likely to need to use my hands. Skill keeps me from censure and social condemnation. If I had this temper and sought conflict with a boom boom stick, society would rightfully kick me out and ostracize me for their own safety. Instead, I never start a fight and stop right before finishing if there are enough people nearby or if my opponent is tired and there's no anger left in their eyes. I've regretted the ones I had to finish almost as much as the ones I lost so I seek to end conflict with planning and with mind games that can defeat a person before they ever reach for a weapon. That is also a skill. If I used that one to have a bunch of rich boyfriends or marry a rich man, society would be just as harsh as the other examples I've given.Skill and how we use it defines our place in society.",1 follower,Eric Lowe,2K,4.1K,37.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-gunpowder-and-guns-changed-the-battlefield-from-swords-and-shields-what-is-the-next-leap-in-weapons-technology

5,"I have been using PHP since more than 6 years now. What I feel funny is how some people make fun of it. I'd ratherI have been using PHP since more than 6 years now. What I feel funny is how some people make fun of it. I'd ratherLet's come to the reasonsI have seen people (even on Quora) who say things like “PHP is not the best language to teach you about how things work. In fact, it teaches nothing except language-level features. If you want to learn web programming without getting in too much details, PHP is the best. ButRemember that it is not C, C++, Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, Haskell or any of those stuff that you need to learn. What you need to learn is 'programming'; to command the machine and make it do what you want. Anything works (no, really, it does). If your program can be written in Basic and Basic does the job - Basic is the language you need to learn. Fortunately, PHP is way more powerful. PHP wasn't built by idiots. If it did, it'd have been dead by now. But look, it is the most dominant. Also, let me repeat it for you - just because something is easy, does not mean it is not powerful.A language should ideally be consistent as well as well designed. But if you know about PHP’s history a bit, you would likely forgive it’s craziness at times (and there are some, in every single language). PHP was not supposed to be a full fledged language. PHP was just a small hack at programming a web page dynamically. It was designed for non-programmers in a time where C and C++ were the most popular languages. Even Java wasn’t really around! PHP Debuted with Java (about a month younger than Java) Links:Code is poetry. And poems are written in all languages. You need the rhythm and emotion more than the grammar and foresight; if you have the rhythm and the emotion, you can write poems in all languages of this world and beyond.EDIT:EDIT 2:EDIT 3EDIT 4EDIT 5","24,272 followers",Anders Kaseorg,1K,549,9.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-gunpowder-and-guns-changed-the-battlefield-from-swords-and-shields-what-is-the-next-leap-in-weapons-technology

Meanwhile, you’re still largely left to do all this in your own room that, in most cases, will have barely any space.I don’t think VR will be significantly successful until spaces are set aside with omnidirectional treadmills and perhaps even basic haptics. However, when this happens, we’ll see people begin to prefer these virtual environments over real ones.All the really adrenaline-fueled, exciting activities will be simulated in these environments and people will likely become addicted. This could become a big problem similar to a gambling addiction and when people got addicted to WoW a few years back but because of how much more satisfying and powerful these experiences could potentially be, people might forget about paying their bills, going to work, their family or their friends (unless they’re playing the game too).In the long-term this won’t be a problem. Interactions in VR will be indistinguishable from IRL interactions. Everything you can currently do in IRL you would also be able to do in VR.

24,"Transfer learning in ML models.Humans are really good at generalizing. We only have to see a few dogs before we can recognize a dog when we see one.Machines are not. ML models require millions of examples before forming a reliable classifier, and that classifier is very specific to the data on which it was trained. If your training data doesn't include dogs with three legs, the model won't recognize them. A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one.

A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one. It's hypothesized that the reason humans learn so quickly is that we are fitting new examples into our existing knowledge rather than forming entirely new categories. If we could teach machines to do the same, they would learn exponentially faster and apply that learning more effectively.Transfer learning is a very hot topic in AI research right now, so I expect major breakthroughs in the next few years. I think this may be sufficient to achieve artificial general intelligence, but even if not, it will dramatically extend the range of tasks that machines can accomplish.",17 followers,Fabius Fairchild,1.8K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/After-a-natural-disaster-what-do-we-need-to-do-What-should-we-prepare-for
25,"I think the main problems that we’ll come up against will be the ethical implications of artificial intelligence and other technologies. For example, my specialism in healthcare, so what should we do when AI gets better at predicting the best course of actions than humans? Let’s say that a human has an 80% success rate and the AI has a 90% success rate. Should we go with what the AI says? And what then happens if the AI is wrong and the patient dies?I think we’re a long way off before these types of issues become commonplace, but it’s definitely worth thinking about.
