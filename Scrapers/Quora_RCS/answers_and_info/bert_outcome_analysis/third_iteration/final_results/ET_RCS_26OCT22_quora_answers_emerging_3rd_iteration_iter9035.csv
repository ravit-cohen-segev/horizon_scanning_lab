But they have no other go than to judge you as with how you behave in your interview. This happens because most people aren't aware of expressing themselves. Seriously everything starts from here.I give you one of my experiences. In my college I had something called placement training where in most of the mock interviews my interviewer said that I'm the best. But I faced 10 defeats before I got my rightful job. All of them though were not because of my lack of communication. But that too was a reason at one point. I understood then that communication is not only about expressing the right answer to their question or making them know what we know. But communication is all about expressing what they expect from you. Never an interviewer expects a right answer from you. But he expects an attitude from you which, he might have felt is missing in you. So the thing you lack in you is not confidence or anything else. It is the basic understanding about the expectation of a person sitting opposite to you. And I'm sure that we can't judge his expectation at once. But there will surely be a point where your understanding and skills matches with the interviewer's expectation. May be he found that you are hesitating to communicate because he couldn't clearly picturize what is missing in you. So have this in mind that, when you communicate with others practise to understand their expected answers and try giving them. This might be a bit tough but I think this would be the best exercise. And I believe that communication by itself is a practise and no book can teach it. Grasp how people communicate with each other and to you too. That is the best one from the book of your life experiences. Hope this helps you.",1 follower,Kirk Scott,1K,13.4K,68.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-to-communicate-issues

I‚Äôve had luxury vacations, travelled the world, cars, jets, etc. So this is perhaps the most tangential story of my life. Perhaps the only one exception i ever made in my life.I was sitting in one of my consulting meeting when i heard the tap tap tap sound of heels on the marble floor. The wooden door opened and in walked the devil. It wasn‚Äôt until she sat down on the table and said ‚ÄòShall We Start‚Äô did we all realized (20 of us) that the entire room had fallen silent when she had walked in. To say she was out of my league was an understatement. Over time as i worked on the project, i got to know her better. She was probably everything i ever wanted in a girl. Smart, beautiful, intelligent and a smile of a lioness (i gave her that moniker). She knew she was powerful.Overtime we got close especially as she used to laugh at all of my jokes and one day i just casually asked her out for coffee. I knew I was not her type at all. So all i wanted was just have that validation of taking a girl like that out. One more friend, so to speak. Surprisingly she agreed. We met at my favorite coffee house and despite being a quick meeting, it ended up being a 3 hour date. It was like i had found my twin, my soulmate or even my other half. From liking the same food to discussing the same topics, same music, same thoughts to the point of sapio-sexuality, it was like we were talking as one person.This was hopeful and I thought, okay this could be a good friendship, maybe even love. I asked her out again and again and again and every time she accepted and each time we shared and shared and shared. We started doing everything that couples do. Dinners at the fanciest restaurants, got her gifts (and let‚Äôs just say half her wardrobe now has brands like Fendi, Armani & Gucci), we even decided to create a single music playlist because she genuinely loved everything i listened to and i everything she listened to and we both agreed that was more efficient. She would constantly tell me ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my Home‚Äù and I would believe her. From books and literature to even the movies, we were twinnies. She would always tell me ‚Äúyour‚Äôe the closest I‚Äôve even been to with anyone in my life‚Äù (this probably should have been taken as a warning btw) and the day she said ‚ÄúI have no qualms in admitting it‚Ä¶ I love you‚Äù‚Ä¶ i think i was over the moon and stammering back i told her i felt the same way (this was probably just the validation she wanted‚Ä¶. should have kept my mouth shut).So why this story in the unrequited love‚Ä¶. She was broken. Her last three serious relationships especially a 9 year long one had all ended badly including one in abuse. When I met her, she would go through men like a hot knife would go through butter. We were together for 6 months and i counted at least 20 guys she saw in the same period, some were sexual one night stands (we never were ‚Äúpassionate‚Äù‚Ä¶ which probably made me madder still i think, because wasn‚Äôt I the sap she claimed to loved‚Ä¶ ). .. and despite the beauty goddess with the most perfect facade, her home life too was a mess - alcoholic dad for a start.I thought I could make her happy. I wanted to be her savior. Thanks to my connections, i got her a better job than she ever could have on her own. I blew money on making her more powerful than ever and the high i would get when I would take her out to my social events. I could see the looks of lust, jealousy and envy on the faces of those around me.Despite all of this. Despite the fact she could be herself with me (and said so openely). There could be no commitment and she was straight about that. She was even straight about the passion ‚ÄúI could never do that to you, what i do to them‚Äù. She setup these boundaries‚Ä¶ and I had to accept them... I guess I realized that whilst she completed me in every which way a person could, i could only complete her as an ‚ÄòIntimate Friend‚Äô.I respected her decisions but i hated them but God i loved her. I never knew i could write poetry until i felt those pangs of anger coming out with every word i wrote. I never knew i could be jealous until i saw what i was thinking and writing down. Just the thought of her being with someone else was enough to destroy my day and just her being with me for coffee in the morning was enough to create a high that even made my work prosper (the first month after she said i loved you, i ended up winning 5 new projects i was so high).But i had to let her go. I couldn‚Äôt be with a friend. The jealousy alone was killing me. It‚Äôs not that i didn‚Äôt try. I lost weight and got ripped. I made her choose my wardrobe, so i could dress the way she liked me. I went out of my way to spend time, money and energy on her. When she broke up with her latest boyfriend I was there to comfort her. I wanted her to see I could be enough, that I could be everything she wanted‚Ä¶. but she loved me but she didn‚Äôt want to belong to anyone. She wanted everything I could give her but‚Ä¶ she didn‚Äôt want me. ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI will never leave‚Äù you she would say, but she never acted on that‚Ä¶. and i wanted more.. i wanted US and there would never be an US.In the end, I crushed the one thing which connected me to her ‚ÄòHOPE‚Äô. I crushed and accepted that some people cannot be pinned down no matter how perfect you‚Äôre together, you might both want something else. Over time i slowed down the messages and the dates and the 10,000 ways i told her i loved her to a few hundred. I became the friend she wanted me to be and nothing more.She always said she wanted a tattoo of a butterfly on her back. To this day, i keep putting up a sticker or something on my car or my laptop or something that symbolically reminds me of her. I have never given up on her though and honestly, if truth be told, i‚Äôll take her back in a heartbeat.Someday i intend to write a book about my story ‚ÄúThe Devil & The Dervish‚Äù (dervish is the spiritual pilgrim) and they are both her.
