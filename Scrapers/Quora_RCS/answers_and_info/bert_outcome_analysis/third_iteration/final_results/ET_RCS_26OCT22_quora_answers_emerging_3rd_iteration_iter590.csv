Brands are usually invincible in designing their pages (accounts) and why not to learn from the best. If this is not what you want but just to follow the best, the same procedure will be applied: take a look at the best and go down by the ladder.Just a word or two more: Twitter is in the middle of the change, and it's already showing its new face (features) together with the instructions you can find in the Twitter Marketing section.

That is absolutely incorrect. TheirThe single biggest element that has made SpaceX successful is the low launch cost of the Falcon 9. The single biggest element that made that low launch cost possible is the vertical integration of that launch vehicle. SpaceX supposedly makes over 80% of the parts that go into a Falcon 9. I’ve read a couple of anecdotes where SpaceX was presented with a ridiculously high cost for a given element. Rather than accepting that as the price for doing business, they looked for cheaper options and found them. This is the difference between the “cost-plus” mentality of government funded projects and the “minimize costs” of commercially funded projects.This seems like a good place to point out thatIt is SpaceX’s ability to make this commercial-mindset model succeed that has made them a disruptive element in the global launch marketplace. If that mindset was the sum total of SpaceX’s innovation, then it would be relatively easy for other launch service companies to duplicate their capabilities and develop a launch vehicle that would be much more price-competitive with SpaceX in the coming years.However — SpaceX isn’t done. Right now the fly-back tech is still in the red in terms of the amount R&D money spent compared to the amount of money saved by reflying boosters. That won’t be the case for much longer, though. When the Block 5 boosters begin production flights, the cost savings to SpaceX will increase sunstantially. That’s going to boost their bottom line in the near term and allow them to offer even better prices to customers in the medium and long term. By the time any new rocket from another launch services company comes on-line — SpaceX will be in a position to make it even harder to compete than is the case right now. It will be very difficult for an expendable launch vehicle to compete with one that has the reusablility of the Falcon 9 as it existsBehind the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy is the BFR.

He wanted a trivial thing, just buy a few of their largest ICBM launch systems for his publicity project designed to bring publicity to Mars exploration (and hence channel more funding to NASA).After being literally spat at by the Russians, a personality like Musk wasn’t prepared to take the idea of being defeated, so it more or less became a “how hard can it be?” moment.Quite hard as it turned out, and Musk soon found out why no other private concern had ever achieved orbit. SpaceX was founded in 2002, and Musk expected to launch its first orbital rocket by 2005. The company found a launch site on an isolated island in theThe first attempted launch had an engine failure after 33 seconds of flight, resulting in a total loss of the vehicle.The second attempt had a successful 1st stage burn, but the second stage started to oscillate during its orbital insertion burn resulting in an engine shut down and failure to reach orbit.The third attempt was incredibly frustrating in that although the 1st stage boost was successful, a tiny residual amount of fuel in the main engine caused it to “bump” the second stage at stage separation, resulting in the loss of the second stage and full mission failure.The third attempt was in August 2008, and Musk was three years behind schedule and flush out of money. This was well before he had become a billionaire, and Musk was not only attempting to start up the first private launch company capable of orbit, but was also pouring what seemed to be a never ending stream of money into Tesla, which was resembling the ultimate money pit.At this point, most people would admit defeat, trim their sails and concentrate on survival, but Musk is not someone who admits defeat easily. SpaceX looked like a total washout to the industry regulars, who pretty much wrote the struggling company off. Musk desperately cast about for parts and funding, and scraped together enough left overs to build a 4th Falcon 1 and went for a final launch attempt at the end of September that year. For this launch, no customers could be found to supply a payload since there was no confidence in SpaceXs ability to reach orbit, and the 4th Falcon 1 carried a concrete block as a mass simulator into orbit.The mighty Falcon 1 at Kwajalein Atoll.After that 4th desperate and successful attempt, people suddenly realised that SpaceX had what it took to get payloads into orbit, and the Falcon 1 had just one more flight in 2009, placing a Malaysian satellite into orbit, RazakSAT. The eventual success of the Falcon 1 opened the door to substantial contracts with NASA who were looking for launch providers to supply the ISS. The Falcon 1 was tentatively looked at for development, but in a typical Muskian step, SpaceX went straight into the development of their ultimate space work horse, the Falcon 9, and the rest is history.Was SpaceX always a successful company?",10 followers,Andrew Forrest,2.3K,6.2K,16.7M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-Twitter-accounts-about-technology
