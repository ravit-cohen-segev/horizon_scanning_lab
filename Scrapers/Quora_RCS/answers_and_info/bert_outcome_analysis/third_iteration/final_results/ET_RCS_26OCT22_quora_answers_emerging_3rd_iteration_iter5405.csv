0,"The word ""emerging technology"" is typically used to describe new technology. It is used to describe technologies that are presently under development or that are expected to be accessible within the next five to ten years. The phrase is often reserved for technologies that have or are anticipated to have significant societal or economic implications.Hope it helps!",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-does-emerging-technology-mean
1,"Emerging technologies cover a wide range of technologies. Many are still at the research stage and therefore off the radar of policy-makers, but will in time have transformative effects ranging from the emergence of new industries, by disruption of current value chains, to major societal changes in the fields of healthcare and communications.Following the World Economic Forum’s Summit on the Global Agenda 2010, in Dubai, emerging technologies were defined as:Emerging technologies cover a wide range of technologies. Many are still at the research stage and therefore off the radar of policy-makers, but will in time have transformative effects ranging from the emergence of new industries, by disruption of current value chains, to major societal changes in the fields of healthcare and communications.Following the World Economic Forum’s Summit on the Global Agenda 2010, in Dubai, emerging technologies were defined as:Expanding on this definition and scope, the Summit on the Global Agenda 2011, in Abu Dhabi, led to the compilation of a list of the Top 10 Emerging Technologies with the greatest potential to provide solutions to the most compelling social, economic and environmental challenges.1. Informatics for Adding Value to Information The quantity of information now available to individuals and organizations is unprecedented in human history, and the rate of information generation continues to grow exponentially. Yet, the sheer volume of information is in danger of creating more noise than value, and as a result limiting its effective use. Innovations in how information is organized, mined and processed hold the key to filtering out the noise and using the growing wealth of global information to address emerging challenges.2. Synthetic Biology and Metabolic Engineering The natural world is a testament to the vast potential inherent in the genetic code at the core of all living organisms. Rapid advances in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering are allowing biologists and engineers to tap into this potential in unprecedented ways, enabling the development of new biological processes and organisms that are designed to serve specific purposes – whether converting biomass to chemicals, fuels and materials, producing new therapeutic drugs or protecting the body against harm.3. Green Revolution 2.0 – Technologies for Increased Food and Biomass Artificial fertilizers are one of the main achievements of modern chemistry, enabling unprecedented increases in crop production yield. Yet, the growing global demand for healthy and nutritious food is threatening to outstrip energy, water and land resources. By integrating advances across the biological and physical sciences, the new green revolution holds the promise of further increasing crop production yields, minimizing environmental impact, reducing energy and water dependence, and decreasing the carbon footprint.4. Nanoscale Design of Materials The increasing demand on natural resources requires unprecedented gains in efficiency. Nanostructured materials with tailored properties, designed and engineered at the molecular scale are already showing novel and unique features that will usher in the next clean energy revolution, reduce our dependence on depleting natural resources, and increase atom-efficiency manufacturing and processing.5. Systems Biology and Computational Modeling/ Simulation of Chemical and Biological Systems For improved healthcare and bio-based manufacturing, it is essential to understand how biology and chemistry work together. Systems biology and computational modelling and simulation are playing increasingly important roles in designing therapeutics, materials and processes that are highly efficient in achieving their design goals, while minimally impacting on human health and the environment.6. Using Carbon Dioxide as a Resource Carbon is at the heart of all life on earth. Yet, managing carbon dioxide releases is one of the greatest social, political and economic challenges of our time. An emerging innovative approach to carbon dioxide management involves transforming it from a liability to a resource. Novel catalysts, based on nanostructured materials, can potentially transform carbon dioxide to high value hydrocarbons and other carbon-containing molecules. These could be used as new building blocks for the chemical industry as cleaner and more sustainable alternatives to petrochemicals.7. Wireless Power Society is deeply reliant on electrically-powered devices. Yet, a significant limitation in their continued development and use is the need to be attached to the electricity grid by wire – either permanently or through frequent battery recharging. Emerging approaches to wireless power transmission will free electrical devices from being physically plugged in, and are poised to have as significant an impact on personal electronics as Wi-Fi had on Internet use.8. High Energy Density Power Systems Better batteries are essential if the next generation of clean energy technologies are to be realized. A number of emerging technologies are coming together to lay the foundation for advanced electrical energy storage and use, including the development of nanostructured electrodes, solid electrolysis, and rapid-power delivery from novel supercapacitors based on carbon-based nanomaterials. These technologies will provide the energy density and power needed to supercharge the next generation of clean energy technologies.9. Personalized Medicine, Nutrition and Disease Prevention As the global population exceeds 7 billion people – all hoping for a long and healthy life – conventional approaches to ensuring good health are becoming less and less tenable, spurred on by growing demands, dwindling resources and increasing costs. Advances in areas such as genomics, proteomics and metabolomics are now opening up the possibility of tailoring medicine nutrition and disease prevention to the individual. Together with emerging technologies like synthetic biology and nanotechnology, they are laying the foundation for a revolution in healthcare and well-being that will be less resource intensive and more targeted to individual needs.10. Enhanced Education Technology New approaches are needed to meet the challenge of educating a growing young population and providing the skills that are essential to the knowledge economy. This is especially the case in today’s rapidly evolving and hyperconnected globalized society. Personalized IT-based approaches to education are emerging that allow learner-centred education, critical thinking development and creativity. Rapid developments in social media, open courseware and ubiquitous access to the Internet are facilitating outside classroom and continuous education.","99,916 followers",Alcatraz Dey,9K,1.4K,68.2M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-does-emerging-technology-mean

Our team at Grammarly has compiled a handy list of common grammatical errors to help make your writing accurate, clear, and professional.Ambiguous (“Squinting”) modifiersA squinting modifier is a misplaced modifier that, because of its location in a sentence, could modify either the phrase that precedes it or the one that follows it. In the example sentence, is the subject listening to music slowly or slowly getting a headache? To correct a squinting modifier, move its position in the sentence to clarify to the reader which word you intend to modify.Misuse of lie/layIf you plan to place or put an object somewhere, such as a plate on a table, you should use “lay.” If you intend to stretch out on a bed for a nap, you should use “lie.” The verb “lie” is an intransitive verb, which means it does not need an object. The transitive verb “lay” requires an object.It may take some getting used to this “lay” or “lie” business; after all, misuse of these verbs is common. But if you remember to lay down your fork before you’re full, then you won’t have to lie down later from overeating.Comma splicesHe was very hungry, so he ate a whole pizza.To splice means to connect or join. When a writer joins two independent sentences with a comma instead of separating them with a period or coordinating conjunction, that’s a comma splice.The comma has its jobs to do, but connecting two independent sentences isn’t one of them. Besides, the period gets testy when his sister, the comma, steals his thunder. Periods have their jobs, and so do commas, but never the twain shall meet—unless it’s in the form of a semicolon. Semicolons can also take the place of a coordinating conjunction, such as “and,” “but,” or “so,” among others.Run-on sentencesRun-on sentences, also known as fused sentences, occur when two complete sentences are squashed together without using a coordinating conjunction or proper punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon. Run-on sentences can be short or long. A long sentence isn’t necessarily a run-on sentence.To avoid run-on sentences, see if there is more than one idea communicated by two or more independent clauses. In our examples, there are two complete sentences:Example:Example:Both sentences are complete ideas by themselves; therefore, use a semicolon or a period to indicate that they are separate independent clauses.Using “could of” instead of “could have”“Could have” is always correct; “could of” never is. Writers probably make this grammar gaffe because, when we speak, the contraction “could’ve” sounds an awful lot like “could of.”TautologiesTautologies express the same thing twice with different words. In our example, the word “made” implies that Jack used his own two hands to create the pail. The prepositional phrase “with his own hands” creates a redundancy. Once you know what they are, it’s fun to discover tautologies: dilapidated ruins, close proximity, added bonus, large crowd...The list goes on and on!After reading through this list of common grammatical mistakes, you might be wondering how to remember all these rules as you write.

You're not alone when you say that you're terrible at drawing; all the great artists have started drawing withFigures like this one -​The reason why they went ahead from these so called ""Drawing is a skill which develops as you practice. You're not alone when you say that you're terrible at drawing; all the great artists have started drawing withFigures like this one -​The reason why they went ahead from these so called ""First and foremost, the one great thing that's in your favor is- the fact that you are dedicated to improve your drawing. I say this because it seems that way, as you are asking this question. And this is really important because any art form can not be learned just for the sake of it; there has to be passion, interest, curiosity, and dedication attached to the process of learning.So in your case, it seems, the biggest hurdle is over, and you can start drawing by observing things around you! Simple as that!And in this endeavor which is stated above, the following steps that I'm about to suggest, should help you in making yourself a better artist.But before blindly following the path below, always remember that you are free to choose your own unique path; the path which you feel is comfortable. The real objective here is to practice regularly and with an intent to learn. It's immaterial which way one chooses to start the practice of drawing.So keeping this in mind, let me try and suggest some steps which you can adopt for the exciting journey that you're about to begin. And like I just said, you're also free to develop your own unique path after understanding these steps, as well. And that would be way more cooler, to be honest!(Please note that each and every step mentioned below can take weeks, months, or even years to perfect. It would all depend on how really one wants to improve herself and how much of effort she's willing to put in.Additionally, for every step given below, there’s a lot of material available online, including on YouTube. You are encouraged to check out different sources, adopt different styles, and practice whichever style that suits you the most.)So let us just begin!Step 1:Firstly, take a paper and a pencil (or pen), sit down in a comfortable position, clear your mind from of all the distraction, and just focus on the task at hand.Now try to draw a simple shape. For instance, draw a circle, and then keep on practicing it.Then onward, every time, try to draw a perfect circle; that's it! It will keep you busy for some days or even months, if you're really serious about it.With only using your hands, it would be a lot difficult for you to draw a simple circle than you are imagining.Just start drawing circles and keep practicing those circles until you reach a stage where you will be able to draw a perfect circle without using any aid and only with your drawing hand.Your attempts would start from something like this -​​And then your hand-eye coordination would improve​​This is pretty good estimation of circle. Congratulations! Now move on!In similar way, start working on various other shapes like a triangle, a square, a cube, an octagon, so on and so forth.This should again keep you busy for quite some time. Remember, it's a herculean task if your starting point is the first circle figure in this answer.But having said that, after ""x"" amount of timeAt that stage, there are two approaches that you can adopt -Approach 1]To try and add shades to the basic shapes that you've already mastered, so that at the beginning of your drawing itself, you would get well versed with how to add shadows and where to put them with respect to light source, etc., in any figure you would draw in the future.Approach 2]To build on to these basic shapes that you have mastered(You can adopt any of these above approaches. It's your wish. What you find easier to adapt, you should adopt. I personally would like to take the first path as it is advantageous to get an essence of what shading is, along with learning different shapes. It helps when one tries to draw complex shapes, later on. This approach also gives an additional practice of looking at ""the broader picture"" by looking the object with a reference to the light source. It also gives a broader perspective of depth which is very important when it comes to drawing complex shapes with a decent accuracy.So to move forward in this particular practice ritual, I have assumed that we've adopted the first approach. And as mentioned earlier, there's no hard and fast rule to it, you can go with the second approach, too.)Step 2:Now that you know how to draw simple figures with a sense of perfection to it, let's start shading these figures.(For consistency of representation in my answer, I'm sticking to circles.)So your first attempt of shading a circle without any understanding of it, would look something like this -​​​Notice, even though your attempt as shown above was not that great if one considers the extent of realism to it, you were still innately aware of a fictitious light source and you assumed it towards the upper left corner, and considering that source, you drew a shadow of sorts on the opposite side, towards the bottom right corner.And that's what is required, here. Some common sense, nothing more.Now keep practicing this shading stuff​​​Now the above drawing is shaded to make the circle look like a sphere or a solid object. You can shade it to make it look just a circle and not a solid object, too. You learn such nuances once you begin the practice. It’s fun and a lengthy routine.Later in this routine, you can start bringing in the surroundings into the entire picture, to explore the shading and shadow aspect of it. In that case, the drawing should look something like this -​​​But since it’s presumed that now you have passed this level of drawing and have improved your drawing, let's put it in a little more realistic manner, as shown below.​During the practice, keep an eye on your shading; notice how the shades vary with the availability of the light. Look at the shade card below, for reference. Learn from this, and improve every time you draw a shape.Keep practicing. It’s an infinite loop!​{Before going ahead, let me tell you something about the relativity concept.There are two kinds of people who start drawing. 1] The ones who intuitively understand relativity, and 2] the ones that don't.While reaching up to here, I presumed you knew relativity; if you don't know, though, don't you worry. Nothing fancy, here.When an object is drawn closer, it looks bigger and if has to be shown farther, it will have to be drawn smaller; that's it. If you understand this much, you know relativity!}That out of the way, let us understand the concept called as aI’ll explain this concept with an example of a cube.When we draw a cube, why is it that the lengths and the breadths of that cube taper towards its end, or slant inwards into the paper? Just look at this picture below for the reference and ask yourself, why would that happen? Can you see it for yourself?​​​As you can see, in the figure above, the edges are tapering towards the right as well as the left side, as if going into the drawing paper. This relativity and adjustment gives the cube an illusion of a ""3D"" on a ""2D"" paper. And this is possible because of the concept of aNow consider that same cube, again.In the cube, we had assumed a vanishing point (V.P.) somewhere deep inside, towards the right and the left side. And that is why the sides tapered towards the inside of the paper, towards the right and the left. So if we check that same cube again, as shown below, with markings for your understanding, it traces two points on the either side wherein the tapered lines disappear and form their respective points. Those two points are called the vanishing points.​​That green dot is what is called as aJust imagine how a cube would look without this concept of a vanishing point. It would look more like a square in 2-D.When a cube is drawn, we always have an intuitive sense of this vanishing point, and that's why we're able to draw it differently than say, a square.So I hope the concept of the vanishing point is clear in your mind, as for any good drawing, which is drawn after taking into consideration the space and the distanceHere are some more examples of the vanishing point concept, for your understanding.Exhibit 1] A top view (or the bird's eye view):​​​Exhibit 2] A horizontal view of a landscape:​​​​​Is it too much to handle, already?Well, just don't panic now, all right? Just having the knowledge of this vanishing point at this stage is enough. You should just try your best to show this vanishing point everything you draw, and you need not take a scale to measure things and stuff like that.(This ""step 3"" was a mere background of this vanishing point concept, just to make you aware of its importance in drawing.)Step 4:Now carry your supreme confidence of drawing and shading the basic shapes, and of the knowledge of the shadow effect and the vanishing point to the next level of drawing, i.e., drawing random/complex shapes.Rules of the game remain the same.So to start with, how about an egg? Not that different to the circle, eh?Let's just start. Practice till you master; that's it!​​​​Nice, that's a really nice strawberry. And look at that detailing. Voila!(Notice, though the last strawberry looks impossible to draw, we've already developed an expertise in shading by now. It's the same thing, just at a micro level. Have some faith!)Likewise, keep drawing some more random shapes and shade them. Put some shadows on to those drawings. Consider the effects such as reflection, refraction, translucency, etc. And just keep on practicing.There are gazillion shapes around to practice. Try drawing two random shapes a day. It should be an entire package- Drawing+Shading+Shadow+Any other special effect. Something like as shown below -​​​​Step 5:As we now know how to draw and shade various objects with a relative precision, it's time to draw animated objects or living organisms. It should involve their movements & their facial expressions; it's the real deal!The foremost aspect to do this is nothing but to keep your eyes and mind wide open. You should observeSo observe all the nuances- the peoples’ walk, a bird's flight, a dog's sleeping posture, etc. And whenever possible, create a fast, first hand drawing of that particular position, movement, expression, etc., and work on the details later on in your free time.Draw something like this.​​Similarly, try to quickly draw all the different facial expressions as you see them, then and there -​​​​Same goes with the trees, flowers, animals, birds, so on and so forth.​​​​​​​​​​So after this eventful journey, it's now time to wait and take a look at the image below, it's of a beautiful lady. She’s indeed looking very beautiful, isn't she?​​And if you ask yourself, would you be confident enough to draw her, just as she is? Most probably the answer would be a big 'No', right? If so, this means you still have a scope for improvement!You would then thus notice that your drawing is still in its infancy stage and there's a hell lot of scope for improvement.For instance, you would have to work on your detailing of the human eye and its movement, the human hair and their shine, etc. I think you get a sense of what am I trying to say, don’t you?So basically, at this stage, you would surround yourself with these intricacies all the time to move forward and not to get stuck at this somewhat primordial to intermediate level, which is below par.Nobody would help you here but you yourself!(Do such improvisations on everything- plants, animals,Step 6:As you would start implementing the corrections and after a hell lot of practice, finally, your drawing would resemble something like this -​​The more you practice, remember the nuances, etc., the more real and believable(And I must add that even after loads of practice, some people may not be able to draw the proportionate faces, different shades, the light effect, etc. But just don't give up. Some people are naturally inclined towards drawing and others are not. But still, what makes a few people great sketch makers or artists, is more than anything else, their practice and perseverance. So don't you ever give up.It's just that your pace of learning things can be on a slower side, but you would still improve a lot for sure. You can just look at where were at the beginning and where have you reached by now; it should be enough for you to keep yourself motivated.)Step 7:Now we're talking. This is the real deal, man.Put everything together. You should start drawing different landscapes, full of people and lots of animals. You should start memory drawings by now.(You can draw panoramas from the beginning itself, it's just that at this stage those would be more believable.)Your drawings would be something like -​Now you would know much about everything. At least as much to develop your own interest and style of drawing.Here's an outline of different drawingsCheck outStep 9:This one's about perfecting to a level where your drawing would be indistinguishable from a photograph or a real image. This is an optional step, of course.It would also require a hell lot of practice, but it's not a necessary step, I must add.(Though the drawings which look like a photograph are hallmarks of awesome artists and perfectionists who have put in a lot of hard work, there are equal examples of awesome artists with brilliant drawings that are not be equatable to a photograph. Their drawings, too, are equally awesome as far as the concept, its meaning, and almost real appearing shapes is concerned. So you should keep this in mind, as well.)Here's an example of a real looking drawing by​This much should serve you well.

I was able to learn French to conversation fluency in 17 days using the following techniques. Note that I had previously learned Spanish to fluency so this was not my first foreign language.In summer of 2005 I stayed with a French friend in a tiny village in the Beaujolais region of France. No one in the village spoke English and, since my friend knew I had an ambitious learning goal, she refused to speak to me in English as well.I set up a routine where I did the same things every day.In the mornings, I woke up and wrote out longhand the regular and irregular verb tables for 1.5-2 hours. I managed to get through an entire pad of paper in two weeks. I still believe that writing things out by hand is the best way to memorize things.While I wrote, I would listen to Michel Thomas' language learning mp3s (I would run for 45-60 minutes in the early afternoon in the French countryside listening to catchy French music. Music is a great way to learn the intonation of a language and train your facial muscles as you sing along.I had lunch with my friend and her French friends everyday. As they refused to slow down when speaking to me in French, it was learn or starve!In the afternoon, if I wasn't playing darts or Boules with my French friends, I was reading ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" in French. Reading the children's books you read as a child is a great hack to learning new languages. Firstly, the language used is simple and secondly, knowing the story helps you to guess the meaning of new words and avoid using a dictionary. Surprisingly children's books are more entertaining in a foreign language.I spent at least an hour writing basic essays about myself which I had my French friend check for errors. When you meet new people you inevitably get asked the same things: ""Where are you from?"", ""What do you do?"", ""Do you like France?"". By learning ready-made answers, you get to practice what you learned and build up your confidence.Another good tip is to learn the filler words. These are the words and phrases people say then all the time between sentences (alors, en fait, etc.) but have no real meaning; allowing you to buy time in a conversation and increase your confidence.After 17 days I left the small town and went to Paris. I met a girl in a coffee shop and we started talking. After a few minutes, she asked how long I had lived in France. When I told her I had been learning French for 17 days, she swore that I had lived in France for at least a year.Hopefully there are some useful tips you can use in your learning.

Use Your Sleep. During this one seminar in college (I forget the title) we were told that, while as psychologists we have studied sleep for a long time, we still did not know much about sleep.However, something that we did find out is that our minds use our deeper phases of sleep (The dream phases or REM [Rapid Eye Movement] phases) to put information from our short-term memory into our long-term memory.Knowing this, we can actually use our sleep to our advantage.If we study or learn something and then sleep right after that, we increase the chances of our mind transferring this new information from our short-term to our long-term memory.The only requirement is that we have to reach a stage of deep enough sleep (REM sleep which usually happens between every 60–90 minutes).This means, if you take a nap in the middle of the day that is around 90 minutes long, right after you studied, or study at the end of the day before you go to sleep, you will increase the chance to transfer some of what you learned.Just make sure not to put any activity between the learning and sleeping.2. Start Early. Do Little. I know you want to cram, I know you do not want to start studying weeks or even months in advance and I know you want to spend as little time studying as possible.But the truth is that if you want great grades, if you want a degree that is worth something, and if you want to get the job of your dreams, if you really want to learn you have to start studying earlier.That doesn’t mean you have to spend 3 hours or more every day studying or learning or improving.If you want to, that will get you to your goals faster, but the point is that one hour a day over the course of a couple weeks and/or months will be much more beneficial to you than studying 8 hours every day 7 days before the exam or test.Start early and do a little bit every day.This will give you more time to facilitate what you must learn, more time to ask the questions you need answered and, most importantly, it will reduce your level of stress tremendously!Plus this is a great habit to get into for after you are done with your degrees as well, for in the working world you can still learn and improve.If you spend 1 hour a day to improving your skill and learning more, you will be climbing the corporate ladder quickly and effortlessly.3. Set Up Triggers. A nice little trick I picked up as I started into Personal Development were Triggers.Triggers are used to remind yourself of your biggest goals and they can be anything from a 10 Million Dollar check (Source: Jim Carrey) that you write to yourself to a post-it note on your computer screen.Do this so you do not forget your purpose and know why you are working so hard.Take a couple post-it notes and place them everywhere around your house where you frequently look at.On these notes should be pieces of information that are very important for the exam, or that you have trouble remembering, things that you want to learn or raise your awareness for.It could be important formulas for Math, Vocabulary that you are struggling with, or even a picture of a concept you need to memorize. (For those already past the exam age these could be reminders of your dreams, triggers for personality traits you wish to adopt or reminders of who you want to be).The trick then, is to not only look at the nice post-it note, but to think about it whenever you see it.Stop what you are doing and take in what is written on the note for just 30 seconds.Over the course of just a week you might make it up to 30–60 minutes depending on where this post-it note is, but it will be the repetition that will set the information in your mind.Put some across the toilet on the wall, on the door to the fridge, on your pillow, even on your water bottle.4. Teach Others. Teaching others is the single best way to test your knowledge and the most effective way to retain information (90% of what you teach you retain).Teach a topic to them like they have absolutely no background knowledge.If you are showing them how a concept in Biology works, imagine that they never took a science class in their life.This will make you pay close attention to the details and you will not just assume they know what you are talking about, challenging your knowledge even more.Sometimes you will trip over very simple thi...","87,306 followers",Shefali Naidu,5.2K,822,49.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-to-learn-technology

Be patient and learn to simply take a moment and take a deep breath if you get annoyed. Patience is key because without it you cannot sufficiently understand the technology, and your view and memory of the experience will always be negative in your mind and will turn you off from using the technology again on your own.One last but important step to enjoying the learning experience when it comes to new technology is to ensure that you're using the equipment and systems that are optimized your own needs. For example, if your eyesight is poor, increase the size of the text in the browser, online documents and anything else read on screen––learn how to do this for each device, as it varies across computers, phones, eReaders, etc. And if you want to text but you find it hard to press the tiny buttons on a cellphone, purchase one with bigger keys or get one with large on-screen touch keys. There is usually a solution to anything that makes it easier for you to use the technology, so don't let your own special needs stand in the way of using technology.Thank you.",16 followers,Cory Hicks,572,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-to-learn-technology

It has not been 8 months since we started working on new technology at my company, and now we have been sent newer development boards for testing by our partner companies.It definitely means that we need to re-learn atleast 20% of the what we worked on in order to stay on top of the technological wave. Mastering is still out of question. Work hard.","1,732 followers",Heath Weaver,2.6K,471,4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-does-emerging-technology-mean
