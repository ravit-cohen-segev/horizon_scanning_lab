The Chinese were also very advanced but they completely isolated themselves from the rest of the world. As did India and later on Japan.It wasn’t until the 15th Century Renaissance that western civilization started to advance again. And it wasn’t until the Scientific Revolution and the first Industrial Revolution that the world entered the modern era and changed dramatically.If we had not fallen so far behind, most of our current social problems would be solved long ago and our civilization would probably be out colonizing the entire solar system.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Are-the-elite-against-or-for-advanced-technology
3,"“Do you think there is some forgotten history of mankind like some ancient history of advanced technology and advanced humans?”If I may, I'm going to break this question into it's three comprising parts.First, “do I think there is some forgotten history of Mankind”? Absolutely. Without a doubt. There are ancient civilizations, structures, and events that we have only recently glimpsed in modernity, even as recent as only a few years.It has recently been discovered that there was another civilization in China at the same time that the traditionally known Chinese civilization was developing. Som“Do you think there is some forgotten history of mankind like some ancient history of advanced technology and advanced humans?”If I may, I'm going to break this question into it's three comprising parts.First, “do I think there is some forgotten history of Mankind”? Absolutely. Without a doubt. There are ancient civilizations, structures, and events that we have only recently glimpsed in modernity, even as recent as only a few years.It has recently been discovered that there was another civilization in China at the same time that the traditionally known Chinese civilization was developing. Some speculate that they could even be older than the Chinese. We don't know their name, where they came from, what they believed, or anything else. Of course, the idea that another civilization was about, much less possibly older or more advanced, isn't exactly something that sits well with the Chinese Communist Party and government, so they're not in any kind of a hurry to investigate further or share what they know.I'm only in my 30’s, and when I was in grade school I remember being taught that human civilization is only 5000 years old. In high school, it became 7500 years. By the time I was in undergrad and grad school, the temple in Turkey had been found that is dated back more than 12,000 years. Remarkably, the ruins of a civilization in South America have been found that are believed to date back up to 14,000 years.The ruins of an unknown civilization have also been found deep in the Amazon where it was previously believed that no large or sophisticated civilizations could exist.There are other more benign events that have taken place and are well documented that have led to the loss of our historical knowledge, such as the destruction of the Great Library of Alexandria, or groups and populations that purposely destroyed knowledge and literature because it did not agree with their religious beliefs or world view.All of these are examples of lost history.Next, did any of these lost civilizations and histories include advanced technologies that Mankind has forgotten? It depends on what you mean by advanced technology. Were the ancients more advanced than we give them credit for? Did they have technologies and methods that we've forgotten? Most assuredly! Consider the following. If the Great Pyramid of Giza was built in the twenty year time period believed by most mainstream Egyptologists, then each of those blocks, weighing tons each, would have had to have been laid and put into position every 4.6 seconds, from start to finish, for the twenty years straight. The largest freestanding statue in Egypt weighs 2 million pounds. The West Block at the Temple Mount in Jerusalem weighs 1 million pounds. The largest building block at the Temple of Jupiter in Lebanon weighs over 4 million pounds. All done by peoples who were supposedly technologically simple, without the use of iron, and only soft copper to try and quarry such hard and massive stones. There are examples of stonework around the world that we cannot or would be hard-pressed to duplicate today. Some of the stonework we don't even know how it was done, such as some of the Incan stonework found in South America. For some, it's as simple as not understanding how they managed to quarry and move such massive stones from the quarries, across distances, and up mountains, even well above the treeline. For others, it is as baffling as trying to comprehend how they managed to fit the stones together. Some of their structures appear as if they literally melted the stones into shape and together. If that is indeed how it was done, how did they reach the required temperatures of 1 or 2 thousand degrees Fahrenheit to achieve it?Finally, were there forgotten “advanced humans”? I would say certainly not. They are us. We are them. We're all the same humans, just subject to the limitations of our own memories and inadequacies. A great analogy would be the Dark Ages of Europe. The Romans weren't “advanced humans” and the subsequent people “less than” in some way. We just fell victim to our own human faults: war, corruption, discontent, violence, greed, pride, etc. They couldn't have been “advanced humans”, at least compared to the rest of us. Their civilizations did fall in the end, after all.",0 followers,Alex Foster,36.7K,368,19.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Are-the-elite-against-or-for-advanced-technology

We need leather first. Where are we going to get leather?How to make Leather:Oops. We don’t have any cows because they haven’t been domesticated yet. We’ll have to make our leather out of something else, such as a deer.How to kill a Deer:Really? A bow and arrow? How do we make that? Better just look for a dead deer lying around somewhere.

You mean we can’t use a regular fire? Ahh. Its not hot enough.How to build a Forge:Charcoal?How to make Charcoal:????…As you can see. Even the simplest tasks are not so simple. It seems like technology is progressing really fast today, but that is because of all the technology that literally took ages to figure out.How long would it take to figure out how to do any of the simple technologies above, simply by trial and error? It could take a really long time, for example, to figure out what Iron Ore looks like, and how to build a forge hot enough to melt it. Especially if you didn’t even have any idea that Iron even exists.I mean, come on. Everyone knows rocks don’t melt. If they did, how could we use them to build ovens. Right????So there are a lot of hurdles. But once a technology has been figured out, we can build on it to create the next step.These days, we’ve figured out enough things to do a lot. We’ve also figured out something called science, which is the art of figuring out new things.Tasks that were once really hard, become much easier.

For years, Dr. Gey, a cancer and virus researcher, had been collecting cells from patients who came to The Johns Hopkins Hospital with cervical cancer, but each sample taken quickly died in Dr. Gey’s lab, all apart from Henrietta Lacks. Henrietta Lacks cells did not die, in fact they wouldThis was an amazing medical breakthrough, for decades whenever anyone tried to experiment on human cells to find a cure for a disease they would simply die within hours, but with Henrietta Lacks cells, they survived and could grow again and again meaning that there was now nearly an infinite amount of these perfect cells alive if used correctly.The first things these cells were tested on was polio, and instead of dying straight away like most cells they survived. This allowed scientists to experiment on Henrietta cells until they found a vaccine for one of the biggest children killers of the early 20th century, polio.Curing polio was only the beginning of Henrietta Lacks cells career, by the end of the century her cells were used to create theHenrietta Lacks unfortunately never found out about her contribution to science as she died only a couple of weeks after her treatment, her cells were also taken without her knowledge and her family only found out about what she did for medicine and science 20 years later.","68,794 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Are-the-elite-against-or-for-advanced-technology

There are very, very few people who know how to make a barrel left in the world and fewer every year, yet barrel making was an advanced technology that changed the entire world for literally thousands of years.Incidentally. the most prolific barrel in the world today is the ASB or American Standard Barrel that hold 53 gallons because America makes more barrels than anyone else in the world. Many used Jack Daniels barrels are re-used to make other kinds of liquor in other parts of the world.Do you know who the highest paid man in the community was in “ancient times”? It was the Wheelwright.Making a wheel from wood with an axle that attaches to a cart and doesn’t fall apart within a mile or two is one of the most “advanced technologies” of all time. Without it, most civilizations would have failed or failed to spread. Cart wheels are complex and the forces must play against each other continuously to hold the wheel together as it rolls. A Cartwright made as much then as a jet airline pilot back does today. In the 1880s when the average wage was $1.50 a day, the Wheelwright was making 90 dollars a week. On the Mayflower they brought one single cart over to America and it was the most valuable thing on the ship manifest, worth more than 10 times the next most valuable thing on the ship.
