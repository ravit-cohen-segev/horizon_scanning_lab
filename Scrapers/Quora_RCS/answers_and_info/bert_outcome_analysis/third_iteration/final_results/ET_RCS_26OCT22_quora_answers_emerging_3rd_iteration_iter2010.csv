Well, the caption isWhen you first see the picture below, it is easy to understand how a system could mistakenly classify the image as snow and snowmobiles.For image recognition such as this, the algorithm would apply a level ofThe best way to increase the confidence interval of a machine learning system is to feed the system more uniqueNo matter how great the technology you’ve built, without an adequate amount of data, the model will never get trained, never developing the ability to strongly identify and classify what it sees.Of course this is just one example of the interplay betweenTo provide value, you need","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-keep-myself-updated-with-the-upcoming-webinars-and-product-releases-by-technology-companies-like-Google-Amazon-etc
