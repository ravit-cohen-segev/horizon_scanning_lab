1,"Have you ever seen a personal computer from the 1970s? Here’s the Commodore PET from 1977. It came with 8K of RAM, and a tape deck for storage.The IBM Personal Computer in 1981 didn’t replace the PET with a wholly different thing. But it did make improvements, and of course, as an independent development, no compatibility between them. But that’s the default. New things replace old, they don’t cooperate with old.The Macintosh in 1984 also didn’t toss out the idea of the personal computer, but it made improvements.So did the Amiga computer.Laptop computers didn’t change the whole idea, either.Have you ever seen a personal computer from the 1970s?

New things replace old, they don’t cooperate with old.The Macintosh in 1984 also didn’t toss out the idea of the personal computer, but it made improvements.So did the Amiga computer.Laptop computers didn’t change the whole idea, either. They did come up with a name for the class of personal computer: “laptop” or, later on, “notebook.” But they were still personal computers.And 42 years later, we still have laptops, which are still personal computers.Along the way, we added another new subclass, the tablet. They’re still personal computers, but there has been a revolution along the way, even if it happened a bit at a time.Sometimes we took a branch off to make something new, but still kind of the same thing. Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) were very low performance personal computers. We didn’t want to say “PC” most of the time with these. Except Microsoft, who initially called them “Pocket PC”, because, yes, they were pocket personal computers. Still faster and more capable than that old PET 2001.Today we have these things. They’re still personal computers as well, but they also got another subclass name: smartphone. Why? Well, they are personal computers with several data radio modems, one of which uses the same kind of cellular networks that cellphones used, back when plain old cellphones were a thing.One of the reasons you know a thing is a personal computer is that it can adapt to nearly any purpose, given time. Compared to that PET 2001, your phone — I have an Honor Magic4 Pro phone here in my hand — isn’t the same thing at all. And yet, yes it is. I can chose the programs I want to run on it, I can personalize it, and it’s mine, not something owned by my company, my university, etc. It’s vastly more powerful than the PET, the IBM PC, the Macintosh, the Grid, the Amiga, etc. And yes, it can be used as a telephone (though in fact, being a European model in the USA, not so much), but that’s kind of a side effect of having a data network. In fact, in about a week, the voice networks on my cellular carrier, T-Mobile, go away forever. It’s all computer from here on, all data!I will make the claim that the Personal Computer represented a major change in the way computers are used, marking the smart of the second generation. And that smartphones did as well, being part of the third generation. Those generations were about access and portability, though, not the fact that you’re using a computer:Of course, these are just my distinctions. None of this happened all at once, but over time. The first members of a new generation weren’t terribly useful yet. I could have a typical PDA with me all the time, but it didn’t network. Networking was a completely different technological revolution that overlays all of personal computing today.So whatever comes next, it’ll probably start out kind of crappy, and it’ll be made from the personal computers we use today, but if it’s a true revolution, it’ll drive that evolution to new places. The one I have in mind is this:In short, it’s a revolution not in wide-area communications, not in computing power, not in mobility, but more than anything, a revolution in man-machine communications. That’s happened before, and in fact, continuously. The GUIs in Amiga, Macintosh, and Windows were a huge change. The GUIs in mobile devices, especially tablets and smartphones, were a predictable but important change as well, a compromise in efficiency necessary to enable mobility. Along the way we got other interfaces, like good speech recognition between machine and man.The ultimate end is to eliminate the interface, or at least as much of the interface as possible, and connect machine to our brains.

Candidate use so much help from friends and online that they really aren't effective measures of the candidate's abilities. They measure a candidate's ability to solicit help from friends.And, as a candidate, you probably don't want these homework assignments to be a widespread practice. Companies who do these homework assignments often take advantage of candidates.A company has a strong incentive to cut candidates who are bad fits prior to the final round. Bringing a candidate in for a full day of interviews is expensive. While you might be bummed to get rejected prior to the final round, it's a waste of your time if you're brought in for a final round (particularly if you're interviewing with multiple companies) when you are very unlikely to get an offer.However, when a company can just shoot off a quick homework assignment, they might offer you the chance to do this assignment even when you're unlikely to be hired.

These puzzles were all designed so that brute force methods would not yield an answer within a human lifetime.Puzzle answers could be written in any programming language (we had one guy submit an answer in a language he designed himself), but that meant that the pool of reviewers needed to have people who knew the languages well enough to review them.One day a puzzle answer came in that was written in OCaml, and I was the only person around who answered the call for people who knew OCaml. I began reading the answer, which was all in one file. At the top it looked good, but the further down it went the more ugly the code got. So I recommended no go.A few weeks later I was again asked to review an OCaml puzzle answer. Top looked great, then I began reading down and it was getting ugly and HEY WAIT A MINUTE. Of course it was the same code with a comment changed. A search revealed that the first guy (whom we didn’t call back) published his answer on his blog and someone copied it and sent it in with their resume.To detect this kind of thing we had a backstop. The last thing in the onsite interview involved being given a room with a computer in it and being asked to solve a simpler puzzle. Faced with that it was relatively easy to catch people who could not code.And this happened. I also administered this in house test for a while, and every so often there would be someone who seemed great but just couldn’t write a working program.I really liked that system.
