No, it would be a big mistake to think so. China is not only “stealing”, but also “stealing” for hundreds of years, but the “things being stolen” cannot be measured by money. If, you only think that Chinese people have stolen advanced technology, then Chinese people are too simple. It's naive of you to think like this ~China not only steals from the US but also steals from advanced countries all over the world.But we do not think that was a “Steal”, we treat them as the “learning”. However, we were forced to “learn” and “steal”.Because of the Opium War in 1840, the Chinese “stol” from the British what is advanced, what is the world, and what is ignorance.Because of the Second Opium War in 1860, China “stole” from the British and France, what it means to fatten sheep and then kill it. China has “stolen” that western civilization is just a beast in the cloak of civilization. The site of Yuanmingyuan, which was robbed and burned, is still in Beijing, and the Chinese government will never rebuild it because it is telling the Chinese people that they are backward! China has learned that backward countries lose not only dignity but also land, property, and life. From this time, China was once again shocked by the weapons and equipment of advanced countries. The Chinese began to learn advanced weapons and equipment, and the mighty Westernization Movement began.Because of the failure of the Sino-Japanese War in 1894, Chinese people “stole” from Japan that what China needed to learn was not technology at all, but the political system! Chinese people have learned that Japanese people are far more ferocious and greedy than Europeans! For the first time, the Chinese “stole” that the nation could be extinct and enslaved.Because of the defeat of the Eight-Power Allied Forces invading China in 1900, the Chinese “stole” from Britain, France, Germany, the United States, Russia, Austria-Hungary, Italy, and Japan that it was not only the system that fell behind but also the corrupt Qing government!Because of American history, Chinese people have “stolen” the importance of independence. If it is not an independent country, it will always be a colony. This is why China will persist in pursuing independence no matter how many people it sacrifices.Because of the failure of the Revolution in 1911, China has “stolen” that its fragile economy cannot change the situation of bullying in China.Because of the New Culture Movement in 1919, Chinese people “stole” that the change of system can't bring people's awakening. Only when the change of thought is touched, the change of system will affect. Otherwise, no matter how advanced the system is, it will not drive the ignorant people.Because of the Japanese massacre in Nanjing, the Chinese “stole” that compromise and concession will not lead to peace but will intensify aggression. Japanese invaders will kill people in your capital. They will rape his wife in front of her husband. They will pick out babies with bayonets from pregnant women's stomachs. They will carry out killing competitions. Before this, Chinese people were just like stupid animals. Now, Chinese people have learnt that Chinese people want to be regarded as human beings, so they must fight like human beings. That's why the Japanese killed 35 million Chinese people, and finally made the Chinese people more United and fierce. 35,000,000 people made China, a sleeping dragon, open its eyes.bury alivekilling competitionsdie for ours’ countryEvery inch of land in China was liberated by Chinese people with blood, which is why Chinese people never allow any land to be lost.Because of the Korean War, the Chinese “stole” from the Americans what the most powerful military power is like. The Chinese “stole” from the Americans that American soldiers can also be killed. The Chinese “stole” from the Americans that if China wants to have peace, the Chinese must have the ability to fight.Because of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, the Chinese “stole” from the United States and the Soviet Union that diplomacy should focus on national interests.Because of the Gulf War, the Chinese “stole” that modern information warfare is like this. This is something we have never seen before, and it completely sobers us from being intoxicated with the victory of the Korean War. Since then, the PLA has been learning from the United States.Because of the events in 1989, Chinese people “stole” what the state governance and modern country are like, and the times have changed.Because of the disintegration of the Soviet Union, China “stole” that it was not only nuclear bombs but also ideas that destroyed the country.Because of the YInhe incident, the Chinese “stole” that our weak navy and satellite positioning system could not protect our caravan at all.Because NATO bombed the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia, the Chinese “stole” that the principle that weak countries have no diplomacy remains unchanged today.Because the United States has infiltrated China's Internet in various forms since 2008, Chinese people “stole” the importance of Internet security, an...",0 followers,Ming Mo,622,118,132.2K,2020,https://www.quora.com/The-U-S-announced-penalties-on-three-China-companies-and-their-subsidiaries-claiming-that-they-were-engaged-in-unspecified-missile-technology-proliferation-activities-What-factual-basis-does-the-US-have

These are the people that guaranteed Chinas rise and also guaranteed Chinas position as the Worlds Manufacturer.-But here’s the real kicker.US GDP Growth Rate - 2.1%China GDP growth rate - 6.0%The US cannot remain the number 1 economy when Chinas GDP is growing close to three times faster.-We all know that Covid has turned the world upside down but everything will go back to how it was before Covid invaded the planet and once it has gone things will return to how they were before Covid.-Just one more wrinkle - American companies that have stockholders are required, by law, to maximise profits and they are not beholden to the government, to Trump or to anything/anyone else.They MUST not purposefully or knowingly reduce profits or they can be sued by shareholders and they will be sued if they do, knowingly, allow profits to drop.Shareholders can and probably would sue every member of the Board and the CEO as well. If any of these American companies were to purposefully reduce profits by leaving China and returning to the US or any other place where they would knowingly reduce profits the Directors of the company could be sued by shareholder and end up bankrupted by any such move and/or end up in prison for a long time for knowingly reducing shareholder returns.How many America senior managers would ever take the chance that they would end up in prison for 10, 20, 30 years or even longer?-America will not be a haven for any of these companies unless they are given the right to reduce shareholder returns and if that were to happen where do you think those companies will move to - Vietnam, India, Cambodia, etc?

8,"The US has not fallen behind China in missile technology. Where they have fallen behind is in deployment, and for a very good reason. The intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) treaty between the US and Russia dating back to the 1980’s bans either side from possessing the type of missiles that Mr Lung endlessly hypes.

So before you start getting a boner over how great and superior these thing are consider this. These types of missiles were banned for a reason. They can carry either a conventional or nuclear warhead which makes them dangerous. If I detect one coming at me I might just assume the worst. Hyping missiles that the other guy had in the 1980’s but is no longer allowed to have? Give us all a break. If China now considers itself to be one of the big boys maybe they should consider playing by the same rules. Another thing to consider. The treaty between the US and Russia now appears to be on shaky ground. The Russians it would seem are, surprise, surprise, cheating and the US is now considering backing out. If this should happen how long do you think it will take for the US to install 100’s (or 1000’s) of similar type missiles on their nearby military bases and in Japan? I suspect not very long. China currently has 100’s of these things aimed directly at these bases, Japan and US carrier groups. Why shouldn’t the US also have 100’s aimed directly at China. That’s the way it works. You threaten me and I counter. A needless arms race that China started. A more sensible approach would be for China to remove these missiles.

Nation-states are too closely inter-connected with each other and they cannot sever cross-border relations.The US appears to have become jealous of China, since Beijing had been much more successful at containing the COVID-19 outbreak. When you compare results, Americans have good reason to feel ashamed.China has only had a few thousand people die from the virus and less than 90,000 confirmed cases in the country, while the US with two months to prepare for the pandemic has reported over 50,000 deaths and a million people infected.That’s shocking since China is the world’s most populous nation with nearly 1.4 billion people while that’s three times more than the US. India is a neighbor to China with a large population and they are performing better at tackling the coronavirus than the Americans have as well.Both Republican and Democrat politicians in the USA have stumbled so they stand eager to distract American voters from paying attention to their blunders.President Donald J. Trump and his administration were very late to respond to COVID-19, while Democrats had failed to call for urgency. US lawmakers will play the blame game.They will want to say China is at fault and argue that Beijing does not have a democracy, enforces political censorship and forbids public assemblies to protest against their government.They will rely more on the US-based media to push an anti-China narrative, which seems very successful so far.You can get a better sense of knowing American sentiments by reviewing Facebook and Twitter feeds. Apparently, many Americans love criticizing China at this moment.The US media is successful at portraying China in a negative light and even if the stories are false, Americans will believe them anyway.This is a psychological state when you can be easily deceived by false warnings.I recall in elementary school, a teacher said she was working late and there was a false fire alarm in the building. She thought she could smell fire and believed she had seen smoke as she rushed out of the school. She learned later the fire alarms were only being tested. There was no smoke or fire.By understanding this, we can see how many Americans are duped into believing strange conspiracy theories about China.Many have learned at a young age that China was a country very different than the USA and so Americans would equate those political and cultural differences as bad.When people assume China is a bad country, it’s very hard to convince them otherwise. To ask them to alter their lifelong perspective on China would be similar to suggesting a loyal Democrat should vote Republican and vice versa.Nevertheless, Americans and the world will not de-couple from China and they know that. Let’s take a closer look by reading an article from the China Daily:https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202004/01/WS5e83d179a31012821728371b.htmlAccording to the China Daily:“US politicians will fail in their attempt at decoupling the US from China and promoting the movement of the supply chains elsewhere; it is difficult to decouple enterprises enjoying supply chain, cost and efficiency advantages.China should now refrain from large-scale monetary stimulus measures that may result in a drastic rise in manufacturing costs, the biggest threat to its supply chain. Besides, it should take the lead in boosting the digital economy to attract enterprises from across the world.”We will likely hear a lot of noise from American politicians this election year as they promise to get tough on China, but it’s just noise – nothing more.",63 followers,Peter Elliott,611,5.4K,20M,2020,https://www.quora.com/The-U-S-announced-penalties-on-three-China-companies-and-their-subsidiaries-claiming-that-they-were-engaged-in-unspecified-missile-technology-proliferation-activities-What-factual-basis-does-the-US-have
