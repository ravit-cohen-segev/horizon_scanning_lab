0,The larger numerical BS norms mean subsequent cleaner engines…..The vision of engine manufacturers like Honda is to provide more cleaner air from exhausts than the air entering engines.Tjough the BS norms in numbers and their validity over certain future periods is entirely a Govt. related issue.I hope this helps.SUNIL PATIL,698 followers,Pratik Das,629,143,2.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-technology-after-a-BS-VI-vehicles-launch-in-April-2020-How-many-years-will-BS-VI-vehicles-be-able-to-sustain
1,"Life on Earth is billions of years old, and the evolution of technological creatures happened just once, so it would seem unlikely that there will be another one any time in the next few billion years.Even if you consider just the evolution of man from non-tool-making apes, it still took at least a hundred thousand years or so.And as if that weren’t enough, it’s worth pointing out that we are rapidly exterminating larger mammals, so we are essentially eliminating candidates for further development of tool-makers.",121 followers,Jeffrey Chan,9.9K,1.5K,4.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-technology-after-a-BS-VI-vehicles-launch-in-April-2020-How-many-years-will-BS-VI-vehicles-be-able-to-sustain
2,"Human beings were the first species to leap in evolution using fire, electricity, and chemicals to advance civilization - which species will be next to take this evolutionary step and set off the next technological race for survival?There are no other species on the planet capable of taking this leap. Our most intelligent creatures live in the oceans, making it impossible for them to master fire and all its associated technologies. You realize, I hope, that there is nothing inevitable about technologically capable creatures evolving anywhere.",366 followers,Brett Alder,1.1K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Human-beings-were-the-first-species-to-leap-in-evolution-using-fire-electricity-and-chemicals-to-advance-civilization-which-species-will-be-next-to-take-this-evolutionary-step-and-set-off-the-next-technological-race
