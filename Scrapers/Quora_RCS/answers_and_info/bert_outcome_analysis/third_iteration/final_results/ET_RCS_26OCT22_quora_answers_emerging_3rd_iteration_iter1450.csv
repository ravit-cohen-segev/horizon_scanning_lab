0,"I doubt anyone knows the answer to this. My supposition is that we are decades away from a practical laser-based weapon. Although the Navy is testing them now, they are huge, eat up a lot of power, and have not proved particularly reliable. Advances in electronics and batteries make these kinds of weapons more and more practical, but we’re still years away, in my humble opinion.","16,063 followers",Pavel Fekula,1.4K,11K,118.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-far-off-are-we-from-replacing-guns-firing-metal-projectiles-with-lasers-or-the-next-big-technology-Are-we-decades-away-or-centuries

2,"Fifty years is a long time in terms of technology. Consider the changes in computing alone; the computing power that filled a large room five decades ago now fits in the palm of your hand, and it is vastly more powerful given access to the internet.

Consider the changes in computing alone; the computing power that filled a large room five decades ago now fits in the palm of your hand, and it is vastly more powerful given access to the internet. Natural language processing and machine learning have become wide spread in only the last fiveCouple this with similar rates of advancement across nearly all of science and it is clear that the ability to prove beyond reasonable doubt when criminal activity has occurred will exceed what is portrayed in fictional stories. In particular, testing technologies able to detect ever more minute traces of evidence confirming the presence of people and substances, as well as the proliferation of surveillance technologies, will render privacy an ever more precious commodity.Note that fictional accounts of future technology often ignore features of technology that would invalidate the plot line. For example, frequently an action scene of the hero racing to help a victim is used rather than the power of a phone call to authorities who could arrive on the scene in moments. The action scene injects more suspense while the reality does not.The ability to quickly access a the video, audio and related historical data required to identify a perpetrator is already pervasive in public places. It took only a few hours to identify the Boston Marathon bombers using technology fromIn short, I think that forensics will be automated. Every officer of the law will have immediate access to pervasive surveillance records, immediate DNA/substance detection and correlation tools as well as rapid and automatic autopsy results. The focus of future fiction should be more on motive, not proof of guilt.","5,084 followers",Bobby Tatro,3.9K,2.2K,45.6M,2014,https://www.quora.com/How-far-off-are-we-from-replacing-guns-firing-metal-projectiles-with-lasers-or-the-next-big-technology-Are-we-decades-away-or-centuries

Amazon was offering recommendations based on your past purchases and browsing way back in the 1990s, and that can't be dismissed as a form of thought reading. And internet ads today try very hard to get to know who you are so that they can send you ads for products you'll buy.

6,"No, no one would want people reading their thoughts. That will probably never happen just because of that reason. But, even should that become a thing, the brain is a notorious thing to figure out.

We can already do some of it now ... a wearable that detects ""calmness"", to help you ""meditate"", could be built-into the equivalent of Google Glass today. And would be adopted just as wrist-worn heart-rate monitors are.Moving on, some brain measurement might help a future Glass-based personal assistent to correlate how you feel with what you are looking at, so that it can identify real-world objects with your moods. It will start to offer feeds of news items or playlists of music or movies to watch that suit your current mood.When people get used to this, there'll also be apps to trainAnd so it goes ...Meanwhile, the military-intelligence-industrial-complex will continue working on this stuff to get better lie detectors and better ways to interrogate prisoners etc.","58,988 followers",Michael Wolfe,504,2K,17.3M,2015,https://www.quora.com/How-will-technology-change-forensic-science-over-the-next-50-years

A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one. It's hypothesized that the reason humans learn so quickly is that we are fitting new examples into our existing knowledge rather than forming entirely new categories. If we could teach machines to do the same, they would learn exponentially faster and apply that learning more effectively.Transfer learning is a very hot topic in AI research right now, so I expect major breakthroughs in the next few years. I think this may be sufficient to achieve artificial general intelligence, but even if not, it will dramatically extend the range of tasks that machines can accomplish.","45,630 followers",David Seidman,790,3.6K,85.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-will-technology-change-forensic-science-over-the-next-50-years
