2,"In my opinion, the scariest part of technological advances is that part that we don't expect to be any problem at all. That's generally how we get our comeuppance. Everyone assumed that the Titanic was unsinkable, just because enough morons signed off on the limitations of which they well knew were not worthy of concern. And everyone believed it until the ship went down and killed thousands of people.The scariest part is the unanticipated problem — the problem completely unexpected, for which, therefore, no contingency plans exist. That's probably what will kill us.","6,464 followers",Michael Soareverix,652,373,6.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-scariest-part-of-advancing-technology

4,The new software people started using to make “Deepfakes” porn. Basically it puts peoples faces on other peoples bodies. And probably very soon people will be able to modify all kinds of videos and change the appearances of people which when you think about it can be used for all kinds of horrifying things. Video evidence will become obsolete as well.,1 follower,Anthony Davenport,69.5K,89,10.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-scariest-part-of-advancing-technology

LET US IN!”Employees crouched, watching worriedly as the protestors grew more violent. There were at least two hundred so far, and as night fell, their numbers swelled.Andrew Seln sat in his chair, typing. The protestors didn’t matter. They were a temporary inconvenience to his work.The other employees tried to follow his lead. There was always the possibility that if they didn’t, they would be fired.Andrew was a genius, a man of intense focus and ambition. There was no doubt that he had earned his position as CEO at Neuracell. Quality was of highest importance and protestors were not an excuse for wasted time.In fact, Andrew’s wife sat nearby, holding their child and watching him work. After Andrew’s house had been badly damaged by a riot, the family had basically moved to the office. Instead of losing his productivity after the disaster, Seln had somehow increased it.“Seln, the police are taking a long time to get here,” one of the employees said. “This protest started getting aggressive an hour ago and it was supposed to be over at 8:00. It’s practically night. Nobody down there is leaving.”Andrew responded without looking up. “The city has been under some strain. They’ll be here eventually. Until then, focus on your work. Every extra minute we stay here is a minute the company becomes more successful.”The employee was silent. Seln continued typing, ignoring the crashing and shouting. He wasn’t bothered that the employee called him by his last name. Everyone did. Andrew Seln had earned a reputation as ‘Seln’ in the media and his employees had taken to it naturally.Below, however, the protestors were beginning to get riled up. The chanting grew louder as hundreds of the impoverished citizens gathered, increasingly bold. “Break the doors down!” somebody shouted.A man ran forward out of the front of the crowd and swung a metal baseball bat with all his might straight into the doors. The glass shattered.The crowd roared, galvanized into action. People had been waiting to vent their anger for hours, and throwing rocks wasn’t doing it.Both the doors were smashed open as people shoved their way into the building. In seconds, the entire dynamic had changed. This was no longer a protest. This was a riot.The mob rushed up the stairs in a frenzy, breaking everything they could find until they reached the main floor.Andrew Seln had just enough time to turn in shock before protestors broke open the door and flooded the room.The programmer quickly hit ctrl + s and began backing away, hands raised. A man picked up his computer and slammed it onto the floor with a harsh laugh, smashing the screen in with his foot.One of the employees tried to run through the doorway. A furious man stepped forward and punched the employee straight in the mouth. The employee crumpled.“You like that!? YOU LIKE THAT!?”The protestor kicked the man, blood dripping from his fist. The employee curled into a ball as people gathered, kicking him indiscriminately.“Hey—” Seln started, shocked by the sudden violence.The man turned. “You!” he hissed.Seln was thrown sideways to the floor as the mob kicked down the computers. “Drag ’em all out.” the man spat in contempt.Seln saw the door open and then he was thrown down the stairs, vision going black as he tumbled. He hit the opposite wall of the stairwell with a crunch, letting out a pained gasp of breath. Seconds passed as footsteps pounded on the metal. Then Seln was hurled down the next set of stairs, crashing to the ground unable to breathe.Seln was dragged out of the building, clawing for a wall to grab onto. He felt a jerk on his arm and then he went tumbling down the concrete steps, striking his head brutally in the ground in what would have been a fatal impact.For a moment, the innovator blacked out. Then the neural lace he wore sparked and sent a ripple of awareness through his brain.Seln was enhanced. His skull had been reinforced and covered in shock-absorbers that would stop a bullet. His spinal cord had been layered with protective nanomaterials. He had even replaced his entire right arm with a superior robotic one.Most importantly, he also wore a neural lace of his own design, a device that sustained his mental activity and allowed him to control his emotions and think faster. The device he’d created his business around. Now it was re-awakening his consciousness and working on healing damaged brain cells.Seln crawled to his feet just in time to see one of his co-workers hit the ground next to him. The co-worker didn’t get up.“GIVE US JUSTICE!” the crowd chanted, looking on in glee as employees were beaten and thrown down the stairs. The rioters had spent eight months in horrific poverty as intelligent machines took their jobs and the economy crashed. Now they were fighting against one of the companies that had done it all.Seln looked around desperately for his wife and child. All he saw was a flash of his wife’s blond hair and then she was lost from sight.The CEO ran forwards, shoving aside more rioters. Everything he had worked for was flashing before his eyes.His wife stumbled and fell. The two men let go of her in disgust. One kicked her. The other snatched her pearl necklace and held it up for the crowd to see. “THIS IS JUSTICE! THIS IS JUSTICE!”Seln’s vision went red. He shoved the man aside, grabbing the pearl necklace and helped his wife up, who was looking dazed.His little child huddled on the ground. Seln sheltered him, glaring at the crowd. For the moment, they didn’t move forward.Then the man Seln had pushed got up and hit Seln with an echoing slap. Seln staggered back and the man spat in his face. “You f—”Seln’s right arm blurred, catching the man’s wrist as he went for another slap. The CEO bared his teeth in a savage grin as the man’s face twisted in discomfort against Seln’s iron grip.Then the man pulled a knife from his waistband and lunged for Seln. In a single fluid motion, Seln gritted his teeth and snapped the man’s wrist upwards.The rioter flopped to the ground as the entire crowd turned in shock and going silent. Then, as if by some horrible spell, the skin on Seln’s hand slipped off, revealing a patchwork of dark metal.If the crowd had been riled up before, it was nothing compared to the violence they felt now. Seln was everything they hated, every effort that had been made to establish a ‘permanent biological underclass’ by upgrading machinery.The crowd roared and attacked. Seln was struck in the back of the head by a flagpole. His wife and child were trampled as the crowd went wild. Gunfire sounded, and Seln felt a piercing pain in his left shoulder.Another flurry of shots rang out. Someone pinned him down, hot breath making it hard to breathe. Seln was thrown upright against a wall, then lifted into the air so that everyone could see him.“CUT IT OFF! CUT IT OFF!” the crowd screamed.Seln struggled as several people held his arm in place, striking at it with hammers and blunt objects. Dents began to appear as the people struck harder, knocking pieces out of the asphalt road he was sprawled on. A bolt cutter changed hands and Seln struggled, eyes wide at the sight.The arm sparked as a metal spike was rammed into his elbow. The man with the bolt cutter swore and hissed as he pulled the levered edges tight. The arm was becoming unrecognizable.Seln gasped as he felt a piercing numbness spread through his arm like pins and needles. The rioters heaved as the arm was cut further, only strands of wire holding it together.With a final tug, the metal arm was ripped out, leaving a gaping hole of shredded metal and wires. Seln felt sick, rolling limply to the ground as people kicked him. A blow struck his eye and his vision went completely dark.A canister landed next to him with a thud. Dark green gas poured out and the rioters scattered, choking as the gas burned their lungs. A helicopter flew overhead, firing the gas canisters indiscriminately at the fleeing crowd.“My God,” the pilot said, looking down.Neuracell headquarters was ablaze. Bodies lay in the street. Fragments of metal and brick were scattered everywhere.Seln choked as the gas surrounded him, burning his throat terribly. He couldn’t move. His entire body was paralyzed. He struggled, tears burning in his eyes. Blackness began to close in and the pain began to fade.The helicopter descended beside Seln, the wind of the blades blowing away the blistering gas. But the soldiers inside jumped out in the opposite direction, uttering low cries of horror.Seln’s wife and child lay in the street, unmoving. Killed by the riot.“They killed a child…” one of the soldiers murmured.The soldiers turned to go back to the helicopter. One of the soldiers peered towards Seln, suddenly noticing a rise and fall of his chest.“That guy’s alive!”The soldiers hurried over, administering a medkit, talking in low voices.“Look what they did to his arm.”“This poor guy.”“Do you think he worked for Neuracell?”“With an arm like that? Definitely.”“Wait… I think… Oh. Oh no.”“What?”“Recognize him?”“Oh sh—this is Andrew Seln.”The soldiers looked on in shocked disbelief.“This is going to be on the news.”The soldiers picked him up and set him in the helicopter. “Get us to the nearest hospital.”The helicopter sped away, leaving behind only bodies and a broken metal arm.",UNKNOWN,Bill Yu Liao (廖彧),650,138,1.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-scariest-part-of-advancing-technology

The steel girders it was constructed from were still warm from the mill. It is unusual today to have so many resources devoted to a single building but the Depression was just beginning to set in and there was a lot of slack time.Doing the interior was much easier than now. installing HVAC systems is a lengthy process but those didn’t even exist then (at least as we think of them). Wiring was easy, too since all they had to worry about were lights and a few things like fans.Building inspections were in their infancy so there was little slow-down from that.Safety was a low priority. Five people died building the Empire State Building. In modern day, each death would have stopped construction while authorities investigated but that didn’t happen back then.Ironically, the building was designed to got up fast so that the builders could start leasing office space as soon as possible but because of the Depression it took years to fill it. For a while it was known as the Empty State Building.Between safety, inspections, complexity and demand for resources, it would be too expensive to try to put up a building that fast today.",94 followers,Ben Levy,5.7K,1.6K,3.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-scariest-part-of-advancing-technology

Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party. Because radiation from nuclear accidents is apparently scarier than way more people dying of regular pollution constantly and the total annihilation of all life on Earth as the oceans boil away.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Where-do-I-get-dental-treatment-with-advanced-technology
