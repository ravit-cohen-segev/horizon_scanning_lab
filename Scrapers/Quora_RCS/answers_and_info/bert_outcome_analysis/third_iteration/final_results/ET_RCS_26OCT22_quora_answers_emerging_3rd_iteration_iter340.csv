1,"MKBHD is the best tech YouTuber. Unlike other top tech YouTuber, I have never seen Marquess do a promotion or plug in any of his videoes. He has taken the quality of YouTube videos to a whole new level, and most of the current popular YouTuber (not just tech) followed through.His videos are always for the viewers. Even though he could be making a fortune by doing more videos and promoting tech products/services, he’s clearly not worried about money.And that’s not even the half of it. His review videos are pure perfection. I feel like he answers everyone’s questions before we need to ask him. TMKBHD is the best tech YouTuber.

6,"Honestly, that just depends on what you are trying to accomplish. I really like LinkedIn because it is very business-oriented and has a more professional feel to it. Whereas something like Facebook or Instagram is widely used for personal. While there are business Instagram and Facebook accounts, I still prefer LinkedIn because it allows you to connect on a professional level. As a serial entrepreneur, this is one of the most helpful tools for me. I hope my answer helps.

Factors like your industry, audience, and brand can all influence the network you use.1- Facebook is the most popular social network in the world with more than two billion users. As a result, you can find just about anyone on Facebook, provided they have access to the Internet. That means almost everyone in your customer base has a Facebook account, which is why it's a top social media site for businesses.2- Twitter gives its users a steadyThere are lots of social media platforms available to marketers today, and the ones you use can play a major role in your social media marketing success. Factors like your industry, audience, and brand can all influence the network you use.1- Facebook is the most popular social network in the world with more than two billion users. As a result, you can find just about anyone on Facebook, provided they have access to the Internet. That means almost everyone in your customer base has a Facebook account, which is why it's a top social media site for businesses.2- Twitter gives its users a steady stream of information and new content from all over the Internet. It has millions of engaged users every month, and practically every brand in the world has an account to update its customers. It may not have the same broad audience as Facebook, but it’s easily one of the most accessible networks on the planet.3- Instagram is one of the youngest social networks out there, with a majority of users under 25. That makes it the perfect social network for brands or companies that target young, hip demographics. Photos and short videos with a small amount of text do exceptionally well on Instagram, and it also integrates with your Facebook and Twitter accounts so you can use the same photos across multiple platforms.4- Pinterest is a place to share (or “pin”) different visual content so that other people can see it. That can include everything from a scarf to an infographic, which means practically any company can find at least part of their niche on this social network. It’s one of the best social media platforms to promote new visual content you create, especially if you regularly maintain boards.5- In terms of professionalism, no social network can beat LinkedIn. It’s a thriving community of workers and business owners who share and connect on a professional level, making it much more formal than other social media platforms. Because of that, its users tend to respond better to B2B content than B2C.6- YouTube is kind of a catch-all when it comes to content since so many people use it (it’s the second-largest search engine in the world after Google). Comedy and music both do well on YouTube, but that doesn’t mean you can’t use this social media platform for your business.",151 followers,Sawyer Smith,547,550,8.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-social-media-technology-platforms

It tends to use more water to enable the agitator / pulsator to work efficiently. The dirty water stays inside the drum until it is drained at the end of washing cycle. Too little water will cause the pulsator’s effort to be concentrated on the few clothes directly over it. It uses more water and soap but less on electricity. But not at all times. Top loading washing machines generally cost less because of the design simplicity and the need for less seals.Front loader uses gravity to tumble the clothes for washing action and in the early part of drying. It uses minimal water and soap in the process which is one of its main selling point. Power is needed to bring clothes into tumbling motion hence will require more electricity because it is working against the gravity. However, in the matter of cleanliness of washed clothes, nothing beats the front loading as the tumbling motion subject the clothes to more mechanical washing action causing ultimate separation of the stains and dirt from the fabric. Some models pump out the dirty water and replace it with fresh water during washing cycle resulting to even more clean laundry. Too much soap will actually do damage to the internal electronics. The added mechanical features and sealing requirements makes the front loading washing machines more costlier than the top loaders.Both models have its pros and cons when using conventional electric motor. When inverter motor is considered into the equation, the front loading will easily surpass the top loading in both water and electricity economy. Remember that front loading cleans better in the first place so choosing which one is a good should not be difficult anymore.As for capacity, a 7 Kg is enough for a family of 3~4 because you will actually have to split your laundry into whites, colors and denims. If you have limited space for drying of clothes and blankets, you might look into a washer/dryer combination. You can fold the clothes right after drying and save pressing electricity in the process since it is good as pressed when folded while hot. Personally, I would like separate specialized machines to do each task so that in case of break downs, I will still be left with one functioning machine.Finally, a high end top loading washing machine will likely not able to surpass the average front loading machine in terms of performance. However an average front loader is generally more expensive that the high end top loader. Cost will be your ultimate limiting factor so you can choose for high end machine that is economical to run or an inexpensive model yet large water and electricity consumer. As they say, fine things comes with a cost.",UNKNOWN,Godrej Appliances,1.7K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Who-are-some-of-the-best-TECH-Youtubers-to-follow

It wasn't always pleasant within the team either. Everyone was invited to the Christmas parties - except the cleaning staff. Of course, I wasn't that actively involved with the patients. But if I hadn't cleaned every day, probably no more patients would have come. It's a bit like cleaning ladies are invisible. I chose the job freely and knew that it was limited in time. But anyone who works as a cleaner for years has to get a decent coat. I have become much more attentive myself through my part-time job. I think a cleaner doesn't want much. But a 'thank you' would be nice. And the understanding that cleaning is not a matter of course, but hard work.(found in the Internet anonymous)Cleaning is a difficult and dangerous job. The European Agency for Safety and Health at Work recently pointed out that cleaning workers have a particularly high risk of illness: due to the harsh cleaning agents and the risk of falling when mopping floors and stairs. Anyone cleaning school toilets or hospitals needs a hepatitis A vaccination.Cleaning staff have 18.4 sick days per year. That is well above the average of 10.1 days in the service industry.
