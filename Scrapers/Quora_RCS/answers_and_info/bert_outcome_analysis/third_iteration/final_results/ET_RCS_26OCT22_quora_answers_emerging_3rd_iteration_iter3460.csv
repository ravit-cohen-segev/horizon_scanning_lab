See how the blades in front are big and as they go back, they get smaller and smaller?As the air goes back the same amount of air that’s between the big blades is forced between the tiny blades in the back.That compressed air is then released into a combustion chamber. That’s a big furnace with a bunch of fuel nozzles spraying a fine mist of highly refined kerosene into the air and lighting it up to superheat the compressed air and get it moving REALLY fast as it decompresses.The point of it all, first and foremost is to blow that air onto a Turbine, called a “gas turbine” like a big windmill. That windmill is connected by a shaft that runs back forward through the engine and turns the compressor, which brings in more air.This is why another name for a jet engine is a “gas turbine engine.”The gas turbine only takes some of the air’s energy. The Remaining energy of the heated compressed air keeps going back, and depending on what kind of jet engine it is, that’s what’s next.What you normally think of as a jet engine uses all that remaining air energy for Thrust. In other words, it blows the air out the back hard enough to push whatever it’s attached to forwardThere are some other things you might want to do though, so you might add something after the compressor turbine to do something more than just push. A fighter jet, for example, wants to be able to go way faster than that air will allow, especially after the turbine has taken its share of energy, so after the turbine, you add another combustion chamber called an “Afterburner” which reheats the air again before blowing it out the back at full powerAnother kind of Jet engine is called a “Tuboshaft” engine. These are used to run things like helicopters or big tanks like the M1 Abrams. The way that works is after the compressor turbine, you add a “Power Turbine” which is connected to a gearbox. That gearbox, in the example of a helicopter, is what runs the rotors.I used to repair the Engines on these bad boys:Yes, I said engines, Plural. The Super Stallion is run by three General Electric T-64 engines.You might also run the power Turbine’s shaft directly to a Prop on a large prop plane. That kind of engine is called a “Turboprop” engine. Big Cargo planes with Props like the C-130 are normally using Turboprop enginesBut however you cut it, whatever you’re doing with the air after you compress it and heat it, in a jet engine, they all work on the same principle:Suck, Squeeze, Bang, Blow!",UNKNOWN,Chris O'Leary,1.7K,4.1K,89.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-reverse-engineering-advanced-technologies-like-jet-engines-and-semiconductors
1,"The answer depends on who is tasked with the engine work. If DRDO, they cannot do either job. They tried to reverse engineer the GE-404 engine for 30 years and failed. The USSR reverse engineered it in 9 months and fitted it onto the MiG-29 as the Klimov RD 33. But they couldn’t break the computer protocol, so the engine was fitted without FADEC. That is one heck of a disadvantage. The MiG-29 leaves a dark smoke trail; it cannot accept slams (rapid throttle movement forward).In the Mirage 2000 and Rafale, one does not have to worry about engine handling for fear of causing an engine surge-theThe answer depends on who is tasked with the engine work.

The U.S. has never been the leader in all tech and with the realization of the importance of tech most goverments, most notably China, have tech agendas. Many researchers will follow the research funding which is under attack by the Trump administration so the U.S. is likely to slowly lose leadership in many technologies.

By technology we can think of things like “missile technology” or “rocket propulsion technology” etc.I will answer with what comes to my mind and I might miss some things and get others wrong but I’ll try.For instance we have air to air missiles. Europeans are currently developing Meteor missile which reached initial operating capability (IOC) less than a month ago.What is publicly known is that the missile has a ramjet propulsion system and can reach speeds of over 4 mach.According to MBDA, Meteor has three to six times the kinematic performance of current air-air missiles of its type. The key to Meteor's performance is a throttleable ducted rocket (Meteor (missile)Here’s an article claiming that Meteor is in fact the best air to air missile.The Best Air-to-Air Missile in the World Is in Sweden — War Is BoringAssuming this public information is correct and I don’t see why it wouldn’t be - Europeans are ahead of US at the moment with their air to air Meteor missile which was developed over concern for Russia’s R-77 Vympel ramjet missile and according to some sources Meteor missile was built to “wipe the table clear of all opposition”.M777 howitzer is actually designed by BAE (UK).It was immediately widely adopted by US Army and US Marine Corps as well as Canadian Army and Australian Army.The lighter weight and smaller size allows the M777 to be transported by theM777 howitzerAMOS mortar system is joint design by Sweden and Finland.AMOSWhen fitted to a vehicle, bothAMOSGotland class attack submarine originates from Sweden.It is said to be the world’s quietest submarine.TheOn the water surface, the submarine is powered by two sets ofThis capability had previously only been available withGotland-class submarineThe secret to the world’s most silent submarineArcher Artillery System is also from Sweden, it’s dubbed as the world’s fastest howitzer.It uses a Swedish howitzer system that has far superior performance against for instance the M109.The system is designed for high strategic, operational and tactical mobility. The vehicle can reach road-speeds of up to 70Archer Artillery SystemHaubits FH77And this one.. Leopard 2A6. I’m sorry, almost everyone I respect has the authority says it is superior to the beloved Abrams. It’s developed in Germany.It is said that it’s tungsten penetrators have superior accuracy and velocity and superior penetration capabilities due to tungsten’s higher melting point in comparison to depleted uranium.Leopard 2Prathamesh KulkarniIt is the world's fastest anti-shipThe missile travels at speeds ofThe land-launched and ship-launched versions are already in service, with the air and submarine-launched versions currently in the testing phase.An air-launched variant of BrahMos is planned which came out in 2012. ABrahMosThere may be more but I can’t come up with any at the moment, I may update this answer if I have the time and come up with or am recommended new systems and technologies.Things like Electronic Warfare systems etc. are hard to compare, they’re being developed around the world and especially Europe has a very competent high technology cluster that offers a serious rivalry to any US based companies while struggling with but a fraction of the funding that the US ones receive.Luckily for Americans and Europeans we’re all friends and we’ll sell each other anything we can make better than the other - provided they’ll want to buy it that is. Sometimes it is chosen to buy domestic just to support the industry.There are a lot of technologies and systems used by militaries andThey might already be immersed into countless engineering sites online and imagining whole new technologies and solutions.

Supposedly, this technology was used to help cripple the Iraqi air defense system when the US invaded.This was important to Cisco because we were working in security and cryptography and the NSA was forever trying to get us to corrupt our products so they could un-encrypt foreign transmissions on the fly. One time we were required to corrupt product that had been shipped to China and it started a major debate about our fiduciary responsibility to the country or to the customer. The issue was that if you sell a security product that you know is corrupted, you are knowingly committing fraud and are liable. As the Product Manager at the time I asked the NSA if they would stand behind us (and me as I might be personally liable) in court if we were discovered. Of course the answer from the NSA was “Hell no.”We were on our own. We then entered into a long debate about how to detect Easter eggs and other corruption introduced into security products unknowingly through another vendor’s corrupted hardware. The issue was never resolved but it should be known that our security source code HAD to be provided to the NSA in order to get FIPS certification and they made certain changes to it.So to answer your question, USA military technology is advanced far beyond anyone’s knowledge to describe the extent.On the other hand, the Chinese probably know more about our technology than we do since they perpetrated the greatest security breach in history by compromising the RSA key technology used by almost everyone in the world. We only learned of it through the vigilance of Lockheed-Martin who discovered the breach accidentally. But for months the Chinese had the key to almost every computer in the world.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Has-the-application-of-secret-far-advanced-technologies-gone-too-far-already
