2,Guns will always be with us….What they shoot will change!And none of those changes will ever make the 2nd Amendment irrelevant or repeal able.It exists because the founding fathers were afraid of having a STRONG GOVERNMENT that could overpower the people who elected it.The British tried gun confiscation during the Revolutionary war.The 2nd Amendment is there to ensure that Tyranny of Government could be met by revolution if the people deemed it needed one!And THIS is why the Democrats who are in favor of VERY STRONG FEDERAL GOVERNMENT are so intent on taking our guns away so they can do what tGuns will always be with us….What they shoot will change!And none of those changes will ever make the 2nd Amendment irrelevant or repeal able.It exists because the founding fathers were afraid of having a STRONG GOVERNMENT that could overpower the people who elected it.The British tried gun confiscation during the Revolutionary war.The 2nd Amendment is there to ensure that Tyranny of Government could be met by revolution if the people deemed it needed one!And THIS is why the Democrats who are in favor of VERY STRONG FEDERAL GOVERNMENT are so intent on taking our guns away so they can do what they like without fear of causing another American Revolution!,"28,188 followers",Murphy Barrett,4.7K,12.3K,157M,2022,https://www.quora.com/In-the-USA-what-piece-of-technology-could-replace-the-reliance-on-guns-as-a-2nd-Amendment-right
3,"How about lasers? Or phasers? Or something else that’s currently the realm of science fiction?In a hypothetical future where technology has created such weapons (see: “arms”), if such weapons are the replacement for guns in the military, policing, etc, then the citizenry is guaranteed by 2A the right to “keep and bear” them.If the government has phasers, guess who else gets to?Y...",199 followers,David Randall,2.6K,26.9K,53.3M,2022,https://www.quora.com/In-the-USA-what-piece-of-technology-could-replace-the-reliance-on-guns-as-a-2nd-Amendment-right

5,"Your question involves 2 totally different things.#1 Technology has nothing to do with the 2nd Amendment. The second Amendment affirms our rights as US citizens.#2 The assumption that Technology can replace anything in the 2A is therefore immaterial. That's the same argument people make about the founding fathers didn't mean for “assault weapons” to be covered.The 2A is about inherent rights, not things.","1,187 followers",Hansel Bumgarner,1.8K,10.5K,9M,2022,https://www.quora.com/In-the-USA-what-piece-of-technology-could-replace-the-reliance-on-guns-as-a-2nd-Amendment-right

7,Any honest gun replacement would have to be as good as or better than the firearms available today across multiple dimensions.The best candidate that we see in fiction is StarTrek's phaser:,"2,762 followers",Christopher Proescher,767,13.4K,29.6M,2022,https://www.quora.com/In-the-USA-what-piece-of-technology-could-replace-the-reliance-on-guns-as-a-2nd-Amendment-right

10,"In my opinion, yes! But it will take a while, 10 years or more.I see a Data Lake is the next step after a DWH.Lets have a look at the flow of a Data Lake.Data is ingested raw and then gets curated, the result is often structured data. This is very companies such as Teradata or Oracle hook in.They claim that you can use Hadoop for data collection and preaggregation and then the structured data gets into the DWH for further processing. So they sell you their Hadoop Appliance and their DWH. Awesome!And why do not use Hadoop for structural processing? Simply performance. You can basically query daIn my opinion, yes! But it will take a while, 10 years or more.I see a Data Lake is the next step after a DWH.Lets have a look at the flow of a Data Lake.Data is ingested raw and then gets curated, the result is often structured data. This is very companies such as Teradata or Oracle hook in.They claim that you can use Hadoop for data collection and preaggregation and then the structured data gets into the DWH for further processing. So they sell you their Hadoop Appliance and their DWH. Awesome!And why do not use Hadoop for structural processing? Simply performance. You can basically query data similar like in a DWH. You can do it via SQL (HiveSQL or Spark), but no matter what you do, today you will not get the performance of a DWH for queries that have many joins.What is now the challenge for the traditional DWH vendors? In theory, they should win market share.The challenge is A DWH is mostly based on appliances, a Data Lake is a open source platform that can be rolled out on a heterogenous cluster. So many customers do not buy the Hadoop Appliances from the big DWH vendors, but create their platform based on their requirements.Looking at open source platforms, they provide modularity. You can build your cluster based on your requirements and you can focus on various topics such as in-memory processing or deep learning with GPUs.The reason why processing of structured data similar to the modern DWH is not yet possible on a data lake is simply the fact that companies such as Teradata and Oracle have built their systems for over 30 years and a lot of innovation and know how is packed with their cost based optimizators and engines.But what will happen is that gradually open source platforms will gain power and will get better and at some point they will replace the commercial DWHs.I see by the way a parallel development with other tools in the past. In the millenium years, I was working as a software engineer and we were using Rational ClearCase for version management. ClearCase was extremely powerful and I loved to work with it.Looking at the market now, almost everyone is using Git or SVN: Why? Because it is open source and it is free. It took various years until they provided similar features as ClearCase, but in the end they have the same capabilites.Disclaimer: I am a former employee of Teradata. What I wrote does not mean that companies such as Teradata will cease to exist. I rather believe that the traditional DWH vendors have to adapt their strategy and this is already happen. I cannot predict if all these big system integrators will exists in 10 years, but I am sure that if they exist that they are completely transformed companies with a complete different offering","47,054 followers",Abhinav Sharma,3.5K,865,7.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Will-the-technology-replace-the-old-musical-instruments-like-guitars-drums-etc-with-digital-instruments

12,"I always find these questions interesting, becaue I never know hat the questioner actually means by bid data.  So I'd have to say that some of the functions of data warehouses could be replaced by modern data tools, while others could be enhanced.  Was the hand drill replaced by the power drill? Not always.
