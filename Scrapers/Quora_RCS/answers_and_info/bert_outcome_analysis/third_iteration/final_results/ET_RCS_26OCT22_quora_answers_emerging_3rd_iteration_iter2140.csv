1,"Nanotechnology, but in a really cool way.You remember the microbots in Big Hero 6, right? Well, unfortunately, those microbots are impossible, but there is a similar technology that’s being developed in real life.The idea is to build tiny replicators that can create more of themselves, like a sort of super bacteria that never stops replicating. Such a technology would be“…the first replicator assembles a copy in one thousand seconds, the two replicators then build two more in the next thousand seconds, the four build another four . . in less than two days, theyNanotechnology, but in a really cool way.You remember the microbots in Big Hero 6, right?

But they would have an abundance of material on Earth, especially of carbon, which would likely be the building blocks of such an assemblers. If you were carrying a jar of them and tripped and they spilled out, and they had no limit, they would quickly devour the entire earth with no way of stopping them.But here is where things get interesting: These tiny robots would have the ability to construct molecules from atoms, giving them the ability to produce amazing materials like graphene, cubes of apple, and even brain material.With advanced nanotechnology in the form of self-replicators, the entire world would experience a revolution. Think for a second about what wouldn’t change in the face of machines that can produceProduction jobs would cease. The price of every item ever created would be lowered massively. Supercomputers and experiments regarding brain material would become almost commonplace. Terraforming other planets would take years if not months. And all of this is actuallyThere is a lot of power contained within those tiny machines.","9,704 followers",Tim Mensch,626,3K,18.8M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Who-wants-to-participate-in-the-upcoming-history-experience-of-technology-computing
2,"I think this question is much too large for a Quora sized answer (in part because of a combination of a lack of curiosity in the field generally, and a general lack of emphasis on history in schooling).Just to pick four here in no special order — and from about the same period (~ 1962) — how about:1.I think this question is much too large for a Quora sized answer (in part because of a combination of a lack of curiosity in the field generally, and a general lack of emphasis on history in schooling).Just to pick four here in no special order — and from about the same period (~ 1962) — how about:1.Anyone in computing should have read and understood everything that McCarthy did and wrote (this doesn’t mean he was right about everything, butcf.

4,"Ever since mobile telecommunications standards were first laid down in the 1980s (the First Generation or 1G), there has been a continuous effort to increase the data rates available to the end users. Once certain levels of data rates are achieved by the industry, they set even higher targets, driven of course by the ever increasing demand by the users.1G, 2G, 3G and 4G basically refer to these standards that were successively laid and met by the telecommunication sector (both the industry and the academia). The current thrust is towards reaching the 5th Generation of mobile communications.

The current thrust is towards reaching the 5th Generation of mobile communications. Behind each of these generations, there have been one or more breakthrough technologies that helped achieve the quantum inter-generation leaps in the data rates. I will elaborate upon those below:First Generation (1G):Second Generation (2G):2.5G:Third Generation (3G):This time the target was to be able to provide sufficient data rate for both voice and mobile internet ~ 384 kbps3.5G:This is what most of urban India currently uses. HSDPA/HSUPA (High Speed Downlink/Uplink Packet Access) are the standards used and they offer data rates of 5-30 Mbps.Fourth Generation (4G):In essence, Mobile Broadband. They now want to offer you broadband-like data rates on mobile devices ~ 100-200 Mbps.5GThere. You now have a birds-eye view of the different generations of mobile communication.Edit 1: Added the part about circuit switching and packet switching.
