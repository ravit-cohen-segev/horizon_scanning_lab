In a matter of weeks pressure vessels the two and three miles in diameter will be formed and filled with air at sea level pressure, with 21% oxygen and 78% nitrogen and water vapor.This atmosphere will be buoyant enough to float above the clouds of Venus between 50 km and 55 km altitude. This atmosphere will be drawn from the thin wisps of gas surrounding Mars. Mars will have a large centrifuge, 4x larger than Monaco, to produce 1 Earth gravity for inhabitants. 250,000 cities, each capable of housing over 100,000 people will exist on each plant, and cover only 2.8% of the Martian surface and less than 1% of Venus’ surface.The order of battle will be Mars first. That’s entirely due to the fact that Mars’ escape velocity is 5.03 km/sec while Venus’ escape velocity is 10.36 km/sec.So, the way it will work is this;The first Mars flight will occur in the 2024–2026 time frame. The first Venus flight 2030 time frame. Population on Earth drop below 500 million by 2050 - while population on Venus and Mars will rise to over 4.5 billion on each planet.What will happen next is the development of Deimos and Phobos in developing large space colonies called Bishop Rings.

Not very much!In order to measure larger quantities, I use scientific notation. As an example,Various amounts of energy in Joules and what you could do with it.From this we can conclude that the Death Star is a BAMF.I'm happy to go into details in the comments regarding these calculations. I'll also explore a few different scenarios.MarsEnergy required to heat Mars from current average temperature of -60C to a more comfortable 15C (like Earth):Conclusion: Asteroids/comets are tricky propositions, rather energetically painful, and messy. A big enough impact to melt all the permafrost and as a result reconstitute the atmosphere would likely make Mars a terrible place to live. Lots of dust. Dust cools the atmosphere and buries rovers. That said, it's possible that big hits in the past have temporarily warmed the planet for a few million years, and xenobiologists find that exciting.Clearly, some subtlety is called for.Mars' surface temperature is stable, which means all this energy falling on the surface is matched by radiation back out into space. In order to increase the surface temperature, one needs to reduce the amount of back radiation. Greenhouse effect! Greenhouse gasses are not my area of expertise, but I'll make some educated guesses anyway.Water vapour and COThis is electrical energy, which is easier to come by than rocket fuel. Nuclear power would be the way to go, but even solar power could take a decent bite out of this. Especially if solar-electrolysis becomes industrialised.Another approach not entirely without merit would be to increase the solar flux by using GIANT mirrors.Another proposed idea is to dig a few dozen enormous holes in the crust to let heat out to the surface.Conclusion:VenusVenus is a MUCH harder bet than Mars. While Mars could be terraformed in only a few thousand years, no gently-gently approach could ever work on Venus.First, alternatives to terraforming. It would be possible to live on Venus in the high atmosphere, in giant floating cities. Using a standard space-station atmospheric mix at about half an earth atmosphere, a pressurized geodesic sphere would float naturally somewhere above the bulk of the clouds of sulfuric acid. Atmospheric motions would likely lead to some rotation about the polar areas, where inhabitants would experience a near-perpetual sunset. Floating cities could be mechanically rotated to provide a day-night cycle for on-board agriculture. The Venusian atmosphere is rich in carbon, oxygen, sulfur, and has trace quantities of water. These could be mined for building materials, while rarer elements could be mined from the surface with long scoops or imported from other places with space-plane shuttles.But Venus is nearly as big as Earth, with similar gravity and heaps of sun. Floating cities are all very well, but we need to house billions of humans, not millions. What's the next step?First, the atmosphere has got to go. 200 atmospheres of crushing pressure, heat, and sulfuric acid rain.Energy required for giant mirror to reflect all light from the surface:After a hundred years or so, the atmosphere freezes out onto the surface (briefly going through an interesting super-critical phase). While you wait, you can use it to absorb the impact of a few icy comets and moons, in order to give Venus some badly needed water.We need a way to spin Venus faster. The obvious approach is to crash asteroids into the surface to make it turn faster. Cost of this isIn fact, the mass of the atmosphere, now frozen out hundreds of meters thick all over the planet, is about the same as the mass of the entire asteroid belt, and it's already on Venus. All you have to do is chuck it off the surface fast enough and in the right direction, and you can spin the planet in any direction you like. In order to spin the planet up to a 24 hour day AND get rid of the frozen atmosphere, it needs to leave the surface at aboutAfter this is done, the energy budget can be pilfered to sculpt a few ocean basins and continents, synthesize a desired atmosphere, open the sunshade a little, and start growing plants.Conclusion:Postscript:Slate article comments:Magnetic fields!",826 followers,George Dowson,754,527,3.7M,2013,https://www.quora.com/Which-one-would-be-easier-to-terraform-Venus-or-Mars

Like H-bombs, A-bombs and fission reactors, fusion reactors release the energy difference between one configuration of particles and the other. It looks a bit like matter is being converted into energy, but it’s actually energy before and after, with the difference in energy being detectable as a difference in mass.The problem is that the reaction, the stuff doing the reacting, is about as hot as the middle of the Sun. That means you can’t contain it, i.e. hold it together and keep it from leaking out, by enclosing it in steel or ceramics or anything - it would melt its way through anything, and the reactor would quickly be a pile of slag.The Sun holds itself together with gravity. It’s so dang huge that the gas just bunches together and stays that way. Needless to say, we can’t build a reactor the size of the Sun to work that way.Instead, though it’s awkward and difficult, we can contain the explosion with lasers and powerful magnetic fields. Carefully tuned, the combination works a bit like the invisible force fields you sometimes see (or actually don’t see) in Sci-Fi movies.Problem solved! Sorta. Those magnetic fields and lasers cost enormous amounts of energy to set up and maintain. So until recently, most of the energy generated by fusion reactors went into keeping them from blowing up. Nuclear engineering is slowly getting better at setting up that field, and we’re around the point where there’s more energy -barely- being produced than what’s used to hold the reactor together.This sounds wasteful - if (say) 99% of the reactor’s energy output is used up just holding it together, it’s just 1% efficient, right? Well actually, it’s not quite that bad. Hydrogen is incredibly abundant, you can get it from water and you only need a tiny amount. Even the special isotopes of hydrogen needed for a reactor are relatively cheap to obtain. The big draw of fusion reactors is that their fuel is very cheap and we’ll never be in danger of running out of it.","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Will-fusion-reactors-replace-nuclear-in-the-near-future

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",0 followers,John Holmes,826,1.2K,784.1K,2021,https://www.quora.com/They-say-that-fusion-reactors-can-make-more-energy-than-it-uses-But-I-thought-it-was-impossible-in-physics-to-get-more-energy-out-of-less-energy-How-is-it-possible
17,"The environmental and safety characteristics of fusion power production offer the prospect of significant advantages over virtually all present major sources of energy.The basic fuels for fusion — deuterium and the lithium that is used to generate the tritium fuel—are plentifully available, and the fusion process would make no contributions to greenhouse gases or ocean acidification.The fusion fuel in the fusion chamber of an operating fusiion reactor at any given time is only a few grams.

Any abnormal behavior in the high-temperature plasma will inevitably cause rapid cooling of the plasma and quick termination of fusion process. Due to low fusion fuel inventory and requirement for stable confinement, there is no possibility of an uncontrolled large-scale fusion energy release. Moreover, the reaction products themselves are not radioactive (in contrast to fission).The above graph is a compoarison of fission and fusion in terms of radioactivity remaining in years following reactor shutdown (note log scale on Y axis that compresses visually the differences between fission and fusion in terms of production of radioactive waste and their endurance in the environment).The fusion neutrons induce radioactivity in the surrounding structure and tritium is a radioactive isotope. The amount and hazard of the resulting radioactivity strongly depends on the choice of material surrounding the fusion chamber. Proper choice of materials can result in minimization of activation products and tritium inventories[1].The radiological inventory in a fusion power plant can be much lower than that in an equivalent power fission reactor, and the time-integrated biological hazard potential can be lower byThe use of low-activation materials will also allow fusion components to be recycled or disposed of as low-level waste and not be a burden to future generations. The comparison of the decay of the radioactive inventory in a reference fission reactor and reference fusion power plants using low-activation wall materials is shown in the graph above. The graph shows the potential advantage of fusion power. After a period of 100 years, the radioactivity remaining from a fusion system can be millions of times less than that from fission. In the simplest terms, this translates into no need for the storage of waste over the geological time periods contemplated for repositories such as Yucca Mountain. In fact, the dose rates are small enough that some components can be directly recycled.Futher improvements that result in still yet cleaner forms of nuclear fusion can be expected to result from future innovations like -Falling Wall Molten Salt fusion chambers[2]Advanced fusion fuel cycles including He3-He3 anutronic fusion.He3 + He3 -> He4 + 2protons + 12.9 MeVHe3-He3 fusion uses totally non-radioactive fuel and produces totally non-radioative Helium as nuclear waste (and no neutrons - only easily shieldable protons that can be collected and directly produce electricity at very high efficiency exceeding the Carnot efficiency of any current thermal power plant)The combined requirements of He3-He3 ICF fusion is believed to be only about 40X the combined temperature, plasma pressure, and confinement time requirements of DT fusion. This not an impossibly high requirement and will be reached in future ICF fusion power plants.[1]",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

18,"It would be much cleaner than fossil fuels and traditional nuclear fission, if we could just make it work. So far we haven’t been able to, because of the complexity of containing the extremely high temperatures that fusion reactors need. Hotter than the sun, in some cases.Hopefully we’ll get there, but the joke in the field is that fusion always seems to be about 30 years away.","220,646 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,783.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-one-would-be-easier-to-terraform-Venus-or-Mars
19,"Extremely clean.  The by-products are benign things like helium, or tritium (which fairly rapidly decays to hydrogen/water) and in any case very small in quantity.  If nuclear fusion is ever realized, the dirtiest part will be the irradiated parts of the reactor itself.  For instance, the containment vessel will be highly irradiated - but thats quiet a small volume and should only be disposed on the order of once every few decades.",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,202.4M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Will-fusion-reactors-replace-nuclear-in-the-near-future
20,"Not nearly as clean as many suggest. At the very least, the irradiation of the PFM alone will produce many times more high-level waste than a fission reactor would in producing the same amount of heat. Or at least, that’s the experience of all tokamaks to date. After their D+T experiments, JET needed to install remote handling facilities as the reactor vessel was made dangerously radioactive. ITER will have these facilities from day one.The ITER website gets around this by stating that it won’t produce “long-lived” waste, which is true. It’s still high-level waste, and still needs to be dealtNot nearly as clean as many suggest.

It’s still high-level waste, and still needs to be dealt with.But then there’s the source of Tritium. Currently, the only source is nuclear fission reactors. The ITER website gets around this by saying the Tritium will come from “inventory”. That inventory all came from fission reactors.One of the contributions of ITER is that, for the first time, we’ll have a high flux source of the high energy neutrons that D+T fusion produces. There will be experimental modules that use these neutrons to breed Tritium, to develop the breeder blanket technology to be used in future reactors such as DEMO and PROTO. These modules will need to use “neutron multipliers” to breed more than one atom of Tritium per neutron, as one atom of Tritium is consumed in producing each neutron and the goal in future reactors is to replace the Tritium as fast as it is consumed, and there will be some neutron losses (in irradiating the PFM for example). This neutron multiplier will produce still more nuclear waste.So there will be lots of nuclear waste, and as a result the earth will become a slightly more radioactive place.And unlike the extra radioactivity produced by fission reactors, this increase will never disappear completely.","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Will-fusion-reactors-replace-nuclear-in-the-near-future
