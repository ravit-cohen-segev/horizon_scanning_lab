0,"The next steps will be SpaceX testing Starship (alone) and then on Super Heavy. - This will demonstrate a lot of new technology (tough heat shield, large diameter stainless steel tanks, a novel skydiver-style descent using large movable fins) to allow full reuse and cheap operation.After that SpaceX will perfect in-orbit transfer of large quantities of LOX and liquid methane, which will allow lunar landing missions and missions to Mars.SpaceX might test spinning a tethered pair of Starships to simulate gravity - useful for long missions eg to Mars.We also need NASA to test their nuclear powerThe next steps will be SpaceX testing Starship (alone) and then on Super Heavy. - This will demonstrate a lot of new technology (tough heat shield, large diameter stainless steel tanks, a novel skydiver-style descent using large movable fins) to allow full reuse and cheap operation.After that SpaceX will perfect in-orbit transfer of large quantities of LOX and liquid methane, which will allow lunar landing missions and missions to Mars.SpaceX might test spinning a tethered pair of Starships to simulate gravity - useful for long missions eg to Mars.We also need NASA to test their nuclear power plants (starting with Kilopower) in space. They can power ion engines (eg VASIMR) and lunar bases and Mars bases and may be needed for local propellant generation and other In-Situ Resource Utilisation (ISRU).One day NASA might test NERVA in space, which would help with faster transit times to asteroids and other planets, and give us a means to redirect asteroids that might hit Earth.",4 followers,Dan Bradbury,4.2K,21.7K,235.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-will-be-the-next-big-technology-change-in-space-travel
1,"Cost reduction.In a few decades we might not only have Blue Origin, but also Red Destination to compete with each other, lowering the prices even more.enabling:Much more satellites. Smaller countries and companies will be able to afford one.Space construction.Also the coming few decades structures will be build that totally dwarf the ISS. Using advancements in robotics and materials, things can be folded and inflated to much larger volumes.enabling:TourismLarger telescopesPossibly a laser array.With a sufficiently large amount of lasers we could launch lightsail probes to another star.

A student involved making those can expect an answer before he retires- while its better than nothing, the prospect of such a long wait might be not enticing enough.Further than that is very hard to predict. Technologically we would have laid the foundation, to have a sustained Moon base or launch a mission to Mars by then. Feasibility would depend more on how well humans can hold up far from Earth. This will be tested, while NASA is going to the Moon again.If physical and psychological problems can be solved easy, things will go very very fast after that. I do not expect that however. Astronauts spending long time on the ISS didn’t feel well. It might be very hard to solve those problems.Using robotics only might be the more rational approach. I think it would be much less interesting to a lot of people and will receive a much lower budget, slowing things down a lot. So let's hope they find a way to keep astronauts safe and healthy over longer times in space.","358,862 followers",Sean Kernan,3.1K,5.6K,726.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-will-be-the-next-big-technology-change-in-space-travel
2,The first answers are pretty much correct. AMy bestIt could be something else that does the same thing.Traveling to Mars in two months will make Mars accessible without serious side-effects due to zero-The first answers are pretty much correct. AMy bestIt could be something else that does the same thing.Traveling to Mars in two months will make Mars accessible without serious side-effects due to zero-g and cosmic rays. This should be the goal for space travel now. We can hope for faster if and when we perfect fusion power.,0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-will-be-the-next-big-technology-change-in-space-travel
3,"Faster rocketsOur rockets today are fast,but now fast enough. We need to create propulsion system that is faster than our chemical systems right now. If our rockets were faster than space travel and colonization would be easier,but they would probably cost more.","135,508 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-will-be-the-next-big-technology-change-in-space-travel

5,"Because batteries about “atoms” and not “bits”.All the rapid advance you’re seeing in other fields, even materials science and biology, is largely driven by information technology. We’ve been able to make very small and very fast computers which can be put anywhere, and which can crunch huge amounts of data.Biotech is all about modelling and pattern matching DNA and protein folding and other chemical reactions etc. Medical imaging is about crunching noisy signals and extracting useful information from them. AI is about crunching data.But however much computing power you throw at battery designBecause batteries about “atoms” and not “bits”.All the rapid advance you’re seeing in other fields, even materials science and biology, is largely driven by information technology.
