Augustine of Hippo’s development of the doctrine of original sin, on the basis of the creation myths in Genesis, has been pretty damaging to Western Christianity. On the other hand, that old story conveys something that at times feels like the greatest truth of all about human life: it all went wrong from the start. And all attempts at building Utopias, like Calvin’s Geneva or the Soviet Union or Mao’s China, have ended up in horrors.Please don’t think about Utopia—one meaning of the word is “No place,” and it never was and never will be.

1,"If automation expands out beyond the menial/physical roles into various sort of administrative and professional domains, then it could be the majority of the population finding themselves with nothing to do.This is different from the original forms of automation, where dull-backbreaking human work was replaced by machinery.

This was generally a positive thing, and allowed people to focus on more meaningful work.But a second tier of automation, with deep learning and increasingly capable AI would change that. All manner of jobs would be subject to replacement by automation.In principle this could be a boon. A worker could be replaced by a machine, and then she’d live off those proceeds and be able to fill her time with creative pursuits and study. If the mechanical slave was ten times more productive than she was, then there’d be enough wealth to make us all prosperous.That could create a utopian, Star-Trek like world, where scarcity has ended, and everyone can be rich.I am not sure that’s not going to happen. The owners of corporations will replace their expensive staff with cheap mechanical (slave) labour. The owners will be the ones who will see the benefits.The displaced workers will go on the dole. And any income they receive will have to come from a state which relies on corporate taxes. A “basic” income level which would be paid to maintain social order.There is a period of significant change coming. And I am not sure that any of our politicians and institutions are preparing for it in a convincing way.",178 followers,Andras Ivan,1.5K,1.1K,1.4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Can-advanced-technology-create-an-utopia-How

3,"It's currently unclear.We don't know what would happen if we replaced all manual jobs with Artificial Intelligence. Such a thing would have such a tremendous impact, we don't know the full consequences yet. Many people are completely open-minded about the future situation. Others are hesitant to introduce such a technology to the world, as it will alter our societal system that has been in place for thousands of years.When we speak of the future, we seem to be naive and optimistic. Just about everything I research on the subject is only talking about the upsides of such innovation.

Just about everything I research on the subject is only talking about the upsides of such innovation. Everything has a price, and is this a deal we're willing to make?Of late, I've been researching all I can about future technology, and I'm completely unsatisfied with the notion that technology will solve our problems. It won't solve our problems—it's steadily making them worse. What was the cost of the current modern world? Nuclear war, global warming, and a perversion of our culture.The debt will only increase, and as we continue to reap the benefits from technology and congratulating ourselves on our ingenuity, we will become hopelessly addicted and enslaved to its magnetic screen. I'm not discounting that it's already happening, and we are in the beginning stages of it. The consequences will only become more severe, and we may have to abandon the Earth because even Mars looks more promising than a war-torn planet.Right now, it's easy to see an idyllic future, as humans are optimistic by nature. Our capitalistic system makes it seem that 'new' equals 'better' when this isn't necessarily the case. Products made in earlier generations lasted longer for one. My cheaply made desk collapsed within two years of purchasing, while my current desk was manufactured in the 19th century, and it serves me well. Are things that are made with machines necessarily better?The increase in interest toward STEM showcases this point. In humanities, we're hopelessly out of ideas, and we've all but given up on the cultural aspect of society, opting instead for a universal, bland culture. Politics is almost sickening, and we've already tried every political system possible—what's the point? You know we're a sick society when a Montana leader body-slams a reporter and he managed to win. STEM is practical, while the humanities are so controversial, if you say anything remotely original, you're a bigot, and get the hell off of my screen. Something like math is the most uncontroversial way you can be smart, because with math, there is either a right or wrong. Humanities? Open to interpretation and unique to its population.With STEM, I've noticed a stigma with ideas that don't align with the perfect future agenda. Whenever people warn about something that isn't mainstream, people ignore their warnings and continue to innovate as if nothing bad will become of it.Eventually, this illusion will fade when we're confronted with the issue. AI has been nicknamed the last invention, which may become all too true. People neglect that pesky detail, and they only focus on the positives, making it seem like we'll invent our way to a utopia.Technology has disastrous consequences, and we're running into a brick wall with our eyes shut. When we crash is the question, and how much will we be hurt? Will we be merely dazed or will it stupefy us? If we are successfully knocked unconscious, AI could either nurse us back to health, or do unspeakable things while we’re vulnerable? With the previous blunders by the human race, at least we knew that another person would either help or hurt us, not something as foreign, emotionless, and super intelligent as a computer. For the first time in eons, another thing could replace us on the food chain. We would no longer be the most intelligent beings on The Earth.So no, we're a few Jenga blocks away from tumbling our society. What happens when we reach a singularity is as mysterious as what caused The Big Bang. We can only speculate until that day arrives, sooner than most people can fathom.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Can-advanced-technology-create-an-utopia-How

7,"I have hired many engineers over the past 20 years and the two things that I tell a fresh graduate is that the greatest skill you have to offer me is your ability to read and comprehend technical topics very quickly. For many years I have questioned why we need to divide engineering education into different groups - civil, mechanical, electrical, mining, petroleum etc… In my province (BC) we are legally allowed to practice engineering in areas we have proven competence. Being a mechanical engineer does not mean that I am competent in HVAC design or aircraft design. It also does not mean that II have hired many engineers over the past 20 years and the two things that I tell a fresh graduate is that the greatest skill you have to offer me is your ability to read and comprehend technical topics very quickly. For many years I have questioned why we need to divide engineering education into different groups - civil, mechanical, electrical, mining, petroleum etc… In my province (BC) we are legally allowed to practice engineering in areas we have proven competence. Being a mechanical engineer does not mean that I am competent in HVAC design or aircraft design. It also does not mean that I am incompetent in Electrical systems design. Once you have an engineering degree, all you have proven is that you can learn technical subjects quickly. The real learning starts on your first day of work. Some of our best process (chemical) engineers are mechanical engineers because they have an excellent grasp of thermodynamics, fluids, heat transfer etc… Similarly, I have seen some very good structural engineers (typically civil) that had mechanical engineering degrees. Mechanical engineers make great controls engineers as they understand the mechanical and process aspects of the system and we also learn most aspects of electrical circuits. Many of our best “programmers” are mechanical engineers where you would have expected a computer or electrical engineer. I used to design building systems and was forced to learn about building codes, mechanical systems and electrical systems. I was equally comfortable specifying beams as I was specifying high voltage feeders or plumbing waste stacks.  Having hired many different engineers over my career, I have learned that mechanical engineers are generally the most well rounded and can do just about anything with suitable training and mentorship. I personally think that we should only have one engineering degree and that it should be based on mechanical engineering. Once you graduate and follow a certain path, then you can take more specialized course for a particular field. I have also hired many technologists who generally get more specialized training in one field; however, I find their ability to expand beyond their base is limited. Sure they know the new lingo and hit the ground running but they stall pretty quick once the technology or conditions change. Young engineers are generally more broad but can quickly grasp the lingo and concepts.Another very important aspect is that engineering is a self-regulated profession. As a profession, we are held to very high standards. After university, we only get two grades. The bridge either stands up or it falls down. The plane either flies or it crashes. If we screw up, people can die. We are not allowed to make mistakes. How is it possible that anyone can get 100% every time. It is very simple, we use proven codes, standards and methods. We use checkers and stringent approval processes. We are registered with the government and take an oath to protect the public and put them above all else. When we stamp a drawing, we are saying that people can bet their lives on our work. We are expected to know and follow the applicable codes and if we deviate from them, we better be able to defend it in court. When you read a code - for example NFPA 85 code for boilers, - it makes reference to every discipline of engineering from civil to mechanical to electrical and controls. We are expected to fully comprehend and translate the requirements into specifications that can be relied upon for the construction of a system that is safe, reliable and cost effective. So in essence, engineers are also technical lawyers. Our job is to understand technical requirements embodied in codes and standards and protect the public. We are held to very high ethical standards. This often brings conflict and forces us to ponder philosophy. Is it ethical for an engineer to develop weapons that could be used to kill children. Is it ethical for an engineer to design machines that contribute to global warming. We are faced with these questions every day.In many ways mechanical engineers are the engine of society. We create and build the systems that everyone relies upon. If someone asks where power comes from and their initial thoughts are the electrical outlet, then we smile and think about all the massive infrastructure that was created by engineers to support power getting to the outlet.Being a mechanical engineer can be very fulfilling. Indirectly you touch many lives and solve problems that benefit society. I am not suggesting mechanical engineering is altruistic but there is definitely an element of philosophy embodied in our profession.I started university at 16 with extreme naivety and just took mechanical engineering because I liked cars. I now look back on my life and career and feel extremely fortunate and truly believe I could not have picked a better profession.So the short answer to what is mechanical engineering is that it can be whatever you want. You are given a toolbox of knowledge that lets you do anything or go anywhere that your heart desires. How you use the tools is up to you.",UNKNOWN,Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Can-advanced-technology-create-an-utopia-How
