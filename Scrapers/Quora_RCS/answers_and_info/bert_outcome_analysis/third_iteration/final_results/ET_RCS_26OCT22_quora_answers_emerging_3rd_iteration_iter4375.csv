Guess what? All four of my TVs run Linux! I literally had no idea.So then I started to look at other instruction books. Turns out my dishwasher and my wife’s car both run Linux…probably other things that I didn’t keep the instructions for - and things made by companies who don’t bother to tell you to, too.Because small/cheap computers cost less than the price of a MacOS or Windows software license, almost all of IoT (Internet of Things) devices that need an OS at all, will be running Linux…because it’s free and it works very well indeed. I know someone whose front door bell runs Linux.The Linux kernel contains 20 million lines of code. About 10,000 people have contributed code to it (I’m proud to be one of them) - and it’s FREE.This is an astounding piece of technology - yet even the people who wrote it are often completely unaware that it’s slipped quietly into some other odd corner of their lives - quietly making things better - rarely taking credit.",3 followers,Steve Baker,23.6K,27.4K,163.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-mind-blowing-technologies-that-exist-that-most-people-dont-know-about

Once they sense a nearing neighbor, the growing process halts, ensuring that light can penetrate the canopy and photosynthesis continue.Another possible explanation is that this is a defense mechanism against leaf-eating insects. The gaps mean bugs wouldn't be able to reach other trees, impeding their spread.The next time you're out walking through the forest, take a moment to look above you and you might be pleasantly surprised by what you find.Edit 1: Thanks Robert Taylor for the correction.Edit 2: Thank you all for your love, affection, and kind comments.",89 followers,Anish Ambavat,3.7K,61,216K,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-mind-blowing-technologies-that-exist-that-most-people-dont-know-about

You can even lock the doors or arm the security system from a far distance. Reemo can also help seniors to go through the frustration of solving everyday technical problems. Since Reemo uses gestures that are intuitive and natural, it is very simple to use and you will have no trouble with remembering the commands.The Active Denial System:This directed-energy weapon is designed for area denial, crowd control and perimeter security. The Active Denial system was developed by the U.S. military and is not a lethal weapon. Since it’s only function is to heat the surface of targets, such as the human skin, it is often called a heat ray. In 2010, the weapon was deployed in Afganistan as the U.S. army wanted to test it, but it was soon withdrawn without seeing any combat. Currently, the ADS is only a weapon mounted to the vehicle, but both the police and the U.S. Marines are working on portable versions.Nuclear batteries:Imagine a battery that won't run out of charge. Nuclear batteries can produce a large amount of energy and can work ""at least"" for 20 years. The batteries contains heavy metals that could give out radiation.Nuclear batteries use the incredible amount of energy released naturally by tiny bits of radio active material without any fission or fusion taking place inside the battery.These devices use thin radioactive films that pack in energy at densities thousands of times greater than those of lithium-ion batteries. Because of the high energy density, nuclear batteries are extremely small in size. They can be used as energy source for our mobile devices, tablets, Laptops, UPS, Cars, VehicleThe algorithm that can detect whether a person is gay or straight:Technology today is accelerating so fast it's hard to comprehend. In the latest step towards a future that's looking more AI controlled every second, a study at Stanford University found that a computer algorithm could correctly guess whether a person is straight or gay highly accurately.This machine intelligence can tell whether a man is straight or gay correctly 81% of the time, and 74% of the time for women. It can't work as a perfect determinant of sexual orientation as a whole, but it has made it more apparent, in case it wasn't already, that a person's sexual orientation is not a choice but something you're born with. It also worked a lot more accurately than with human judges, who only achieved 61% for men and 54% for women.strange :-Virtual Animals with Digital Minds:Whole brain emulations of human minds are quite a ways off, and likely won't appear until the second half of the 21st Century. But in the stage leading up to this we'll be able to emulate the brains of much simpler organisms. Already today there's the OpenWorm project, an effort to digitize the brain of a nematode worm.Within the next two decades, we will most certainly be able to simulate the brains of other organisms, like ants and bees. And who knows, by this point we might even be able to start simulate the brains of simple mammals, like mice.But by virtue of doing so, we will have created virtual animals who essentially ""live"" inside a computer. And someday, perhaps even by the 2030s, these digital brains will be uploaded to robotic avatars.Darkest material till known:It’s calledThe piece of aluminum foil shown here is creased, wrinkled, in a random fashion before being coated with Vantablack on one side.

While the position was for a casual restaurant job, the jeans were not trendy ripped in just a few small places, but rather tattered. The animal hair floating off the sweater and reflecting the light during the interview was gross to look at, and this was for a position in a food service establishment, and a semi-fancy one at that. While this isn’t necessarily a ridiculous fashion statement, it sure showed that the candidate wasn’t taking the opportunity seriously and didn’t seem to understand the atmosphere and culture of the business at all.Sure, I get it, people love their pets and it can be hard to avoid, but if you own a dog or a cat that sheds on your clothes, invest in a lint-roller before your job interview. It should be a no-brainer, but this woman seemed to think it wasn’t necessary. The sweater would have been okay for this interview if it would have been clean and hair-free. Many people forget that it’s crucial to be clean and presentable - comb your hair, make sure there aren’t any stains on your clothes, iron out the wrinkles and double check that there isn’t any dirt under your fingernails before you go into an interview.In my scenario, it wasn’t just the candidate’s outfit that was the biggest problem.

Our office’s internal conference room was undergoing some renovations and so we had to interview in my colleague’s office. We put two chairs for ourselves in front of her desk, and then one chair for the candidates about five feet away from us. There was no table in between us to hide the interviewees’ lower bodies.Our first candidate, who will I will refer to as Tina, had mentioned on her résumé that she played on her university’s intramural women’s rugby team. When Tina arrived we saw that she had made that mistake that we see a lot of college students and recent grads make - they fail to make the distinction between “good-looking clothes” versus “clothes that make me look good”.This 20-year-old woman showed up wearing a skin-tight dark purple one-piece outfit. It was sleeveless, and had a very deep plunging neckline that revealed more than a share of her cleavage. This outfit was also so short that it barely covered up the bottom of her ass.As Tina took her seat I pretended I was just going to turn the ringer off on my phone, but instead opened it and quickly texted to my interview partner, “Dear God, I hope she doesn’t uncross her legs”. Well, I’m answering this question, so yeah, she did uncross her legs. It wasn’t quite a “Basic Instinct” moment though, as she was wearing underwear, but it was a little much for an interview to do some basic database work. I’m not sure how we didn’t laugh out loud.Taking things a bit lower (literally, not figuratively) I guess her intramural rugby team took it seriously as we soon noticed that her legs were covered in bruises that were all over her thighs, kneecaps and shins. It was distracting, until I noticed her shoes were basically a pair of red ballet slippers and that became my next distraction. I suppose that despite her very visible cleavage, I wasn’t staring at her breasts. The whole thing was very odd and you wonder what type of person would dress this way for an interview, but we focused and continued.I have to say that Tina was a pretty good interview and candidate. We actually ranked her second. Our top choice then turned down our offer as she received another offer in a field that was more relevant to her career goals. As such, we actually made an offer to the scantily clad and bruised up rugby player, and she accepted.After Tina’s interview we reached out to her university’s career services office and told the person who had sent us her résumé to please talk to her about what is proper professional attire. When her first day arrived she didn’t wear an outfit you’d go clubbing in, which was good. However, she went in the opposite direction and showed up in old blue jeans, a T-shirt and sneakers. She was a jock, after all. At that point we didn’t bother to say anything to her, and so it became her daily work attire. Ultimately she turned out to be a good worker and we liked having her around. Needless to say, she was not majoring in fashion.","129,191 followers",Jessica Su,9.6K,1.5K,49.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-mind-blowing-technologies-that-exist-that-most-people-dont-know-about

So based on those observations, this guy probably wasn’t poor, which made his choices for the rest of his outfit to confuse everyone present the day he came in for an interview. He wore a nasty stained white tank top that also had holes in it, the type that is commonly called a wife beater ( i hate that name btw), and a pair of jeans that the photo i have included do not do justice in terms of how holey they were.You saw more skin, front and back, than you saw denim. To make matters worse, he had a huge rip on his back side that ran down one of his pockets, and he was not wearing any boxers or underwear……Needless to say, this fine upstanding young man did not get hired to be our new day shift manager, and i can understand why totally.The second person to come in totally not dressed appropriately was a girl in her early twenties who was applying for a bartending position. If you look at the photo i included, that is basically what she wore in, with a bra and thong on underneath.At first, everyone was shocked, and of course we were discussing her outfit while she was in her interview. Most of us assumed, and wrongly so, that perhaps she was a dancer at one of the clubs in town and either came in right after a day shift, or while on her break. One of our cooks though knew the girl and let us know she wasn’t a dancer, nor did she work in an adult club. He claimed she was fairly conservative from what he knew of her and was clueless as to why she would dress like that when coming to a job interview here.She was not hired as well. Our manager said that she conducted the interview like any other, and asked if she had any questions about the place. The girl asked what the policy was concerning sleeping with or dating coworkers or customers.So that is my story of two people who came to job interviews at my place of work, dressed entirely inappropriately. Hope you enjoyed the read!","8,044 followers",Sourojeet Chakraborty,19.1K,199,7.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-mind-blowing-technologies-that-exist-that-most-people-dont-know-about

It was at a time period, when located in the Silicon Valley in California, you would have to be interviewed by 423 employees to discern if you qualified for a job.

What was more comical is you would be interviewed by people that in NO way were connected with the department you were attempting to gain employment in. Imagine you are interviewing for a computer game company as an artist and you are interviewed by the warehouse shipping lead? No logic whatsoever.I was attempting to get a job as a network administrator for a very large and well-known entity. I had passed four interviews and was lucky enough to move on to the next.My next interviewer happens to be a woman that I am informed works as an admin and I have no idea why she is interviewing me.She sits down and introduces herself and appears pleasant. The first question she asks is “If the #2 pencil is the most popular, why’s it still #2?”. I am taken aback. I reply “Because a number one pencil writes darker than a number two?” She just looks at me.She asks, “Why does it REALLY hurt to hit your funny bone?” I answered, “Because there is no bone covering or protecting the nerves at that location, so you are really making direct contact with nerves.” I am thinking, what is this?She then asks, “Why is the third hand on the watch called the second hand?”. I answered, “The hands could have been named anything they wanted.” I said, “If the third hand measures seconds, why can it not be the third on the watch if it was designed to do so?”At this point I had had enough. I asked her what is with all the ridiculous questions that have absolutely nothing to do with what I am interviewing for?The door opens at that moment and another woman comes in and asks the person interviewing me to leave. The person who had been asking me questions says to the other, “I like him, he is pretty sharp!” and she leaves the room.I am now informed by the person who is sitting down that she is the interviewer I was supposed to have been speaking to. I asked whom the person was who was just asking me a series of strange questions. She said, “That was my secretary, Betty. I told her to come in here and see if you needed anything such as water since I was going to be a few minutes late.”",198 followers,Tanmay Sinha,21.9K,54,910.6K,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-mind-blowing-technologies-that-exist-that-most-people-dont-know-about

I'm single and I have to pay for rent, bills, food, and gas to get back and forth to work so I'm on a budget. Good quality clothes and shoes are expensive and I take issue with spending my hard earned money on clothes that I will only wear to work and sit behind a desk all day (I'd never wear business casual clothing outside of work because I find them to be restricting, uncomfortable, and boring). Plus, my job doesn't reimburse me for the cost of purchasing work clothes and that makes me feel like I’m going to work to make money just to spend on something for work and that's not ok with me. So I created my own work “uniform” consisting of black pants and a blouse (I'll explain where the idea came from later). I purchased 3 pair of the exact same black slacks, 2 white tops (1 long sleeve and 1 short sleeve), and 1 color top. Here is an example of how I wear my uniform during a work week:Mon: Black Pant #1, Long Sleeve White TopTues: Black Pant #2, Short Sleeve White TopWed: Black Pant #3, Color TopThur: What I wore on TuesdayFri: What I wore on WednesdaySince I work behind a desk and literally sit in a chair for at least 7 hours out of a 8 hour work day my clothes are not getting dirty or smelly. After work I immediately change out of my work clothes and I check for any stains to make sure that I don't need to throw anyhing in the wash mid-week. If not I simply spray them down with Febreeze or Downey fabric spray, hang them up, and recycle the outfit later in the week.I got the idea for a workplace uniform from a physician that I used to work for. The dress code was business casual as we did not wear scrubs. I noticed that the doctor wore the exact same slacks, dress shirt, and tie every single day that I worked there for 3 years. For a while I thought he had been sleeping in the office and not going home to change clothes. But that didn't make sense because he never smelled or appeared unkept. Then oneday his wife stopped by the office and gave me his dry cleaning and asked me to hang it in his office because she had to be somewhere else shortly and didn't have time to drop it off at home. When she handed me a bunch of the exact same dress shirts and slacks it clicked in my head that he had created a workplace uniform. So I started doing the same thing! My uniform is professional and appropriate for the workplace and I have never had any complaints about it. Your coworkers will probably notice your “uniform” but will not say anything as long as it's well kept and not smelly. I've only had 1 coworker try to put me on blast about it and commented that I always wore the same thing, to which I replied “Yep. I'm not here to impress you so my workplace uniform is as good as it gets. But catch me outside of this place and I guarantee you that my outfits will put the mess that you wear to shame.” That shut her a** up quick and one of my other coworkers burst out laughing.",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,7K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-mind-blowing-technologies-that-exist-that-most-people-dont-know-about

On most days she wouldn’t wear bra and it was noticeable. Sometimes all she wore were those thin athletic sweaters just zipped up half way with no shirt or bra under. She came in one day, wearing a crop top that was lace and very much see through, she wore a bra that day, thank goodness. It became the norm to see her like that in the office. If I were going for a night out I would wear the things she wore, but NEVER to work. She was a nice girl, wasn’t stuck up or anything, but she did do whatever she wanted and especially worked whenever she wanted.We had 6 attorneys in our office all married and all around the ages of 50.When she showed up to the office in these outfits no one would say anything and I wondered why. I just assumed they were all perverts BUT it turns out she was sleeping with one of the attorneys that’s why nothing was ever said. I guess he got a kick out of seeing her dress like that around the office.
