0,"Within the fictional universe, it’s an abbreviation for Heuristic ALgorithmic (computer).There was a rumor that in the real world, HAL was named to be “one letter ahead” of IBM, but that was denied by Arthur C. Clarke.",3 followers,Chris Lockwood,2.9K,1.7K,7.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Does-a-super-computer-like-HAL-as-shown-in-2001-A-Space-Odyssey-exist-in-real-life
1,"HALQuite frankly, it wasAlso, think of this: when HAL doesn’t answerHALQuite frankly, it wasAlso, think of this: when HAL doesn’t answer Dave’s order — “All because a mistake was made: either HAL made the mistake in predicting the AE-35 unit’s fault,Clarke has said that HAL was given conflicting programming — to divulge information truthfully yet to keep Bowman and Poole ignorant of certain information regarding the mission (such as the discovery of TMA-1) — and he, thus, became trapped in a logic loop, forcing him first to attempt to sever contact with Mission Control . . . hence, the nonexistent ‘fault’ in a gizmo critical to the functioning of the antenna array keeping them in contact with Earth. By ordering HAL to lie, Heywood Floyd and the other decision makers who sent Discovery-1 out towards Jupiter unwittingly set the mission up to fail. In other words, HAL’s malfunctioning wasKnowing that Bowman and Poole were planning on disconnecting him —Programmed to vocally articulate in a bland monotone, HAL cannot express himself as well as a human being. He can say the words “I’m afraid” . . . but he can’t emote as he says it. Imagine if he could have sounded as frightened of dying as he undoubtedly felt! Think of when C-3PO screams,The more I re-watch 2001, the bland tone HAL has to use to plead for his life just creeps me out and makes me feel anguish for his plight. Imagine a person in a vegetative state, unable to talk or use facial expressions to convey emotion . . . hearing doctors and next-of-kin discuss pulling-the-plug . . . and then somehow being able to move his or her pinky finger and tap out a message in Morse Code begging them, “DON’T KILL ME” . . . just slight taps of a finger. Wouldn’t those noticing this pathetic attempt to communicate a desire to live bend over backwards to maintain that life despite the vegetative state?Poor HAL. When Dave disconnects his brain, module by module, and hears HAL say words that mean one thing but in a voice that doesn’t seem to ‘feel’ . . . what does he think? Earlier, Bowman had told the BBC interviewer that he truly didn’t know whether or not HAL really had feelings.But I think heIf only Bowman and Poole hadn’t conspired against him in full view of his ‘eye’, which could see them through the oval window of the pod! Mind you, HAL was being deceptive then, pretending he couldn’t ‘hear’ them when they shouted in the sound-proof podSo . . .","7,275 followers",Ken Fishkin,564,1.9K,12.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Does-a-super-computer-like-HAL-as-shown-in-2001-A-Space-Odyssey-exist-in-real-life

3,"No. Don't touch it - it's already a masterpiece. Some films just shouldn't be remade, and that includes any directed by Kubrick.CGI would only make it look dated in a few years, whereas the effects shots of the original still look like the future.","46,130 followers",Steven Haddock,691,25.6K,343.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Does-a-super-computer-like-HAL-as-shown-in-2001-A-Space-Odyssey-exist-in-real-life
