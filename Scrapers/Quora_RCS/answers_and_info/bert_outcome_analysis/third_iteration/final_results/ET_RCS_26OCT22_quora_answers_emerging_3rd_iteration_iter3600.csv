1,Everyone copied everything they could. The German Panzer V was a German interpretation of the Russian T34. The USSR captured a B29 that landed in Russia and copied it down to the last bolt so they could evaluate the design.

2,One of interesting examples of an advanced German WWII tech was Zielgerät 1229It was an early example of an active infrared device for the Sturmgewehr 44 assault rifle.The Vampir was first used in combat in 1945 on the Eastern front.The main problem with Vampir was a battery size that weighted 15 kilograms and had to be carried in a backpack. That didn’t make it very practical to use.One of interesting examples of an advanced German WWII tech was Zielgerät 1229It was an early example of an active infrared device for the Sturmgewehr 44 assault rifle.The Vampir was first used in combat in 1945 on the Eastern front.The main problem with Vampir was a battery size that weighted 15 kilograms and had to be carried in a backpack.

It wasn’t hugely successful but it could fly at more than 700 mph and might have broken the sound barrier in fast dives.On the other hand Germany couldn’t possibly have developed a nuclear weapon. At its peak the American “Manhattan Project” (to build the A Bomb) consumed 8% of the electricity generated in the US.

4,"The Germans had very little strength in 1939. They reached the height of their manpower in 1944. They even demobilized after the French surrendered in 1940. What you are asking is if they had the technology of 1945 and the audacity of the German Army of 1941 and the manpower of 1944 with the quality and leadership of 1941 and the manufacturing focus of late 1943. The Germans didn't even go to a war production footing until 1943. By then it was way too late.You are piecing together lots of puzzle pieces to make the German Army invincible.

The Germans didn't even go to a war production footing until 1943. By then it was way too late.You are piecing together lots of puzzle pieces to make the German Army invincible. They would have needed more fuel, better fuel and more artillery shells to really have been invincible, not just technology. The German technology of 1945 also still lacked a good bomber or any good capability and any real, solid trucking. They were dependent on trains and horses. And the tanks of 1945, while excellent, were still way slow. In 1943 the German Army was enormous -- but it wasn't as good as the Army of 1941. When Hitler asked why this enormous army of 1943 wasn't as good as the smaller, less strongly armed and equipped army of 1941 Guderian said, ""Because the army of 1941 is in the ground!"" The best soldiers, the cream of the crop, were dead by the end of 1941.The Germans lost the war outside Rhzev during the winter of 1942. By failing to take Moscow according to the timetable, which everyone knew was a throw of the dice, the war was lost, even as early as January, 1942. The Generals knew it. Their only hope was in crushing Moscow and that opportunity had passed. And without a bomber force capable of crippling Soviet industry or a Navy capable of stopping US shipments to the Soviet Union, the war was lost. The German Army was exhausted by the end of 1941. No amount of new tanks or technology was going to fix that. It doesn't matter how many Panthers or Tigers you have if you have no fuel to run them. Unless they disrupted Soviet munitions and took Moscow, their industrial capacity was limited and their fuel situation dire. The Germans didn't JUST fail because they lacked good tanks early. They lost for a variety of important reasons that it would take a large number of ""what ifs"" to fix.","5,642 followers",Andrei Ţaga,1.3K,315,8.8M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-the-Germans-were-advanced-in-technology-during-World-War-II

6,"William Craig’s book “Enemy at the Gates: The battle for Stalingrad” had an interesting story about a ‘friendly fire’ incident:In World War II, each Red Army soldier received a daily ration that included 100 grams of vodka.

Major Malygin telephoned Ivan and threatened to report his fraudulent behavior to Army headquarters. Okay, fair game. But Major Malygin went one step further, probably one step too far, he said he would cut off Ivan The Terrible’s vodka ration.Ivan screamed over the telephone “Three rounds hit the vodka warehouse with Major Malygin still inside, shattering hundreds of bottles. Luckily, the Major survived the ‘friendly fire’ incident, he staggered out of the wreckage to the nearest telephone and contacted headquarters to accuse Ivan The Terrible of this terrible crime.The person on the other end listened to his story patiently, but replied unsympathetically: “From then on, no supply officer would mess with Ivan The Terrible’s vodka ration.",0 followers,Brent Cooper,6.2K,7.9K,409.4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-the-Germans-were-advanced-in-technology-during-World-War-II
7,"Depends on the area in question. Generally, there existed a technological equilibrium between the Allies and the European Axis.

Today English is the unchallenged lingua franca of science, but this was not always the case.Back then the dominant language was not English, but in many areas of natural science it was German. The most extreme example among these is probably chemistry. If you studied chemistry at the beginning of 20th century, then you also had to study German. Period. You could forget English, completely forget it. There was no way around it. Either you started learning German, or no chemistry at all.If we compare, for example, Germany and the USA in the number of awarded science Nobel prizes, then we can see that it took the USA 20 years, mass immigration of specialists, a lost world war for Germany, a complete breakdown of the German scientific sector, the division of the country, a gigantic German brain drain to achieve 1965 parity with Germany.Or based on more general terms, the use of language. The combined Anglosphere (USA, UK, Ireland, India, Canada, Australia) against the Germanosphere (Germany, Austria, Switzerland). We see that the shift occurred 1960 when the scientific output of the English-speaking world finally rivaled and eventually superseded the German share.","29,920 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,836,7.7K,249.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-the-Germans-were-advanced-in-technology-during-World-War-II
8,"The Germans made numerous military mistakes in WW2, but the biggest mistake they made was underestimating their enemies, and more specifically not understanding what kind of war they were in.The German war machine was highly inefficient, and it was mobilized for war way too late.

The German regime in their infinite wisdom, decided that they didn’t need to fully mobilize their industry for war production until much later in the war. Despite being the first country to gear up for war, Germany was quickly over taken in production by almost everyone. Despite Germany have considerably more resources than the Soviet Union, they were vastly out produced by them. Partially because the Soviets were actually very good at mass producing, but also because the Germans under performed so fantastically.Nazi Germany was rife with rivalry between companies, which made duplicate efforts, without any result. It was rife with experimental prototypes which were based on fantasy of superiority rather than mass production facts. It was rife with the military making decisions on how and what should be produced, rather than people who were experts on mass production. For example, in their pursuit of creating the ultimate tank, the military and their crony engineers altered the design of the Tiger constantly. They made tiny changes, and insisted on introducing them to the production line constantly. On average, a change to the production model was made every 5 models produced. So imagine that during the 1943 Kursk offensive, when Germany fielded around 300 tigers, they had 60 different models, all of them needing slightly different spare parts, slightly different manuals, slightly different maintenance. Imagine the logistical problems. In contrast, the Soviets fielded just models of the original T-34 with a 76mm gun, and made on average 10,000 tanks before they introduced an upgrade, allowing for a huge amount of commonality and more extensive upgrades rather than minor details.Such things prevented the German military production from ever reaching its full potential. At this point, the Germans had already lost. By 1943, it was too late for the German war machine to handle what it was facing, it was under equipped and their defeat was only a matter of time, no matter how you look at it.
