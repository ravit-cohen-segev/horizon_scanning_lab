And keep the physical communication lines open.No. In fact there would be no need for communications to fail. If and when we start to colonize our solar system, different societies will rise on their own. You see colonies would eventually suffer from one of the oldest habits of humanity. Greed!Earth would without a doubt demand that its hunger for resources to be fed, leaving what's left to the colonies. Eventually those colonies tired of being treated like slaves would eventually rise up and demand independence. The freedom to govern themselves.That in turn would undoubtedly lead to conflict, maybe even war, and alliances would be made and broken.A good example of this was shown in the TV show “The Expanse”. It's fairly recent and it shows how humanity became divided between Earth, Mars, the Belters (those who live on colonies in the asteroid belt) and those who live on the outer planets like in Saturn moons. The division is clear as it's the reason why. Also you get a good idea of how that would affect human evolution as well.But in a case of full blown war, the planets that would become the biggest instigators would be Earth and Mars. Mars being closer to the asteroid belt would seek to claim full property over the resources of the asteroid belt. And Earth would simply not allow that to happen. So a conflict between who commanded the greatest and easiest supply of resources, would be inevitable, if all negotiations failed.Any colonies on the outer planets like Jupiter or Saturn moons, would have very little interest in meddling in that conflict. Both Jupiter's and Saturn's moons would offer all the resources necessary for them to keep to themselves, without needing to meddle on other people's problems. In a way colonies orbiting Jupiter or Saturn would most likely be the ones to declare themselves independent from Earth and basically everyone else's, seeing that they would not really need anything from anyone else.",UNKNOWN,Mark,1.4K,3.2K,1.4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-would-be-the-optimal-number-of-humans-on-Earth-so-that-we-could-socially-and-technologically-evolve-but-we-would-not-oppress-other-species-and-overuse-resources
