Most people would not notice this change due to the excessive use of smartphones. butAR devices aren't much of a trend these days, but in the near future, AR devices will outnumber smartphones and create a new industry which will combine with a number of different fields such as entertainment, transport, telecommunication, education and so on. People like new things, it was the same when the first smartphone came out. Everyone who saw the product wanted one and it will be the same when a really advanced AR product is introduced. Google glasses sure was an innovative product, but comparing its capabilities with a smartphone, it is inferior.When Graham-bell invented the Telephone, it was just lined communication, not much of a deal if you ask someone these days. That simple innovative product transformed the telecommunication sector, resulting advance devices that could do tasks which weren't even thought of back then. The same thing happened when Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone. This will be the same effect for AR. Google glasses could operate really well and it could be further developed to do tasks which weren't even thought of in the present era. Currently, a number of companies work on these devices.Smartphones are changing our lives, AR will revolutionize the world.AR devices will be the next big thing. I’m not saying that smartphones would be completely dead when this happens, but with the evolution of the world, smart cities, artificial intelligence, driverless cars and all these new things, smartphones seem a bit outdated.The world's evolving.

2,"Well honestly what I am going to say is more my hopes then a definite just because no one can predict the future, especially with so much relying on government funding, which is iffy at best. But with that said I think in the next 20 years we will see much more minor changes then many hope for.Firstly I think we will see computers double to triple their current speeds. At the current rate it is taking about 3 years to double the number of transistors on a chip which correlates to about double the processing power (it can vary depending on many factors), but it also is becoming a lot more expenWell honestly what I am going to say is more my hopes then a definite just because no one can predict the future, especially with so much relying on government funding, which is iffy at best. But with that said I think in the next 20 years we will see much more minor changes then many hope for.Firstly I think we will see computers double to triple their current speeds. At the current rate it is taking about 3 years to double the number of transistors on a chip which correlates to about double the processing power (it can vary depending on many factors), but it also is becoming a lot more expensive to get that increased power. Imagine your computer from five years ago, is it that much slower then todays? Intel has been shifting from increasing processing power to focusing on energy consumption for that processing power. I think in 20 years traditional computers will have reached about their max potential for the average consumer, after all transistors can only get so small.Now the question becomes will quantum computing surpass top consumer computers and I think not likely, a least not for a reasonable cost. The biggest issue with quantum computing is the fact that the atoms have to be cooled. In fact the majority of a quantum computer size is just for cooling. There just a ton of major challenges with just as many major breakthroughs.Most major companies think we will have standard Quantum computers by 2026, I am more conservative and would lean towards 2038 but either way within 20 years most experts think we will see Quantum Computers being fairly common, at least for research. How affordable and how powerful they will be though is just too hard to tell at this time.A big thing which is changing our world is 3D Printing. The ability to print anything you want on demand will become huge for many people in the future especially as the cost drops heavily.That graph shows the cost of a fancy machine, most residential machines cost between $500 - $3000 and I think we will see prices fall to the $500 - $1000 range as they become more common in wide spread. Of course printing little toys won't be a major difference (besides companies who might start selling printable goods for you to buy), the major different will be instead on the industrial scale. Just imagine instead of buying a house and then spending months building it, you go and get one printed, one that you were able to design. I think in the next 20 years we will see larger items like cars, houses, bridges , etc become more customizable and cheaper as companies start printing them out.Just imagine a massive 3D Home Printer, incredible.I'll add more to this as I get some free time.

4,"Big things can be good or bad. Here is my take:Medicine -Big things can be good or bad. Here is my take:Medicine -Analysis: Antibiotic apocalypseScience and technology -Now enter in storage. Having a good storage system changes everything. Battery technology has been improving rapidly the past few decades but it still has a long way to go. Lithium-based batteries are now quite good but the supply of raw materials to make them may not cover demand. Enter in two potential technologies. Sodium based batteries and graphine based batteries.Sodium has many of the same electrical properties as lithium but it is a larger ion. One of the problems in making a sodium ion based battery is that it is more difficult to encapsulate the larger sodium ion than it is the lithium ion but there has been a lot of research in solving that problem. Also, the energy density of a sodium battery is less than that of a lithium ion battery. However, the sodium ion battery may be significantly less expensive. So much so that stationary storage of energy at wind and solar farms may be practical. Now you have a low cost of renewable energy that you can store for when it is needed. That is one shoe dropping on fossil fuels.But what about transportation? Well, as it turns out, some of the researchers studying sodium ion batteries are claiming that their batteries will be able to be recharged in as little as five minutes. So now you have a car that can go several hundred miles on a charge and be recharged in minutes. The car is less complicated than one with an internal combustion engine and will be more reliable. The battery is now relatively inexpensive so it may also be less expensive to purchase than an internal combustion engine car. This upends a big segment of many economies. It can also destabilize oil producing countries that no longer have a significant source of income. Oil production doesn’t have to cease to destabilize a country. You only need to reduce demand for oil to the point where the price is low and economic and civil turmoil rises.Will the big things change the world as I foresee? Probably not but things will change and the change will happen faster than you think. Once things reach a tipping point, the change happens faster than people are prepared for.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,17K,996,156M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-next-big-things-in-medicine-science-and-technology-in-the-next-20-years

We could have accelerated healing, immunity to disease and eventually we could stop the aging process by silencing the genes which cause aging and repairing bodily tissue. Stem cell pharmacies will also be commonplace. scientists have already developed nanobots that eliminated 90% of a cancerous tumor within 3 minutes. Scientists have also made the nanobots biodegradable meaning that they are designed to degrade and dissolve naturally once they have done their job. By making them out of natural materials it is also much less likely to be rejected by the body. Also, if they are small then they will not interfere with the nerve and electrical signals coming from the brain which means that they can operate inside the brain as well. Their limited functionality also ensures that they can’t do any damage. By having nanobots in our body they can deliver and administer drugs in parts of the body that are inaccessible with most medical equipment. There will be a nanotechnology conference this year. Gene editing will also be very significant because even now they can use Crispr to silence and replace faulty genes in the genome. This means that they can cure many more diseases that are rare and incurable using normal methods. Genome sequencing will also be important because the 100,000 genomes project will be completed by December this year. Scientists believe that Genome sequencing will be as common as Penicillin by 2040 and there will be billions of genomes being sequenced which will vastly enhance people’s quality of life. Hyperloop one is also taking off and becoming very popular which will be a new mode of transport which can connect cities using tube systems. The Hyperloop pods will travel in a vacuum and reach speeds of up to 700 mph. in the tube all the air will be taken out and they will levitate above the ground moving using electromagnetic propulsion. This means that there will be only 1G of force and there will be no friction. Also last year for the first time ever Britain has produced more energy using renewable energy sources that it has using fossil fuels. Britain has also pledged to make diesel cars illegal by 2042 and remove all plastic waste by 2040. In 2016 scientists also discovered gravitational waves that means that in the future we could develop technology that could manipulate the force of gravity. In 2017 the first humanoid robot called Sophia was the first robot ever to be granted citizenship in Iran and the robot made a speech. In 2030 carbon nanotube length will be sufficient to begin building a space elevator that scientists hope will be fully operational between 2050 and 2080. However, global warming is increasing with 2017 being the warmest year on record without an El Nino event. Due to the water crisis, Capetown and South Africa could become the first city to completely run out of water. It is also predicted by many scientists that by the summer of 2020 the Arctic will be ice free and by 2050 one third of the word’s landmass will be arid desert due to climate change.","135,529 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-next-big-things-in-medicine-science-and-technology-in-the-next-20-years

I went to a job fair (dressed nice) and actually got a job at a call center. I told the recruiter my whole situation and he said it didn't matter, he hired me on the spot. Well the next Monday comes around and the HR department calls me in and says they didn't know about my background and that I lied (which I didn't) and they fired me. I wasn't allowed to drive so I had to call my P.O. and tell her I need a ride because I was let go. Because I was past my allotted time to find a job in the program, she told me I would have to go back to prison. She was calling the US Marshals to come get me.I was so upset I couldn't hold my tears in. I felt God had it out for me and I wasn't given a fair chance to fix my life.I was told the US Marshals would be coming to get me in about an hour, I must have looked helpless because an older man came up to me and asked if I was OK. I felt so defeated and told him the whole story. Turns out he was the head of another call center next door (411,which no longer exists) and he told me to call my PO and tell her I got another job and he would personally keep in contact. He kept his word and I worked there for 3 years before he sold the company and retired.I then went into sales because I had friends who were felons and they told me about jobs that didn't care as long as it wasn't for a violent crime.The reason I am writing this is because I too like computers and design. During this whole time working in sales and at call centers (which I always hated, but was better than prison) I would work in Photoshop and web design on my spare time. I got really  good and started getting clients on my own. 11 years later I now own my own design company and I get offers all the time to work for large companies.The point of all this.You are going to have some bad days, months, and years. But I promise if you do the best you can to keep a positive attitude it will all work out in the end. Now my felony doesn't even matter anymore. After 7 years in most states (10 in others) your felony doesnt even show up on your background check (except Government jobs). After 7 years you dont even have to put that you are a felon.People hire people they like and trust. It will take a few years to get there (in my case 5 years) but you will get there.

I stole food from the grocery store to survive and when it got too cold outside to bare, I would go to the 24hr CVS and just walk around the store all night to stay warm.I had bounced around doing drugs, being homeless, and going in and out of jails since almost as long as I'd gotten out of the military. I had been ruining my life for almost 10 years. I accumulated 7 felonies ( I no longer have any criminal record because I was able to have my record expunged after paying a lot of money and navigating a lot of legal hoops ) mountains of debt, had attended and left every rehab program in San Diego. My own parents doubted that I would ever recover and my family would not help me, plus they were on the other side of the country. I was left to my own devices..I was lucky in only one fact.. Being a military veteran, the judge was always lenient on me and while many of my friends were sent to prison I never got more than jail time.. In total I probably spent almost 2 years of time in county jails split up over that 10 years.And then, one day I just woke up and without cause I just looked around and thought to myself I'm about to turn 30.. And I'm acting like a kid.. If ai turn 30 and I'm still a mess well I might as well keep doing what I'm good at at that point. But that's not who I want to be.With $50 in my pocket after renting a uhaul truck I took a truck load of junk I'd accumulated and stored in a storage locker and I moved to LA, rented a storage locker in Hollywood and lived in that storage locker until I could afford to rent a room in an overcrowded tiny apartment.My first week in LA I decided to sign up for film school. Being a vet I had the opportunity to use the GI Bill and student loans between the two I was able to go to school and live off my loan money for a year and a half. I saw t as my only opportunity to make something of myself. If I failed then I'd be destined to be a homeless bum forever. So I worked my ass off! I volunteered for everything, took part ineverhthing and a year and a half later not only did I graduate film school with a 3.98 GPA but I skipped my own graduation because I was already booked to work on my second feature film.My family thought I was insane when I started film school. Everyone did. I had no experience in anything film related, had absolutely no connections, I didn't even know a single person in LA when I moved here.I worked in the film industry for a few years until he mistakes of my past caught up to me and made me reevaluate my future. I failed to mention an important event: when I got out of the military I also came out as gay. I had denied that fact for about 23 years because my Dad made me think that being gay was horrible and disgusting. So when I did come out, I clung to the first guy that showed interest in me. As it turns out, that person not only introduced me to drugs and made me feel like I belonged for the first time in my life, he also infected me with HIV - infected in 2003, didn't find out until a nurse told me almost 2 ears later while I was in jail. Technically upgraded to AIDS in 2010) so after a month of working on location in Cambodia on the last feature film I had the pleasure of working on, the exhaustion and unfamiliar environment and whatever else.. I was given the wake up call that I had finally pushed my body beyond its breaking point. I was so sick that I ended up being admitted into the hospital for a week and a half. I was so sick I could hardly walk. For 2 months..I gave up working in the film industry because that made me realize that I couldn't maintain at that level any longer. It was only a matter of time before I get sick again. I already know how I will die. There's nothing more in this world that Is rather have than to embe able to build a family of my own but between my disease and my past I've accepted that some dreams have become unattainable because some scars never go away. But that doesn't mean that I can't at least try to find other dreams to strive towards.Now 30 years old I walked away from the career which saved my life and almost cost me my life and I didn't give up. I wrote another answer here on Quora..If I can accomplish that, then is your dream really so unattainable?The word failure is a contrived word that doesn't really mean anything. As long as you continue to try to achieve a goal, you have not failed. Failed only has meaning when we choose to give up. Nothing worthwhile is perfected in the first attempt.The word impossible is a contrived word that is a scapegoat for laziness. Nothing is impossible. We just say things are impossible when we’re too lazy to try.

I really enjoyed reading Jo Roderick's answer to your question.  Like you, I, too am a convicted felon.  I know exactly what you are going through, and I know some days can be very bad for us.  My crime is not something I like to talk about, because most people perceptions of what I did are misguided and untrue, yet, I say that, not to justify what I did, but do want to add that my conviction was a direct result of my own testimony.  There was no victim testimony.  I did not go to prison, and I fulfilled all my sentence requirements in advance, and I was released from probation 1 year in advance.  I have to register at the local police station for life everywhere I go.  I think that gives you an idea of my crime.Everyday I get up in the morning, I know I have to be the best I can be, and do the best that I can do.  Everyday that I leave home to do what I have to do, I make sure that I do it, regardless how tired I am or regardless of the fact that life happens at any moment and my entire day can change at a moments notice; I still do what I set out to do.I am self employed for obvious reasons.  I have been self employed for almost 25 years. I am self employed because once people find out my criminal history, they disappear.  I am a Business Consultant, and I am exceptionally good at what I do.  I do not have the luxury of making a mistake as do others have because that is not an option I can practice.  You see, I am a convicted felon, and I do not want anyone to stigmatize me, but they do, anyway, because that is what people do.  Although, I know that there exists several people that have good intentions, I find them, but they are few and in between and those are the ones I trust.So, for your information, I am 58 years old, I have my own business, I go to college full time and plan to get a Ph.D, I am an honor roll student and I have received several scholarships that help me financially.  I do not publicize my business, 100% of my incoming business is from referrals, and I am very particular of the clients I work with.  My clients are very difficult to work with, and there is no consultant out there that I know of that wants to work with them.  I specialize at what I do, therefore I work only by referral.  My earnings are very modest, but I have all that I need.I cannot afford to think that because I am a convicted felon I cannot be an accomplished individual like others.  I like to humble myself, and treat everyone with respect and dignity, whether they deserve it or not.  At the end of my day, I do not feel I deserve all the goodness life has to offer, yet I have it in the fact I have a family and friends that love me unconditionally, even with the knowledge of what I did.The reason I chose to answer your question with my name fully attached to it is because I love who I am, yet, I do not like what I did.  Yes, I screwed up, but I did not screw up my life or someone else's life! I took responsibility for what I did.  And regardless of what perceptions people may have of me, I am certain of one thing, Life is not about how others look at me, Life is about how I look at myself.  Life is not about getting others approval, Life is about approval of myself.So, at the end of the day, when I lay my head next to my pillow, I can say to myself, you did good today Ross.  Then I feel God's smile upon me, you see, at the end of the day, I did not do anything for others, I only did it for God!  So when I die, I hope He looks upon me with Grace.

There are still many kind people left that are willing to help others, and try not to judge them on their current behaviour, not their past mistakes.Take pride in everything you achieve along the way. It doesn't matter how small the success is. As with everything in life, moderation is key. If you spend too much of your time congratulating yourself on the most ordinary, mundane things in your everyday life, you are also not taking steps forward, but are instead doing the two-step with your ego. This achieves nothing but an unhealthy state of narcissism.In life, it is inevitable that there will be set-backs and that you may be disappointed. In the equation of the numerous positive small steps in relation to your small failures, you will find that you are still ahead on your scoreboard. It will minimise the negativity of your setback and encourage you to try again.Depending on where you live, and the rules that govern, you may not be allowed to go into law enforcement, but there is nothing to stop you from entering private practice.

It took me a little while to recover because I wasn't brought up to understand the system, but here's few tips that will help you through the hard part, speaking mainly from a business perspective.First, keep doing what you're doing as far as learning goes. You must never stop educating yourself. Read everything. That one thing puts you above 90% of the population. Don't worry about focusing on a single subject. More on that in a minute.If at all possible, find a job that  gives you the opportunity to improve your skills, even if it means a big pay cut. Office supplies boy for a programming company? Take it. Once you're in, even if they're not planning on promoting you because of your background, they likely won't check your record again for a promotion.Pay attention to all the pain points in the company and start offering recommendations. At first it will be hard to find them, but keep looking and you'll see them everywhere. This is where you learn about a lot of existing solutions you probably won't even know were a thing. I wound up as a knowledge manager (check out pay scale), even though no one in the company even knew what it was, simply because I could prove we needed one so badly. Graphic design was my initial goal, but KM is very enjoyable and challenging, plus it pays a lot better. Google is your best friend.Make sure you can write really well. No matter your role, you need to communicate to get to the next level. Remember those recommendations you're going to be making? They need to sound good. If they don't, the logic at the heart of them will be lost.You're going to fail a lot. Don't get discouraged. Politely bug the right people until they act on your suggestions or give you an opportunity to make them happen, even if it's temporary. A temp member for a project is your opening. Secretly work from home (if necessary) to show how bad a*s creative you are.Work 50-60 hours a week, unpaid if you have to, to develop your plans. Don't tell them you're doing that, though. They'll pay you for it later. Trust me.By following this path and making it your own, you're almost guaranteed to be successful. It may not be what you initially expected, but when a company stats putting their trust in you and relying on you to drive aspects of the organization,  you're just getting started. Use what you've learned to start your own business maybe.Your history, business, life, it's all just a series of problems looking for a solution. There is always a solution. Always.

Your past therefore doesn’t need to define you and whether you have a criminal record or not is irrelevant.What“I screwed up” is the narrative to your story and that’s a huge problem. That negativity is going to be hanging over you and every time you face a challenge (there will be many, regardless of your past) you’ll feel like you’re not capable or good enough to overcome that challenge.“I screwed up previously and am making my life better” is a different and more positive approach. Looking at how you can improve your future, is better than dwelling on your past. In the moments of doubt, knowing that you’re striving for a better future is what will get you over that wall.Your past defines very little of who you are in the future.
