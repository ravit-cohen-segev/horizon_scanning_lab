What Superman does is utterly ludicrous. Flight requires two things - lift and thrust. He’s got problems with either. To start, the human body is definitely not the most aerodynamic object in the universe. It’s lumpy and there’s nothing even resembling a wing. No matter how hard you push it from behind, the amount of actual lift you generate will be minuscule, so just getting off the ground is going to be a chalWhat does “like Superman” mean?

It’s lumpy and there’s nothing even resembling a wing. No matter how hard you push it from behind, the amount of actual lift you generate will be minuscule, so just getting off the ground is going to be a challenge.Then there’s thrust. Superman has a really,So, let’s think about a couple of options. Jetpacks. Those are cool, right? Here’s the thing, though. If you go look at practical footage of the “jetpacks” we can build today, they struggle to get a person any substantial distance off the ground, they’re gigantic, and their forward thrust is negligible. They’ve also got to have all of their fuel on board, and fuel isn’t light. So in addition to your dumb, lumpy, weird human body - already a pretty dense thing to deal with - it’s got to deal with a couple hundred pounds of chemical propellant. It’s just…it’s not going to happen, and there’s not really much reason to do it. We can get ultralight, solar powered planes to a point that would put any solution using conventional technology to shame in a fraction of the time it would take to figure out how to make a contraption like that function without killing the person it was trying to move around in the first place.Okay - let’s get creative, then. Do it like a bullet train. Those work with magnets, and we have it on good authority that the puzzle of how ******* magnets work is one of the greatest secrets humanity has ever tried to unveil. They’re…like…magic or some kind of miracle or something, right? I’ve run a few thought experiments on how you might be able to do anything at all like what a bullet train does and I’ve come up short.Let’s assume that you’re trying to fly by pushing against the Earth’s magnetic field. The power supply required for that would be utterly beyond comprehension. Gravity pulls down really, really hard. Just getting a marble to float in midair - not moving in any direction - would require just…just a stupid amount of flowing electricity to create an electromagnetic force sufficient to counter the pull. On a tiny little 5g marble. Your big, weird, dumb human body is a whole lot heavier than that tiny marble. What’s worse - you can’t actually add more weight with the power source than you make up for in force. If you have to take a hundred pound battery to provide enough thrust to lift a 100 pound human…well, that’s not going to be good enough, for obvious reasons. The person plus the battery dramatically exceeds the amount of force that the battery and associated equipment are capable of generating.But - I hear you say - but what about those silly little desk tchotchkes you can get from any number of stores at the mall? Those manage to float whole tops. Welp, in that case it turns out that the extremely light top is getting a whole lot of help from the magnet in the base. If you were going to take that approach and attempt to generate a magnetic field that extends hundreds of feet into the sky - man, I don’t even want to think about the side effects of that. Your magnetic field is going to be spherical, so anything within that same hundreds of feet on the ground is about to get absolutely blasted. I can wreck your computer’s whole day with a few tiny buckyballs. This would be the equivalent of hitting it with a car. An accelerating car. With a big rocket stuck to the top of it. It’s a lot, is what I’m saying. But that only gets you up in the air. Now you have to make it move in whichever direction you want to fly, as fast as you want to fly.So, nope. There’s no amount of technology that would make that possible. This isn’t uncommon for superhero stuff, though. There’s absolutely no way that The Flash could move as fast as he does without dying from about a dozen different things. Cyclops should fly backwards in the air every time he opens his eyes and lets out the force of the punch dimension or however they’ve decided he works. The Incredible Hulk conjures mass out of literally nowhere. That’s the great thing about superhero tricks. You can’t do them, but you can draw them, and you can fake them, and you can imagine them - you just can’t try them at home.",0 followers,Matthew Jett,1K,349,614.2K,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-my-job-becomes-obsolete-because-of-new-advanced-technology-in-the-future-what-should-I-do

The best estimate I could find (BBC Four) stated that there are 100 trillion ants on Earth and they have spread to every single continent on Earth. Ants are absolutely remarkable and these are some thing they have already done, without the intelligence boost this question gives them.Humans have build cities, and some intelligent animals may have cobbled together a makeshift shelter for safety, but ants have built massive colonies underground, safe from most hazards that lie above, with rooms dedicated to specific purposes like storage, mating, nurseries, farms and even garbage disposal areas like we have with landfills, all connected with tunnels that ensure good ventilation.A group of scientists unearthed an ant colony that covered over 50 square metres of space and was 8 metres deep. The colony must have moved 80 tonnes of soil to build it. This would be a New York City for the ants to build. But, we have discovered supercolonies, built by these ants, most notably the Argentine Ant. One supercolony in Europe spread across 6000 km, formed by multiple ant colonies joining and working together, with billions and billions of workers, basically forming their own countries. That’s not all. Argentine Ants from different supercolonies are sociable to other Argentine Ants from other parts of the world, essentially creating a mega-colony that has spread worldwide.Ants are also the only animals other than humans, to go to war with each other and other kinds like termites. The Army Ants of South America band together into a gigantic unit, moving as a united front and tearing through everything that cannot get away. When the Army Ants start to move, birds take off, insects flee, snakes go into the water or into their burrows, even jaguars and horses turn and run when they spot the ants.Army Ants can eat an entire horse. Compare a horse to yourself. There, you see why everything runs. Army Ants also build things with themselves. Have to cross from one tree to another? Have to cross a small stream? The Army Ants build bridges with their own bodies, ensuring no obstacle can stop their movements.Ants have also been spotted using deceptions. When two ants from different species meet in the wild, they either duke it out instantly or size each other up to see how dangerous that ant is. Ants have been seen standing on higher ground or pebbles to look bigger than their opponent. That’s not all. Ants use tactics in war too. They put the weakest and crippled ants at the front lines to suicidally charge and overwhelm the target before the larger soldiers come in to finish the target effortlessly. This prevents the valuable soldiers from being injured or killed unnecessarily. This brings me to another point. Ants act as a superorganism, not as one. They are absolutely ready to die for the colony’s survival, there is no retreat, just endless waves and waves until the ants destroy the enemy, meaning large colonies almost always destroy other insects or animals. Ant wars are pitted at massive scales, since both sides are suicidally ready to throw out millions upon millions of lives to ensure victory, like the Argentine-Fire Ant War in California, for control of not just a small area, but practically the entire state. This war has already lasted years and to my knowledge, is still ongoing.I have just given you an infodump on just how crazily similar ants are to humans and how they have thrived for longer than the dinosaurs and spread to all continents other than Antarctica. How they construct country-sized colonies and wage massive wars with tactics. How they work as one. Now, imagine they all gain intelligence. Imagine they all become as smart as humans. They would take longer to get to our standards than the apes, but they would easily become the largest threat to all the intelligent animals. The superorganism they act as ensures little room for error and no personal nature will get in the way. They could learn to construct, become deadlier, form armies to attack cities and wherever intelligent animals stay. I assume that the supercolonies could join as one, alliances between ant colonies that consist of trillions of ants could be formed and there would be no betrayal, just a ruthlessness and bravery never before seen. Ants will find ways to be resistant to pesticides and water attacks. All intelligent animals would immediately stop fighting themselves and realise just how dangerous the ants became.Then…I don’t know. Maybe World War Ants happens or something.Sources:Edit:The stretch of the 6000 km supercolony.

And it's not ""artificial consciousness"".Everyone is afraid that AI will suddenly wake up, get upset, and take over the world.Or that AI will wake up and take all of our jobs. This will happen. But without the ""wake up"" part.Below I describe what real AI is.If we want to understand the “existential threat” we first need to know what AI is.Then, if you are at a cocktail party and someone says, ""but what if robots are intelligent?"" you can argue with facts, mixed with a little bit of alcohol.---------A) STATISTICSStatistics is at the heart of most AI programs.Just like statistics is at the heart of a lot of human decision making.For instance, if you see clouds in the sky, your brain thinks: ""Hmmm, the last 100 times I saw clouds this dark, it usually meant it was about to rain"".When you think like that, you are using statistics to make the decision: ""I should _probably_ go inside now.""I'll give an AI example: Siri or Alexa. How does Alexa understand the words you just said?In 1989 I was visiting Carnegie Mellon to decide if I would go to graduate school there.One of the graduate students, Kai-Fu-Lee (now one of the most famous investors in the world and I would check out his excellent recent TED talk on AI) showed me what he was working on:It was speech recognition for the 60 or so commands that might happen on a Navy battleship (ten guesses as to who was funding his project).When you say the word ""Fire!"" a sound wave is created. When you say the word ""hello"" a sound wave that looks different is created.If 100 people say ""Fire"" and 100 people say ""hello"", all of those sounds waves are stored in a database.Now, if a brand new person says ""Hello"" the computer program needs to determine if that person said ""Hello"" or ""fire"".There might be 10 different attributes of every sound wave. It breaks the new person's sound wave into those 10 attributes.Then it compares that ""vector"" of 10 attributes with all of the vectors in its database for ""Hello"" and ""Fire!""It uses a statistical technique called ""Hidden Markov Analysis"" to determine if the sound wave is more like the ""hello""s in the database or more like the ""Fire!"" in the database.Then it says to itself, ""This guy said ""Hello"". ""It then has a line of code that says, ""If someone says ""Hello"" Then say ""Hello"" back"".Additionally, it adds your ""Hello"" to its database.Your ""Hello"" might be slightly different than the other 100 ""Hello""s so it just learned a new way to say ""Hello"". That gives it greater ability in the future to recognize the word ""hello"".In other words, it ""learned"".So it used Statistics to hear you, code to respond to you, and database technology to learn. There's no real intelligence there but it feels like it's intelligence.Multiply that by 30 years and millions of patterns and computers a million times faster and you have Alexa and Siri in today's kitchens.Ask ""Siri"" what gender it is.-----B) EVALUATION FUNCTIONI just mentioned about language recognition. But how does a self-driving car work?Every second it has to make a decision. Does it move forward? Does it brake? Does it swerve to avoid an accident? Does it turn left?How does it get from point A to point B?1) Google Maps. - Using GPS it knows where it is. And it puts itself on Google Maps.2) List all of the possible routes. This is a ""hard"" problem in the mathematical sense (there's no way for it to guess the fastest route. It has to list each route and then sort by the shortest. )But now computers are so fast what would normally be a slow decision (drive me from this corner in Piscataway, New Jersey to the capital building of Sacramento, California) now just takes seconds.3) Waze. Use Waze to eliminate the routes with too much traffic.4) Start driving.5) Statistics: Every microsecond it uses statistics to see if there is blank space or an object that must be avoided or a traffic sign that must be followed.6) Decide what to do according to the code. For each traffic sign, it has code that tells it what to do (if a sign says ""Stop"" it Stops for a second, uses Statistics to see if any traffic is happening on its sides (with radar and cameras to provide the images). )If there is a person standing in front of it, it might just stop.If there's traffic it didn't expect, it might trigger the program to re-route.If it's blank space it will just keep going.If there's a baby crossing the street and it has to swerve to avoid hitting it, but if swerving will cause the car to hit a truck, killing the passenger in the car, then the ""AI"" of the car is dependent on the ethical decisions of the programmer of the car.In other words, in every situation, it determines it's options, then uses an ""evaluation function"" programmed by a coder, to determine which option has the most successful outcome (move the trip forward, don't kill anyone).Eventually the evaluation function will NOT be programmed by a human coder.Instead, through thousands of experiences of other self-driving cars, the experiences plus the outcomes will all be put into a central database.When a new experience is encountered, the code will look up that experience in the database and the database will spit back the best possible outcome.The code will learn statistically what the best outcomes are of each possibly decision and change the code accordingly and send updates to all self-driving cars.-----C) TREESThe hardest game in the world is a board game called GO. With chess, if a computer can evaluate a billion possibilities a second, it can be a world champion level player.But a Go game can involve trillions of possibilities. How did Google make a program, Deep Go, to beat the world's best Go player. This was thought to be impossible.And yet Google did it.For any game, a computer program first builds a tree of possibilities. Much like a human would.A human thinks: ""If I make this move in checkers, my opponent might respond with A, B, or C and then I can do D, E, or F and then my opponent can do G, H, I if I do D or it can do J, K, L if I do E and I'm never going to do F.A computer doesn't select as well as a human so it builds the FULL tree. Meaning, what are ALL of the possible moves it can do, what are ALL of the possible responses of my opponent, etc.And then it uses a programmed evaluation function to look at the leaves of the tree it built.Whichever move results in the best leaf of the tree (as determined by the evaluation function) that is the move it makes.That's how computer chess worked for decades. I'll get to the secret sauce in a second for how computers conquered chess.And then after that I'll describe how computers miraculously conquered Go.It's only a miracle until science can explain it. It's only ""intelligence"" until it can be coded by a programmer.D) HARDWAREEverybody thought for decades (including many Nobel Prize winners) that the best computer chess programs would be developed when scientists encoded the knowledge of the best chess players in the world into the evaluation function.How does the world champion value a position instead of a weak player?This turned out to be wrong.The MORE code in the evaluation function (i.e. the ""smarter"" the evaluation function was from a human perspective) the SLOWER the program.Which meant a smaller tree would be built, which meant less possibilities would be analyzed.What really allowed the programmers at IBM to build ""Deep Blue"" which beat Garry Kasparov in 1997 were two things.Both related to hardware.a. Computers got faster.And finally, they made the evaluation function STUPID in order to use less code so the hardware could value more positions.Then, before anyone caught on to their ""artificial intelligence"" they retired Deep Blue right after it beat the World Champion of chess.As hardware gets faster, artificial intelligence gets ""smarter"".[as an aside, I once gave a date a chip that was the initial chip for “Chip Test” - the “ancestor” of what became the best chess computer, Deep Blue. She was weirded out.]----INTERLUDEWhat I just described is all the basics. You can stop now.The rest of artificial intelligence is simply combining the basics to make more advanced techniques.-----E) STATISTICS + TREERemember the TREE from computer gaming. And STATISTICS from speech recognition.Now let's go to the impossible game of Go. Google developed the program ""AlphaGo"" to win at Go when everyone else thought it would take another 20 to 50 years.First, remember Kai-Fu Lee who worked on speech recognition. And later developed Apple's first attempts at speech recognition in the 90s?At one point in his grad student days, he was getting tired of navy battleship commands (as one does) and decided to focus on building a program to play Othello.He ended up building the world champion of Othello.He took a lot of games, let's say a million, and put them in a database. And each position from each game, he would label, ""winning"" (if it was a position on the winning side) or ""losing"" in a massive database.He would identify several attributes of each position (how many white pieces, versus black pieces, how many corners were controlled, how many pieces were on the sides, etc).Now, if the computer was playing a brand new game, it would determine all the attributes of that position, then use Hidden Markov Analysis (remember: speech recognition) to match that position to the database.If the position pattern-matched a ""winning position"" then it would make the move that would lead to that winning position. If it matched a ""losing position"" it would not make that move.That program became the world champion of Othello.AlphaGo took it one step further.It put in the positions of millions of Go positions and did the same sort of breakdown.It used faster hardware to speed up the process.Then, once it became pretty good at GO, it played BILLIONS of games against ITSELF to put many BILLIONS of new positions into the database. In other words, it ""learned"".Now it was ready to play Go. It crushed the world champion------That's basically it. That's all of artificial intelligence.Let's say a bank wanted to fire all of the employees in charge of lending. And replace them by artificial intelligence.How would the bank lend money?Well, there's 100s of millions of loans already out there. And for each person who has ever borrowed money I know:- their ageI can put all these vectors in a database and divide them into people ""most likely to pay back the loan"" and people ""most likely to default"".Then, just like speech recognition or the Othello program above, I can use statistics to determine who I should loan money to.And if I say ""no"", I don't have to explain. On to the next one!---Let's say I want to fight terrorists.I already have examples of many terrorists who trained in the US and then went on to perform or attempt acts of terror.I know everything about their bank accounts. How often they transferred money. How often they traveled. How often they took out cash versus using a debit card.And so on.I can build a vector of attributes of what a terrorist bank account looks like. Then I can match new people against that database of vectors of terrorists.Believe me, every time you do a bank transfer, some AI program is out there trying to determine if you are a terrorist.----This is all that AI is.It is nothing more. It's not ""intelligent"" from a human sense. It's not conscious, nor will it ever be.Here's how AI has improved in the past forty years (and how it will improve the next 40):- statistics has gotten betterWhat is changing the fastest is data. The land grab of modern society is not land, or gold, or oil.It's data.I have been invested in many companies that collect and sell data. I was an early investor (and on the board of)Believe me when I say, data-driven companies know how many strawberries you ate last summer.And right now that data is used mostly to target you for ads about sneakers. Or politics.But this is AI 1.0. Soon that data will be used to target your every movement, your every want, your every need.Amazon Prime won't be about delivering you what you want tomorrow. Amazon Prime Plus will be about delivering you what you want yesterday.Police 2.0 will be like the movie ""Minority Report"".Even art and music will be driven by AI that studies the neurochemical responses to music you like to music you don't like. And then compose accordingly.Where will humans still be unique?I don't know. Ask the humans with AI implants that enhance their brains so when they look at you they know exactly what answers will make you happy.BUT… will AI replace jobs?The answer (at least in the next decade or so…) is NO.Look at recent examples:A) Many people were worried ATM machines would replace bank tellers.Instead, the banks made so much in profits they opened up more branches than ever, creating new jobs.B) Will autonomous delivery services cost jobs.Right now there are millions of truck drivers involved in delivering goods. With autonomous delivery, less people will go shopping, more people will be required to shop in the aisles, finding products for people.Obviously this is not a high-end job. But this replaces the fact that less cashiers and drivers will be needed.Meanwhile, there will be more high-end jobs. More maintenance engineers for the cars, customer service, marketing, etc.C) Ecommerce. Branding will become less important (branding is VERY important when everyone is shopping at the big box store but advertising will have to become more clever and digital) so the millions in profits that are generated from AI will filter down to more people starting e-commerce ventures and the ancillary businesses associated with that.)Final conclusion:This is probably a net NEGATIVE for society as the higher classes will be able to afford “super AI” capabilities, making them demi-gods to lower-classes.Instead, massive profits will be generated, which will be soaked into the economy through a rising stock market, increase in opportunities, etc.",UNKNOWN,Sriraman Madhavan,4.1K,186,7.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Could-super-artificial-intelligences-create-any-kind-of-advanced-technology-we-can-imagine-in-the-future

9,"They were much more isolated from the rest of the entire worldRecent studies on ancient DNA have indicated that, for instance, the genetic structure of South America, with its separate and genetically differentiated groups, was pretty much already in place even some 8They were much more isolated from the rest of the entire worldRecent studies on ancient DNA have indicated that, for instance, the genetic structure of South America, with its separate and genetically differentiated groups, was pretty much already in place even some 8,000–9,000 years ago. There was relatively little admixture afterwards.Let’s not forget that, despite later migration waves from Asia which mostly affected only North America, the bulk of the American population had been formed, and the bulk of the American territory had been settled by a handful of Paleo-Siberians who possibly numbered only a few thousand people. Their spread throughout the continent seems to have been incredibly fast, but just try to imagine what happens when a small population migrates rapidly to all the corners of a continent almost as large as Asia. They were far apart from each other for a long time, which might explain the immense linguistic diversity of Pre-Columbian America.That points out to what some othe scientists, using other fields of scientific research, had already concluded: that, compared to Eurasia and particularly the Mediterranean basin, linking Europe, West Asia and North Africa, the Americas had a much higher degree of isolation between its societies and its few fully formed civilizations. They were perhaps more self-sufficient and mostly interacted with other peoples only on a regional basis, though occasional trade with further areas certainly happened. The two most civilized areas, Mesoamerica and Western South America, especially the Andean region, were far from each other and separated by regions of dense forests and large swamps inhabited much less advanced peoples.Some authors have speculated that the very location of the Americas was not very conducive to a very intensive and useful exchange of crops, animal domesticates, techniques and so on. The Americas are mostly placed on a north-south axis, not on a west-east axis like Europe, Asia and North Africa, so that climate conditions vary even more in the Americas even in regions that are reasonably close to each other. There was no Mediterranean/Black sea, no “natural corridor” like the Eurasian steppe. There are much fewer peninsulas than in Asia and especially EuropeThere are big geographic challenges in the natural environment and relief of the Americas, which might have become partial genetic and cultural barriers: the Andes, the Rocky Mountains, the extremely dense rainforests of the Amazon, the dense rainforests and mountains of Mesoamerica, the deserts of the Southwestern United States.Add to all of that the Americas lacked traction and transport animals like horses, camels, donkeys and oxen, to be domesticated, easing the transport of people and objects. Species of those animals did exist in the past, but the American mega-fauna was almost wiped out in the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene, possibly partially due to the influence of the expansion of Native Americans throughout the continent.Besides, for some reason I don’t quite understandAncient and long extinct horses of the Americas.As for Australia, it had all the shortcomings of the Americas, but on steroids. Most of it is arid or semi-arid, and there is absolutely no large river basin or peninsulas to facilitate trade and travel. Australia was inhabited by a much lower population than the Americas, scattered over a huge territory, and they were even more isolated than the Americas for most of their history. Australian aboriginals had very few native plants and animals that could ever be domesticated in a productive way.They were entirely on their own in a land that was not particularly favorable to dense human settlements, and there is no change of higher technological development without a lot of dense human settlements interacting with each other.",29 followers,Khaled Omar,1K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-my-job-becomes-obsolete-because-of-new-advanced-technology-in-the-future-what-should-I-do

I will use another ill-informed answer to provide contradictory examples:In the Mulligan River area of SW Queensland grows theAustralia’s best Pituri. This plant is found throughout Australia’s desert areas but the best, the Panama Gold, grows in the Mulligan. The plant is a nicotine based narcotic, however for the best effect it has to be processed to enhance its properties.First the plant is stewed by wrapping in leaves over coals. The ash of an acacia plant, an alkaline, is added and reacts with the nicotine. After stewing the resultant mass is chewed and moulded into round balls.These balls were now about the most valuable trading item in the country. So valuable they were packaged for sale in purse like woven bags:2. Textile crafts!As well as the purse like bags below cloth was woven from flax like grasses and warm clothing made from possum skins sewn together using kangaroo sinews.3. Organised agriculture.Plants were cultivated and native fruit trees planted along migration routes. I have seen examples along the Walkers Crossing Track in SA.4. Woodcraft.Dishes, woomera, boomerang, spears all carefully made from specific timber types chosen for each purpose. The Dieri aboriginals carved wooden Toas that told a story much like a message stick.5. Permanent settlements existed in areas that had plentiful year long food supplies such as in Victoria’s Western District where stone huts were constructed and stone eel traps existed thousands of years ago.6. Astronomy. Sit in the outback one evening and you can’t miss the stars. These stars and constellations were named by indigenous peoples. The placing of stars triggered movement along an annual path to food sources.7. Tribal groups:And each group was well aware of its boundary and fought to maintain it.8. Religion was based on the belief that each creature, plant, animal or human, is part of “country” and had to be maintained according to strict rules - both environmental and social. These rules were taught and sung as “dreaming stories” and if the weren’t followed punishment would occur such as famine, death. Not unlike any other religion.9. And getting back to pituri. This product was traded all over the continent. In Outback South Australia friends of mine are from the Dieri group. Their country was the fertile valley of Cooper Creek at the junction of the Tirari, Strezlecki, Stony and Simpson Deserts. They existed in a similar way to the towns on the Silk Road. Trade routes crossed through or nearby their country from every part of the continent. They pearl shell from the Kimberly, baler shells from the Gulf, the best ochre from the Flinders Ranges, finely ground stone axes from Victoria and of course pituri from the north:This trade route extended to the far north where for at least 400 years before European settlement trade was conducted with Macassar sailors, mainly for Trepang and Sandalwood.Aboriginal Australians had all the technology required to survive in their country. Even in deserts where, despite having better technology, Europeans can die in days.Read this",UNKNOWN,Shaun,13.8K,1.2K,883.2K,2020,https://www.quora.com/Can-a-man-fly-like-Superman-with-advanced-technology

And at the same time i get a lot of fun from this sort of sport!That however wasn’t all. A bushranger reported:One bushranger…killed an Aborigine man. Then he seized the dead man’s wife. He cut off the man’s head and fastened it round the wife’s neck. Then he drove the weeping woman off to his den to be his slave.James BonwickIn 1869, the last native Tasmanian man, King Billy, died of poisoning from drinking too much alcohol. The British wanted to study his body and so, a surgeon cut off his head , skinned it and placed the skin on another skull, then sent the head back to Britain. The rest of the body was stolen from the grave with others taking his hands, feet, until there was nothing left. The last native Tasmanian woman,I will now list - as well as provide a brief description - some of the massacres that occurred on mainland Australia:Waterloo Creek massacreRufus River massacreTheSquatters and Sawyers had set up a storehouse at Pelican Creek where sailing vessels left supplies and picked up loads of red cedar. Soon after the storehouse was established provisions were left with five men and one boy who were to guard the supplies before they were redistributed to other areas. One morning at dawn the Aboriginals crept up and massacred the men. Only the boy who escaped into the bush was left to tell the tale. Later whenWord soon spread to other Europeans who became frightened. They formed a mounted posse and had a simple plan to take revenge with their muskets and pistols. They mustered all the men who could be spared and when the avenging party got together it numbered eleven. They advanced the theory that the foul deed was the work of the coastal tribe.In retaliation, the British killed 100 Bundjalung Nation tribes-people. This incident has been forever memorialized as the Evans Head massacre.In 1853-4, between 30 and 40 Bundjalung people, including men, women and children, were murdered while they slept, and many who got away were badly wounded. This event is known as the East Ballina massacre.The Richmond River massacres conclude with a mass poisoning that took place in South Ballina. During the early development of Ballina, the Arakwal South Ballina clan numbered around 200 people. During the 1860s, the clan was given poisoned flour in order to make their damper. The elders as well as the children refused to eat the damper, seeing it as a strange new food. The next morning, the Arakwal woke to see nearly 150 adults dead.The tragic history of the Aborigines at the hand of the Europeans has resulted in many problems with the Aborigines today. To provide some examples, in 2009 the ABS estimated life expectancy at 67.2 years for Indigenous men (11.5 years less than for non-Indigenous) and 72.9 years for Indigenous women (9.7 years less than for non-Indigenous).Most suffer drinking problems, and they are some of the highest consumers of drugs in Australia. This is perhaps a result of the many psychological issues that plague the indigenous Australia, not only as result of the massacres that took place, but also due to the more recent issue of theIn terms of education, Aborigines suffer many problems.In 2009 the imprisonment rate for Indigenous people was 14 times higher than that of non-Indigenous people. In 2000, Indigenous Australians were more likely per capita to be both victims of and perpetrators of reported crimes in New South Wales. In 2002, Indigenous Australians were twice as likely as non-Indigenous Australians of the same age group to be a victim of violent aggression, with 24% of Indigenous Australians reported as being a victim of violence in 2001. In 2004, Indigenous Australians were 11 times more likely to be in prison and in June 2004, 21% of prisoners in Australia were Indigenous despite only accounting for 2.8% of Australians.To answer your question, “",8 followers,Dima Ma,3.7K,2.1K,3.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Could-super-artificial-intelligences-create-any-kind-of-advanced-technology-we-can-imagine-in-the-future

Historians are still trying to figure out why China was unwilling to colonize the world since it had the resources, the manpower and the technology to make it happen.In fact, China had the shipbuilding and navigational know-how to make it across the Pacific to “discover” and colonize the Western Hemisphere and Australia/New Zealand if it felt like doing that by the time of the Tang Dynasty in the 600s AD.During the trade-friendly, sea-faring Northern and Southern Song Dynasties, China had a huge trading fleet that numbered tens of thousands of boats that could ply the South and East China Seas with ease. Overseas trade was so important, in fact, that for the only time in Chinese history the Southern Song Dynasty of the 1100s AD and 1200s AD had its capital on the ocean, in the modern-day port city of Hangzhou. (All Chinese capitals before and since have been deep inland, far away from the coast, like Beijing. Most Chinese dynasties except for the Southern Song deeply distrusted trade and the powerful, rich merchants that trade tends to foster.)The below is a model replica of a Southern Song Dynasty ship of the 1100s AD. It was quite impressive, being bigger and more technologically sophisticated than any ship being built in the world at the time. These ships had huge rudders and divided sails that efficiently tacked to the wind, and compare favorably to the Spanish galleons that the Europeans used for their exploration and colonization in the 1500s and 1600s (an example which is below the Southern Song Dynasty ship picture).China’s seafaring technology reached its apogee during the Ming Dynasty, in the early 1400s, when the Yongle Emperor recruited one of his trusted eunuchs, Zheng He, to sail the “Treasure Fleets” to demonstrate to the world the power and riches of China. The Yongle Emperor was, as far as I can tell, the only Chinese emperor since the Tang Dynasty who seriously considered maritime exploration as a primary tool to expand Chinese influence, and who put huge amounts of resources into making it happen.These “Treasure Fleets” set out from Nanjing, the Ming Dynasty capital at the time, and went throughout the Indian Ocean, some making it all the way to the East African coast. There were 7 expeditions that took place between 1405 and 1433.The below is an example of how sophisticated China’s shipbuilding technology had become. The very big boat was one of the flagships of Zheng He’s “Treasure Fleets”, which sailed from China to Indonesia to India. The much smaller boat was the European flagship that Vasco Da Gama, the Portuguese explorer, used to sail around the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa on his way to “discover” India in 1498. That flagship was at the cutting edge of European sailing technology. Just look at how massive the differences were in technological know-how.Below you can see a whole “Treasure Fleet” decked out, sailing the seas. Each fleet contained hundreds of boats, each boat with hundreds of men. In total, around 20,000 people would be on board one of these fleets, which made a fleet as populous as a contemporary city and the largest armada of its kind in the world at that time. And these fleets sailed for thousands of miles per trip. It was quite impressive. By contrast, Vasco da Gama’s fleet in 1498 contained four tiny ships and at most 170 men.China, as a result, would’ve crushed Europe if it had been competing as a colonizer in the early 1400s.Alas, that was not to happen. China after the Yongle Emperor’s death in 1424 and the last “Treasure Fleet” in 1433 turned in on itself and began to close itself off from the outside world. Subsequent Ming emperors dismantled the great ships of the “Treasure Fleets” and used the huge amounts of money devoted to maritime exploration into building the extremely expensive Great Wall, and into building and maintaining huge armies to ward off the newly powerful Mongols on the northern borders.It was a bad time for China to cut itself off, as it was during the 1600s and 1700s that Europe began to grow technologically by leaps and bounds. And it was colonization, and the continual competition it fostered among small European kingdoms (small in comparison to China, that is), that caused these technological leaps and bounds.It was the centralized nature of the historical Chinese state that led China to not explore, colonize and expand outside its immediate sphere of influence in East Asia.In the 1,400 years after China attained in the Tang Dynasty the technological, logistical and resource capabilities of carrying out long-distance colonization, there was only one period of sustained political division of warring small kingdoms similar to what characterized Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire—the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (五代十国), which ended in 979 AD when the Northern Song Dynasty was founded. This period of disunity only lasted around 90 years or so. Otherwise, all emperors who founded dynasties after the Northern Song Dynasty just took control of the previous dynasty’s powers with a rebellion or rebellions. As a result, there were no “warring states” that preceded the Yuan Dynasty, the Ming Dynasty or the Qing Dynasty.Because of a highly centralized state, any decision that happened in the imperial court either advanced or stopped projects that could lead to colonization. It’s not a great leap of logic to think that if the Yongle Emperor’s “Treasure Fleets” had continued for another 100 years after 1433, that one or two high court officials or emperors would’ve thought it would’ve been a good idea to take some land—and thus colonies—in exchange for all the money and trouble they were spending on these huge maritime expeditions.Unfortunately the Ming court turned very conservative after 1433, concentrating its energies on land-based enemies, mostly the Mongols. The Qing court after 1644 continued with that same land-based foreign policy, very much ignoring what was happening in maritime technology. And both the Ming and the Qing courts remained deeply distrustful of overseas trade, regulating and controlling it with a weird anti-outsider paranoia that kept foreigners and Chinese traders heavily monitored and restrained. It was an almost 180 degree policy turn from the openness, trade-friendliness and cosmopolitanism of the Southern Song.The Europeans, because they were so politically divided, did not face the same problem of over-centralization of exploration and colonization decisions as happened in China.Christopher Columbus is a great example of this.Columbus had this rather crazy idea that if he sailed due west from Europe, that he would eventually hit Asia on the other side. Astronomers and other learned men in various European courts countered that this was impossible since, considering the circumference of the Earth known at that time, he would have to traverse an ocean 15,000 miles wide to get to Asia. Columbus thought not, that the ocean was just a mere 3,000 miles wide and that he would have enough supplies to make it across to Asia. Neither astronomers nor Columbus, of course, knew that a huge continent lay in the way.Columbus, with his new ideas, first went to the King of Portugal to see if he could get the money for his expedition. The King conferred with his experts and advisors and turned Columbus down on precisely the grounds I gave above. After a few years, Columbus went to the King of Portugal again, and again the King turned him down—this time because Portuguese explorers had just rounded Africa and the King needed to conserve his money for expeditions to India. He then went to the courts in Genoa and Venice in Italy—at that time very rich cities capable of giving him the ships and money to sail across the Atlantic. They also turned him down. He sent his brother to the King of England to see if he could sell that court on his expedition idea. The English King turned him down. Columbus was finally down to the Spanish court of Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand. Isabella remained skeptical, but Ferdinand became intrigued. Columbus finally convinced him, he convinced his wife, and off Columbus went in 1492 with the necessary ships and money to cross the Atlantic.So Columbus had to be rejected by 5 rich and powerful monarchs before finding one who had enough faith in him to give him the money and ships he needed.And even if he had failed with the Spanish monarchs, Columbus could still appeal to and convince the King of France, the King of Scotland, the various kingdoms and rich city-states in Italy that were not Genoa and Venice, the Pope, the King of Denmark, the Holy Roman Emperor, and the various kingdoms and city-states of Germany. Columbus, in other words, had a lot of choice in finding his “venture capitalist investor” so to speak. His goal was to clinch one sale with one single monarch to be successful.Imagine doing that in China—a Columbus-like explorer with a crazy exploration idea would only have one court to go to, the Ming court. And if the emperor turned him down, that was it. End of story. There was no other recourse, there was no choice at all.So it was this hyper-centralization of the historical Chinese state that strangled what little appetite there was for exploration and subsequent colonization among the Chinese.",44 followers,Stefan Hill,890,2.2K,5.2M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Could-super-artificial-intelligences-create-any-kind-of-advanced-technology-we-can-imagine-in-the-future

One of the most famous is aspirin. First Nations people taught Europeans how to cure and prevent scurvy.

It became the new standard in this ‘new’ land. The common European design layout of cities and towns were rarer in America.The following were used about 1000 years before Europeans, and about 600 years before the Mediterranean countries: ‘zero’, advanced mathematics, astronomy, ‘farmers almanac’, anesthesia for surgery.Some of my other answers are more detailed, but I’m trying to not let my answers get too long and boring. I’m guilty of writing a little too much, sometimes!Update: I can’t believe I put ‘astrology’ instead of ‘astronomy’, lol, it was late by the time I got everyone to bed and I was already exhausted so I didn’t notice, but I fixed it! Ancient South Americans mapped the stars to an incredible level that it took a very long time for the European and Mediterranean countries to catch up to!The potatoes were cultivated more than 4,000 years ago on the Andes mountains. Archeologists found hundreds upon hundreds of little plots of land all over the mountain range. These plots of land were arranged in such a way that they were used to develop crops of potatoes at different heights, different needs for sun, different needs for water, different soils, etc. The Andes mountains contain tropical zones, dry zones, and wet zones. The ancient South American Native people used all the factors you can think of to develop different types of potatoes. Today they grow over 3,800 different types of potatoes, while the US only grows 250 different varieties today.When the Europeans came over, they chose the kinds of potatoes that would grow best in their home countries; Ireland, for example, became most notable for their potatoes, and potatoes enabled people to survive the threat of starvation during the World Wars. My adopted Dutch ‘Opa’ told us stories of the war, and I remember the great respect he had for the humble potato. He tried to teach us how to peel a potato so thin that when you took the peel and bent it between your fingers it wouldn’t ‘snap’. I’m sure many of you who had family in Europe during the war have similar family stories.Corn was developed in like fashion. There was corn that would grow best in desert-like conditions; these were developed to have a much shorter stalk, than corn that is grown in better water and soil conditions. The ancient South American people valued variety. Potatoes and corn came in many different colors, some were developed for fodder, but most were for human consumption. Perhaps this development of the potato and corn enabled and sustained those huge ancient empires we learn about in our history books!Long strand cotton grew in the Americas. In Europe, only short strand cotton was accessible, from India and the Near East, and was only good to be used as padding for chain mail. Long strand cotton from the Americas grew as much as 2 1/2 inches long and could be woven into cloth. After having everything, even your underwear spun from wool it must have been a nice change! Of course, if you were a rich noble, your clothing was woven of silk or linen.There I go again, rambling on and on when I said I wouldn’t, lol, but ancient American history and Native history is so exciting, and undervalued, and quite frankly, not accurately taught. We really aren’t motivated to learn the truth. As European descendants ( I am half First Nations and half European so I owe a debt to each), we are so much more comfortable believing that we came to the Americas, and ‘civilized’ them! I’ve even seen such ridiculous comments as ‘they are lucky we came along to save the Native people from each other. They would have killed each other off’. There’s a lot of denial regarding murderous European history; the millions upon millions murdered by the Germans and the Japanese during the ‘Wars’, or the million of Irish poor starved to death by their own Nobility, when they could have rerouted food to their own people.

Mainland Aboriginal and Tasmanian Aboriginal people didn't cultivate crops in an agrarian way but more so in a slash and burn way. Using the firestick not only enabled controlled bush burning but also allowed for particular seeds to germinate and then some complex methods of getting to them e.g. digging for yams or detoxifying them e.g. Zamia Palm seeds. Note: Torres Strait Islander TSI people did cultivate crops in a more defined way which was the basis of the abolition of Terra Nullius = Australia “uninhabited “ by the late great TSI Leader Eddie Kioki Mabo.Secondly. Aboriginal people had an abundance of protein from various marsupials and fish and shellfish. Their cycle of migration followed the availability of these foods and they went from one place of plenty to another.It is true that they had no carbohydrate staple like wheat, rice or potatoes. In place of protein staples such as sheep or cattle they had kangaroo, echidna, bush turkey all grassland protein staples and dugong and fish speared or caught in traps or dams. Some types of yams, flour and bush foods were gathered seasonally and eaten or buried and stored for later.Thirdly. For reasons related to the above Aboriginal people had very complex family and clan groups and groupings that ensured genetic diversity in the worlds most isolated and enduring gene pool. This also led to oral traditions that could recall geological timescales of 10,000 years ago or more.Fourthly. Aboriginal society had a lot of mock battles and coming of age ceremonies and initiations as well as some occasional limited clan warfare. Perhaps the interclan moiety marriages of “skin groups” and a patriarchal and matriarchal set of customs, law, lore, medicine, and native title minimised the bloodletting common to all other foundation peoples of the earth.Fifthly and most crucially. It would appear that Aboriginal community groups and society had a combination of “no political leaders” and only task/role leaders. As with some African social groups they appear to have been ancephalous - without a head or appointed King or Leader. Others say that there was power sharing and many sets of customs and manners shared between men's business elders, women's business leaders, Mabans-Featherfoots-Healers and young men and young women coming of age leaders.From the earliest colonisation to today this perceived lack of leadership by whitefellas is seen as a fault rather than a blessing. You see, it could be argued that Aboriginal society advanced in terms of art, language, culture, sharing and story telling while other foundation peoples of the earth had warfare, disease from urbanisation, famine from reliance on stored food crops, and rigid power structures kept in place by lifelong warrior castes.Technology therefore had to be the difference to survive or get ahead in such trying conditions and circumstances. Meanwhile…across the ocean in the Great Southern Land the Indigenous peoples lived without warfare or hunger until British Possession (and Occupation - as it was rightly called in South Australia) chipped at, then smashed, that away.",0 followers,Claire Jordan,971,45.6K,295.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Could-super-artificial-intelligences-create-any-kind-of-advanced-technology-we-can-imagine-in-the-future

There were Native Americans living in permanent homes all over both continents, in some cases in what we would call “cities.” There were political entities and even confederations that were quite permanent. If you include South America, you will find expansive empires with many of the governmental services we expect from our leaders today.
