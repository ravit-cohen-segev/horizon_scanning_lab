What's the point in accumulating wealth if we don't have the health to enjoy it?“Previous studies have found that as many as a third of Americans are lonely, and that 18% of UK adults felt lonely “always” or “often” (pdf). The latest research, which collated studies in two meta-analyses, connected the issue of isolation to health and specifically to premature death.A second meta-analysis took in 70 studies, representing 3.4 million people from the US, Europe, Asia, and Australia. It found that the effect of isolation, loneliness, and living alone had an effect on the risk of dying younger equal to that of obesity.”“With an increasing aging population, the effect on public health is only anticipated to increase. Indeed, many nations around the world now suggest we are facing a ‘loneliness epidemic,’” Holt-Lunstad said in a press release. The research is forthcoming in the journal American Psychologist. Holt-Lunstad also presented her findings (pdf) to the US Senate Aging Committee in April 2017.Such “epidemics,” while not confined to rich countries, are linked to prominent features of affluent culture: longer life expectancy, decreasing marriage rates, people having fewer children, more people getting divorced, and more people living alone.”This ""epidemic"" is also growing in other individualistic countries such as UK, Scandinavian countries and Australia:“The research highlights the impact of loneliness on Australians’ mental health. Lonely Australians, when compared with their less lonely counterparts, report higher social anxiety and depression, poorer psychological health, lower quality of life, and fewer meaningful relationships and social interactions. Loneliness increases a person’s odds of future depression by 15% and social anxiety symptoms by 13%. This fits with previous research, including a study of more than 1,000 Americans which found lonelier people reported more severe social anxiety, depression and paranoia when followed up after three months.The symptoms aren’t just psychological: Australians with problematic levels of loneliness are more likely to have more headaches, stomach problems, and physical pain than those who are less lonely. This is not surprising as loneliness is associated with increased inflammatory responses”But what's the correlation of loneliness with individualism/collectivistic cultures?“They were surprised to find that there was a direct correlation between the two. The more individualistic the country, the higher the levels of depression.Britain topped the list of the most individualistic country in the world, just ahead of the USA, Australia and the rest of western Europe, based on research by the Dutch psychologist Geert Hofstede.”This all makes sense because the very notion of individualism goes against normal functioning of our brains. Our brains have evolved to function well with adequate production of neurotransmitters/modulator Serotonin, which is designed to occur within emphatic relationships. Take the relationships away, and problems ensue. Daniel Goleman has popularised the idea that the production of certain mirror neurons makes possible altruistic behaviour beneficial to social cohesion.Another issue of American individualism is that it frames social challenges as issues of only individual choices while overlooking the effects of social policies and environmental structures that affects entire communities.For instance, talking about equity, the dominant narrative in America is that economic success and failures are tied to personal choice and determination. When thinking this way, people assume that the playing field is already level and that being poor is the result of bad choices. This view reduces public support to address economic policies, legal systems, institutional racism, and other factors that contribute to economic inequality and health disparities. It's the same reason why majority do not see racism as a systemic or structural problem, but rather as something that lies within individual people. That view obstructs the implementation of effective reforms to address inequity.In short, the ""self made"" man is a myth but individualism refuses to acknowledge this.Many individualists use the ""survival of the fittest"" argument to justify their lack of empathy for people unfortunate than them whenever they seek help.""Starving to death? it's only your fault why you can't become rich, let nature take its course and take your weak genes out of the gene pool"" - without knowing the outer influences that might have kept him in his state of poverty.""Can't attract a partner? You have weak genes, so let nature take its course and cleanse your genes out of existence"" - without realizing outer influences such as different beauty standards, racism can affect one’s success.The thing is, We are no longer savages and should become civilized, which includes helping all people reach prosperity, not just the few lucky ones with inherited genes or wealth for success in capitalism. With Automation set to eliminate jobs, there will be no other option than Collectivism. To deny, or fight it is savagery and stupidity.So as a progressive society, we should strive to maintain a healthy balance between individualism and collectivism. It's okay to love yourself, but most importantly, let's encourage people to love everyone irrespective of differences for the collective good of society.","246,859 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-root-causes-that-bring-emerging-technologies-and-what-impact-do-they-have-on-individuals-society-and-the-environment

2,"Technology, emerging or not, is a tool so achieves nothing on its own. The future of humanity will be decided by how humanity uses its technology, which will be decisions made by people living in a collapsing society, so whose understanding is shrivelling by the day. This is because civilization is the blossoming then shrivelling of human understanding.","246,859 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-positive-and-negative-impacts-of-emerging-technologies-on-individuals-society-and-the-environment

4,"Emerging technologies are found in a variety of ways. Sometimes they are developed in response to a specific need, while others result from serendipity or chance. New technologies are often discovered through research and development (R&D). Scientists and engineers spend years exploring different possibilities and testing different hypotheses in search of new and better ways to do things. Some technologies are also discovered through commercial applications.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-root-causes-that-bring-emerging-technologies-and-what-impact-do-they-have-on-individuals-society-and-the-environment
5,"Some things do have impact on ethics in our society. Specially when an elder is told to change the way they are thinking, it becomes even more difficult. Say for example, you have ABS in a car, which helps prevent wheels from locking. Here in this case, elders will think: “We had that skill and we did not need anything like that, you all don’t know how to stop a car in a tricky situation like that”. So here there is an impact on ethics. This is a very small example, there are others too.","246,859 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-root-causes-that-bring-emerging-technologies-and-what-impact-do-they-have-on-individuals-society-and-the-environment
6,"Zero impact I would say. Ethics is not a slave to technology. Ethics is not a set of rules which become redundant due to technology. Infact ethics is a higher ground on which everything stands. For example- the debate on ethical practices in development of future technology. Ethics is the wheel on which the vehicle of technology would run not vice-versa.Ethics does not mean cultural rules, ignorant beliefs or a closed mind set. It's a larger perspective of fructifying the best for everybody involved.",78 followers,Rajan Singh,1K,360,25.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-positive-and-negative-impacts-of-emerging-technologies-on-individuals-society-and-the-environment
