2,"Some centuries after our time, humanity discovered a form of FTL that was rickety and dangerous.

It wasn’t incredibly fast (in terms of traveling the universe), but fast enough to allow ships to colonize a good portion of the galaxy over the next nine millennia (I’d put it on the order of a 2000c). Along the way, humanity became more and more technologically advanced. In the intervening time-span, people created AI but kept them under their control. They build machine servants and machines to build machines. Then both humanity and technology plateaued. The species became decadent and stagnant.(Huh … maybe Herbert was on to something)If you follow the Prequels (I do, semi-loosely … though I hate them), then a group of idealistic people saw this stagnation and decided to do something about it. They secreted themselves on a planet and built cyborg bodies. They used these to topple the old order and enslave mankind. On the outskirts, a bunch of humans began resisting them and formed a league. This resistance erupted into a war, and the war waged for many generations. During that war, one of the cyborg overlords (ugh … “Cymeks”) accidentally released a source code which quickly became sentient and absorbed all computing power on a planet.That AI overlord then turned around and enslaved the cyborgs. It then crafted a plan to enslave humanity and either drive the species into extinction or keep them as pets. But it could not escape one aspect of its source code: a desire to preserve the cyborg humans, but it did force them to work for him/it. The humans on the outskirts resisted and developed techniques for opposing the inhuman monsters. This resistance steadily increased in its viciousness and even justified the “anti-technology” portion of humanity (the League) exterminating entire planets with humans on them. (This last fact is from the original Dune series; the Butlerians were also genocidal too)During that great war, a family rose up —the Butlers— who unified the masses and championed the cause. Along the way, humans began experimenting with drugs and techniques for improving the human mind and body. A small band of colonists discovered Dune and then the Spice, Melange. Another group of scientists discovered the idea of “Folding” Space, for jumping instantly from one place to another, a huge advantage over the machines. Using those specialized humans, and some old cyborgs who defected, the human resistance finally began winning. They fought brutality with brutality and utterly incinerated planet surfaces and they burned through system after system.One of the final battles vaporized the surface of the Earth, rendering it uninhabitable and the old planets of humanity were slowly wiped out of existence. The war eventually turned totally to the human’s favor due to the Fold Space system and the usage of the spice to enhance human thinking, allowing for just enough prescience to guide ships to their destination safely. This advantage pushed the machine minds to the breaking point and the last remnants of the AIs gathered around a planet called Corrin for their last stand. There, the supreme commander —an Atreides nobleman— was in the heat of battle and had to banish a Harkonnen noble/military leader for what the Atreides saw as cowardice. This began the 10,000 year rift between those two great houses.The leader of the Butler House (the family that acted as spiritual leaders of the resistance) were there at the end when the last remnants of the “Thinking Machines” were finally destroyed. In celebration for this victory, the Butlers changed their names to Corrino, named after the planet where humanity vanquished the machines. In honor of their role in the Butlerian Jihad (named after them as well), the leader of the family was crowned the emperor of the universe and given the royal planet of Salusa Secundus. The Atreides, humble in his victory but wanting a place to call his own, was given the green world of Caladan to form his great house to rule as aSome time after the Butlerian Jihad began to wind down, the fires still smoldered. The Jihad then banned all potentially thinking machines, even ones humans needed to travel the universe, even ones that kept humanity safe. It also hunted humans who harbored any sentiment for machines to make their lives easier and became a galaxy spanning witch hunt which continued to burn for decades even while the collection of human worlds slowly gelled into the pattern that would endure for millennia.In honor of the planet that spawned the human diaspora, the remnants of the Jihadists gathered on an island on “Old Earth” and hashed out what order they wanted to form for the species. In their hauteur and haste, they assembled a pan-theistic religious doctrine called the Orange Catholic Bible, an agnostic-ish collection of religious and ideological beliefs that could fit most religious beliefs but still assert rules on how humanity should behave. Most people found it to be appalling —to create a religious book so casually— but over time it began to gather believers and with the force of law, it fell into pan-galactic use. In it, the prime rule was: “Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind.” It was more broadly interpreted as: “No technology that has even the slightest potential to replicate conscious thoughts.” No computers whatsoever.From that great conference, humans also formed the government and social structures that would lock human beings into its pattern for the next ten millennia. Since machines were barred from replacing humans, the Great Convention called for the forming of the Great Schools that allowed people to fill those voids:There were other schools, but these were the big ones.Some time after all this settled and the Great Convention’s rules began to build the structures of government, the Imperium solidified around the Emperor of the Known Universe, a Corrino who controlled half of the wealth of Dune —the sole source of the geriatric life-extending Spice Melange— and had half of the military might of humanity. On the other side, were the collection of great houses, the million or so fertile planets capable of supporting human life spread (what I estimate was, around the Local Group). The Imperium slowly admitted new worlds as lesser houses were awarded a planet. This happened slowly over time since Fold Space allowed for expansion out of the galaxy and across the cosmos. Together, all the great houses sat in a legislature called theThe wealth of the Imperium was controlled by a company called calledAbove all that, the Sisterhood kept the deepest secrets of all. Using the Spice Melange, they’d unlocked all the ancestral memories (on the feminine side) for their peak-trained Reverend Mothers. Using that knowledge and wisdom, they saw a pattern and predicted that this feudal system wouldn’t work in preventing the imminent destruction of humanity. They decided that they’d need to usurp control of the universe, but not for many millennia. So they crafted a plan to slowly capture random mutations in the human population and combine them —one day, long into the future— in one human being who would free humanity from stagnation. In preparation for this, they began engineering religions that they tailor made for worlds that planted seeds of expectation for this super being. On the planet Arrakis —Dune— the band of Zensuni wanderers, once slaves millennia before but now the Fremen, accepted this religion of a messiah and slowly began to unlock secrets of their own that would unravel plans millennia down the road.Sometime in the first millennium after this pattern emerged, a Great House had a conflict with the Emperor of the Known Universe. In a fit of rage, they conducted a sneak attack on the home world of the Emperor on Salusa Secundus — a lush, green world. In the attack, a sufficient number of nukes were dropped on the world to totally annihilate the entire surface and turn it into a post-apocalyptic hellhole. In keeping with the Great Convention’s proscription against using atomics against human worlds, that rogue house’s world was annihilated as a punishment, using a barrage of nuclear weapons reserved by the rest of the Great Houses. That house’s name was struck from the history books and its few noble survivors were accepted by the Spacing Guild and secreted away on a planet known ONLY to the Guild for rogue houses (thus went the legend), never to be heard from again. Thereafter, Imperial home world was moved to the ringed planet of Kaitain where it remained until it was moved to Arrakis by Paul Atreides in the events of “Dune”, over 10,000 years after the Butlerian Jihad (or >20,000 years from now).","29,977 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,1.8K,7.7K,250M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-transhuman-agenda

This is referred to in the DE as 'The Golden Age of Invention' and is placed roughly 20,000 years Before Guild (BG). The events ofWe can surmise that the two nations driving expansion into outer space are the USA and Russia/Soviet Union. We can surmise this because theAs an interesting aside, people in the Duniverse, even historians, tend to refer to nations from our times as 'Great Houses', indicating humanity still approximates distant cultural institutions as best they can according to the precepts of their times, though most of us would consider our political system far removed from feudalism.After the start of the expansionist movement humanity discovered some form of FTL travel that is only roughly described by FH (this may indicate that FH didn't have enough physics to bullshit us, or that the people at the time of the novels have lost exactly how it worked). This method of travel wasAt some point a man (or perhaps school) named Holzmann discovered something about the nature of space at the subatomic level, and he enumerated three 'effects' that could be generated by the application of his principles. These are somehow vibrational in nature (alluding to string theory, perhaps?) and one nullifies gravity (allowing suspensions vis-a-vis glowglobes), the second nullifies and/or amplifies force (allowing for shields which deflect fast weapon strikes and which result in tremendous explosions when the focused power of lasers are trained on them) and the third nullifiesSometime in these murky millennia the sandtrout were engineered or found on a new planet and moved to a garden world that would eventually become Dune. The sandworms areAs crude as their space travel was, humans utterly relied on incredibly advanced computers to navigate and administrate their systems. Eventually humanity gave rise to ASI(s) - Artificial Super Intelligence(s) - and for the most part these seem to have been prevented from independent action somehow. If these ASIs were conscious or not is not explicated, but eventually at least two gained self-awareness and escaped their source code constraints. After this point humanity effectively became the pets/servants/slaves of the rampant ASIs. This led to a generations long conflict between ASI and humanity called, somewhat misleadingly, the Butlerian Jihad.At the end of the Jihad almost all thinking machines were eradicated and most human planets were organized along strict military, authoritarian lines, with clear divisions in hierarchy. This is what leads to the Imperial-feudal structure of society during Dune. The division of power and spheres of influence ended up as follows:CHOAM is a trade group of producers and merchants made up of all kinds of people, and has a kind of de facto independence.In addition, humanity produced the Orange Catholic Bible, which basically exists to validate the galactic power structure and tell people not to build thinking machines ('Thou shalt not build a machine in the likeness of the human mind'). Mentat schools arose to replace the processing capabilities of computers with superadvanced human intellects. Pseudo-religious-political organizations like the Bene Gesserit and the Tleilaxu and the Ginaz school filled niches left by the absence of advanced computers or their structuring capabilities. That first one starts a breeding program in the religious belief that a male savior (basically genetic perfection) can be produced and used by them.Key to all this is spice consumption, necessary for getting through space safely, extending life, raising intellect and developing human physical potential. Which means Dune is important to Emperor, Guild and commoner.Further notes:",152 followers,Alex Mann,3.3K,2K,102.8M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-transhuman-agenda

The invasion costs sixty years worth of income from the planet and it's the single richest place in the Empire. Artredis weren't lightly guarded, they were attacked by an overwhelming force that knew their positions and strength exactly, so they never stood a chance.The movie compressed that into a relatively lightly guarded palace that was quickly defeated by the attack.

Each action scene is easy to follow, thrilling, and a visual treat.Denis Villeneuve is miles beyond exceptional as a director. He is truly the best director working today with prior movies like Sicario, Prisoners, Blade Runner 2049, and Arrival. I would say Dune is his best work yet. It’s no small feat to adapt a book as complex as Dune to the “silver screen” so skillfully.Adding to the visuals is the music of Hans Zimmer which is at its best maybe ever. The orchestra swells as the scene plays out, giving you goosebumps and drawing you into the moment. Each moment of the movie- from the dark to the light are perfectly accompanied by perhaps the best soundtrack since the original Star Wars films.The characters were fantastic in this movie. You have the young and somewhat lost Paul played by Timothee Chalamet, the hardened Gurney played by Josh Brolin, the loyal Duncan played by Jason Momoa, and the deformed monster Baron Harkonnen played by Stellen Skarsgard. Everyone delivers a top-tier performance.Now the story is good. I worried that the pure scope of Dune lore would be too much. I feared the film would either ignore most of the lore or cram too much of it in making the film clumsy. Somehow, neither happens. Dune includes all the important lore bits that make it so fantastic and yet it feels natural and real.There are no holes in the story at all nor are there any moments that make you think “what?”. Everything fits nicely and the story itself is very engaging.There is 1 issue- this is part 1 of 2 and it feels like it. Instead of being like the Avengers and making each movie feel like a complete film and also a part of a large series- this movie very much is part 1 of multiple parts.The film ends with a cliffhanger and virtually nothing resolved. This is in an effort to make sure no lore is missed or forgotten and that the movie follows the book. I personally like this choice.Part 2 could be one of the greatest films ever made and I hope it is. However, part 2 is not greenlit so if there is never a part 2- this movie is a flop.",4 followers,Dan Bradbury,758,21.7K,235.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-Dunes-background-lore

The Quality of Automation today is entirely human programmed & synchronized albeit through very innovative algorithms from Amazon Warehouse Logistic Robots to Google Searches.So either AI development is in very high spheres like Defence or still in Research stage which is why Common man still hasnt “Experienced AI”However i believe in Market ForcesRight now China has a huge demand for Commercial AIIntelligent programs that can shape up Logistics, Distribution Routes, Prioritize Construction Operations, Step up low cost manufacturing as human beings evolve economically, Transcend patterns at astonishing speeds and in biotechnology areasPlus autonomous vehiclesThis means stuff like Quantum Computing and AISince there is a huge demand, there will definitely be innovation at a much much faster levelMeanwhile the West doesnt have the hungry Demand for AI. They dont have the populace or the need for step cost cutting manufacture. They dont need logistics or distribution routes.Their demand will always be at the highest level of Defence or Space which can never be commercializedIts why despite US and German cameras being so top notch, they are entirely used for Defence or Space while most Americans flock to Canon,Nikon, Olympus or Sony brands.So since there is lesser Demand, there will be Innovation at a slower levelThis is only for Commercial AI where Common man gets introduced to AINot AI used for Defence, Space etc where US will prioritize and continue to show more focus and growth.Thus in the next 10 years or so i believeChina will surge ahead of the world in Commercial AIChina would perhaps be Second or third in Defence or Space related AI where it will be US, S.Korea and then ChinaThats what Laws of Demand say and Demand is God.",0 followers,Mike Bell,4.7K,122,274.3K,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-transhuman-agenda

No pollution, clean streets, no beggars/homeless, wide variety of independent shops and food outlets, moderate traffic, !!electric motorcycles!!, well run places to stay, delicious food (so much better than UK ‘Chinese takeaway), very little sexualisation of women (either clothes or depiction in adverts), everyone with a 15cm smartphone, great internet access, people hiring bikes with an app on their phone.Where shall I stop?Once the truth starts to filter to the general population, respect will grow.Of course there will be resistance. We in the West cannot bear the idea that our version of ‘democracy’ is not the best for everyone. It will take us a while to understand the role of the Chinese Communist party and the benefits of a system like that.Addition 1: We are told that China suppresses religion - but in Dali there is a three-sources temple in the town - Confucius, Tao, Buddha - and the Confucius Centre in the centre has been completely rebuilt in the last few years. On the outskirts there is the Guan Yin temple. Ordinary folk out shopping come in all the time to say a prayer etc. I sensed their genuinely spiritual experience.Addition 2: I also realised why China was advancing so fast - they work steadily! Wherever I looked people seemed to be just ‘getting on with it’. I sensed this was a deep habit, centuries old in the population.Addition 3: Dancing in the park! Amazing. Just a group of people with a music-system doing musical Tai Chi. Another small group playing instruments in the park. So unselfconscious. Just enjoying themselves.Update 2020: My prediction is probably now wrong. A dark cloud has descended over China/West relations. There is a growing China-phobia in the UK. People with no knowledge of China, who, when I wrote this post 2 years ago, would have little to say about China, now are experts making cold-war-like statements.I responded recently to a very good article by a Harvard professor warning against a new cold-war with China. I was immediately vilified by comment writers (as was the author), accusing me of being a Chinese troll, or perhaps the author of the article. Very disturbing.The main driving force for this is that western commentators blame China for their COVID19 deaths because of the delay in reporting in Dec 2019. The very slow and inadequate responses by the UK, US and now Brazil and all the consequent deaths are blamed in China, not on the inadequate response.China is not perfect, but the inaccurate picture I reported 2 years ago has been transformed into something more dangerous.",UNKNOWN,Bill Yu Liao (廖彧),650,138,1.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-space-time-made-of-1

It can do the job, much faster and perfectly.In manufacturing, research and development, and technology India doesn't even stand a chance against China. Comparing the two is preposterous. The pathetic state of Indian manufacturing can be gauged from the fact that 69 years after independence, India can't even manufacture products as simple as earphones. Yes, even your earphones are probably manufactured in China, though they might contain a Made in India tag, to fool the Indians.Comparing the two countries would be a great injustice to China. Most of Chinese people don't want their country to be compared with India, they think of it below their dignity, the same way we think of Pakistan.

Smaller cities have buses available that will take you just about everywhere within the city and bigger cities have subways as well as buses. For going between cities and provinces, China has a high speed rail system in place that is more extensive than the American highway system! For example: I lived in a city called Nanjing in China - about 200 miles/300 km from Shanghai. I could take a high speed train from Nanjing to Shanghai in about 1.5 hours!In contrast, I took an Amtrak train from Detroit to Chicago (about 300 miles/480 km) and it took over 8 hours!Another area China wins at is public utilities. They provide electricity, water, and gas for billions of people for very affordable prices! I paid maybe a total of $20 (US) per month for all utility bills, whereas it cost me over $100 in America! Atop of that is wireless technology (which is considered a public utility in China). I paid 100 rmb ($15) monthly for 16 GB of 4G data, with 1000 texts and 500 minutes of talk (which pretty much meant unlimited everything for me). In America I pay $50 a month for my unlimited plan. Yes, the 4G is a little faster, but that may just be because I’m not trying to access the foreign web here…A third area (kinda related to the second) is how the CCP controls markets and prices so everyone can live a comfortable life.
