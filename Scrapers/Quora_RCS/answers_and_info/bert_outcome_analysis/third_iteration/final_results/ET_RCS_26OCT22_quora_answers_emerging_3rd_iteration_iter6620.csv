We do, or should do, things because they are the right things to do.So, we should do what is right, and one of the things that is right, is to try to make sure that doing what is right continues to be a selective advantage.The selective advantages of love in human beings is that it encourages a higher degree of social cooperation and, because people who love are people who can be trusted, a more efficient social cooperation not so riddled with graft and vendetta.The only way that a lack of love might conceivably be a selective advantage is if social cooperation were instituted purely by force, yet in a way that is efficient and free of cheating or vengeful violence.

4,"Evolution isn’t directed. I love the movie Waterworld, but it perpetuates a common misconception about evolution accommodating environment. In the movie, the planet is covered with water and everybody lives on boats. After generations like that, a guy is born with mutations that give him webbed feet and gills, allowing him to breathe under water.The problem, of course, is that people are no more likely to be born with fully-functional gills now than they would be if the planet were covered with water.

Your genes don’t know that the planet is covered with water, or that gills would make your life easier.That is why evolution consists of brief periods of change followed by millions of years of stasis. Evolution isn’t just drifting species all over the road. You more or less stay on the same path until something crazy happens, and if that crazy thing is beneficial, then your species might adopt that trait. Natural selection can’t create something that a species doesn’t already have. Major steps in evolution occur when some random genetic mutation gives an individual something that their species doesn’t already have.In your example, it is no more likely for a person to be born with insulated fingertips now than it was a hundred thousand years ago or it will be a hundred thousand years from now.

Humans will only evolve to become more resistant to electric shock if they have to endure life-threatening situation that most of them have to endure in their lifetime before reproductive age.

For quite a while after that, we were still just spending time surviving. Language is evolving, we’re doing the hunter gatherer thing. Our days were mostly consumed with subsistence and learning how to express abstraction. There was no such thing as abstraction before we came along. We had to invent how to talk about the future, plan, and communicate with other tribes without killing each other. There were lots of things to work out with this new hardware upstairs.Finally, we learned how to control plants on a wide scale, i.e. agriculture begins. That was about 10,000 years ago. At this point, we have an abundance of food and we don’t have to chase animals around the land all year. So, we’ve really only had 10,000 years to develop anything resembling technology. Before we had an abundance of calories, we were too busy surviving and figuring out what to Do with a brain like this before that.If you think what has happened in 10,000 years, it is almost mind blowing. Everything in history, everything that has ever been invented, written, or built was effectively done in the last 10,000 years. Wow, incredible!Last thing, it was really industrialization that led to the acceleration of technological development. You have to have machines to build new machines. “Machine shops”, where they build parts for other machines, took off. From the early part of last century on, we built a ridiculous number of machines and figured out how to use electricity as a power source. Remember, that’s only about 100 years ago. Another wow. So, in 100 years, we went from a light bulb to a computer doing billions of calculations a second (that’s on almost everybody’s desk top). We built a huge machine, stuck a few computers, and some bottled up fire in it, and flew some humans to our moon. In about 100 years.

The creature’s natural lifespan is less than a year, but species can survive decades under a rock in the desert or frozen in ice in the antarctic, get hit with a raindrop, and be up and copulating in the amount of time it takes you to put on socks. We slapped some on the outside of a spaceship for 10 minutes, and 68% of them survived (that’s a lethal dose of cold and a lethal dose of radiation and a lethal dose of nothing to breathe for pretty much everything else living).The reason I’m droning on about this microscopic marvel is that the only advantage humans have over a tardigrade is a fairly impressive brain. We have done a lot with that single evolutionary trait, but it really isn’t as unique as we like to make it out to be. Other species use tools, other species have communities, and other species haveEdit: It is wise to note that every species is equally evolved. It’s not a process with an end goal in mind, it’s ongoing and random. Traits can come and go, some are beneficial, some are not, some are specialized, others are pretty general. Species that survive something like a mass extinction tend to be highly flexible in the biomes they can live in, and it’s a trait we see in many species across the world today. Those species that can survive the largest range of calamities have the best chances at survival, and that’s probably the highest evolutionary trait, if you want to place them in a completely subjective hierarchy.Can you imagine how many species of single celled organisms died off before the first multicellular organism came into being?
