Supposedly, this technology was used to help cripple the Iraqi air defense system when the US invaded.This was important to Cisco because we were working in security and cryptography and the NSA was forever trying to get us to corrupt our products so they could un-encrypt foreign transmissions on the fly. One time we were required to corrupt product that had been shipped to China and it started a major debate about our fiduciary responsibility to the country or to the customer. The issue was that if you sell a security product that you know is corrupted, you are knowingly committing fraud and are liable. As the Product Manager at the time I asked the NSA if they would stand behind us (and me as I might be personally liable) in court if we were discovered. Of course the answer from the NSA was “Hell no.”We were on our own. We then entered into a long debate about how to detect Easter eggs and other corruption introduced into security products unknowingly through another vendor’s corrupted hardware. The issue was never resolved but it should be known that our security source code HAD to be provided to the NSA in order to get FIPS certification and they made certain changes to it.So to answer your question, USA military technology is advanced far beyond anyone’s knowledge to describe the extent.On the other hand, the Chinese probably know more about our technology than we do since they perpetrated the greatest security breach in history by compromising the RSA key technology used by almost everyone in the world. We only learned of it through the vigilance of Lockheed-Martin who discovered the breach accidentally.

And the US had a lead in 18 areas.

However the US never managed to upgrade it’s bomber fleet during the cold war. While the Soviet Union made more than 800 supersonic bombers the US can to this day only only has made 103 supersonic bombers of the B1 lancer type.Again the Soviet Missile technology was exceptionally good in the late cold war. theThe Soviet Union’s pilots in the 1980s also had the helmet mounted display, which is something US pilots didn’t get on the same level until early 2000s.Army:Infantry Weapons:ArtilleryUS never fielded many MRL systems. The only one ever fielded was theFor basic artillery both sides had the same technology, with the Soviets having a much greater amount of self propelled artillery with the Americans mostly having conventional towed artillery. However, Soviet SP artillery also generally had a higher rate of fire due to their autoloaders.Armour:The US fielded the best computers and electronics, later also the first to use thermal optics. The US ammo was however much slower than Soviet, and the Americans didn’t consider soviet lack of firing computers a problem, due to how fast their projectiles moved.As for the quality of soviet tanks, this is what the US had to say about some of the things i described.",6 followers,Boris Ivanov,616,10.4K,110.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-technologically-advanced-military

Finally, we had a domestic Tesla, and in 2011 Putin drove a Yo-mobil for the rolling cameras. Everything looked very bright and promising, but nothing came to fruition. No factory was built. No mass production was launched.The grand total of three Yo-mobils were manufactured. Appropriately, the king court’s jester politician Zhirinovsky bought one and managed to drive 300 miles, at which point the car refused to charge. A Mercedes Benz E-class picked him up.142 millions euro invested in the project had magically disappeared.Looks too good to be true? True.Marussia Sports CarFounded in 2007 by Nikolai Fomenko and partners, Marussia Motors set an ambitious goal of producing the first Russian racing car.They beat Yo-mobil and managed to produce forty four prototypes of varying degrees of (in)completion.Hundreds of millions of dollars went down the pipe, and in 2014 the project was shut down at a loss. The same year, Nikolai Fomenko sailed on his super-yacht into Dubai marina for the yacht-show.His super yacht was neither designed nor manufactured in Russia.Mr. Chubais, the head of Rosnano, a state venture fund, is giving Mr. Putin heads-up on how he’s blowing, sorry, spending budget moneyPlastic Logic 100 eBook ReaderThis e-book reader is based on the developments of the German company PlasticLogic. In 2011, it was on the verge of bankruptcy due to its failed product: the electronic book reader Que.But then Rusnano swooped in and the business of the PlasticLogic went uphill. Until it didn’t.Mr. Chubais paid off $50 million worth of PlasticLogic debts, and another $100 million was offered as a loan guarantee to build a plant in Zelenograd near Moscow. He sold the idea to the government that his eBook readers would be used instead of textbooks in all the schools of Russia. $700 million more were poured into the project.To cut the long story short, in 2012, the construction of the plant and the production of devices were abandoned altogether, citing economic inexpediency.Do you think Mr. Chubais got fired? It’s a rhetorical question.Prime minister Dmitry Medvedev said about YotaPhone, new Russian smartphone: “When Steve Jobs heard about YotaPhone, he was worried.”At the end of 2013, CEO of Rostec, owner of Yota Devices Ltd, ex-KGB general and Mr. Putin’s old friend, Sergei Chemezov presented the highly innovative Russian smartphone YotaPhone with two displays to Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.Observe, they always present their prototypes to the supreme leaders and not to the public.In Russia, government is your investor, your marketer, your consumer, your law, your freedom, your bank, and your career. Public doesn't count for much. They only need to be fed buckwheat and macaroni and entertained with TV fluff and parades.For some unbeknownst reason, all the smartphone components were produced in wealthy Singapore, the E-ink display was from aforementioned PlasticLogic, which explains why sale price was so high.In 2013, YotaPhone was sold for 499 euros. Grand total of 40,000 devices were sold by mid-2014.Riding on the back of their success, in 2014, Yotaphone 2 was released, and 22,760 units were sold.In 2017, Yotaphone 3 was released at the price of $450 with even fewer units sold.Hundreds of consumers await the release of the KGB general’s YotaPhone 4.Meet Boris, a man in Alyosha robot suit passing off as a robotIn December 2018, the story of a Russian cutting-edge life size robot that was the answer to Boston Dynamics’ robot, went on all the federal TV channels.During the nationall forum “Projectors” held in Yaroslavl, the life size robot Boris was showing some cool dance moves to the clapping audience.Turned out it was a human pretending to be a robot by wearing Alyosha robot suit.

You don’t need an economics degree to understand that it’s unsustainable.The only time Russia is 2nd to America is in video games and in memes. Russia is not the Soviet Union.EDIT:1. I don’t believe a subject as complicated as this can be boiled down to a single number, especially when many things doesn’t have inherent quantity, like morale. It might be useful to analyze “wars that exist in a vacuum” between two countries that only fight each other with everything they have (a good example of this from Youtube is Binkov, in which he stated his assumptions) but not real-life conflict. If those rankings are to be believed, Russia should have finished their operations in Ukraine right now because of the massive disparity in index ranking.(From globalfirepower.com, which will be my punching bag here)2. Lack of transparency of their methods. Most only mention vague ideas of accounting for logistics, economy, and other “side” factors. Just as importantly: HOW?How do you account for intangibles like willingness to fight or network of allies? Did you even count that? What about potential insurgencies that can (and often do) erupt in occupied areas? What method did you use to calculate the component indices and how did you add them up? What kind of weights do you use? What factors did you consider? Why? Why not others?50 factors sounds awfully simplistic to me, considering we’re talking about entire countries and their militaries. And this is pretty much the only description of their methodology I can get. They don’t even give what the benchmark for “perfect” is.3. In many of these rankings, the difference between Russia and China falls into the 3rd or even 4th decimal place/significant figures.In practical terms, that’s not much (compared to, say, India vs US, in which the difference is stark both in index ranking and in real-life); that’s like 2% difference. I bet with a slightly different weightage or if I account for different things, I can flip the rankings between the two countries.Why I choose China is because China has more people, bigger economy, greater pool of scientific talents, more allies (yes, really—if you think North Korea and Russia are China’s only allies, you’re living in the 1990s), and generally far more competently run than Russia (don’t believe every headline from BBC, CNN, or Fox; there’s no way China leapt from what they were in 1980s to what they are today in 2022 if they were run like Russia).","1,831 followers",Jones Averino,517,1.7K,10.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-technologically-advanced-military

We are so far ahead of the ancients that we might as well be living in an alternative fantasy world. That is what centuries and millennia of continued scientific progress do to civilisation.People who think that ancient India was more advanced than today confuse mythology and literature with science. So they keep asking questions like this:But there is absolutely no evidence for any of this. Anything that the ancients could do, we can too — and way better. We have stood on the shoulders of giants and seen much further than they could.PS","68,769 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-advanced-technology-is-not-being-used-to-the-maximum-of-its-potential
