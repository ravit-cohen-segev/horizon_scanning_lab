Going to movie and having an ice cream was a treat.For me now at the age of 66 typing this answer in the phone is an incredible privilege. Having a chance to drive and own a Lexus car is a great blessing. Live a life with out thinking pay check to pay check is grace. Having a family away from home and still be cannot to them is incredibly enriching.When some people need money to come up in life when I could help from my experience is great reward for me.I had the privilege in the lock down time to join morning meditation of Dr. Yong in you tube is owsome.

4,"Technology is expanding at an exponential rate every day.The problem is that human nature hasn’t progressed in any noticeable way in keeping up.So now what we see is, essentially, humans being provided with more deadly technology and misusing it in more destructive ways.C’est la vie . . . .",0 followers,Hatice Aslan,570,164,11.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Many-futurists-predict-futures-filled-with-very-advanced-technological-feats-but-is-there-more-of-a-chance-it-will-probably-be-just-as-mediocre-as-nowadays
5,"Maybe, maybe not. The problem is that to reverse engineer something, you need to first figure out how it’s fundamentally working, and if it’s so advanced that you have no idea what it does or how it does it, you can’t reverse engineer it.We could certainly find out what material it is made of, etc.Even more so if it’s just a component. If you were to, for example, take a 386 processor out of an old PC, and teleport it back to the late 1800’s into the lab of someone working on electrical and electronics, they wouldn’t even know how to make it “do” something.

Even if you gave them the specifications and schematics for a basic system - it would just be complete gibberish to them (they’d be able to read the English words, but not understand the functionality, because most of the ideas in that wasn’t even available at the time - never mind implemented in some hardware). There is too many technological steps for them to understand even the concept, never mind reverse engineer it.Similarly, if you were to send a piece of titanium back to the 1700s, they’d figure out “it’s a bit like iron, but much lighter and sparks different when you heat it up” - but they would have no way of actually making titanium metal, even tho’ it’s about 10th most common element in the crust of this planet. It’s quite a lot more complex than making steel, copper, tin, lead, silver, etc from “rocks”. For example, it requires completely inert gas to be melted, not just “no oxygen”, but also “no nitrogen”. And even separating air into components wasn’t really a well known subject in the 1700s. So there’s several “technology jumps” between “having titanium in metal form” and “being able to come up with the process of how to make it”.",13 followers,David Reyes,1.8K,2.9K,11.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Many-futurists-predict-futures-filled-with-very-advanced-technological-feats-but-is-there-more-of-a-chance-it-will-probably-be-just-as-mediocre-as-nowadays

7,"Possible? Hard to say. Imagine a even a 16th century genius coming across an iPhone. They would have no chance to reverse engineer such a device. A 20th century group (Einstein, Fermi) might have a chance, but it would be like the Manhattan Project - it would take years, even decades, to develop the tools needed to explore the device in detail, even though the idea of “field effects” and particle physics were at hand.Technology “not of human origin” would still (likely) have to obey the established principles of physics. But that still leaves enormous leeway in what might be encountered.It isPossible? Hard to say. Imagine a even a 16th century genius coming across an iPhone.

But that still leaves enormous leeway in what might be encountered.It is really not “human origin” (or not) that matters, as much as the degree of advanced science that was applied and represented in the device or technology that would be the obstacle. An alien, extraterrestrial race, not terribly more advanced than ourselves, would still likely understand and apply principles of electrical circuitry, and that applied heat boils water.

8,"It really would depend. If it was too far advanced, probably not. Just take a transistor for example. Take that back to say 1900. I have no doubt that they could work out what it did. But they wouldn't have a clue how to test it's composition to see what elements it's composed of, let alone how to make one. Things aren't just invented in a vacuum.

9,"It might be possible to reverse engineer the technology but if it requires some exotic item to get it to work that is not naturally available or does not exist on Earth, we might only be able to use the reverse engineered item for a short time before it is no longer functional when the exotic matter that powers the device runs out and we can no longer get the item to work.Just the manufacturing of the item components might very well make it impossible to recreate since it might rely on a series of subsystems that would all need to be back engineered just to create a working prototype.",366 followers,Brett Alder,1.1K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Many-futurists-predict-futures-filled-with-very-advanced-technological-feats-but-is-there-more-of-a-chance-it-will-probably-be-just-as-mediocre-as-nowadays

It would be much quicker since we have the knowledge, but it would require rebuilding rather the reverse engineering.I suppose it’s possible that a team with the requisite knowledge and reference materials could build a board and code something to get the processor up and working, and that could be used to rebuild the ability to make the current technology. However, that is not reverse engineering. It is highly dependent on having the right people and materials on hand.To take advantage of a fundamentally new-to-us alien technology, we’d need a full university course of instruction and quite possibly the high school and grade school materials also. Having the technology itself wouldn’t help much at all, other than as a comparison point.
