There’s no way I’m going to be employed there, as long as I have choice. Usually, though, people are pretty chill; and if it turns out that I choose other company over them, maybe they’ll enhance their compensation package so the accept rate is better in the future?In the end, nothing of it is personal in any way, it’s just business as usual.
