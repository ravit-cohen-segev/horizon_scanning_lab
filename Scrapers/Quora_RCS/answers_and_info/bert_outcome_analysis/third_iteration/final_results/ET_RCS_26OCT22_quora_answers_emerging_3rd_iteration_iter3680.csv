4,"The thing is, while the official explanation in the Thor movies has always been that Asgardians are simply millennia ahead when it comes to scientific development, that doesn’t really explain why Asgardian society is so primitive in every aspect other than technological capabilities.Their weapons and armor are designed based on laughably primitive standards - Mjolnir is an exception here, because I’m talking about the extremely medieval spears, chainmail, and shields that the guards and such seem quite fond of.

To be fair, the Asgardians themselves do seem nigh-invincible in the physical sense, so their weaponry might reflect this fact; however, on the other hand, it seems intensely foolish to challenge others with such primitive tools, and more to the point, it seems intensely unbelievable that such a godlike people would be fine with weapons that don’t at all reflect their capabilities.Their standard of living is quite obviously millions of times less advanced than their technology. Everyone is content toIt also doesn’t explain why the Asgardians refer to forces and energies as innately magical. Are the citizens of Asgard not provided with basic education on how their ungodly paradise operates? What precisely is their backup plan if literally anything goes the slightest bit wrong?And finally, Asgard is basically a flat continent floating in space. There’s a reason we never see flat planets in space: they would collapse under the force of their own gravity until they became spherical.

That for one usually means that he’s weaker.Maw proudly states that Thanos is the “most powerful being in the universe”.ConclusionI for one see no way Thanos could beat Maw in a fight which starts more than 10 meters away, but apparently even Maw proudly claims Thanos is stronger.

11,"I hear about the Asgardians using advanced technology, and that is pretty much true. While the Asgardians have much more of an intimate understanding of their mystical connections than humans do and routinely combine their mystics with their tech, that does not make Asgardians any less magical. Magic and sufficiently advanced technology could be interchangeable terms, so neither term is really wrong at all.According to how magic works in both the MCU and the Marvel comics, any being in the universe can use magic. There are different categories of magic to draw from that we see.Eldtrich/UniversI hear about the Asgardians using advanced technology, and that is pretty much true. While the Asgardians have much more of an intimate understanding of their mystical connections than humans do and routinely combine their mystics with their tech, that does not make Asgardians any less magical. Magic and sufficiently advanced technology could be interchangeable terms, so neither term is really wrong at all.According to how magic works in both the MCU and the Marvel comics, any being in the universe can use magic. There are different categories of magic to draw from that we see.Eldtrich/Universal Magic:Or…The eldtrich magic is used by harnessing energies found throughout the entire Multiverse. This is what Earth sorcerers mainly use, although any being can harness these energies through proper training and technique, such as Krugarr. Things like shields, swords, space shards, and most of the other stuff that Strange uses are harnessed from the energies of the universe. Pangborn was mentioned to even be able to passively channel dimensional energy into his legs in order to walk after his paralysis.The Asgardians also use this, I'm assuming. Sorcerers like Loki and Frigga can make illusions and pocket dimensions. Lorelei can influence the mind. Heimdall can see nigh everything and use dark magic to generate Bifrost. And I'm shooting in the dark, but my guess is that Hela was able to grow more powerful on Asgard by drawing on the energy of the realm itself. Maybe it's because Asgard is her birthplace, though I can't evenPersonal/Inborn Magic:Or…Personal magic is used by harnessing energies from within the caster themself. The immortal Iron Fist, protector of Kun Lun, sworn enemy of the Hand, uses Chi energy in order to channel it into super powerful blows. Also, I can't stop laughing at that picture of Danny Rand.Some of the Asgardians also use this, due to the Odin-Force. Odin can use magic to project energy, enchant weapons, and recharge the Odin-Force by entering the Odin-sleep. This power exists in higher concentrations with direct descendants of Asgardian royalty, which is why Thor can hold his own against Thanos, and Hela is able to lay waste to an armies worth of Einherjar. The two royals can generate their own personal energies such as lightning and magical bladesBorrowed/Dimesional MagicOr…There are also the energies that can be borrowed from powerful magical entities. The Ancient One and Kaecillius both drew power from the Dark Dimension, and thus, Dormammu himself in order to prolong their life and increase their power. Usually, these beings are powerful enough that they have magic to spare, so drawn magic is incredibly powerful. Kaecillius was able to use his new abilities to manipulate reality outside of the Mirror Dimension, but it made him a puppet to Dormmamu who could easily take his soul.So now that I've pointlessly explained the categories of magic despite the question only really asking for the Asgardians, I'll sum it up.",108 followers,Richard Mason,1.2K,1.3K,20M,2020,https://www.quora.com/In-the-MCU-Asgardians-have-extremely-super-advanced-technology-that-can-be-easily-mistaken-for-magic-but-is-still-technology-yet-Mjolnir-is-real-true-magic-supposedly-So-does-the-MCU-have-magic-or-not

22,"One morning the weekend before Halloween my 13-year-old daughter came up to me and said ""Mom, today I'm going to meet the man I will marry!""""How could you possibly know that?"" I asked this daughter (who had never been boy-crazy like her girlfriends nor ever had a boyfriend or date).""Because I've been asking and asking God who I would end up marrying, and this morning when I was praying, he told me I would meet my future husband today!"" she answered matter-of-factly.Needless to say, fear struck my heart.

I asked this daughter (who had never been boy-crazy like her girlfriends nor ever had a boyfriend or date).""Because I've been asking and asking God who I would end up marrying, and this morning when I was praying, he told me I would meet my future husband today!"" she answered matter-of-factly.Needless to say, fear struck my heart. My impressionable daughter believing this crazy idea would make for an interesting - if not scary - day! Today, I would definitely keep her close to me and keep a strict eye on her!That night I knew we had plans to take my daughter and her friends to a haunted house. I asked her if she thought she was going to marry one of her friends. She said ""No, I'm sure it will be someone totally new that I've never met before."" (Yikes, fear again.)Nothing eventful happened all day. But that evening the line waiting to go into the haunted house went down the street and around the block. The kids didn't seem to mind the long wait and goofed around in line and talked to others nearby. I kept a very close eye on my extremely attractive daughter (Come on, I AM her mom, but others think her attractive too). I suspiciously eyed every boy who talked to her!!!Finally, our group of teens got to enter. I was behind the group & directly behind my daughter. Dark, scary, fun, and long was the walk in the pitch-black, winding corridors. Suddenly a man dressed as the Grim Reaper jumped out right in front of my daughter and scared her so badly she screamed and fell backwards - on top of me and those behind me - toppling all of us over! The (now kind & sorry) Grim Reaper helped us all up, and, noting her extreme reaction of fear, he came out of character long enough to offer to sneak us out a side exit. She said 'no, its okay' and we moved on - embarrassed.That night my daughter was SO disappointed when she said ""I was so sure God told me I would meet him TODAY.""Fast forward 10 years. My daughter was the maid of honor for her best friend's wedding and gave a beautiful toast and prayer at the wedding. One of the men attending the groom was from out-of-state and took an interest in my daughter, emailing and calling her after the wedding. Eventually they engaged and married.After they were married, we were sitting around talking and the subject of haunted houses came up. My SIL said he had once helped construct one in an old grocery store building when he spent a year in our town! ""Really?"" ""Yes,"" he said, and I got to be the Grim Reaper for it and carry a fake scythe!""Comparing notes, they figured out that the exact year he had spent in our city was the year my daughter was thirteen! When asked if he remembered an incident at the haunted house with a frightened girl, he wasn't sure - as all young girls scream. But when he heard she toppled me & others over and he came out of character to offer assistance out a side exit, then he said, ""That was you?!? But that was just a little girl I offered help! Usually I pride myself in never coming out of character, but she was so scared and I worried people might have fallen and gotten hurt!"" (Lol Yes, a 13-year-old, 5-foot tall girl IS 'just a little girl' to a 19-year-old, 6 foot 2 inch young man - as it should be!)So my daughter did, indeed, meet her future husband that day!!! Amazing! Out of the mouth of Babes...!(They have been married now for almost 13 years and have 5 children.)",326 followers,Katie Delap,53.3K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/In-the-MCU-Asgardians-have-extremely-super-advanced-technology-that-can-be-easily-mistaken-for-magic-but-is-still-technology-yet-Mjolnir-is-real-true-magic-supposedly-So-does-the-MCU-have-magic-or-not

What is in those containers might be alien to us, and how those containers are filled or emptied might be different, but they will exist. As will this stuff… GNDN tubing.If is exposed to temperature differentials, it will need insulating and there are only so many ways to insulate stuff. It will be recogniseable.If you want to go anywhere in space, you’ll need either these things, shapes may vary,Or this kind of thing…Whatever there physionomy, they are obliged to use simple physics to do anything at all. It is almost certain that they will be a species that has understood logic and “failure of complexity”. It has to be simple and practical, because anything over complicated has a higher risk of failure. Too many components, much higher risk of failure.Anything that needs massive delta V to go anywhere in space is unlikely to have decorative balconies on it, even if it has a magic handwavium drive.Whatever the bizarre form of life that may exist, as soon as this life form has to manipulate material to accomplish transport, or change of environment, they have to follow basic rules af matter, which means containment.A lot of the other technology will be quite obvious as well.It may not have a handle shaped like the ones we need, but it will certainly have a recogniseable business end. If you want to make holes, your tools are going to be recogniseable as that. There is no point in putting bells and whistles on it. It’s a spade.Another thing that is going to be recogniseable, even if the immediate use is unknown, is this kind of thing…Any alien race capable of interstellar logistics, is a species that will need food of some form in order to do this. Even if the alien species has developped total conversion, there will almost certainly be waste disposal in some form or another.Most of the alien technology is likely to immediately obvious, some of it will need to be observed in action to identify its purpose, but overall, there are only so many things you can do with matter, and we’ve done most of it as humans already, so we know the concepts.We also know how to analyse and “scan”, we can point a reciever, be it radio, radiation of any kind, (including heat, sound and light) to find out what is the main energy involved.You can be 100% sure that there will be electricity in the affair, you cannot cross space in a plant grown from a magic compost heap powered by wishful thinking, there are few alternatives to basic mechanical principles and not many of them would work in space. Hydraulics in one form or another, can’t conquer worlds without it.If your alien species is hostile in intent, the technology is going to be recogniseable once it has begun its job.It’s either going to be “bang bang duck” projectile in some form or another weaponry/missiles/or it’s going to be super space death rays, (only really useful in space at close range) if not, it’s going to be microbes and viruses, which will be recogniseable by their differences to our own.As I’ve said quite often, an alien race intent on pacifying the planet won’t put boots on the ground, it will either sit in orbit and drop rocks on us, or send down a pathogen. It depends on what they want.A friendly Alien race, would sit in orbit and try to communicate, probably by the simple device called a radio. This is recogniseable technology as well. It doesn’t matter what shape your alien is, radio is radio, and using a hand held frequency scanner, you could find it soon enough, because radio needs an antenna, find the antenna and back track.In reality, aliens might be amongst us already? The technology might already be here, we might not notice because it is similar or identical.Sometimes the wrapping might change, but the basic principles have to be the same.*","284,845 followers",James Altucher,991,878,91.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/In-the-MCU-Asgardians-have-extremely-super-advanced-technology-that-can-be-easily-mistaken-for-magic-but-is-still-technology-yet-Mjolnir-is-real-true-magic-supposedly-So-does-the-MCU-have-magic-or-not

28,"We cannot make gravitational black holes in a lab, but surprisingly we can create acoustic or sonic ones and test some properties of the real ones on them.They arise in flowing liquids when perturbations of sound waves called phonons in them are slower than the speed of the flow of this fluid. This is similar to photons not being able to escape real black holes. Similarly to real black holes, there is an event horizon in acoustic ones; the boundary where the flow of liquid changes from being faster than the speed of sound to the area where it is slower than the speed of sound. Just like in natWe cannot make gravitational black holes in a lab, but surprisingly we can create acoustic or sonic ones and test some properties of the real ones on them.They arise in flowing liquids when perturbations of sound waves called phonons in them are slower than the speed of the flow of this fluid. This is similar to photons not being able to escape real black holes. Similarly to real black holes, there is an event horizon in acoustic ones; the boundary where the flow of liquid changes from being faster than the speed of sound to the area where it is slower than the speed of sound. Just like in natural black holes, phonons in perfect fluids move like gravity in spacetime.One of the notable features of black holes, Hawking Radiation, was tested this way on sound waves by using stretched-out Bose-Einstein condensate as the liquid. It had a transition within created with lasers in such a way that on one side, it flowed faster than the speed of sound, and on the other side, it flowed slower. This prevented the phonons from getting across these two layers and caused a phononic analog of photonic Hawking Radiation to appear.Furthermore, the theoretical process of energy extraction from black holes called the Penrose superradiance was also tested on sound waves. A few speakers arranged into a circle played the same sound with a small delay in each. There was a central, spinning cylinder made of sound-absorbing foam. When the cylinder spun slowly, the sound became quieter, but when it spun faster, it became louder, which means that it gained some energy from the spinning of the cylinder. In the same way, energy can be extracted from a rotating black hole by shooting photons at it.Until it ever becomes possible to create our own real microscopic black holes that would not be dangerous, their sonic versions present a fascinating opportunity to test many aspects of these mysterious objects that are otherwise too far in our Galaxy for us ever to send probes to or visit.The question was: Can we make our own black hole?",UNKNOWN,T.
