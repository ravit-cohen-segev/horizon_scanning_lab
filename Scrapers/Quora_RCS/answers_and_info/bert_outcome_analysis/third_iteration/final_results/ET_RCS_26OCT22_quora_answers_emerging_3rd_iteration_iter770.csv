If you think about it, we currently have lots of possibilities blocked by the simple fact that we lack a portable, high-density power source capable of quick re-charging. That’s what super-capacitors will solve.And I think we’re close; graphene seems to be what we need (and not only for that).",0 followers,Francisco Muñoz,9.8K,67,267.2K,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-technological-advance-that-will-be-as-historically-significant-as-man-landing-on-the-moon

Of course we had a good Wifi, cable TV, etc. I had told him before many things about ‘60s and ‘70s.

When I was a kid, we could travel between Paris and New York in three hours and a half (if you had enough money to buy a ticket). You could take a Concorde at 9am in Paris and you could land in New York at 6:30 am local time, with a flight time duration of 3.30 hours. Today, if you want to fly to New York from Paris, the average duration of your flight would be 7.30 hours. Then I told him that the Concorde was designed in the 50s and 60s and her first flight was in March 1969. Here you can see a photo of this first flight:So in the XX century, there was a plane which needed less time to fly from Europe to America than another one in the XXI (at least until now).Then I showed him another airplanes that were designed in the ‘50s and ‘60s and began to fly in ‘60s-’70s:1.- A Boeing 747 the biggest airplane in history (passengers of course) until the arrival of Airbus A380:2.- An outstanding Blackbird; one of the fastest airplanes in history:3.- The Grumman F14:And Finally the superb Saturn V rocket -- the most powerful in history until the SLS begins to fly in the following years.So in the 1960s aeronautics and space engineering lived their golden era. Why? Because NASA had something more important than technology: political will and a lot of money to spend. If the same effort would have been maintained for 50 years, we would have had a Lunar Base, and another one in Mars already.",9 followers,Andrew McGregor,516,13K,67.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-technological-advance-that-will-be-as-historically-significant-as-man-landing-on-the-moon

Fool or liar, I take offense at either.If you distrust the government that much, if you refuse to accept reality from multiple sources, if you need to feel as if you have some secret knowledge in order to feel special about yourself, you have a problem.That's why it matters.We have a terrible tendency these days in the United States to tear down heroes and achievements. Then we rewrite history to try and make villians the heroes. It is a disturbing trend.

I fully expect there to be people living in earth orbit and on or in asteroids before there are permanent bases on the moon, because the moon is at the bottom of a gravity well with no useful resources. Maybe even people living on Mars before the moon, it’s a much more interesting and useful place to go despite the distance and terrifying landing approaches.The moon is a bit like a random spot 500km from the coast in Antarctica.

All bought in a frenzy right before the price imploded.See, the problem is, no one knows it’s the “next big thing” until everyone is talking about it over cocktails.By that time the vortex is sucking in enthusiastic speculators. Just in time to evaporate their wealth.So instead of speculating in “the next big thing” the most successful investors, I know of, buy cheap what no one else wants.Warren Buffett bought a wood furniture company in the midst of the tech boom.Then he bought a railroad in the midst of the Great Recession.Many thought he was nuts. “Old senile Warren has lost it,” some derided.Yep, pretty much. Except he bought both cheap because nobody wanted them. He fixed them up and eventually made a boat load of money when other investors rediscovered them.So you can keep chasing the current “next big thing.” And getting surprised, how just after you invest, it implodes.At least you can do that until you run out of money.Or do like old senile Uncle Warren. Look for what no one wants. Buy it cheap. And wait for it to become a “sort of big thing”.Me? I like Uncle Warren.
