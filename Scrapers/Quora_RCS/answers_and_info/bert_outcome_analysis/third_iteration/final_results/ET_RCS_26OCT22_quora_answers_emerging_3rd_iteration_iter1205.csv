They’re pocket-sized, battery powered personal computers with wireless network peripherals. The last vestiges of “phone” technology is perhaps the circuit-switched voice connection, which ended with 3G cellular radio, a technology that’s end-of-lifed by most network providers, with sunsetting maybe starting soon (Verizon was going to pull the “plug” by January of 2020, but they gave it an extra year).You might also note that these pocketPhones are dead.

Well, let’s take a look at what made the smartphone so successful as a personal computer itself. There was a time, when I was a kid at least, when a computer wasThis changed fundamentally with the personal computer. The personal computer wasPocket computers started a bit before smartphones, but once you got smartphones, personal computing changed fromSo asking where smartphones are going is essentially the same thing as asking where personal computing is going. The easy answer: bigger, better, faster, more. Bigger not necessarily a matter of size of of scope — you can buy a $50 smartphone today, and you can buy a $2500 smartphone. Every year, some company or another tries out a new peripheral or two. Apple put a scanning LIDAR device in the iPhone 12 Pro… a bunch of companies made folding phones. Those that are well received get accepted by the public catch on, the others, not so much. But smartphones, like PCs before them, are mature enough that you don’t see too many big jumps in technology anymore. Which is not a bad thing given the cost of upgrades… unless you’re one of the companies making them.Nathan BrittWe see this with smartwatches, too. They do afford a bit of additional convenience over the phone. Actually, before the pandemic, I wasn’t very kind to the idea of the smartwatch: do I really need to save myself the arduous journey of my hand to my pocket. But since I got a smart watch (a simple one, the Honor Magic Watch 2), I’ve reconsidered. The smartwatch means I can answer phone calls without the “where did I leave my phone” question, I can enter those 2-way authentication codes, etc. It’s really the same thing asBut I specifically mentioned Nathan because he brought up smart glasses. We saw that with Google’s Glass project. Everyone thinks Google Glass just vanished, but in fact, no, it didn’t. The Google Glass Enterprise Edition 2 still exists, for various business uses. It’s still very much a first step. Glass gives you Android, a low resolution heads-up display at the periphery of one eye, a camera, and a small battery built into a pair of glasses. So it’s basically a very low end smartphone-like device, the main advantage being that it’s hands-free. This wasn’t ever going to be a hit, in this form, with consumers. But you have to start somewhere.The other end of the spectrum is the Microsoft HoloLens. This is a $3,500 PC for your head that, oh-by-the-way, offers full augmented reality by way of scanning lasers creating a visual overlay. And yet, even the HoloLens isn’t perfect… the eye box (the area of overlapping image) is about 52 degrees in HoloLens 2… you can fall off the edge of your AR pretty easily. But it’s a full fledged, smartphone-like computer, containing a Snapdragon 850, typical phone RAM and Flash, etc. But it’s bulky and weights over 0.5kg.And still, this one’s important because it’s not justThis would affect other products, too. When I can call up a virtual monitor tha floats wherever I want it, at sufficient resolution, my need for real monitors is greatly reduced. And the whole concept of an operating system changes. Rather than calling up apps from a menu, our most-used apps will present at virtual objects in our environment. Move from the livingroom to the kitchen, office, car, etc. and you’ll have different virtual objects, representing the ask-for apps useful in those situations. But we’ll also have more automatic apps, things that engage based on what we’re doing.And it’s quite possible that’s a large a change as the smartphone was in the first place. If not fundamentally more. Give that device five years of mainstream use and the idea of picking up a screen will look as quaint as a person typing into a big desktop computer does today (he says, typing into his big desktop computer).The problem, of course, is in the details: how do we get an advanced computer, display, radio, and battery into a thing you’re going to be willing to wear for 8–12 hours a day? How much of our regular set of smartphone peripherals migrate there? And how will society react in an era when pretty much everyone might be recording everything all the time (because we will for AR, the computer analyzing what we see, even if we don’t save it). We’ll be wearing these while driving… as long as it’s you and me driving and not robots, that makes all of those cellphone problems all the worse, because we’re already holding the device. The greater the actual value, the greater the impact on society and the number of new problems we’re likely to encounter and, maybe, decide to deal with.I do imagine at some point the major jump would be fromRead MoreVerizon 3G Network Shutdown","41,191 followers",Dave Haynie,929,6.9K,95.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/After-Android-what-comes-next-in-the-evolution-of-mobile-technology

In the last 5 years or so, it’s been slowly dawning on us that more technology, by itself, cannot be the solution, and in fact, the systems we currently have in place, while they solve some problems, create other problems that may be equally severe.While technology has certainly lifted many humans out of poverty and enriched our lives in many ways, it has also made the world increasingly complex and difficult to navigate. The rapid disruption of many established industries has meant that even the most intelligent and conscientious individuals have had to struggle to stay relevant in the modern globalized economy—while others, inundated with information to make sense of, can’t figure out how to make all the right decisions the first time, and must spend years broke, jobless, underemployed, or burnt out. We are not weaker or stupider than our ancestors, but the world is more challenging than ever before and we need to go through more trial and error than they did in order to secure a comfortable existence. Continued technological development will increase material abundance even more, but technology alone cannot solve the problem of figuring out whom to distribute resources to and getting everyone on board with how resources are distributed.The internet has enabled new modes of social interaction that the evolution of our primate brains didn’t equip us to handle. Despite the fact that we are supposed to be more connected than ever before, many people are lonely and starved of genuine positive human attention. Many people don’t belong to “tribes” or “bands” in which individuals are valued, the way our ancestors have for millennia; instead, we all compete for attention on a globalized market provided by social media, and many people are losing the competition, becoming lonely and depressed, while even those who are winning, receiving a larger share of positive attention than others, can often be anxious and insecure about maintaining their position in the status hierarchy, because they, too, often lack a close-knit social group in which people genuinely care about them. Economic growth and technological development don’t increase the ratio of available human attention to the amount of need for human attention (as both scale linearly with the number of humans alive). We have to admit that we simply don’t know how to solve this problem right now, but at any rate, it’s obvious that we can’t rely on technology to be our savior.I believe that in order to confront the major problems that we will face this century, we are going to have to look inward and confront some uncomfortable truths about human nature, understand the fact that technology can amplify both the best and the worst aspects of it, and possibly come together to make big sacrifices in order to build a world that’s truly better for all of us. This is the “reckoning” that I speak of.","106,678 followers",Brian Bi,1.1K,4.5K,48.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/After-Android-what-comes-next-in-the-evolution-of-mobile-technology
2,"Have you ever seen a personal computer from the 1970s? Here’s the Commodore PET from 1977. It came with 8K of RAM, and a tape deck for storage.The IBM Personal Computer in 1981 didn’t replace the PET with a wholly different thing. But it did make improvements, and of course, as an independent development, no compatibility between them. But that’s the default. New things replace old, they don’t cooperate with old.The Macintosh in 1984 also didn’t toss out the idea of the personal computer, but it made improvements.So did the Amiga computer.Laptop computers didn’t change the whole idea, either.Have you ever seen a personal computer from the 1970s?

New things replace old, they don’t cooperate with old.The Macintosh in 1984 also didn’t toss out the idea of the personal computer, but it made improvements.So did the Amiga computer.Laptop computers didn’t change the whole idea, either. They did come up with a name for the class of personal computer: “laptop” or, later on, “notebook.” But they were still personal computers.And 42 years later, we still have laptops, which are still personal computers.Along the way, we added another new subclass, the tablet. They’re still personal computers, but there has been a revolution along the way, even if it happened a bit at a time.Sometimes we took a branch off to make something new, but still kind of the same thing. Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) were very low performance personal computers. We didn’t want to say “PC” most of the time with these. Except Microsoft, who initially called them “Pocket PC”, because, yes, they were pocket personal computers. Still faster and more capable than that old PET 2001.Today we have these things. They’re still personal computers as well, but they also got another subclass name: smartphone. Why? Well, they are personal computers with several data radio modems, one of which uses the same kind of cellular networks that cellphones used, back when plain old cellphones were a thing.One of the reasons you know a thing is a personal computer is that it can adapt to nearly any purpose, given time. Compared to that PET 2001, your phone — I have an Honor Magic4 Pro phone here in my hand — isn’t the same thing at all. And yet, yes it is. I can chose the programs I want to run on it, I can personalize it, and it’s mine, not something owned by my company, my university, etc. It’s vastly more powerful than the PET, the IBM PC, the Macintosh, the Grid, the Amiga, etc. And yes, it can be used as a telephone (though in fact, being a European model in the USA, not so much), but that’s kind of a side effect of having a data network. In fact, in about a week, the voice networks on my cellular carrier, T-Mobile, go away forever. It’s all computer from here on, all data!I will make the claim that the Personal Computer represented a major change in the way computers are used, marking the smart of the second generation. And that smartphones did as well, being part of the third generation. Those generations were about access and portability, though, not the fact that you’re using a computer:Of course, these are just my distinctions. None of this happened all at once, but over time. The first members of a new generation weren’t terribly useful yet. I could have a typical PDA with me all the time, but it didn’t network. Networking was a completely different technological revolution that overlays all of personal computing today.So whatever comes next, it’ll probably start out kind of crappy, and it’ll be made from the personal computers we use today, but if it’s a true revolution, it’ll drive that evolution to new places. The one I have in mind is this:In short, it’s a revolution not in wide-area communications, not in computing power, not in mobility, but more than anything, a revolution in man-machine communications. That’s happened before, and in fact, continuously. The GUIs in Amiga, Macintosh, and Windows were a huge change. The GUIs in mobile devices, especially tablets and smartphones, were a predictable but important change as well, a compromise in efficiency necessary to enable mobility. Along the way we got other interfaces, like good speech recognition between machine and man.The ultimate end is to eliminate the interface, or at least as much of the interface as possible, and connect machine to our brains. I don’t know if we’re jacking in, entering enhanced AR/VR, sticking anIn fact, if we’re going the VR/AR way next, that’s already a thing.

Technology is currently one of the major driving forces behind environmental change. Technology in the broadest sense first gave us fire, which allowed our ancestors to cook their food which was an important factor in the increase in the size of their brains.

Then there was agriculture which gave us cow’s milk and the need for lactose tolerance. The less energetic lifestyle resulting from agriculture has also has allowed a reduction in the weight of our bones. Technology has reduced the amount of stress our environment puts on us, which is the opposite way to that in which evolution usually works, but if you relieve pressure there is normally a reaction. There are, for example, far more people with allergies today than there were fifty years ago. As general levels of hygiene and medical care increase, our immune system does not need to be so robust. My wife and I have three children, all adults now. The oldest has asthma and is allergic to peanuts. No-one else in the family has any allergies. They were all brought up under very similar conditions. So, why does only one have the allergies? It can’t be entirely environmental. Genetics is a possible reason.Our bodies have cooled by 0.05° Fahrenheit per decade over the past 200 years as our more sessile lifestyle has slowed our metabolic rate. This is cumulative and is passed on from one generation to the next, so it can only be evolutionary.Since we’ve only known about evolution, genetics and DNA for a few generations it is far too soon to expect too many directly observed changes. Congenital defects are less likely to be fatal today but it is possible that in the not too distant future genetic engineering could have an effect on them. It’s difficult to think of anything more artificial than genetic engineering, but it will still have an evolutionary impact.",3 followers,Kumar Saurav,2.6K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/After-Android-what-comes-next-in-the-evolution-of-mobile-technology

In politics, disruption often leads to economic collapse or war. It could be a difficult balancing act at best.The other change will come from resource contention.
