4,"To understand this, you must understand the use case of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies. When the currency system first started, how long were cowry shells used? How long was gold and silver used? How long was gold backed currency used? How long will debt based currency used? All things are bound to fail. Until we find a better value exchange than bitcoin, Bitcoin is here to stay.More info about the usecase in this article.Blockchain - Value Proposition",18 followers,Albert Brown,602,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-do-we-know-about-the-Tesla-Pi-phone
5,"""There are two bubbles: We have a stock market bubble, and we have a bond market bubble,"" said the former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan.""In our search for new stand-alone businesses, the key qualities we seek are durable competitive strengths; able and high-grade management; good returns on the net tangible assets required to operate the business; opportunities for internal growth at attractive returns; and, finally, a sensible purchase price.""There are two bubbles: We have a stock market bubble, and we have a bond market bubble,"" said the former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan.""In our search for new stand-alone businesses, the key qualities we seek are durable competitive strengths; able and high-grade management; good returns on the net tangible assets required to operate the business; opportunities for internal growth at attractive returns; and, finally, a sensible purchase price.I would also argue we have a real estate, cryptocurrency and startup bubble.Any time we find ourselves at the top of the market, we should consider taking our profits and reinvesting them in investments that are uncorrelated to broader capital markets and macroeconomic factors.Uncorrelated assets can offset your exposure to market fluctuations.

We call this an “inverted yield curve” because short-term yields pay more than long-term, which is a weird situation.This indicator is so ubiquitous, that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York publishes a monthly “recession indicator” on their website. You can access it for free:UNEMPLOYMENT RATEAnother indicator to watch is the headline unemployment rate relative to its 12-month moving average. While this is a noisy indicator, when the rate crosses above its MA, you should be checking your dashboard closely for other things which may signal a slowdown. It is easy to see that unemployment tends to tick up about 10–12 months prior to an official recession.Currently the UER looks okay. No klaxon sounding here.…And that’s all I’m gonna give you…I’d recommend doing lots of research, though, to build your own dashboard of indicators. But that is only half the equation—you’ll need a process to understand what you need to do when you get red blinky lights and klaxons going off!Only with a cohesive strategy should you put money at risk. If you don't have one, build one or pay someone who has one you like.—This is not investment advice. I am just a guy answering a question on the internet.

7,I wish I knew. People who make bets on these things and are correct make a bundle if they’re wrong they lose much as bettors do in Las Vegas. Instead of trying to time the market you could employ an investment strategy that works for you. One way to offset risk is with time. The longer your investment horizon the easier it is to ride out the bumps. More than five years let’s you invest more into equities. Maybe invest at a steady pace so during downturns your money buys more and in upturns you’re making money on what you’ve already invested and keep some cash handy to invest during extra big dI wish I knew.

Maybe invest at a steady pace so during downturns your money buys more and in upturns you’re making money on what you’ve already invested and keep some cash handy to invest during extra big downturns. Diversification helps too by asset class but too much and your investments become diluted. Be wary of some mutual funds. The fees and the way they’re treated for taxes can kill you.Good investing is difficult because it’s counterintuitive to what we feel. When the market tanks we get scared and want to sell yet that’s a great time to buy. When the market is up we what to buy more yet it might be a good time to take some profits. It was difficult but I put money into the market in 2008 and it has worked out well.Buy low and sell high sounds easier than it actually is to do.,"35,900 followers",Rafael Eliassen,9.2K,631,36.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-do-we-know-about-the-Tesla-Pi-phone
8,"One of my former executives made a great analogy of financial crises: You can compare this to an earthquake in the SF Bay area. You know it’s going to happen, but you don’t know the exact moment and you don’t know the exact magnitude.The same goes for financial crises. There is tension building in markets, but when and how it will release is uncertain.But how do we know tension is building?, you might ask.For years the central banks (FED, ECB) have been giving away free money.One of my former executives made a great analogy of financial crises: You can compare this to an earthquake in the SF Bay area.

There is tension building in markets, but when and how it will release is uncertain.But how do we know tension is building?, you might ask.For years the central banks (FED, ECB) have been giving away free money.Since the central banks cannot continue to give away free money, interest rates have to rise. This will have downward pressure on the currently issued (low rate) bonds.But it’s unlikely the stock market will benefit from this change, with the increase of interest rates corporate loans (either public traded or obtained from banks) will be more expensive as well. Money will be more expensive to obtain.Is there a safe place? Sure, there is one extremely safe investment, but it has a backdraw: cash.Timing is everything and everybody gets it wrong.But, given what we know from previous dips in the market: over time the market recovers. If you have plenty of time you can keep your investments, have the dip carve away some value and the rise up recover it.I can’t advice you, but now at least you know where the market is heading and based on your portfolio make some assessments of your actual risk.",795 followers,Patrick Bendahan,779,476,1.2M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-long-will-Bitcoin-exist
