0,"At $0.30 per watt ($300 per kilowatt) the cost of photovoltaic panels is aleady a small part of the total system. So while efficiency continues to increase the labor of putting the panels on your roof is already the bulk of the total system cost. There is no longer a reason to wait. As has been said, ""It's a no-brainer"" at this point. Does not even pay to agonize about how big a system as the marginal cost of a larger system is small once you have the permits and a company ready to do the installation.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-better-to-install-solar-energy-now-or-will-upcoming-technology-advances-make-it-worth-waiting-a-while-longer
1,"“Is there any upcoming technology… that the US could slowly evolve into, that would NOT restrict guns but would make guns safer to the individual and to our society?”Short answer: to paraphrase Jeff Cooper, gunsIf a gun is not capable of frightening amounts of damage, then it's useless as an offensive weapon, it's useless as a defensive weapon, and it's useless as deterrent.I suspect you're asking about something like Star Trek's phaser, set to “stun”, which would reliably knock any person unconscious and reliably“Is there any upcoming technology… that the US could slowly evolve into, that would NOT restrict guns but would make guns safer to the individual and to our society?”Short answer: to paraphrase Jeff Cooper, gunsIf a gun is not capable of frightening amounts of damage, then it's useless as an offensive weapon, it's useless as a defensive weapon, and it's useless as deterrent.I suspect you're asking about something like Star Trek's phaser, set to “stun”, which would reliably knock any person unconscious and reliablyEDIT: to illustrate the concept, suppose I did own a Star Trek-style phaser, and suppose I needed to use it as a deterrent — say, against several attackers coming at me. Drawing a firearm can work as a deterrent, because everyone knows that firearms can kill. But a phaser? The attackers would know that some of them would be stunned, probably painlessly, and the rest would keep coming. Should I then say “no, no, I have this here little switch set to ‘kill’ ”, and expect that to work? (Bottom line: when your life depends on deterrent, you want that thing toI'll say this, though.

5,"All the “safety” in the world is meaningless, if people don’t learn how to use them, and learn what they can do.For example, it’s often said not to use a magnum ammo in a shotgun in home defense, because of how much penetration they have. You need to be aware of not only what they do in defense, but in what they can do, so far as collateral damage goes.","28,184 followers",Murphy Barrett,4.4K,12.3K,157M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-upcoming-technology-that-the-US-could-slowly-evolve-into-that-would-NOT-restrict-guns-but-would-make-guns-safer-to-the-individual-and-to-our-society
6,"Short answer: No. Longer answer, firearms are already totally safe as long as you don’t pull the trigger with a loaded round in the chamber. Then there’s that question of, ‘safer for whom’? Hunters generally don’t plug a fellow hunter, though it has happened. No technology is going to deal with that. Target shooters on a rifle or pistol range don’t shoot fellow competitors, though I suppose that has happened. Police officers and legal gun owners have on occasion shoot the wrong person and there have been accidental discharges that have resulted in injury or death.

The point here is that none of the above is ‘on purpose’. Criminals, terrorists, lunatics and those below the age of reason misuse firearms and no technology is going to stop that. The answer is that as a society we have to deal with criminals, terrorists, lunatics and others BEFORE they do what they do… so far we haven’t done that.

You never fire at a shadow, or a sound, or a suspected presence. You shoot only when you know absolutely what you are shooting at and what is beyond it.Its also not a technology but we have to deal with gangs and criminals more effectively.Now as the majority of gun deaths are suicide and country like Japan, France and Switzerland had more suicides per 100,000 in 2018 then the United States and the United States is never the most for Suicides.

She made herself a drink, and sat at the kitchen table across from him.He stood, pointed the gun at her face, and pulled the trigger. It didn’t go off. He clicked it again, pulled the hammer and tried again, and threw the gun at her. It hit her in the forehead and she started bleeding. He stepped to the knife drawer, grabbed the first long blade he saw, shoved it into her throat, and killed her.Well, the gun didn’t work out so well.Maybe you should ask Quora how to make knives safer?",UNKNOWN,Edmond Schwab,733,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-upcoming-technology-that-the-US-could-slowly-evolve-into-that-would-NOT-restrict-guns-but-would-make-guns-safer-to-the-individual-and-to-our-society
