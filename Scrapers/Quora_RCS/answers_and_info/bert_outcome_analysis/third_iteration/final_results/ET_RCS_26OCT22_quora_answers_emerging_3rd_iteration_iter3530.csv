0,"When I had my own company, many of our engineers traveled to Europe somewhat regularly. Since they had to go right to work from the airport when they landed, they frequently requested a business class upgrade, which I usually approved. But eventually it got out of hand, and more and more of our engineers were requesting the upgrade for every trip they made.Each business class ticket was costing us around $5,600 round trip, compared to $1,200 for economy.

So I came up with an idea. I offered, in lieu of a business class upgrade, two days of hotel and rental car for the weekend before they had to be there. This way, they could fly to Europe Friday afternoon and spend the entire weekend in Europe, expenses paid, prior to reporting to work on Monday.Since most of them had already been flying to Europe on Sunday evening for a Monday morning arrival, which put them in the office by noon, they jumped at this. They began to fly Friday evening, arrive Saturday morning, and had two free nights and a rental car to explore Europe.Our $5,600 air fares came down to around $2,500 including air, hotel, and car. This became a far more popular option with my employees.","6,785 followers",Ron Wiseman,8.6K,9.7K,29.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-difficult-can-it-be-to-design-sleeper-economy-class-seats-with-so-much-advance-technology-intelligence-around
1,"First class seating, for long haul flights at least, is a lot better than economy. You can sleep properly and arrive genuinely well rested. This is particularly good for work travel.As an example, here is an Emirates economy seat. Which is a lovely economy seat:Here is Emirates first class:There is a fully reclinable seat, complimentary drinks and snacks and a higher quality of food that is served on real plates with knives and forks. You also get priority queuing and some other minor perks. Emirates also throw in a chauffeur service for free which is nice.It’s a lot better. But it’s a lot morFirst class seating, for long haul flights at least, is a lot better than economy. You can sleep properly and arrive genuinely well rested.

But it’s a lot more expensive.So, why do people book the seats? There are in my view two main groups of people:First class is not worth stretching yourself financially for.If you have a lot of air miles and want to upgrade, or if there’s a great deal - fine. But I think there are very few people saving up their pennies to splurge on the more expensive seats.",209 followers,Denis McManus,5.6K,163,526.3K,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-difficult-can-it-be-to-design-sleeper-economy-class-seats-with-so-much-advance-technology-intelligence-around
2,"Oh boy, don't even get me started on that one...I fly a lot so I go get business class upgrades on almost every flight I take. When I fly with my wife I always give her my business seat. Now, obviously, on some longer flights I like to talk to her from time to time.Now, while you would think there is no harm in walking from Economy to Business and talk to her, I was scolded and ""strongly encouraged"" to not ""come to business class"" during the flight.This not only happened once, but just about every flight!I have no idea why flight attendants are such ""watch dogs"" in this regard.

Don't get me wrong, as I fly a lot I talk to many of them, but on this matter never received an answer that made sense.Same goes for those flights were they ask you to not use the lavatories, even if it is just ahead of you, of the business class. You can't create a more artificial ""separation of classes"" than that :)",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,17.7K,996,156M,2016,https://www.quora.com/How-difficult-can-it-be-to-design-sleeper-economy-class-seats-with-so-much-advance-technology-intelligence-around

5,"First, cancer is notSecond, cancer is a case where we wish evolution and natural selection were not true. By the time a cancer is noticed it consists of, at least, a billion cells.

Thus, those billion cells are not identical. They are a population of a billion individuals, each of which is different from the others.So we give a treatment that kills 99.99% of the cancer cells. Sounds pretty good, doesn’t it? Only 1 in 10,000 cells is left alive. But that still means there areWhat oncologists have started to do is give 2 or more therapies at once. The idea is that a cell might be resistant to one, but not to the other one or more.Even so, if just 10 or so, or even just 1 cancer stem cell, survive, the cancer stands a good chance of coming back.",129 followers,Clemencia Naranjo,1.9K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-difficult-can-it-be-to-design-sleeper-economy-class-seats-with-so-much-advance-technology-intelligence-around
6,"Coal power.Coal power is undoubtedly useful. It’s cheap, easy to build, moderately easy to run. It powers our daily lives, our factories, our businesses, our electric cars that claim to be “green,” despite the fact that they’re putting out more greenhouse gases by not using solar, wind, or nuclear as much as they think they are.But it’s not justCoal power is deadly. It kills thousands of people per Terrawatt-hour. By comparison, Solar kills 440, wind about 170, and US Nuclear and Hydro tie at 0.1 deaths.Coal pollution is killing people, there is noCoal power.Coal power is undoubtedly useful.

7,"There is a popular misconception that Tesla is a highly advanced car company. Sorry but it just is not true. Tesla as a rule are using proven off the shelf technology, but are marketing it in a very effective way.Even the much hyped auto pilot has better versions produced by main stream car manufacturers.If I had to pick an advanced car company, I would suggest Mazda is up there near the top as they have produced a major step forward in engine design with their new compression ignition petrol engine. Time will tell if it is reliable and effective, but early signs are good.Based on their perforThere is a popular misconception that Tesla is a highly advanced car company.
