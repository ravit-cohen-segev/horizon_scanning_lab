I wouldn’t be so bold as to assert that no one gets this, but it seems obvious to me that the vast majority of cryptocurrencies/token sales that exist today won’t be successful in two, three, five years’ time. The best days for cryptocurrencies are ahead of us, and it will take time for bad business models to fall by the wayside, good business models to rise, scammers and incompetents to be booted from the market, etc.In fact, I think the best way to view the current cryptocurrency market is to map it to the dot-com era of the mid-to-late 90s.

The venture capitalist Fred Wilson recently posted a great piece about this:I see a lot stupidity and naivete in the cryptocurrency space right now, with people desperately trying to get on board (Fear of Missing Out), and looking for assurances from those they deem expert (“If I buy ETH right now will it be worth $5,000,000 one year from now?!?!?!?!?!”)Yes, I’m exaggerating to some extent, but there’s a lot of stupid money flying around. There are a lot of unthinking people skulking around. And those people are going to get killed in this market.And yet. The potential is huge, and a decade or two hence we’ll have several people who have made billions (tens or hundreds?) from cryptocurrencies and/or their applications.",0 followers,Glen Boston,655,71,1.7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-something-you-see-but-no-one-else-seems-to-get-when-it-comes-to-cryptocurrencies
1,"I wouldn't go as far as to claim no one has thought of this before - but I see value in cryptocurrencies more dependent on enterprise applications rather than consumer adoption.What the average Joe doesn't get though is banks hold their money using a central ledger and it is essentially numbers on a screen. The numbers go so deep when you consider derivatives market cap are estimated to be up to 10x world GDP.Bitcoins are unique numbers on a screen as well using a different system and that belief is gaining traction.

The numbers go so deep when you consider derivatives market cap are estimated to be up to 10x world GDP.Bitcoins are unique numbers on a screen as well using a different system and that belief is gaining traction. But average Joe doesn't care about the background, and adopts the easiest solution that works.Money is simply a belief system that only works because enough people believe in it. People look past religion, culture and language barriers for cash. A universal language and belief system so to speak.Before I draw off to a tangent, cryptocurrency is heavily based on people with lots of money believing in it. A majority of cryptocurrencies are held by individuals or entities with large funds. So what do those people generally do? They invest in enterprise with great potential. The current landscape overall is overhyped and oversold, but there are some decent cryptocurrencies not in the mainstream news that offer a decent enterprise solution.Also, another thing is a lot of people who actually do understand cryptocurrency and are skeptical about its potential may see short-sightedly. What we are used to right now is not necessarily indicative of the future. If the next generation skips the whole system we have now, we can have a totally have a new system set up and blockchain technology offers that sort of potential.That being said, speculation on individual cryptocurrencies can be highly risky in the short term.

2,"The advance and spread of cryptocurrencies requires ‘perfected’ security. It will do for identity what GPS did for location.

People in the cryptocurrency economy will always be on the grid, so to speak. They will be absolutely, positively identifiable in a global, distributed web.A public distributed blockchain is a perfect history. It will answer the question at the top of mind of every investigation. Who did what and when.I have no doubt that a new class of individuals will arise who understand these things and will consequently make every effort to safeguard their anonymity. These will be the people who have the ability and/or connections to read and understand computer code. The rest of us will take our chances. Just as today there are people who have been able to take advantage of PGP, the overwhelming majority of people are plagued by spam.The spam of the future will be much more insidious, and seductive.I see the great opportunity for cryptocurrencies to be able to monetize attention in new ways. It’s rather the keystone of a post-modern economic order. Those of us who grew up with Walter Cronkite and three network TV stations have seen, dare I say, the devolution of authority inherent in there now being >2000 channels of television. Social media has expanded that to the very ends of cognition.However all of these have been limited by the fairly narrow regimes of capitalization. Imagine, therefore a world in which social capital becomes actually fungible. I like to give the example of the rise of video games. I started out with pinball in the 70s, listening to the Eagles. Then through the age of Pac Man, then Mortal Combat in arcades. Next Counterstrike and now World of Warcraft, Call of Duty, et al in the living room. My kids grew up watching me play. They didn’t touch the controllers, they watched my gaming as if it were TV programming. Popular gamers developed a network called Twitch, it grew to 55 million gamers and Amazon bought it for a billion dollars. A network of people watching other people play videogames.

4,"Opportunity.Cryptocurrencies could be a large part of our economy in the next decade.A friend of mine who works for a large banks says that a lot of high net worth investors and family offices are looking to diversify their portfolio with crypto, but there is no current legal way to meet demand.I believe coinbase is going to be the vanguard of crypto over the next decade.","3,398 followers",Raymond Scottman,1.1K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-something-you-see-but-no-one-else-seems-to-get-when-it-comes-to-cryptocurrencies

7,Yes but it costs a whole lot more trying to set up a mining system on your own. The best bet would be to sign up on a mining company. They mine for you for a percentage fee from your profits. That way you're not so invested in the whole process of mining but still making profits.Should I recommend some mining companies?
