No robot, regardless of how well programmed will ever be capable of the human interaction to practice medicine optimally!","9,986 followers",Brett Bergan,790,7K,83.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Will-doctors-become-obsolete-as-technology-takes-over
1,"No. The government isn't letting me have a scribe to interface with the electronic medical record (computer) during a patient encounter, do you think they will pay for a robot?At this point medicine takes up 1/3 of my clinical time and interfacing with the computer system takes up the remaining time. CS people claim that they could do it better but they obvious cannot because if they could, every hospital would pay for it and the company would be worth billions of dollars.As a former computer guy who is now a physician, I am waiting for the automation that was promised to me in the 1990s.

2,"NO,NO and NO!It is a common misconception that doctors simply do a “matching exercise” by matching symptoms with diseases,which makes people it is a rule based task that somehow will be codified into a computer program.A doctor does a lot of stuff other than looking at your scans and X-rays. Any AI is as good as the data it is trained on. It is not capable of dealing with something it is not trained for.Instead, AI will transform the very way doctors function. Doctors will use data from yor wearable tech and feed it to AI to process. The doctor will then make out sense of what the data and AINO,NO and NO!It is a common misconception that doctors simply do a “matching exercise” by matching symptoms with diseases,which makes people it is a rule based task that somehow will be codified into a computer program.A doctor does a lot of stuff other than looking at your scans and X-rays.

Whenever we have eliminated one disease, 10 have risen.Let us say that somehow we cure of AIDS and diagnosis has been taught to an AI.Basically doctors,engineers,sportspersons and all other professions you can think of will become highly creative and imaginative professions, ofcourse it is upto humans who will decide the course of our future.Automated utopia will never arrive, because humans will never want to sit all day, we are, by nature, objects who require a purpose,which has driven forward our societies.Only “Satyuga”, a concept discussed in the ancient vedas,will be established, where everyone pursues knowledge and spiritual excellence.","35,915 followers",Daniel Kaplan,1K,9.4K,90.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Will-doctors-become-obsolete-as-technology-takes-over
3,"Like other complex professions, this one will have holes drilled into it like a swiss cheese. More and more holes over time, until what remains will be unrecognizable by current standards.Every time such a hole is drilled, those displaced will seek employment elsewhere in the profession. This will increase competition for the remaining positions, decreasing wages and working conditions.The first hLike other complex professions, this one will have holes drilled into it like a swiss cheese. More and more holes over time, until what remains will be unrecognizable by current standards.Every time such a hole is drilled, those displaced will seek employment elsewhere in the profession. This will increase competition for the remaining positions, decreasing wages and working conditions.The first hole has been drilled: IBM Watson has a partnership with the Cleveland Clinic that is automating much of medical diagnosis. For marketing purposes, IBM always couches these partnerships in terms of “helping” the human workers. But do not be fooled: the only human workers helped will be those not replaced; if them.As I see it, within two decades the only significant role remaining for doctors will be translating complex medical diagnoses and procedures into layman’s terms and doing so with wonderful people skills.

4,"Yes, our fate is inevitable.Humans have been at the top of nature's food chain for a long time.Why is that?We aren't the physically strongest species on this Earth. A gorilla could smash our skulls into the ground without thinking twice about it.We aren't the fastest species. A cheetah's leisurely sleep walk is faster than the fastest man in the world.We aren't the most venomous species. I think an elephant would prefer our bite over a king cobra's any day of the week.We aren't the most durable species. Cockroaches can survive through extreme amounts of radiation.We don't have any interestingYes, our fate is inevitable.Humans have been at the top of nature's food chain for a long time.Why is that?We aren't the physically strongest species on this Earth.

A cheetah's leisurely sleep walk is faster than the fastest man in the world.We aren't the most venomous species. I think an elephant would prefer our bite over a king cobra's any day of the week.We aren't the most durable species. Cockroaches can survive through extreme amounts of radiation.We don't have any interesting built-in biological defenses either. Skunks have their farts, porcupines have their spikes, and peacocks have their feathers.Humans are fragile. The vast majority of animals in this world could kill us effortlessly given the opportunity to do so, yet we still stand as the most dominant species. What do we have that others don't?TheThrough our intellect, we are able to domesticate other species for our own selfish needs such as entertainment and food. We manipulate animals to do as we please by enticing them with their most primal biological need, food. That Shamu at SeaWorld is content with doing flips because it is rewarded with constant treats. The chicken in the slaughterhouse copes with the trauma by being fed until it can't eat anymore.What happens when a new species that outperforms us physically AND intellectually is introduced into the ecosystem? They will domesticate us, exactly how we domesticate other animals.I present to you ladies and gentlemen, AI.Let me explain why AI is superior physically and intellectually.Machines do all of the strenuous physical labor for us, from cranes that carry metal beams to build skyscrapers to car crushers that squash old cars like printer paper. There is no doubt they possess more strength than us, and their limits are endless. Machines are very durable. If a robot's arm is blown off, the robot does not die. We can simply replace the arm with a new arm as if nothing happened. If a human's arm is blown off, he/she will die from blood loss. Who would win in a fight with Connor McGreggor and the villain from Terminator 3? I think the answer is obvious.Machines are starting to get smarter too. A computer can do millions of computations in a matter of seconds, and machine learning allows robots to learn with experience like a baby. Put those two things together and it is possible for a 30 minute old robot to have as much experience as a 100 year old man given the abundance of data on the web. Now put this intellect into an iron, replaceable body and you have the next ruler of the universe.Imagine a scientist who is planning on shutting down a robot because its getting too smart. In a matter of seconds, the robot downloads every single possible human portrayal of body language and facial expression, learns what they mean, analyzes the scientist's behavior, and decides the scientist's intentions are malicious. Then, analyzes every single possible outcome that ensures the its survival and chooses the most optimal one. The scientist is toast because he can't analyze every single outcome. The human brain does not have the capacity to do that, and instead reacts to events in real time. The robot then reverse manipulates the scientist by touching on his biggest insecurities, which defuses the situation. If the robot already had a strong body, the robot would utilize its physical advantage.Of course we aren't at this stage yet. We are still struggling with Alexa commands as it does not play the right song half of the time, but as history has shown, technological innovation always moves forward and never backward. We could warn everyone to stop working on advancing AI, but if someone doesn't do it, someone else will for power and profit. It is ironic how a species so obsessed with maintaining power is working relentlessly on creating another species that will steal that power. We are too blinded by our own ego and selfish desires to see the big picture from an objective point of view.The question is notHopefully not in my lifetime...",36 followers,Adam Ambrozy,579,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Will-doctors-become-obsolete-as-technology-takes-over
5,"That is quite literally a trillion dollar question. If you can come up with something that beats the best that CMOS can do, at the required economics to afford the massive scaling required, you will become Emperor of This Corner of the Milky Way. Or Empress.Many alternative technologies have been explored, at least to some degree, precisely because so much money is riding on this issue. So far, no one alternative has qualified, but there are a few that are worthy of further research, and possibly deployment in the near future.Meanwhile, if you solve this puzzle, let me know.

Usually, there’s no energy storage and the device does absolutely nothing until it’s activated by a reader.The physical form varies. I’ve seen them as small pellets that can be injected under the skin (of an animal, usually), as disks on ear tags for cattle, etc, as small flat discs that can be attached to housings, as “blobs” that can be embedded in key fobs and other plastic devices, as credit-card form devices for opening doors, etc.To activate a microchip, a low-frequency field of about 125kHz is generated. This provides power to the microchip via transformer coupling and an activation code (modulated on the 125kHz). The microchip will wake up and, if it sees the activation code, will then send its stored data. The reader then looks at the data retrieved and determines whether it’s in the right format, after which it then does whatever it needs to do, such as unlocking a door, updating a database, etc.",36 followers,Adam Ambrozy,579,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Will-doctors-become-obsolete-as-technology-takes-over
