RBS, Fidelity, UHG, Amex, Bank of America) don't pay this salary for a mainframe 9 years experienced person. I have only seen, Mumbai based financial services captives (JP Morgan) paying this much. However, cost of living in Mumbai is quite high.So in summary, its not easy to have this jump within 6 months time. Few things you could possibly do to have higher package in long run:Moving to management side might also help you to get good package in future but to excel in management, one has to be good on soft skills and have leadership qualities.

But of course you’re the inside guy for all of that, so why don’t you tell me what you need done and let me evaluate the best I can put there to help you cover it.CEO: …!!
