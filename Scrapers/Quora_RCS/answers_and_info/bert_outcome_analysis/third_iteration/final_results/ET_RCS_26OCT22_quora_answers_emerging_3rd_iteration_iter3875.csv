Because people noticed thatThere is a saying, a secret can be kept between three people when two of them are dead.That means that if there were such a secret place, then eventually one or more, more likely more than one, of those in on the secret, will talk.Since no one has talked in the media about that kind of secret or any other kind of secret society, shadow government, or what have you, then it is most likely there is no such thing. Even the Manhattan Project that developed the atomic bomb during world war 2, locked down from all sides, the most secret effort ever known, had a few leaks. Because people noticed that everything was going in but, nothing ever came out, not people and not even garbage. There is always a clue of some sort.A conspiracy similar to how the Manhatten project was organized is portrayed in the last part of the movie based on Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand. The elite minds of the world were slowly spirited away to a hidden part of the world to develop fantastic motors and other wonders. That begs the question, “What kind of life those elites would have if everything had to be imported by way of a one way journey into that place they lived? The garbage alone would have to be something hard to deal with, especially if recycling had to be done. Or they had many more elites to deal with each of those problems. That still required many underlings who were not of the elite class who, would do most of the menial work. It would have required an almost daily trainload of goods to disappear from the rest of the world to support a reasonably high level of life, or why go there? To just rough it while inventing fantastic devices? All that would require a life style equal to or seemingly much better than what the rest of the world enjoyed. And if only elites were there, who did all of the menial work for those elites, If not other people of a lower class? There would have to been even larger number of menial workers who would wonder what the hell was going on. People who are taken away from their regular way of life to do work for who knows who or why and has little to nothing to do with their own accustomed way of life, will ask questions and protest if not satisfied. Or there would have to be a very large number of very advanced robots instead. That still requires a large number of supporting industries and services to design, control, repair, care for those robots and all of the other details sophisticated robots entailed. So that would, again require a class of workers that were a little higher up but, still not quite elites who were ordinary engineers and technicians. Not a very realistic way to do all that without at least a few other elites, who did not get transported to that place, taking notice of other elites disappearing and so getting suspicious about that kind of activity.Or the thing you are talking about is so tightly controlled that any one who is even suspected of talking, is living under such great fear of their life that, again it is no way to live and someone will talk, just to get out of that fear driven organization. Still no one has talked about that kind of organization. The very first ones to be contacted outside that kind of organization, if that were true, would be a few journalists. Every journalist worth their curiosity will jump on anything that is reported as looking suspicious or curious looking or driven by fear, or just not quite right. A story like that will make big news, therefore sell a lot of newspapers and ad space and time on TV and give a big reason for advertisers a lot of reason to use such a news medium. It would make money for the medium reporting this first, and a promotion with an increase in pay, for the journalist who reported it.There was a story recently of a torture chamber found in Europe. Also found was a list of people who were to be tortured in those chambers. The people on that list were secretly carried off by the police to places like safe houses in other countries to prevent those people from being tortured. That sounds like the kind of thing that a secret society might do. But it was uncovered before the acts of control by fear, of those inside that secret society, could carry out their plans. That is how journalism helps to uncover such secrets. That is how a free journalism, not government, helps to keep us safe from secret societies.The only time when a big secret was kept willingly was, from the ones who could inflict more harm, like in Nazi Germany. The church and others who saved some of those scheduled for concentration camps were, keeping quiet because of the greater fear of being found out by those who could inflict more harm than whatever hardship was to be endured by hiding.It just takes too much work to get anything like a secret society from lasting much longer than a few months. Because of the fear driven way that such societies work. If the same societies tried to make it work by using positive incentives, like some religious cults do, then the members would be too happy and give themselves away from being too happy looking for no good reason. Others around them, will notice that change in their demeanour and sooner or later will start asking questions. If no answer is found, that happy person will be followed or searched. No one can stand by and just watch a person like that without getting suspicious. Maybe that happy person has something wrong with them, like being high on drugs or a tumour in the brain. People do not like having someone acting too differently from the rest of us, at least if the reason is not obvious. Like a person who has won a lot of money might act a lot happier than their friends. So that would give a ready answer and that person than would be considered more or less, “normal”. That is why USA president Trump has so many analyzing him and writing books about him and in the news for all the wrong reasons. A USA president should not act like that. People have taken notice and are doing many things about that. Same for any one else. Act a little out of the ordinary and sooner or later someone will do something about it.Those who try to keep a big secret anyways, despite the fear or by suppressing their happiness, will eventually develop psychological problems, since the subconscious is also a regulator of ones actions. Deep psychosis will eventually give rise to activity that is not normal, like a stutter, or ulcers, or other behaviour which, will affect their secret society in a negative manner and eventually slow down the efforts of that society, when too many get too sick or start acting weird. Also it is because people tend to be creatures of habit. Too big a change, as in what a secret society requires, will upset ones normal behaviour and lead to internal conflicts and then acting out without even noticing.Too much of anything, the same as over eating for no good reason, will eventually get noticed by others, even if it is just the size of the belly or the very different cut or fit of their clothes. People will always notice. That is one of the ways that society works to preserve its continued existence in the way it has been.It is only possible to keep a very big secret by one or two people at a time. Like in a married couple and even those get divorced as often as not. In a business that, has invented a very big break through, it might work if there are only two partners who share their positions very evenly, at 50–50% each. Then it might happen successfully just because of the incentive of a lot of money being shared between only two individuals. If a secretary or a technician who also has to know the details, is added from the outside then, it gets complicated and again hard to keep a lid on everything for more than a few months. An example of this is the very high tech and very powerful theory used by Brilliant Light and Power. That company is allowing everything to be known by anyone. Even then, it is so fantastic, most do not believe it. That makes it not even necessary to keep their technology a secret. So that means that anything that is truly powerful but kept in the open will be more likely ignored because it is too hard to believe. So that is another way that society again keeps things like that under control, although mostly without really trying. Pharmaceutical companies keep developing the next big drug but, have to keep almost everything about the drug or treatment to be mostly disclosed to the government to be sure that the treatment or drug is safe.The biggest thing going against a secret being kept by many people is power. Everyone involved wants to have some input or control or something to make themselves feel more powerful than they already are. Everyone will use every way possible to gain power, if it seems within reach. The pressure to show off ones power tends to be too great. That is why most people who win big money in a lottery, soon lose it all. They show off too much. That is just human nature. Showing off is a way to try and get power over others, as in, “See what I have and you don’t?”. It might seem silly until you get into that kind of position of power. I have been in a few positions where a little power was gained. Just school positions and school awards or social work and called “President”. So I have learned first hand how that works. It doesn’t take much. Even a little power can make people forget what they are doing or what they should be doing. And when a lot of really big power is involved, as in a national conspiracy, the people involved, especially the first level below the top ones. These will for sure get dizzy with power before they even get any and also before it gets too dangerous. And they will talk for sure, if only to write it down somewhere, to be opened by their attorney in case of their life being in danger or telling it to their “best friend”, with an oath for that friend to not tell anyone else. Oh , yeah? If the reason for going to the attorney seems really that big, some attorneys will open that letter very soon, just to be sure its is a good thing to keep secret, or just because the attorney knows how to open that letter without leaving any clues, that it was opened. Most things that an attorney is asked to keep secret are about simple things like lots of money and who will get that money. That will not do the attorney any good to know anything about stuff like that and who the money goes to. So that is not required to be opened at all until the letter has to be opened. It is only the really huge and important stuff, like “in case my life is threatened” then the attorney will for sure open it before it has to be, just to keep the attorney out of trouble with the police. Some crooked organizations give a letter like that to their close friend attorney to safeguard and to open it when required. Trouble with those kinds, crooks know only other crooks even only crooked attorneys who, sooner or later will act like the crook that they are and read the letter before it is required to be opened. The honest crook who will keep that secret is therefore a very rare bird and is therefore the exception. It is hard to know who of your friends is that exceptions to make even a mild conspiracy work properly.",3 followers,Robert Strickland,894,3.9K,14.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Since-Star-Wars-was-a-long-long-time-ago-and-had-such-advanced-technology-what-technology-would-they-have-now

The congress decided that new president won in a fair fight and should be supported.All of the above examples sound weird and absurd, right?If that sounds weird and absurd to Japan, China and US, thenWhat is more, in the movie, both parties allowed foreign involvement in their fight over the throne and no one seems to have any problem with that. REALLY? Agent Ross told T’challa how CIA operative worked in spurring chaos of another nation, while T’challa acted exactly the same way in making chaos and causing a civil war in his own nation. WOW!In the end, T’challa stopped the military action against the white world and decided to reach out to the world with their superior technology. Well, sounds really familiar. A strong and possible power play nice to the white people’s world. And other countries had no problem with that even though Wakanda was like a hybred of Saudi Arab and DPRK. How tamed.This movie reveals a fact that in the mind of US people, AFRICA IS SUPPOSED TO BE UNCIVILIZED AND PREMITIVE, AND SHALL BE MANIPULATED AND TAMED BY THE WESTERNERS, just like how they perceive Tibet, India, south east Asia, etc. It also indicates the image of a perfect country to the west: rich in resource and giving, subdued to the west world, and be friendly if she has technology superiosity. In this movie, this country is called Wakanda.",446 followers,Alyn Lin,29.9K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Since-Star-Wars-was-a-long-long-time-ago-and-had-such-advanced-technology-what-technology-would-they-have-now

Black Panther doesn’t deserve to be on the same level as the Dark Knight. Comparing Black Panther to Dark Knight is like comparing an ant to a human.

Black Panther doesn’t deserve to be on the same level as the Dark Knight. Comparing Black Panther to Dark Knight is like comparing an ant to a human. We are so superior in every way.Don’t get me wrong, Black Panther was great. But it was so overhyped because it was the first solo black superhero movie by the MCU. But there has been solo black superhero movies already (Blade, Spawn). And since it is the highest grossing superhero origin movie of all time, it must be the best right? Right?WRONG!!! People are hyping it up simple: because they don’t want to be racist. If it seems that people hate a movie based on blacks, they’ll be racist. and MCU has a huge fandom, which will make it worse. Yes, the movie was good based on Rotten Tomatoes, but if you looked in IMDB, it has a measly 7.5.How is Black Panther better than the Avengers, when Black Panther doesn’t have any memorable scenes? If you read my previous answer, I stated that Avengers has 13 memorable scenes, from Iron Man vs Thor, to Hulk vs Thor, to Avengers Assembling for the first time, Captain America and Iron Man combo, Iron Man bringing a NUKE to space, etc. The Avengers had buildup, Black Panther didn’t.Guardians of the Galaxy vol 1 was a movie about a group of people that were D List characters who no one even cared about. When the movie was set to release, people went because they were bored and wanted to watch a marvel movie. Then they were blown away by how awesome the movie was. You’re telling me Black Panther is better than that? Drax, Rocket, Quill, and Groot were more interesting than T’Challa, and most of his family (except Shuri and Killmonger, I’ll give it that)How is black Panther than Logan? Logan was hell of more touching than Black Panther! We cried when Logan died, Logan’s fight scenes were much better than Black Panther’s fight scenes, and even though Logan didn’t want any help, everytime he was on the screen, we couldn’t take our eyes off him.don’t get me started on how the hell is Black Panther better in The Dark Knight. The Dark Knight had a way more memorable score, better characters, and a fantastic villain that affected super hero movies today.Black Panther had a predictable plot (I heavily doubt that Black Panther was going to die 3/4 of the movie), the CGI was noticeable.The only thing I will say about Black Panther is that it has one of the best villains, Killmonger.Speaking of which, Black Panther got nominated for the OscarsWhich the majority isn’t too happy.While Black Panther was a good film, but it didn’t deserve to be nominated for Best Picture.You’re telling me that The Dark Knight or Logan couldn’t get nominated for Best Picture, but Black panther did? That's disrespectful.Avengers Infinity War was way better than Black Panther.Now, of course there are going to be some people that complain about us complaining Black Panther being nominated for Best Picture, they say just ignore it, it won’t win.The issue is that its disrespectful to other movies that deserved the spot. Black Panther shouldn’t really be nominated for Best Picture like Bohemian Rhapsody.So yeah. Black Panther is incredibly overhyped, it only got praised so people wont seem racist. It definitely didn’t deserve the Oscar nomination.",326 followers,Anubhav Jain,727,4.4K,123.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Since-Star-Wars-was-a-long-long-time-ago-and-had-such-advanced-technology-what-technology-would-they-have-now
