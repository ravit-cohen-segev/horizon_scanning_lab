We didn't build huge ships and cross the ocean with them, that again is a European accomplishment.The European people destroyed millions of South American native people in their lust for gold. It is estimated that as many as 100,000,000 native people lost their lives to this ‘venture'. While I disagree with that huge population number, it is known to have been the most heavily populated place on earth at the time. Almost an entire continent of people emptied out by slavery in the many mines. So many people were killed that the numbers of people murdered in the holocaust pale in comparison. Then the Europeans sought to replace the South American slaves with the North American Native peoples. We proved to be less hardy in those hot southern climes compared to our South American counterparts. We died off quicker than they did.If you are considering the building of roads, the South American Aboriginal people have you beaten, hands down. The roads that they built extended throughout the entire continent, and were longer and better built than the Roman Roads, and they were all built by hand without the assistance of beasts of burden. There were no horses and cattle to pull the heavy stones, an absolutely Amazing feat! Unfortunately those roads proved to be a major cause of the downfall. Native people had no beasts of burden, and nothing to ‘ride'. When the Spanish came over it was simple to ride their horses throughout the entire continent, with the Aboriginal people on foot, unable to warn friends and family of the coming disaster. These extensive and well built roadways also helped to spreado death from disease as well, as people were able to reach every city and town on the continent in their hurry to escape the deadly invaders.If you are considering mathematics, again the South American Aboriginal people have you beaten, again hands down. They used Zero before other people on other continents including Europe, which was slower in developing mathematics than not only the American Natives but also slower than China and the Middle East. When it came to mathematics, the South American Natives were absolute Genius! It took at Least 1,000 years for Europeans to catch up!If you are considering astronomy, there is simply No Comparison! Europeans are not even on the map! The ‘Farmers Almanac' so to speak was worked out, again, 1,000 years before the Europeans, and 600 years before the Middle East.If you are considering the over 100 pyramids built along the Mississippi river, well the pyramids of Egypt do compare better than ours. We didn't put a point on top of ours, but a platform and though Egyptian pyramids are taller, we do have some that are equal in mass. European settlers ploughed over them and planted their crops on them, not knowing what they were. They still aren't recognized, and I don't know if they are in the textbooks. American textbooks ignore Native accomplishments and focus on prairie ‘Indians' using their nomadic survivalist lifestyle as ‘proof' that we weren't advanced. They even ignore the highly developed accomplishments of those nations as well.If you are considering medicine, the Native people were amazed at how slow Europeans were to understand it, not recognizing what medicine was. We cured Europeans of scurvy for literally Hundreds of Years before the Europeans finally got that it was curable and preventable. We developed pain killers, anesthesia for our surgeries, yes, surgeries! We developed medicine for women's issues and childbirth, antibiotics, our medicine was quite advanced, in fact much of it is still in use in some form today. We not only cured malaria, but prevented it as well. Europeans, late in history bottled watered down forms of it, put a picture of a Native ‘Indian' on the label to prove it came from some wise old Indian and sold it from town to town.George Washington died because European ‘medicine' dictated that sickness was caused by an imbalance in the blood ‘humors', so his doctor overbled him. Europeans just weren't as advanced as us. There is absolutely no way any Aboriginal person would have done such a thing! George Washington would have lived longer under the care of an Aboriginal person.Native people were practicing real medicine while European doctors were bleeding thier patients and using leeches, Middle Eastern doctors were burning thier patients with charcoal, and the Chinese were grinding ‘dragon bones' mixed with flavorings to give thier patients.Native people actually taught Europeans medicine and how to use it when the Europeans were finally open to learning. Then the European would write it down, and share thier ‘discovery’ with other Europeans, taking credit for thousands of years of Native knowledge.I will post this as is, mistakes and all as I need to get working, but I could continue quite a bit more, as European Canadians/Americsns know next to Nothing about this subject. It isn't taught in schools, and the respect just isn't there because no one wants to acknowledge the Absolute Evil that took place in the past. It is much more palatable to think that we were nothing, just an ignorant people waiting to be ‘conquered' saved from ourselves and ‘modernized' by the much more advanced and deserving European people. The real fact is that even though Europeans failed to recognize the greatness in the people they actively sought to destroy, and left only a remnant of, the Entire World Benefited from thier interaction with us. There isn't a country on this Earth that has not benefitted greatly! But that is a story for another time.I'm glad ‘you' came and though you brought and caused great suffering and tragedy, we have great and wonderful countries, and great and wonderful children, as many of us have European dna as well as our Aboriginal dna. I wouldn't be here if ‘you' didn't come, and neither would my children. Just waiting for European Americans to develop socially to the point they can learn and change thier attitudes.

SETI (Mountain View / Hat Creek, California) do this. They monitor 72 million radio channels way out there concurrently. But they have also recently developed technology that seeks out short bursts of laser light, unlikely to occur in nature.The solar system is one of quite possibly 400 billion solar systems or more in the Milky Way galaxy, the galaxy being 13.51 billion years old.The Milky Way galaxy is one of quite possibly 400 billion galaxies or more in the universe, the universe being 13.772 billion years old. So there is plenty of real estate out there.Our searches can only detect intelligent technological life by the technological proxies, so there could be intelligent life out there that we cannot detect, it not being at the technological stage.Conversely, intelligent technological life way out there that is doing a similar search could not have detected life on Earth before 1900 because there was no sign of any proxy of technology.To sum up, intelligent life may exist but it may not yet be technological so we will not know of it if that is the case. Intelligent life in our current form has existed on Earth for 200,000 years but could not be detected from way out there by a search similar to our search, until 1900, or more likely the late 20th century by the leakage of an abundance of radio / television / radar signals.It is highly unlikely that the beginning of our technological knowledge occurred at anywhere near the same moment in time as any intelligent technological life way out there. So we will either not detect it (not yet technological) or if we do detect it that civilisation is likely to be at least millions of years in advance of us technologically.Of course it could be that intelligent technological life does not last all that long. Consider this. We became technological in 1900 and by the year 1960 a combination of 4 or 5 countries had sufficient capability between them to render the Earth unfit to support human life or at least kill all existing human life. That could have been happening way out there for billions of years and may still be happening. Their technological window of existence is extremely unlikely to align in time with ours. An optimist will say that a very civilised society will be able to avoid the technological cataclysm and exist for millions of years, being proportionately more advanced than we could possibly imagine, having become technological numerous millions of years ago and somewhat advanced in such endeavour.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/To-what-extent-were-indigenous-peoples-of-the-Americas-more-advanced-technologically-or-culturally-than-initial-European-explorers-and-colonizers-believed

Until now, most rockets have been built on a cost-plus basis by contractors working for a government agency. A lot of folks think NASA competes with SpaceX. No. NASA doesn’t build rockets. NASA contracts with companies like Boeing or McDonnell Douglas or Lockheed or Aerojet Rocketdyne to build rockets.These contracts are “cost plus.” The contractor is guaranteed to get whatever their expenses are, plus more for profit. If they go over budget, their profit goes up. If they run over time, their profit goes up.SpaceX spent a lot of their own money, rather than working on a cost-plus basis, to design and build their rockets. Cost plus means you have a financial incentive to go over time and over budget, and the more over time and over budget you go. the more profit you make. If you spend your own money, you have a powerful incentive to do it in time and on budget. That translates to lower cost rockets.Finally, traditional contractors build every single rocket by hand. From the Apollo to the space shuttle, the rockets aren’t made on an assembly line. When you’re working on a cost plus contract, if your manufacturing technique costs 10 times more, you make 10 times more profit.SpaceX builds things on an assembly line, to streamline production and get costs down. They don’t hand-make every rocket.

In order to make them as light as possible, they aren’t that robust at all, just exactly as robust as needed on the way up.At the same time, SpaceX designed Falcon 9 stages with a path way to reuse. Some key design aspects were in it since the first launch. Others were incorporated in several redesigns (Block I/II/III/IV/V), some changes were made between launches of a same Block type F9.Booster recovery involves 3 steps:1 - Boost back (optional) reverse stage forward trajectory and send the booster back to its launch site (impossible with parachutes).2 - Re-entry - slow down the stage just enough it stays in one piece and retains its structural integrity through out the hypersonic re-entry stage. This burn starts a few seconds before a parachute would start being effective, in effect it prevents a certain level of heating and turbulent vibration which would be impossible to accomplish with parachutes. This is the key reason parachutes don’t work at all !3 - Landing - Retro burn landing is ultra high accuracy (pretty much solely limited by GPS accuracy, otherwise it could perhaps by accurate to a few inches). Landing on a drone ship or on a concrete landing pad back at the launch site avoids the rocket from getting a salt water immersion, have to be found, fished from the water and then have to go through expensive refurbishment every time to remove all effects from salt water on the rocket.There is a final very convenient advantage of this method. Falcon 9 booster has 9 engines. Launches normally retain a fuel margin reserve in case one or two engines fail on the way up. Lets say there’s a 99.9% chance of no engine failure. In this case the higher acceleration of all 9 engines working properly saves fuel (lower gravity losses). That fuel reserve is used to land the booster.In the 0.1% chance one or two engines fail, the extra fuel is spent to compensate for the engine failures. In both cases the upper stage is released in the right parameters. In that rare case, the booster is a loss and isn’t recovered.With a parachute, the fuel margins are there anyways. You end up with a double mass penalty, while using the retro burn the same fuel reserve has dual use.Rockets are all about the mass.SpaceX / Elon Musk doesn’t care how hard something is. Their solution actually lands a booster that one day could be ready to be processed for launch 24 hours later (24 hour refurb). If every booster splash landed at the ocean, in very rough waters, there would likely be several instances the booster would not be recovered.Each booster is worth perhaps US$ 30 million USD. Over 100 launches, that’s US$ 3 billion. They chose the path that required the most hard work, the hardest engineering, but in the end is the cheapest per launch.Meanwhile the rest of the launch industry does the lazy way, assuming reuse is a fools errand and not even trying it.Get used to this. SpaceX likes to take the hard path if the extra work will make the rocket more economical, give the rocket more performance, make the rocket cheaper to make in the production line.",UNKNOWN,DurgaPrasad (దుర్గా ప్రసాద్),546,183,3.5M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Did-Trump-reveal-a-military-secret-when-he-tweeted-about-the-failed-test-of-Russia-s-Skyfall-a-nuclear-powered-cruise-missile-We-have-similar-though-more-advanced-technology-Why-or-why-not

When he was told in no uncertain terms that this was a COMPLETELY impossible goal - he told them to go back to the Moon by 2024…which might, maybe, be within the realms of possibility.But the whole plan hinges on Boeing getting the SLS rocket working on scheI honestly doubt that they’ll make it to the Moon by 2024.That date didn’t come from government going to NASA and asking: “How soon could you get to the moon?”The date came from Donald Trump expecting that he could order NASA to go to Mars by the end of 2024 so that he could claim that as a part of his legacy at the end of his second term. When he was told in no uncertain terms that this was a COMPLETELY impossible goal - he told them to go back to the Moon by 2024…which might, maybe, be within the realms of possibility.But the whole plan hinges on Boeing getting the SLS rocket working on schedule - and that schedule is still slipping.I truly believe that NASA cannot get to the moon by 2024 using SLS.So the choices are to either cancel SLS - and hope that SpaceX could step up to the plate and do it - or to soldier on with SLS and to slip that date.Cancelling SLS is “The Right Thing” in my mind - and it’s quite likely that a large percentage of people at NASA would agree with that. But the problem is that NASA doesn’t get to choose…it’s a matter of budgets - and Congress holds the purse strings.Cancelling SLS would be a severe blow to Boeing - who are already struggling to keep up with SpaceX on the ISS resupply and crew transfer business. There would be job losses in key states and the political fallout would be high. Billions and billions of dollars have been sunk into SLS and to write all of that off would be politically humiliating for a large number of politicians.That said - NASA did award small contracts to SpaceX for:All three of those things point to the abandonment of SLS.But I believe the first thing will be for the 2024 date to be postponed by the incoming Biden administration. There is really no reason to stick to that 2024 date now that Trump is gone - and NASA were probably going to miss it anyway due to a combination of COVID-19 and SLS slippages.The window is definitely open to a SpaceX solution. It’s interesting to note that SpaceX took a “spare” StarShip nose-cone section and painted it white with a NASA logo on it…take that anyway you like!","68,793 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Did-Trump-reveal-a-military-secret-when-he-tweeted-about-the-failed-test-of-Russia-s-Skyfall-a-nuclear-powered-cruise-missile-We-have-similar-though-more-advanced-technology-Why-or-why-not
