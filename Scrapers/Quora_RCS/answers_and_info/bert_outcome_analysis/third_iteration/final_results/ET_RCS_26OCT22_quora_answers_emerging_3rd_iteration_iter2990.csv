But as the time passes, bad elements start entering in the society. Till kaliyuga approaches, the percentage of bad people stands to 75%. And when this increases to 98%, the destruction takes place and world goes back to krutyuga.Now answer to your question. The people on this earth use two types of technology, one is god's technology of heaven and second the demon's technology of hell in all the fields. People of krutyuga use first technogy that is the most superior one while people of kaliyuga use second type. We people will not understand the basic of heaven technology because we are not fit to use that and therefore we are forced to use demon's one. People of treta and dwapar yuga's use mixed technology.JAI SRI RAM",162 followers,Prasad Chavan,2K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Where-are-the-advanced-technologies-described-in-the-Mahabharata-epic-now

It is the bridge made by Ram’s army to cross the sea from India to Sri Lanka. The engineers who made it were Nal and Neel. The bridge was made with floating stones, and if you don’t believe it, come to Rameshwaram or any temple near the Indian ocean and you will find such a stone floating in a tank of water.Teleportation, size variation, holographs and mega jumpsI know , most of us will laugh about it , but to be honest , if you think about this instances and check the year then you will realize how on earth some one even imagine this things!teleportation is some thing today’s science working , and from my point of view i don't think it will be a successful invention until 10 to 20 years passed.Jumping that huge distance can be explained as, using some kind of foot wear which boost the jumping distance , and Raavana’s head can be explained as a regenerated head , but again this all are assumption for sure , but the concept was there , and that what is the most mysterious thing among all.Human and animal mutationI know most of the readers will not agree or might get disappointed, but this thought only belongs to me.Ramayana characters like hanuman, Bali, jambuvan , jatayu and many more are seams like a scientific experiment to create a better living being,obtaining human and animal both characteristic.Surprisingly they always obey human , or in rough word they can be controlled by a human , though they are more powerful than a human.Weapons of mass destructionThe epics also had such weapons. TheAll these weapons were compact enough to be fired by a bow unlike our massive missiles, and their portability was also a lot easier. The small size helped in keeping the destruction to the intended area only, and probably to stop radiation from spreading out.

Live telecastAs Dhritarashtra was blind but wanted to know what was happening at the battlefield, Krishna gifted Sanjay with ""Dibya Drishti"", so that he could see a “Live Telecast” of “Kurukshetra” and describe that to Dhritarashtra. “Dibya drishti” is analogous to modern television set in the sense that Krishna could not give it directly to Dhristarastra but needed Sanjay.3. AstrasThe function of an Astra is more than that of a missile. It is said that Astras used in Mahabharata probably might have also used technologies of emitting most dangerous rays like Gamma and others, which have exceptional powers to penetrate. Some Astras returns to the person who launches it, for instance, Krishna's Sudharsana Chakra. This may be similar to the reusable missiles which the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) is working on.Astras were also used for defensive purposes similar to a Tesla Shield which is used to destroy the enemy Astra coming towards it.

Superlatively powerful so much so that most of the weapons are glorified using this as the adjective.So powerful that, in the Gita, Lord Krishna claims that amongst weapons, he is Vajra.āyudhānāmdhenūnāmprajanaś cāsmisarpāṇāmAmong weapons, I am Vajra; among cows, I am Kamadhenu; I am the progenitor Cupid and among snakes, I am Vasuki, the king of sarpas.Considered to be the supreme amongst weapons, indestructible.

The only known shield was disarmament and complete surrender. Knowledge of this astra was possessed only by Drona, his son and Krishna. Used by Ashwattama against the Pandava armies, but effect was thwarted by Krishna who knew the said trick. Imagine the disappointment of Duryodhana.From this point on, the rankings are meaningless. It is like ranking the 1000000 KT and 2000000 KT nukes. Any usage was going to result in end of life on Earth.7. ब्रम्हास्त्र (Considered to be the supreme weapon that can be possessed. Very very rare. Possessed by many people and used by just one person in the epic (See #4). Effects similar to nuclear fallout - areas become barren, people suffer, effect propagates across generations. Use restricted against mortals. Karna planned on using it against Arjuna, but due to several reasons (his mother's request, his teacher's curse) could not do so.6. ब्रम्हशिरा (Bhrahmashira)Close relative of the5. पाशुपतास्त्र (Indestructible and irresistible weapon of Lord Shiva that contains the power to destroy all creations.

This trident was used to sever the original head ofIf you have come so far, you might be wondering what could be more powerful. Well, IMHO, there still is.Remember how all the weapons above are meant for destroying enemies that are out there (at least superficially). Most of them were quite successful too. However, unfortunately, the most formidable enemies of a person are often not physical entities that can be blown to bits. They are often sneaky ones in the form of sense objects - lust, anger, gluttony etc and they are often the undoing of the most powerful of warriors, even in the epic. Hence we have1. बुध्दिः (Loosely, the mind / intelligence / consciousness)You don't have to take my word for this.From Krishna's statement in the Bhagvad Gita:indriyāṇiindriyebhyaḥmanasasyoThe working senses are superior to dull matter; mind is higher than the senses; intelligence is still higher than the mind; and he [the soul] is even higher than the intelligence. (3.42)Following which he goes on to claim:evaḿsaḿstabhyātmānamjahikāmaThus knowing oneself to be transcendental to the material senses, mind and intelligence, O mighty-armedThere is no doubt that the person who possessed and used this the most in the war is none other than Krishna (even while keeping his promise of not bearing arms).Update:I cannot take any credit for this update as there are others (eg.0. धर्म (Dharma)The Pandavas were awesome heroes. They had the raw strength of Bheema, the valor and unsurpassed skill of Arjuna and the beauty and brains of the Aswini putras( not to mention the generosity of Karna). Why, they had the constant aid, support and guidance of the Lord himself. Any of them could have been suitable to rule the world in their own right. Yet, they all worked to establish the supremacy and sovereignty of Dharmaputra, who stood for Dharma.Note that there were many other warriors on the other side who were more experienced, skilled, powerful, and had better weapons. Yet they fell, for the weapon of Dharma was wielded by the Pandavas and Krishna.As is said:धर्मो रक्षति रक्षित: ।","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Where-are-the-advanced-technologies-described-in-the-Mahabharata-epic-now

Oh, your body continues to exist - as rotting meat if it isn’t cremated or embalmed, butIt’s just part of the same inability of the human brain to contemplate its own nonexistence as religion and “eternal life” and “life after death” are - a way for the brain to handle a concept that most brains",1 follower,Kirk Scott,1.3K,13.4K,68.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Where-are-the-advanced-technologies-described-in-the-Mahabharata-epic-now
22,"While I don’t think so, a scheme by clever aliens would at least provide a good explanation for why ghosts are often described to manifest wearing historically inaccurate period clothing. “The alien intelligence that is creating them is making them appear as we would expect them to” stacks up better than “the souls of the dead like to wear fancy dress”.",632 followers,Lee Carragher,1.1K,853,2.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Where-are-the-advanced-technologies-described-in-the-Mahabharata-epic-now

From here, we can’t even make out our solar system let alone individual planets. The galaxy is enormous. We are rotating what is believed to be a black hole. Current scientific estimates conclude that there are approximately 100 billion stars in our galaxy alone with planets orbiting them.As we travel further into space, the entire galaxy becomes just a dot of light. Each of those other dots are other galaxies.Further away, it is possible to see the Virgo Supercluster. That red notation represents our local galactic group, containing all of the galaxies near us. In that is the Milky Way galaxy. In that is the solar interstellar neighborhood. In that is our solar system. In that is planet Earth.The local supercluster group contains the virgo supercluster, where we are located, as well as the other superclusters near us.That tiny dot that you can hardly make out on the screen is the Virgo Supercluster. All of those other dots are superclusters. And this is just the observable universe that we can estimate. It is believed that there are countless, perhaps even infinite, other dimensions. Theoretically, planet Earth could have entire civilizations that exist in other dimensions we can’t access or interact with at the present time. Then there is the issue of time and gravity. If time travel is possible, all of these universes would be occurring at the same time everywhere in all dimensions.Multiverse?The multiverse is a hypothetical group of multiple universes.Together, these universes comprise everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, energy, information, and the physical laws and constants that describe them.Do you still think we are alone in the Universe?","20,152 followers",Aitijya Sarkar,5.8K,209,11.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Where-are-the-advanced-technologies-described-in-the-Mahabharata-epic-now
