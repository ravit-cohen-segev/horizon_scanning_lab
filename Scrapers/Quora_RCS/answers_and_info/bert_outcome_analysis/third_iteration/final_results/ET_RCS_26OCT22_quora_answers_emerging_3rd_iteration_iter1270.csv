0,"There never was leaps in engine technology merely trial an error incremental improvement.The leading force behind those improvements has pretty much always been motor sport and in the last 50 odd years exclusively formula 1.Take any part of a modern car from exotic material bodies to turbo chargers via aerodynamics, etc, and in particularly safety and survival of crashes, were created or improved by formula 1 engineers.So to answer your question look at today’s formula 1 card and you will see what will be standard in cars in 5 years.","16,058 followers",Pavel Fekula,1.4K,11K,118.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/When-will-the-next-leap-in-car-engine-technology-happen
1,I’m not convinced there will be any more leaps for the IC engine.I think it’s days are now numbered due to the increasing use of electric power trains instead.Variable compression engines are I suspect the last leap but that’s (to my thinking at least) a current one not a next one in that there are working examples developed already.,"29,921 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,5.9K,7.7K,249.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/When-will-the-next-leap-in-car-engine-technology-happen
2,"The investment in R&D for the ICE is and ICE vehicles is beginning to Fade, and dissapear! Most Improvement have Already been discovered, and there Really is Nowhere to ‘Go’ with the ICE!! It is an Outdated, and Soon to be Obsolete Technology!Electric Vehicles are the Future, and Most Automobile Manufacturers Realize that at Some Point they will All need to ‘Re-Tool’ and Start Producing EVs!",0 followers,Octavia Ward,1.5K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/When-will-the-next-leap-in-car-engine-technology-happen
3,Two recent advances in piston engine tech will let it live a bit longer. The first is the Nissan system that permits the compression ratio to be changed depending on the power requirements. I believe their Infinity brand is making such an engine available now.The other is a combination of spark and compression ignition being used by Mazda in a new SkyActiv engine to improve fuel economy. I don’t think it will be available until 2109 at the earliest.The next real leap though will be new high capacity fast charge batteries with near superconducting motors to create a true replacement for an inteTwo recent advances in piston engine tech will let it live a bit longer.

4,It depends on what technology level you are talking about. Are you asking when the next already known technology becomes mainstream or a completely new technology. I’d compare to potential answers from either battery powered brushless electric to nuclear fusion motor being used to power electric cars. Beyond that maybe levitation engines that defy gravity in every sense. So to put a timeline on it is next to impossible without some more specifics on the level of technology you refer to. Who knows you may even be talking about petrol powered engines at which point I might say the adiabatic engiIt depends on what technology level you are talking about.

5,"The question of when is always answered by “time & money”, how much time and how much money is someone willing to put into R&D on an issue. Right now the goals of greater “efficiency” of IC engines, higher thermodynamics, alternative fuels, and smaller engines with torque boosters. All of these goals are being researched across the world now. The manufacturers will sell them to the consumers as soon as the technology is cost effective and dependable. Right now a lot of capital is going into EV motivated vehicles but there is also effort go into things like the opposed piston where you have twoThe question of when is always answered by “time & money”, how much time and how much money is someone willing to put into R&D on an issue.

Right now a lot of capital is going into EV motivated vehicles but there is also effort go into things like the opposed piston where you have two pistons in one cylinder, variable compression crank & rod combination in InfinitI VC-T concept cars is very close to production, direct injection heads & injectors are ready to go now.Advanced Combustion Systems and FuelsBut in the end the IC engine will continue as a much smaller, more efficient device with computer control of its operation. And you tax money is going to the R&D efforts through the Department of Energy through all sorts of grants. So the question of when is “Tomorrow”.","527,820 followers",Adam D'Angelo,1.1K,990,33.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/When-will-the-next-leap-in-car-engine-technology-happen

7,"The advancements of the previous 2 centuries. That laid the groundwork for the advancements of the last century. A proper understanding of Newtonian physics allowed us to develop the art and science of engineering. The development of the science of chemistry allowed us to make great advances in materials. The discovery of the science of electrodynamics allowed us to start dabbling in electrical power, wireless communications, and so on. All these advancements fed into each other, allowing each of them to advance more quickly.Edit: Yes, as others have pointed out, there are many other factors.The advancements of the previous 2 centuries.

Socio-political factors that unleashed much more of the population to be able to contribute to technological and scientific advancement. Wars certainly increased the demand for and research and development of various technologies. But not all.To go into everything this would end up like an episode (or maybe the whole series) of “Connections” with James Burke. Scientific advancements led to technological advancements, which fed back into scientific advancements. Unfortunately I don’t have the time to explore all the possible connections. But I believe my initial assertion is basically correct: Scientific and technological advancements of the last 300 years or so fed into each other and resulted in the ever quickening pace of technological advancement. The 19th century was full of scientific and technological advancements that most of us just take for granted now. For example, steel - now the most prosaic of materials - was until the latter half of the 19th century a relatively rare and expensive material only used for the most demanding applications. Once steel was available in quantity, all sorts of things became possible or much more feasible.","4,370 followers",Michael J Zupon,802,3.2K,4.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/When-will-the-next-leap-in-car-engine-technology-happen
8,"Content consumption dictates content type. Broadcast TV is changing as we speak in giant leaps. With the FCC ruling earlier in the year, networks and broadcasters will be able to reach out to consumers without needing them to subscribe to a cable provider. Thus becoming individual apps on Apple TV, Amazon Fire or any other platform. These broadcasters will be known for the type of content they provide and the level of interaction or engagement. New broadcasters will come to play. Just like Redbull has original programming so could Coca Cola or BMW; any brand of publisher really.User engagementContent consumption dictates content type.
