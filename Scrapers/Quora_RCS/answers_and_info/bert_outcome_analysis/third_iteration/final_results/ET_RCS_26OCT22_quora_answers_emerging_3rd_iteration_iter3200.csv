The armor Tony is wearing is the Endosym armor, a combo of liquid smart metal and symbiote, capable of facing down the likes of Havoc and Storm with ease. Even his Hulkbuster Mark II that fought Green Scar Hulk was no match for it.Top that off that he had just given Matt Murdock, aka Daredevil, his sight back using the Extremis virus and had tricked the entirety of San Fransisco into thinking of him as the greatest person in the world (despite his lack of morals from the Inversion) and you realize that this Tony may not be the smartest version of himself (he’s had a lot of smart moments over the years), but this is him if he weren’t limited by his own morals and codes.

The only Marvel characters I am caught up with are Wolverine, Moon Knight, and Deadpool.DC Comics is so much better than Marvel Comics, and that's because DC isn’t too political.It's alright if a comic is political, after all Stan Lee created Mutants as an allegory to segregation.But Marvel recently has gone on the extreme. People buy superhero books to be entertained and see developed characters interact. But when you have cringey dialogue, then the series will suffer.The problem with Marvel is that their “Diversity” is just cringey. Its okay to have some political messages or what not, but the problem is that the majority of the audience will never complain about a guy mansplaining. Who the hell talks like this?This has been building up inside me, and I need to get this out of my chest. But DC is so much better because they prioritize good writing over making a political message or creating diversity.For example, look at Jessica CruzShe isn’t interesting because she’s a Latina female. Her gender or race is not the most interesting quality about them.What makes DC characters great is that their characters have FLAWS. Marvel has the brilliant idea that Women do not need flaws, but that is INCORRECT. The Greatest characters always have flaws. That's why Spider Man, Batman, and Super Man are so popular.Look at Jessica Cruz, my favorite Green Lantern.If this was Marvel, then Jessica Cruz will be already be a master at her new powers, and she would be confident. But her thinking shows us that she’s still human, that she’s not sure of herself and isn’t confident.DC Comics is so much better recently because they make characters that are developed, flawed, and relatable. Here, Jessica is having an anxiety attack, and is scared of failure.It makes her so moving and makes me attached to her because she’s not perfect, she’s flawed and having stories of characters that overcome their flaws and rise from their failures is so much more interesting than characters who have no flaws, never face any challenges, and are perfect. Seeing Jessica Cruz eventually get over her anxiety attacks makes me moved, and is empowering.That's why people love DC Comics. That's why I am now a huge DC Comics fan, because their comics are so much better. The dialogue isn’t cringey, it talks about social issues, but it IMPACTS the story; it is important to the story.Now, let's look at Marvel’s Diversity Character,America ChavezWho the hell is she? Well she is born from a different dimension. her parents are two women, she’s a Latina, she’s a lesbian, and she’s overpowered. How powerful is she?She can punch near light speed, she can hit a teleporter, she can destroy a black hole with a punch, she can close a planet sized hole in a galaxy by dancing, and she can kick so hard that it breaks reality, which can make her travel throughout different dimensions.Does anyone see the problem? America Chavez is one of the most powerful heroes in Marvel, and she’s only been a hero for 2 years.If you want my biggest issues with America Chavez, they’re down below:Kenny Nguyen's answer to Why do people hate female superheroes?Kenny Nguyen's answer to Why are fans so unhappy with the current state of Marvel comics?The biggest problem with America Chavez is that she’s so overpowered, that when she loses to Captain America in Secret Empire, it doesn't make sense. How does a guy with a shield beat a woman who can create portals by kicking really hard, and can hit near the speed of light?Marvel is so bad at Diversity because they think a strong female is a woman who is really diverse, and has no flaws and is overpowered and is basically perfect. That is a really bland, dull, and uninteresting character.DC Comics on the other hand thinks a strong female is a woman who has flaws and struggles, but overcomes them and rises to be the best hero they can be. Why do you think people know more about DC characters? Its because they prioritize writing a great story over sending a political message. This is exactly the reason why I am afraid MCU will be too political; people say there’s nothing wrong with being political.There is a PROBLEM when you force in political agendas, and it becomes cringey. Seriously, I can name more female DC Characters compared to Marvel, and this is honestly why I prefer DC Comics more than Marvel comics.10 Reasons Why Jessica Cruz's Anxiety Moves Us - ComicsVerse",1 follower,Anthony Alice,1.2K,5K,44.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-universe-has-the-most-powerful-and-advanced-technology-DC-Comics-or-Marvel-Comics

I think Weapon X was extremely close on making the perfect weapon.Power heavy hitters:These beings have near absolute power and usually take a type of PIS, or reality warping to stop and are usually powered by a deminsonal power source —DC’s Captain Atom:Captain Atom is capable of extreme energy absorption, atomic manipulation and finally energy manipulation; This isnt the extent of his powers, but his most dominant abilities are the ones mentioned.Marvel’s Vulcan:The brother or Cyclops Vulcan can manipulate all forms of energies including both his brothers Havok and obviously Cyclops.Physical heavy hitters:The physical heavy hitters will be the beings who Excell in overall stats and are dominant due to their physical attributes more than say, “Energy Manipulation"" —DC' Superman:I mean who else? Superman is the embodiment of physical prowess and just like all the other characters on this list Superman isn't only limited to physical abilities but is the most dominant in his physical abilities.Marvel's Hulk:The ultimate brawler in fiction of course deserves his spot on one of the most physically superior beings in fiction.Magical heavy hitters:Magical Heavy hitters will be where you see the most complex haxes in both mediums —DC's Dr. Fate:The, “Helmet of Fate"" bestowed upon humanity by Nabu can make any weilder a top tier character in DC granting such magical processes that even the most powerful beings have to think twice before an assault.Marvel's Dr. Strange:Becoming the Sorcerer Supreme and also obtaining the, “Eye of Agamotto: Dr. Strange has also proven to use magic to combat the strongest beings Marvel has to offer.Mental heavy hitters:Being capable of dominanting the mind becomes quite useful in Marvel/DC —DC's Martian Manhunter:Martian Manhunter has a very dominant prowess in Telepathy and although debatable I consider MM more of a mental hero than a physical one.Marvel's Jean Grey:Forget about the Phoniex Force.Jean Grey by herself is a Omega level mutant by herself and just like MM is a planetary threat in mental prowess this is why the Phoniex Force is drawn to Jean and of course she has the Phoniex Force on top of of being an Omega level mutant.Divine heavy hitters:Some beings draw their power from the universe or other deminsons, but other beings draw power directly from their creator —DC's Wonder Woman:Daughter of a Skyfather and heir to the Amazonians land. Wonder Woman is blessed with divine gifts that creates the character we see today.Marvel's Thor:Need I say more?Demonic heavy hitters:Of course with every action there is a reaction and here comes the demonic class —DC's Trigon:Father of Raven and conquerer of many worlds. Trigon would make Darkseid reconsider an attack if he knows he will be facing Trigon in the process.Marvel's Mephisto:Mephisto is a specialized demon who has his own little mini Hell deminson that he rules and can gain a immense amount of power when within.Abstract heavy hitters:Then there is the tip of the ice berg of absolute and they come in forms of ideas/concepts/”God"" —DC's Presence:Of course the top of the ice berg in DC is the presence; You could argue the source but I'm pretty sure the source is apart of the presence.OrDC's Perptua:If you wanna know another abstract like being Perptua who creates multiverses can be considered too.Marvel's All Above one:And then there is Marvel's ultimate character which is TOAA.OrMarvel's living Tribunal:And in case you want another one the Living Tribunal would be right behind TOAA in power.I would like to again say that all these characters are not limited to the catagories I put them in and since all these characters are on top of their tier they usually have other amazing abilities outside their main ones.This also isn't a, “best of"" list meaning:Just because I put Vulcan instead of Silver Surfer does not mean I believe Vulcan is more powerful than Silver Surfer.If I get a good amount of uovotes and views I'll add to each Catagory (:Hope this helped!",0 followers,Poro,513,335,7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-universe-has-the-most-powerful-and-advanced-technology-DC-Comics-or-Marvel-Comics

We have planes that are much cheaper than Moller's little project, and they are much safer and more effective.Why doesn't everybody fly planes or helicopters?Because what the skycar fails to address, is the sheer fact that flying vehicles are many times more difficult a market for the average civilian to penetrate — financially, competently, entrepreneurially.A very small fraction of people know how to fly planes because ultimately it isn't very practical for the greater part of the civilian market.People ride in planes as public transportation, beacuse it is much more understandeable and realistic to rent planes for infrequent trips than to invest in a personal flying vehicle.A common joke about “the future” isBut as I have just shown, flying cars are the answer to a question that no-one asked.And this extends to a lot of sci-fi technology and concepts. Things that sound really cool on paper, but the moment you plop it into real life it fails almost immediately because there is simply no call for it.But everything we have now was at some point science fiction. Telephones used to be locked to a cable network over land. Computers used to be the size of refrigerators. Cars were only capable of tens of horsepower at a time. Trains were still locked to rails and powered by gasoline. Planes could only travel below the sound barrier.We have come far, but every piece of advanced technology we enjoy made a whole hell of a lot of sense, and still does.I hope this helps!",0 followers,Jim Hogarth,10.5K,94,5.5M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Which-universe-has-the-most-powerful-and-advanced-technology-DC-Comics-or-Marvel-Comics

The type of people who are good at producing new technology wouldn’t work well in a military hierarchy, there would be a lot less innovation.The reputation of militaries being able to get things done mostly comes from war time too. During events like WW2 countries will throw massive amounts of money at projects, maybe even unnecessary amounts of money at projects. The looming threat of occupation by a foreign power that hates you is also a great motivator to keep people working and stop them from being too corrupt.Without the civilian/commercial industry the military wouldn’t be as advanced as it is. Modern tech is too advanced and without some looming threat many of the people who are best at that kind of work won’t work for the military. Having just the military researching tech would lead to most technology being ignored if they can’t see the military value in it, it would lead to overspending, inefficiencies, and a lack of skills required to carry out the work.","68,778 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.3M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Which-universe-has-the-most-powerful-and-advanced-technology-DC-Comics-or-Marvel-Comics

And yeah, they’re a hell of a lot better than fighting somebody without one.But, here’s the thing about powered exoskeletons: the person within the exoskeleton limits the exoskeleton’s capabilities. Suddenly, the exoskeleton has to account for a person’s heat tolerance, the types of forces a person can withstand, a person’s range of motion… It’s a mess.Wouldn’t it just be smarter to design a robot instead of an exoskeleton, and man it remotely?
