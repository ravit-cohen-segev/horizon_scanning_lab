If you want to impress them take a short thought experiment to them and then under these conditions propose a small project that you know will drive results compared to their current metrics.Once you show results they would be insane to not hire you.

I am sure you will be on cloud 9.Wait….!This is mirage. It’s a honey trap which you should avoid. If you are willing to boost your carrier as an IT professional then this is the worst thing which can happen to you.I am elaborating what they actually do with freshers . First they will take you interviewed with multiple screening like:1.Reasoning, Aptitude, English Test.2.Coding Test3.Group Discussion4.Technical Interview5.HR InterviewIf you are lucky and eligible enough to pass these stages then they will release offer letters to you.Here comes the hidden truth.Now they will ask you to sign a Bond of amount Rs. 75000 as a training cost.You have to sign because after all this is the big name and you will also have reputation to make in your friend circle. Now After signing bond they will provide their so called training sessions where you will be trained in different domains.1.Networking,2.Java,3.AD servers, Exchange servers, Backup Server,4.Automation (Scripting),5.Operating Systems (Unix, Linux, Windows),6.Internet Of Things (rarest case),7.VOIP,8.ITIL Awareness,9.Virtualization (VMWare, Hypervisor, Oracle Virtual Box),And so on…………………………..One more thing I would like to mention:They will also ask you to pass language proficiency test. I guess this is something convincing.They mean to say that what we have learn 4 years in our college is totally waste and they are giving training something special.Now after you complete your training successfully.Mark my wordsGuess next what !!!They will never ask your preferred location as you already have given before applying to job.Now Any how you reach to your destination then they are providing you Rs. 1200 per day for accommodation and fooding allowance. For example they have sent you Mumbai from Bangalore. They will provide you Air Ticket if you are early otherwise they will send you via train And the shit don’t end up here they will ask you to book tickets on your own… LNow you arrive at Mumbai, Still you haven’t received any allowance and during training they are providing you a salary of $224.62 per month. This salary is quite less than that what an illetrate sweeper or 12th pass Cab driver is earning. Now the hotels are very expensive in Mumbai. You have to shift in Sub-Urban areas like Kalyan, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Panvel, etc. from these places you will find local train whose condition I need not to explain if you have only a little knowledge of local trains in Mumbai. You have to pay a sum of atleast 1000 Rs. for 24 hours, Now comes your fooding part. I am sure you are from different part of country and your eating habits would be different and you would like to eat your native food so It will cost you around Rs.150 for one time and this doesn’t include your local conveyance cost as you have to bear as you have to search some place to stay.At this point of time you haven’t received any allowance and you also don’t have savings. So you ask money from your parents. If you are the elder son of your family and the financial condition of the family is not good then you have to ask money from your friends or parents will arrange this money from anywhere because after all you are their son.Now what’s the point to stay there and do your job on your parent’s money which they arrange for your survival?But you have to stay as you are somehow greedy that you will receive the allowance and salary as well. Today is 31st and you are excited to get your salary. Here comes the surprise:Tomorrow is 1st and you are sure that you will receive salary but there is a holiday and you will receive salary on 2nd. I mean seriously this is the condition of India’s 3rd Largest IT Company.Now on 2nd you receive your full salary but what is this??You were told that you have a package of 3 LPA so you have to receive Rs. 25000 per month but now you will have 20,100 Rs in your hand then you are overwhelmed what’s going on here. You will ask clarification on this and they will tell you explanation:CTC: Cost to company 25000 /- (per month)Gross: You actual income 23187 /- (per month)Take away salary. 20100 /- (per month)Now you are trying to heal up. 10 days gone, you have spent almost 15000 rupees and you are null, you have to pay back your loan which you ask from your well-wishers. Now another blow comes in suddenly, you came to know that you have to apply for that compensation of 12000 rupees. (you are 3000 rupees in negative and still homeless) Now once you apply for that allowance your HR will take almost 1 week to approve it and you will receive amount after 10 days of your application.Now you are searching homes.In Mumbai it is a big task to have home (flat only forget about bungalows) the minimum flat (1 BHK) you will get cost you around 70,000 rupees initially and then 10,000 rupees per month. This is really a big amount.Still you are in free pool or not billable. You are having almost no work than they a lot you randomly project which seriously is of no concern.You heal up with your financial crisis now ready for mental torcher:You are sent to your concerned customer team. There you have to follow all the rules and regulations of your customer along with your parent company. Now they will ask you come in shifts (rotational shifts) as you are machine and the worst part is that they will not allow you to enter in production environment, even you will not have your own PC.You are not working on any technology and the manager and the team is asking you some reports and some monitoring that’s it. You are Okay with this even if you don’t like. Now suddenly after 2 months they ask you log tickets and take responsibility of service desk. Now this is what you have wasted your 4 years of Engineering, Their so called trainings on different technologies.Now is it your dream Job??????ASK YOURSELF Honestly!",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,1K,0,0,2016,https://www.quora.com/Anyone-engaged-with-Wipro-Technologies-can-tell-me-how-much-they-are-automotive-manufacturing-is-it-worth-joining

My hair is falling out.”I was 23 years old and six months into a demanding sales job at General Electric, and I was failing hard.To get this job, I had to convince an executive to pull me off of a leadership program twelve months early.I wanted to live in Chicago where my friends were and a position opened up. The only problem was that I was about to move to Atlanta for my third rotation. Impatient and ready to move up in my career, I made my play.I went to the executive responsible for the Chicago territory and made my impassioned case. He had an open position, I was ready now and if he waited until I went to Atlanta, some other executive would get me and all of the great results I would deliver.He agreed to make a case to pull me off the program and into a direct territory but did so with a warning.“You will be treated like any other sales rep. If you can’t generate business, you will be replaced like anyone else. Are you sure you are ready?”“Of course. Let’s go!”I wasn’t ready.It was a battle not to piss my pants while he was giving me that warning. I had no idea how to sell, had no customers to start with and only a rudimentary understanding of the technology I was selling.But, I got what I wanted. I was the new sales rep in Chicago.Determined to prove my manager smart for giving me the opportunity, I put in ridiculous hours.I made lists of targets for hours. I wrote out cold call scripts. I practiced my elevator pitch. I read scores of sales books and like a college kid, wrote a book summary on every one.I prepared all night and then called customers from 8AM to 5PM, just hoping to get someone live. I quickly learned that cold voice messages were a waste of time.Then I learned that live people weren’t much better. I stuttered my way through calls, sounding like the inexperienced kid I was.The nice ones said no and hung up. The rest chewed me out to make sure I didn’t ever call again.I grew to like the angry people more. At least they weren’t patronizing and I actually kept them on the phone longer.I wasn’t sleeping at all. I laid in bed thinking about getting fired. I thought about telling my parents that I got fired from the job they were so proud of me for getting in the first place.I thought about how I would pay the rent. Even a shitty garden apartment in someone’s basement is expensive in Chicago and I wouldn’t make it four weeks without a paycheck. I thought about moving back home to live with mom and dad.Mainly, I just thought about being a failure.Every week, I jumped on a conference call hosted by my manager. I always went last because I was the rookie.This meant that I had the pleasure of listening to 20 other sales reps talk about the deals they were chasing. Big deals, exciting deals, strategy. I listened to my manager’s voice get louder and more excited when a rep talked about a new opportunity to chase.I wondered what it would be like to chase a big deal and close it. The call had camaraderie, with reps congratulating each other on big successes. They would give each other advice or mention they would call each other after the call to talk strategy.What were they talking about? Were there secrets I didn’t know?Then my manager would call out my name.“Ian, what are you chasing this week?”I would take my phone off mute and say the same thing every week.“Uh, hey Bob. Nothing new to report this week.”“OK. Keep hustling buddy.”“You bet.”I would hit mute and imagine what all the other sales reps were saying about me.Did they feel bad for me because I sucked? Were they gloating that Bob should have hired a more experienced rep? Were the guys in Detroit making bets on how much longer I would last? What were my odds to make it until Christmas?I responded by working longer hours but I was calling less customers all the time. I was paralyzed by the size of the challenge.Every week, I thought about calling my boss and giving him my resignation along with an apology for letting him down. He was a great boss and patient, but I never wanted to let him know how I was feeling, especially after how confidently I pitched myself for the job.This led to my hair starting to fall out in clumps. I was 23 and my hair was falling out because of stress. What the hell?After one particularly embarrassing conference call where Bob asked me a few probing questions about prospects and got nothing as usual, I was despondent. I got off the phone and thought about how I would get fired. Would he call me or make me fly to his office in St. Louis?My phone rang. It wasn’t my boss.It was Don, our top sales rep in Kansas City.I met Don when I was on the training program and spent two days traveling with him to visit customers. Don was 65 years old and one of the most genuine dudes I ever met.He was polite, thoughtful, soft spoken and completely void of ego. He was the opposite of the stereotype of a typical sales person.He didn’t need to work but just loved the job. As a sales rep, he was money in the bank. He led the company every year and hustled like he was at the bottom. He was worried about me.“Hey Ian, are you OK?”I didn’t attempt to lie.“No, Don. I don’t think I can do this.”“Why?”“I look at everything you have going and I am so far away. I can’t even get one order and I need hundreds.”“Well, do you think I started with hundreds of orders?”“No.”“It started with one customer saying yes. Actually, it started with hundreds of customers saying no. I wouldn’t be here if I had a plan to get to hundreds of customers. My plan was to get one.”“OK. How do I get one?”““Think small?”“Yes, you are overwhelmed with the size of the challenge but you can’t do it all tomorrow.I am still grateful for that phone call. It meant everything to me that someone at the top took time to reach out and help.Kindness knocked me out of my funk and my resilience strengthened. I took his advice seriously.I focused on having one great day at a time. Five great days turned into two great weeks and my first great month. I started to land more appointments after two months of this approach.Then, my first customer said yes. I had my first order!Who did I call first?My mom, of course.But, then I called Don. I still remember how proud he was on the other end of that phone. I thanked him for his greatest sale, giving me confidence.That order led to more confidence and I could tell other prospects about my customer. That social proof and confidence led to more sales and I kept focusing on one good day at a time.Two years later, I was pushing Don for top sales though he never gave up that title. More importantly, I was sleeping and my hair stopped falling out.If you are struggling with resilience, focus on the smallest step you can take. Even a small step takes you closer to your goal.If you want to lose weight, start with one great day. Do you want to quit smoking? Make it through one day. Do you need to pay off debt? Tighten up your spending tomorrow first. If you want to have a great year at work, start with one great day.If that doesn’t work, find a Don. You need someone who has been there, can see if you are on the right path and give you the confidence that the road you are on leads somewhere worth following.My stress and lack of resilience was never about the work. It was about my misunderstanding that the work would never lead to a result.If you see some struggling in your office, take a minute and offer your help.Be good to each other.Be a Don.",169 followers,Ian Mathews,6.5K,106,13.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Should-social-media-engagement-and-mobile-technology-be-a-priority-for-CPG-companies

If they can’t figure out the answer to something just by Googling it, then many of them think that the answer isn’t worth figuring out.When I was a student, we had Cliff Notes… summarized versions of novels… for students who were too lazy to read the actual novel. Cliff Notes were pretty much banned in school. It was considered cheating. Now, students have a variety of websites with those same kinds of summaries, and many students use them. They may still read or skim the novel, but they use the online summaries to understand what they just half-assed read.Or, even better, they just find a youtube video of someone explaining the novel to them, so they don’t even have to read the summary, but just listen to someone else explain it to them.But the easiest way to see how tech has made students lazy is when I ask them to write a story or essay on notebook paper instead of typing it. They will groan and complain about it, begging to just type it instead. I call it being “hand lazy.”They’ve also gotten lazier about organization, planning, and other executive functioning skills. Instead of writing down their homework in a physical planner, most of them claim they will just “ask the group chat when they get home.” Of course, many of them forget to actually do that. They don’t worry about taking home the correct books for their homework. As long as just one of them has the book, that person can send pictures of the necessary pages to everyone else. (Or just send the answers… yes, students, we know when you do that.)Some might call those “problem solving skills.” Others might call it laziness.

I warned him not to do that again.Triggered by my reaction, he made a more provocative statement about her.SNAP.In a few seconds, he and I were rolling on the ground, grappling each other. A pretty decent crowd started gathering around, but no one bothered to stop us.He was bigger and stronger than me. It was totally a rush of adrenaline. Somehow, I managed to break one of his teeth. He was bleeding profusely.A day later, the two families were summoned to the school for a meeting. After an hour of discussion, he and I were made to apologize to each other.Somehow, we reached a middle ground. The drama was over, I thought.But my mother had other plans.The next day, she accompanied me to the school. While we were on the way, I kept asking her why she was coming with me. She would not answer.She was waiting at the reception area. The classes started and when the break arrived, she marched into my class pretty aggressively.It would be an understatement if I said I was scared. What now? What next?As the whole class was watching, she pulled me toward herself and demanded that I apologize to him right there.I groaned in hesitation, but her eyes were fixed on me and those were stern. I could see righteous anger in her eyes.I mustered all the strength in me and mumbled “I am sorry” as he smiled a little, looking confused. “Say that louder,” my mom roared.“I am sorry,” I said a little louder and in a more shaky voice. I almost cried. In my head, I had killed him a thousand times within those few seconds.I felt insulted, humiliated and I was definitively convinced that my mother was wrong and stupid. That night, during dinner, I asked her why she shamed me in front of so many students and teachers.“You shamed him in public and apologized within four walls. How is that fair?” she said, as she served me food.Though I felt some logic in her words, I did not buy that totally. I was young, immature.Ten years later.I was invigilating an exam and I disqualified a student’s work because I was sure he was copying. Every symptom persuaded me to believe that.He did not argue because it was a rule there; whatever the invigilator says goes. I grabbed his papers and asked him to exit the class. He did.The next day, in a bit of uncertainty, I checked the camera footages and heck, I found that he had not been copying, but merely looking toward the other side.I checked the footage for all the instances that I had assumed to be suspicious.I was wrong. He was right. It hit me hard.The next week, in a similar test, before I could hand over the question papers, I stood in front of everyone and said this:“Uh..hmm..guys, a minute please. I guess …uh….I owe an apology to Rohan. He was not copying in his test last week. It was …uh…..my error in judgement. I am ….uh……sorry, Rohan. You will write the test again.”Every word wrestled me and crept out of my mouth begrudgingly.Trust me, it took a lot of courage and power to say that. Everyone beamed. Rohan stood up and said thanks.He was given a re-test later that week.That night, while I was talking to my mother over the phone, I told her this. We also spoke of what had happened ten years ago.She said “Ben…”And, after a short pause, she continued “…seems like you have matured, darling.”There was a brief silence. I could hear her wiping off her tears and adjusting her slightly-trembling voice.“I am glad that I raised you, Ben.”That is when I realized I finally matured.Nothing like being raised by a Lioness :)","47,950 followers",Jedidiah Benhur Margoschis Wisely,26.8K,168,18.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Anyone-engaged-with-Wipro-Technologies-can-tell-me-how-much-they-are-automotive-manufacturing-is-it-worth-joining
