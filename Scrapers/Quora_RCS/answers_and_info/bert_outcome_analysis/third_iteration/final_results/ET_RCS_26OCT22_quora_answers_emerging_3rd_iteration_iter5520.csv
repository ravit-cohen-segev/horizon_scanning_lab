1,"When I started as US Army MP we had sirens mounted on the front right quarter panel of the car or jeep. They looked like this:You have a switch you turned on and siren would start winding up with higher and higher pitch, then you shut the switch off and let the internal wheels that made the noise slow down then hit the switch again and started the pitch back on and up again.We used to make the joke: how do you know when to cut the switch and let the wheels slow down? When the pitch of the siren is so high that blood is coming out of your ears.When I started as US Army MP we had sirens mounted on the front right quarter panel of the car or jeep.

2,"Yes it has. The early days had a wail type siren, the real early ones were hand cranked. Sometime in the 1960’s when electronics were introduced to siren control they offered a choice of different sounds, the High-Low sound similar to the old Britts cars, and that raspy loud horn, and the standard wail. As electronics got better and siren bars became better, different sounds were put in but they were still limited, you don’t want to confuse the citizens. Testing was shown that at highway speeds and with the sound proofing of modern vehicles it was difficult to hear an approaching police sirenYes it has.

3,"The technology has been pretty static since the introduction of the electronic “siren” you still hear these days. Before that we used the old mechanical sirens which were unable to be switched on and off quickly.As to the usage… well drivers of emergency vehicles today tend to shut them off unless they are truly needed at a particular time and place. The driver will often give a “whoop” just when approaching an intersection, for instance. This practice also allows the drivers of emergency vehicles to hear what is going on around them. With the old mechanical sirens this was not practical.",4 followers,Matthew Bates,1K,9.8K,293.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Have-emergency-vehicle-siren-technology-usage-in-the-United-States-changed-in-the-past-20-years

I'm already bombarded by a few hundred emails a day, and it's a hassle just to dig through the headers and see which ones might merit further investigation. And within the defense and intelligence community, we're finally starting to move away from email listservs and on to more modern technologies like (classified) blogs and wikis, to more widely disperse information to needed consumers.You can't talk about any mailing list in the defense industry without mentioning STRATFOR. The sheer amount of product they provide and the scope of their coverage makes them a standby, even when they're wrong.I like Breaking Defense. I'm admittedly a bit biased, as they're part of the Breaking Media group, which runs Above the Law (basically, Gawker for lawyers) and I know the senior editorial staff of ATL.  However, Breaking Defense is a genuinely great site for emergent technology, and defense acquisition speculation; especially on the financial side of things.Foxtrot Alpha is great for aviation news -- it's the military aviation sub-blog from Jalopnik.  They can be fanboy-ish at times, but they are usually one of the first places to post really good video content.Diplopundit: unfortunately it is likely to shut down in two weeks or so due to lack of funding. If it sticks around, it's the single best blog for State department/foreign affairs news.The United States Army [ http://www.army.mil/info/organization/natick/ ]publishes news about what's going on at Natick.Wikipedia is (unsurprisingly, as I used to work for them) the best source on the internet for finding out about new technology. The Military History wikiproject in particular is very highly organized, and can point you in the right direction. I'm a bit burnt out on Wikipedia after nearly 20,000 edits over nearly 10 years but it's still something that I check every day. And anybody in the IC who says they don't rely on Wikipedia is lying to your face.Obviously, if you have access to intellipedia, intellink, defenselink, diplopedia, or other non-public sources, those are great.

If the military has the need for advanced radar-absorbing composites for aircraft, they have virtually unlimited funds to drive R&D. They do not, however, have a need for raytraced forests at 60fps in a first person shooter game, so they don’t drive development of graphics cards.Also, there’s this thing where people don’t understand what “mil spec” means. People might think, say, a mil spec processor is the fastest, fanciest CPU on the market. In fact, it’s probably slower, maybe significantly slower, than CPUs on the consumer market. It’s not mil spec because it’s the fastest, but because it’s radiation hardened and fault tolerant and perhaps encased in a shockproof carrier.And of course long lead times on military procurement often freezes in older-spec hardware.So you see a weird mix in military tech of super-advanced materials and optics and sensors and such, ten years or more ahead of anything you thought possible, being driven by processors and computer hardware that’s fifteen years out of date. (Last I heard, American attack helicopters still use Pentium processors for the avionics and sensor suites. Pure speculation, but I wouldn’t be surprised to learn there are super-high-tech prototypes flying around Area 51 still using pre-Intel Core hardware.)And in the comments, these words appear:I am a stalker, troll of trolls;Look on my Rants, ye Quorans, and despair!Nothing beside remains.

9,"Emerging technologies are found in a variety of ways. Sometimes they are developed in response to a specific need, while others result from serendipity or chance. New technologies are often discovered through research and development (R&D). Scientists and engineers spend years exploring different possibilities and testing different hypotheses in search of new and better ways to do things. Some technologies are also discovered through commercial applications.","358,964 followers",Sean Kernan,9.1K,5.6K,726.9M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-are-emerging-packaging-technologies
