There are too many like myself who enjoy being behind the wheel.Some of the freedoms we have today will likely go away. GPS combined with services like Google Maps could lead to the federal government mandating that all cars have the maximum speed of the vehicle governed at the posted speed limit for their location. Meaning, in a 30 mph zone, you can stand on the accelerator, but the car will never exceed the 30 mph speed limit.

There are too many like myself who enjoy being behind the wheel.Some of the freedoms we have today will likely go away. GPS combined with services like Google Maps could lead to the federal government mandating that all cars have the maximum speed of the vehicle governed at the posted speed limit for their location. Meaning, in a 30 mph zone, you can stand on the accelerator, but the car will never exceed the 30 mph speed limit. As soon as you leave there and enter a 55 mph zone, the car will adjust, allowing you to accelerate to a maximum of 55. Construction areas would have special equipment that would communicate with the vehicles, forcing them to slow to the construction zone speed limit.I’m also expecting traffic lights with computer-coded identification as to specific location and direction of approaching traffic to indicate the specific light at the moment to include a countdown to when the light is going to switch to yellow, then red. The car’s computer will pick this up and override the driver’s attempt to run the yellow light, instead, gradually slowing the car down to a stop.I’m looking forward to changes like this from a safety perspective. But I’m going to miss, from a complete stop, not being able to stand on the accelerator of my Dodge Charger Police Pursuit vehicle while the sandwhich that I neglected to remove from the dash flys past my head in a trajectory easily sending it toward the back seat.²Footnotes:","5,085 followers",Bobby Tatro,1.2K,2.2K,45.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Will-traffic-laws-always-adapt-to-emerging-technologies
1,"You have large electric motors running loco engines today. These take energy from overhead lines. Number of diesel engines today also have such motors, where diesel engines generate electricity to run these motors. So motor capabilities will not be a question, but the point is to be able to supply the electricity on-board.Already metro trains are getting powered by batteries/ supercapacitors in number of countries. Trams are routinely using both supercapacitors and / or batteries.For long distance trains, it will be more economical to supply from overhead lines, while for boats, you need on-boYou have large electric motors running loco engines today.

Work is already on to use huge batteries or fuel cells for these boats, and in short time we will find the results. Electric powered self sufficient boats should be a reality in short time.Even small planes are being made to run on battery power, and it is predicted that in few years we will have all electric planes even on long routes, powered by batteries or fuel cells on-board.","2,042 followers",David Filmer,1.4K,3.3K,11.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Will-traffic-laws-always-adapt-to-emerging-technologies
2,Yes. Here’s one:The Chevy BoltAnd another:The 2018 Nissan LeafAnd another:The Tesla Model 3.In stores now!Or did you mean “as affordable as a base-model Honda Civic?” We’re working on that. I give it 5 years for the kind of battery capacity in any of the 3 cars above to beYes.

3,"Around 10 years ago, the price/performance of Lithium Ion batteries was good enough to make a practical EV. Thus was born the Tesla Roadster.Since then, battery prices have continued to fall, despite increases in components like lithium and cobalt.No “revolutionary” technologies are necessary to keep progressing this way. Simply better manufacturing efficiency and economies of scale.Having said that though, I would look at 2 techs.Lithium Iron Phosphate, which is well established, safer than Li Ion, uses no cobalt, and is environmentally friendly. In terms of power/weight, they are not betterAround 10 years ago, the price/performance of Lithium Ion batteries was good enough to make a practical EV.

Simply better manufacturing efficiency and economies of scale.Having said that though, I would look at 2 techs.Lithium Iron Phosphate, which is well established, safer than Li Ion, uses no cobalt, and is environmentally friendly. In terms of power/weight, they are not better than Li Ion but they will set a ceiling on how high prices can go. This is a near term tech in that Lithium Iron Phosphate batteries are already in use.Sodium Glass batteries use glass as an electrolyte. This makes them inherently safer, able to charge faster, hold a bigger charge and eventually be cheaper since sodium is far more abundant than lithium. With all these promises, I am a bit skeptical but the research has been led by John B. Goodenough (the inventor of the Lithium Ion battery) so he has a pretty good track record. This is a mid term tech since its still in the research stage.Finally, I would look at recharging technologies.

4,"It's not so much about technological breakthroughs as it is about supply and demand.Right now there aren’t enough factories producing batteries in order to supply the car manufacturer’s with enough batteries to make all the electric cars that the world wants, right now. But they are coming. It just takes time. Once the batteries are available the prices will fall.",3 followers,Steve Baker,513,27.4K,163.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-emerging-battery-technologies-that-will-revolutionize-electric-motor-capabilities-enough-to-make-electric-cars-and-boats-more-economical-to-consumers

6,"1. Wind PowerHuge strides have been made over the past 20 years to harvest the power of wind. Progress is bred from necessity, of course, as growing global concerns about global warming and ecological damage caused by pollution call for cleaner, sustainable energy.2. Solar EnergyMuch like wind energy, solar energy has seen an increase in efficiency and a decrease in price in recent years, making solar power a $3-billion industry. New legislation and regulations which make it affordable for businesses and homeowners to convert to solar are responsible for solar energy’s growth over the past 5 y1.

Solar EnergyMuch like wind energy, solar energy has seen an increase in efficiency and a decrease in price in recent years, making solar power a $3-billion industry. New legislation and regulations which make it affordable for businesses and homeowners to convert to solar are responsible for solar energy’s growth over the past 5 years, and 2016 will be no different.While only a third of the solar energy available in the US is currently harnessed in the west, this area is geographically superior for solar power generation, and improved government incentives in California indicate this will be the fastest-growing market.3. 3D PrintingThe new millennium has brought us some mind-blowing technology, but none has more potential for impacting the entire world quite like 3D printing.If you’re not familiar with the concept, 3D printers are loaded with additives which can be used like ink to create 3-dimensional objects. That’s4. Legal MarijuanaLegal marijuana sales have grown exponentially since 2012, when Colorado legalized the drug and created the world’s first fully regulated market for recreational marijuana use. In addition to selling the raw plant, it is also being sold as concentrates, edibles, and even beauty products in order to expand the market.Marijuana sales are expected to surpass $20 billion between now and 2020, and that’s if the market stays its course. If other states legalize recreational marijuana use in that time, the industry could experience even greater success.5. Video GamesOver the years, video game developers have been expanding their appeal to reach new markets, including adults and females. This effort has been paid back many times, as the video game industry commands healthy growth year after year. Consumer confidence continues to improve, and there is speculative excitement regarding new virtual reality (VR) technology.While VR will certainly have an effect on the gaming industry, it also has potential in other markets. Whether or not other industries will adopt VR for practical purposes, such as training medical professionals, remains to be seen.6. Artificial IntelligenceFor having come so far, artificial intelligence still has a long way to go. With hopes that AI will one day be able to help solve humanity’s most pressing concerns, billions of dollars fund the research of artificial intelligence every year. Major players include IT companies like Google and Apple, who are already leaders in the field, providing us with such AI amenities as voice-recognition software and self-driving cars.Experts expect the global demand for “smart” machines will increase 20% every year until at least 2020.7. Sustainable Construction MaterialsIn the wake of an international recession, many countries, including the United States, are creating an initiative to boost construction jobs. There are plenty of post-industrial sites around the developed world which need to be rebuilt, and much like the call for sustainable energy sources, governments and consumers alike are calling for greener building materials.Green construction is currently a $36-billion industry, and it is expected to grow an additional 10% by 2020.This industry depends heavily on consumer demand, and may have an even greater outlook with increased government regulations and successful marketing.8. Cyber Fraud DetectionWhere there’s an opportunity to make a quick buck, be sure that there are criminals out there concocting a plan. The trend of doing business and keeping sensitive information on computers will increase, and so will the demand for protection against cyber criminals.Businesses and individuals alike will require protection from cyber fraud for the foreseeable future, but in the next 5 years, this industry is expected to grow over 12% annually.9. DronesDrone technology is new, but the potential for application in a variety of other industries including agriculture, the military, and parcel delivery have already caught the attention of investors. This creates an excellent opportunity in the market to expand research and development of drones, making them more viable with each in iteration. With a projected annual growth of almost 17% annually until 2022, very little is likely to stifle the growth of this industry.10. SiliconRelated to the demand for solar panels, silicon has also been a slowly but steadily growing market in the past decades. In addition to solar panels, silicon is also required to make electronics and building materials, which you may notice are also on this list. For this reason, experts expect to see silicon’s demand increase in the coming years as other industries take hold.These 10 industries show tremendous potential in 2016 and beyond, indicating a future of environmental consciousness and an even greater focus on electronics and AI.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-emerging-battery-technologies-that-will-revolutionize-electric-motor-capabilities-enough-to-make-electric-cars-and-boats-more-economical-to-consumers
