The problem with climate impacting pollution is that it is not a matter of technology, but rather a matter of application of technology which we have had.This is not to negate the importance of ongoing improvements in the technology. But most of those improvements are not in the physical aspects of the technology, as much as in economies of scale of production, and fine-tuning tweaks to things.

But most of those improvements are not in the physical aspects of the technology, as much as in economies of scale of production, and fine-tuning tweaks to things. A few years ago it was estimated that a third of the differential cost in siting a solar panel in Germany and the same in the U.S. was the U.S. regulatory complexity - in other words paperwork.Energy efficiency has been cheaper than energy supply for longer than I’ve been engaged. The first deliberate efficiency programs I know of were in the 1960’s. My state is fighting battles over corrupt mismanagement at two aging and failing coal power plants which were built to serve the DOE nuclear program. Way back in 1952 an efficiency program rendered two thirds of the power from those plants irrelevant for the planned purpose, and people have been fighting over the output of those plants since.The U.S. could double utility scale efficiency programs, from costing about $8 billion per year to $16 billion per year, and saving $30 billion up to $60 billion, simply by raising the efficiency program spending as a percent of total electricity spending in 44 states to the current level in the best six states. Other countries aren’t different, I just don’t know the data for other countries.If we did this today it would approximately double the 1.2% new reduction in total electricity sales per year, leaving approximately $30 billion in everyone’s wallets the first year, and cumulative efficiency activity would raise those savings to $40 billion or more, on top of the present day savings, which are never properly accounted for because they eliminate the need for power plants which are never built, and therefore no one ever has to see the price tag.If you think that’s a poor reflection on U.S. competitiveness, you are right. I mentioned rooftop solar, but to be clear, I don’t spend time on rooftop solar because it is competitive with retail rates, and to eliminate fossil fuel and nuclear generation we have to have something which is competitive with wholesale power production. Rooftop solar is not that. But since around the year 1980, utility scale wind and solar have been - in certain places where power costs are high and wind and sun are plentiful.Each year for the last forty years the footprint where wind and solar were cost-effective got a little larger, because technology improved and made the renewable power a little cheaper. In late 2017 the cost of utility scale wind and solar dropped about 40%, making wind and solar cheaper than 90% of the world’s existing fossil and nuclear power. New utility scale wind and solar are also cheaper than about 90% of the world’s existing hydropower, biomass generation, and geothermal production of power. But if we’re interested in ending fossil fuel use, we hope that those plants will be replaced after the fossil fuels are gone, and we hope that nuclear plants will be run as long as it is safe to do so, because the enormous amount of radioactive waste from nuclear power is the plant core, not the fuel itself.Perhaps two points will illustrate where this is going, plus a third to emphasize how fast it is happening:In 2019, 57% of global photovoltaic panels were sold in developing nations. This isn’t a precise measurement, but it suggests that most solar power development is being used to eliminate the need for expanded fossil fuel consumption, as opposed to displacing existing fossil fuel consumption. This means it is harder to understand how fast wind and solar are growing.As of the middle of 2021, there are at least six multi-billion-dollar projects being proposed to build dedicated wind or solar farms to serve chemical factories, mostly making hydrogen, ammonia fertilizer from the hydrogen, but eventually a lot of different hydrocarbon chemicals and fuels. I know of six, and I also know I don’t know about all the projects.What this second point shows is that 100% of the chemicals and plastics we get from fossil fuels can be produced without prehistoric carbon being moved into the atmosphere. If we recycle carbon from the air or water, we are not changing the atmospheric balance.The third point, to emphasize that the online chatter is pretty far behind the actual practice, is the simple fact that most of the world’s automakers are already in the electric car space, and several have announced a ten to twenty year timeframe for phasing out of gasoline engine production. The average car stays in service 12 years, and so we can suggest that the only gasoline being consumed in about 2045 will be renewable.A point I often make, but which seems especially hard to make stick, is that it matters a lot less when the last gallon of fossil crude oil is produced than it matters how fast we move today to implement all the money-saving efficiency and renewables we can identify.In forty years of activism to reduce the impacts of soot and smog, I have never participated in a serious conversation about how to speed adoption of technology we already have. A few near calls are memorable. I remember an ACEEE conference, in 2007 I think, when a presenter explained how incentives could be used to enlist utility support. I tried the theory, and over 12 years my state spent $1.9 billion, saving $12 billion, and sharing somewhere between $600 and $720 million of that with the utilities. Responses from environmental organizations ranged from indifference to outright hostility.My mother had a photograph of a bird-watching tour. The camera looks down from a high place, perhaps in a tree, at a crowd of about thirty people in a large old growth forest clearing. Every single person in the picture is looking in a different direction. I have thought about using the picture in a presentation, but I can’t find it. Perhaps that is as good as any explanation as to why we are so terrible at using what we have well.The advent of clean energy offers us humans an opportunity to make our global economy stronger than it has ever been before in human history - easily defying the invention of an economy to make it a question of what really is measured by economic activity.I give four reasons, in order of importance:Economic growth;Jobs;Human health (soot and smog kill an estimated 3.8 million people per year, and send hundreds of millions to doctors or to go without care every year for respiratory illness due to soot and smog);climate.The biggest single problem with the effort to reduce greenhouse gases is that advocates have given in completely to deniers who seek to divert the conversation from economics, jobs and human health, to a trivial matter of “science”. And we already have what we need. We just don’t know how to make ourselves use it systematically.","69,840 followers",Marius Kramer,5.3K,2K,192.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-emerging-technologies-have-the-best-chances-of-combating-climate-change

As soon as range gets over 250 to 300 miles and the price is competitive with gas powered cars the conversion to EVs will save half of the CO2 expended for personal transportation.Utility scale battery storage to increase the “capacity factor” of utility scale PV and wind projects will help. Renewable generation could replace 90% of the fossil generation very quickly except for seasonal regional demands. Possibly redox flow batteries could fill the gap as new technology (but the science ad the technology of redox flow batteries is decades old, but new chemistry could make it cheaper, less corrosive and less toxic.Smart-grid applications that make it simple to control natural thermal energy storage in domestic hot water tanks could flatten the demand peaks and force the demand curve follow the renewable generation curve for much the time. Now the generation follows the demand.Smart grid “vehicle to grid” support for voltage and frequency stabilization could also help to extend the distribution system as it assumes increasing loads. Massively distributing residential scale PV generation to the ends of distribution spurs will also help.Major thermal retrofit of all buildings is probably the most important issue, and requires no new technology.","16,662 followers",Lee Thé,699,10.1K,80.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-emerging-technologies-have-the-best-chances-of-combating-climate-change

Once they become of practical use, which doesn't seem too distant a future, the pace of our technology will not only increase but change direction as well.To start with, It will have a massive impact on cryptography. Prime factorization is one of the hardest computational problems, and so, many systems bet on its improbability to be secured. Apparently, Q-computers are good at factorization, they can hack into most of these security systems more easily than classic computers. That can change the encryption industry for ever, including blockchain.Another class of problems they can solve is to simulate complex chemical reactions. Up until now, we do not fare well in this area. Consequently our understanding of many chemical processes is very limited. Q-computers can give us deep insights into these reactions and give us the power to design better processes which might be remarkably more efficient than old ones.Simulating molecules is surely an area where classical computers suck. A few atoms can be managed, but the complexity grows exponentially with every added atom. So by the time we reach any practical organic molecule, they just give it up to eternity. Q-computers can do it much better. It is not because of the power of calculations that they win by, but it is the way Q-computers do calculations, they are especially suited for these kinds of problems. The biochemists are already euphoric with the possibility of simulating large molecules like proteins. We will gain a new understanding of biochemistry and possibly engineer these large molecules to make new materials. This can have an immense impact on healthcare industry amongst others.Speaking of materials, material science is another area where Q-computers will shine high and far above their classical cousins. This will possibly give us the power to design wonderful new materials that are currently unthinkable. Vibranium (from Wakanda), Unobtainium (from avatar) and all other fictional materials may well be within our reach with Q-computers.The amount of data our telescopes and radio telescopes generate is impossible to process with even the biggest supercomputers we will ever have. It is fairly possible that we will know the presence of ET decades after our telescopes discover them if we rely on classic computation. Q-computers will change that too and give us a big jump in our search for cosmological wonders.The possibilities are endless.While the effects of AI and block-chain are more visible and predictable, the effect that Q-computers may have on our lives is nearly unthinkable right now. That is the reason I am most excited to see Quantum computing becoming a reality.Here is a little comic strip explaining the progress we have made on quantum computing… just for a chuckle.
