Let me explain...I've watched more than a few episodes ofCould he? Certainly - it's plausible. Is he? No, not really, not in that sense, but possibly yes (it all depends on your definitions). Let me explain...I've watched more than a few episodes ofI'm fascinated by the insanely ridiculous explanations people will come up with to avoid dealing with the obvious. So much for Ockham's razor. What do I mean? First, this perspective requires us to narcissistically view all predecessor civilizations egoistically, as if WE'RE the only ones capable of technology or innovation, and it requires us to presume an androcentric view of the world and an ethnocentric view of humanity, despising every one before us as inferior. All of these perspectives are quite arrogant. And all of theseYes, every one of these civilizations has wiped itself out through their advancements and political decisions related to them (or in some cases, ignorance of the outside world's threats - see my blog post on that regarding Macchu Picchu:In fact, if you take the perspective of Christianity, God is a creative genius who created man in His image. If that's true, why wouldn't there be a perpetual craving for knowledge and innovation?In full disclosure, I should tell you that I'm an ordained Christian minister and have been in some form of ministry for over 3 decades. But lest you write me off as some irrelevant fundamentalist, you should know that I'm an experienced educator too, with a Masters in technology and a Doctorate in ministry, and I also love to read up on theoretical physics as well as the writings of Hawking and Sagan…as well as psychology and neuroscience. I also love science fiction, Doctor Who, time travel movies, andAnd the cool thing is: We can't even begin to articulate all that's possible in just the part of the known universe we can observe. Newtonian physics can only explain so much (and it's a very limited perspective tied mostly to Earth's limitations). Quantum physics explains a lot more, but still can't explain it all, either. M-theory (string theory) tries to integrate these and comes even closer to a ""theory of everything,"" but we're still woefully behind in our comprehension. The most brilliant minds in our world have tried to research and explain all this, and still can't: Einstein spent the latter part of his life trying to come up with it, as did Sagan and as had Hawking (in their respective specialties) and we still can't explain what lies beyond the event horizon of a black hole and we can only begin to articulate how space, time, gravity, and light are all interrelated.So to your question: Why do we have to presume that Jesus was from an advanced alien civilization and his miracles were simply advanced technology? That perspective seems to limit the options and avoid the inescapably obvious: He told us EXACTLY who He was and why He came and what His purpose for being here was.Moreover, why would He willingly choose to suffer and die at the hands of an oppressive religious regime (which He had publicly chastised and repudiatedBut let me go a step further. We call the things He did (and similar acts done by various saints through time) ""miracles"" because they defy all the norms and laws of science as we understand them and seem impossible. But that's right back to the androcentric & ethnocentric presumption of reality. If God or Jesus are indeed interterrestial beings (and I don't mean ""alien"" in the Area 51 sense, just ""not of this world""), and especially if they transcend space and time, thenSo why can't it be that He transcends space and time and so was in full control of gravity and light and everything else we know and willingly chose to LIMIT Himself while on earth to accomplish His mission? If so, then the miracles aren't implausible and dubiousMy favorite illustration of this comes from the movie(or see myIf we as finite humans can conceive of such advanced capability and beautifully depict it in a powerfully realistic movie (one which several theoretical physicists such as Kip Thorne and Michio Kaku praise as the gold standard of moviemaking for their intentional quest for accuracy to current known and theoretical science), then why can't God be so much more than we can conceive of? And why can't Jesus function in that interstellar role as a transcendent being?So in a sense, He IS part of an advanced otherworldly race, but not in the very limited sense of alien lifeforms but instead in a much more diverse and multiversal ""time lord"" sense, one which cares very deeply about His creation and longs for meaningful relationship with it.@",0 followers,Peter,816,43.6K,167.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Could-Jesus-Christ-be-the-member-of-a-highly-advanced-alien-civilization-that-visited-us-in-the-past-and-the-miracles-performed-by-him-could-be-based-on-pure-tech-incomprehensible-to-us

That all circuitry and functions are made down to the nanoscale.Then obviously being able to replicate or reverse engineer such technology would be no picnic. It may even take humanity decades to make any significant progress.In the end it all comes down to how advance their technology is.Imagine for example that it was determined that the ship was made of elements that go way beyond those known in the periodic table.That alone would be a tremendous setback to any attempt at reverse engineering the technology.Mostly because before you could even think of copying the technology, you would first need to discover how to create those same elements.If you couldn't create them then that would be it, any further discoveries would be halted indefinitely.",37 followers,Ankita Sinha,534,626,52.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Could-Jesus-Christ-be-the-member-of-a-highly-advanced-alien-civilization-that-visited-us-in-the-past-and-the-miracles-performed-by-him-could-be-based-on-pure-tech-incomprehensible-to-us
