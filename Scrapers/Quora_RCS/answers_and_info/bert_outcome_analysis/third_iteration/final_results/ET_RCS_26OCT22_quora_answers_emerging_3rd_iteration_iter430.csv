1,"TL;DR: It is possible.Background: I am currently pursuing an internship working for an IT project in a semiconductor manufacturing company (doesn’t sound too CS, I presume) and in the past I also had an internship at a small technology company.A few months ago a Facebook recruiter messaged me on LinkedIn mentioning the opportunity for Software Engineering Intern. I then decided to proceed with the opportunity she mentioned, and after I discussed about some details of the internship and provided my resume, I proceeded to have a video interview with a London-based engineer.For some reasons, I feTL;DR: It is possible.Background: I am currently pursuing an internship working for an IT project in a semiconductor manufacturing company (doesn’t sound too CS, I presume) and in the past I also had an internship at a small technology company.A few months ago a Facebook recruiter messaged me on LinkedIn mentioning the opportunity for Software Engineering Intern.

It was quite sad (because who wouldn’t?), though on the other side I got to know about:I believe the main tips to get recognized by a recruiter is to have at least an acceptable online presence, showcasing your achievements and what you have done/are doing. I have yet to heard of a recruiter approaching me before, so knowing that people are actively approaching candidates has made it important for me to emphasize that point.",26 followers,Soham Mehta,576,148,70.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/I-am-from-Nanyang-Technological-University-in-Singapore-Is-it-impossible-for-me-to-get-interviews-from-top-tech-firms-like-Facebook

It provided a good overview of current trends in the industry.If there is one takeaway I’m left with from that conference, it’s this:The industry at the start of 2019 is mainly preoccupied with how to work together in teams and how to operationalize machine learning.There was actually very little talk about modelling, deep learning and how to do data science itself. This is somewhat of a «solved problem» by now. And I say solved with a big caveat, because there is obviously lots of progress still to be made in this area. But it’s not where the industry is facing major bottlenecks.The tools and frameworks have improved a lot, and so has the talent pool. Most data scientists in 2019 are quite capable of coming up with accurate prediction models for well-defined problems in a lab environment. However, there’s a lot between that and havingMany companies have been burned by deploying and forgetting about models without monitoring them properly. They become unstable, inaccurate and eventually, useless. Perhaps they were even useless in the first place, because they weren’t properly aligned with the business.A question that several of the talks at the conference tried to address was:A big trend that was also mentioned frequently isThere are many companies getting intoAll of these trends have to do with organization. Like I said, there was little focus on the technical aspects of machine learning itself, and I think that reflects current industry trends.Finally, there is the issue of ethics.

4,"Does data analytics tell you the future?tldr: No.There are several types of analytics (see below). The type relevant to your question is predictive analytics. This does not make “predictions” in the manner of Carnac the Magnificent. Instead, predictive analytics uses data and statistics to forecast likely outcomes based on past performance or behaviors. At the most basic level, it is very much like meteorology. Forecasting, however, doesn’t sound nearly as sexy as predictive analytics.Image from:Does data analytics tell you the future?tldr: No.There are several types of analytics (see below).
