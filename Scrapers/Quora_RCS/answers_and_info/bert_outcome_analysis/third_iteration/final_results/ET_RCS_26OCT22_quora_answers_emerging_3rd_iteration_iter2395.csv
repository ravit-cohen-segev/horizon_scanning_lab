Economic changes, including those flowing from new technologies, do create losers as well as winners. Pretending otherwise is dishonest. Focusing only on the winners and ignoring the losers is dishonest. And leaving the losers high and dry is bad for your economy and your society.This doesn’t mean technology should be banned. It doesn’t mean economic changes should be banned. It means we should think about people’s jobs being eliminated. We should expect these changes and have plans for coping.An ideal coping mechanism is education, especially K-12 that provides the skills for more than one job. This is the opposite of “I grew up in a mining town; mining is the only job I’ve ever had; it’s the only job I’m qualified for; now what am I gonna do?”Another ideal coping mechanism is a diversified economy. It’s the opposite of “This is a mining town. Everyone works for the mine or supplies something for the miners.”Since not everyone gets a good education and not every economy is diverse, we also need safety net programs. Those need improvement. Especially job retraining programs, especially those that say, “You should learn to program, move from West Virginia to Silicon Valley, and find a job. I’m sure that will work great.”",1 follower,Peter Spering,1K,5.3K,82.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-arguments-against-advanced-technology

Notting Hill then was not the affluent area that it became decades later, but just another dingy post-war slum. A place mostly made up of poor but decent people trying to maintain some semblance of dignity after escaping the blitz.Shortly after moving in, Timothy’s wife Beryl gave birth to a little girl. Even though they struggled immensely—Timothy’s difficulties made it hard for him to hold down a job, his wife wasn’t very good at managing their funds—they seemed to scrape on by. A year later though, things got dicey when Beryl found herself pregnant again. They couldn’t afford another baby and abortion was illegal at the time, so what were they to do? That’s where fellow tenant and wannabe landlord John Christie stepped in, claiming to have knowledge on how to do an abortion and offering to help the couple. Desperate and vulnerable, they accepted.Whilst Timothy was elsewhere, Christie strangled, raped and killed this 19 year old pregnant woman. Then he strangled their 13 month old baby, Geraldine. Christie framed Timothy for the murders and the widowed father ended up hanging for crimes he did not commit.This flesh and blood human being whose only crime was being vulnerable, this flesh and blood human being who had everything taken from him — his wife, his infant daughter and his unborn son, had his life stolen from him for no good reason. He had to endure the fear, the pain and the injustice of his position until the rope snapped his innocent neck.If that’s not good enough reason to do away with the death penalty, I don’t know what is.","18,989 followers",Ian York,1.4K,1.4K,10.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-arguments-against-advanced-technology

This tech is classified in the category of science of electromagnetic field--which means that it operates mainly on waves that can be expanded across the electromagnetic spectrum.Since electromagnetic waves (a.k.a. microwaves) travel a speed of light, cannot be seen, felt or detected by any human ability without the assistance of another special technology, and can permeate through anything, such as human body, walls, ceilings, underground and underwater, any military weapon like satellite technology that features these characteristics becomes the ultimate.  Furthermore, satellite sits in the space where no one can see and monitor its activities and where no governance of human law exists.  This geographic point of advantage gives it the most freedom of will.  This is why the U.S. government has been continuously investing in the expansion of space program ever since it was first developed in the 1950's by a group of German immigrant scientists.Satellite was first conceived primarily to serve the U.S. military purpose of  surveying the ground activities of the Communist Russians.  Its civil applications only came secondarily years later and very often is used as a mean to mask its military uses (that's why most of us know so little about this).Satellite technology has the unsurpassed capabilities of reading, controlling and manipulating human body, mind, attitudes and behaviors.  Since it works on electromagnetic energy and human body is a walking circuit and human brain also operates on microwaves, its ability to intimately interface and interact with human body and mind is incredibly sophisticated...unimaginable by anyone.  It can easily operate a human much like a fashion of a zombie with the speed of light.  It can produce mass human destruction...far beyond the nuclear capability... in term of speed, magnitude and expansiveness.  In term of being a weapon of destruction and spying, satellite technology is the unmatched well-kept jewel of the U.S. government ever developed in the history of man.  In the civil setting, it permeates almost every aspect of life on earth.  In addition to its interfacing ability with human brain and body, it can interface with all  electronic devices such as computer, ATM and mobile phone.  It can access into anything that is digital.  It can also easily disenable any of these devices in split seconds.Now, if you stand back and gather all the information provided above and project that into a large integrated picture, you will realize how unimaginably powerful satellite technology is in the setting of military, politics and economics.  The limit of this satellite technology in the technology-and-human relationship is only bound to the creativity  and imagination of an human satellite operator.P.s. If satellite technology can do numbers of things on human that are only to be limited by the will and creativity of its human operator and no one would ever know about this, would you think that the U.S. government  dares to use this technology to monitor and spy on the activities of its civilians right in their homes and turn its citizens into zombies in order to put forth various large scale economic and political agendas.  If a human can be controlled and manipulated into any possible form of biological states that a human body can possibly respond, such as going from being healthy to sickness, without ever being known, then he or she can be ruthlessly turned into an economic commodity to promote various economic industries that links to healthcare.","4,877 followers",Jim Mowreader,4.3K,15.3K,57.3M,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-arguments-against-advanced-technology

Supposedly, this technology was used to help cripple the Iraqi air defense system when the US invaded.This was important to Cisco because we were working in security and cryptography and the NSA was forever trying to get us to corrupt our products so they could un-encrypt foreign transmissions on the fly. One time we were required to corrupt product that had been shipped to China and it started a major debate about our fiduciary responsibility to the country or to the customer. The issue was that if you sell a security product that you know is corrupted, you are knowingly committing fraud and are liable. As the Product Manager at the time I asked the NSA if they would stand behind us (and me as I might be personally liable) in court if we were discovered. Of course the answer from the NSA was “Hell no.”We were on our own. We then entered into a long debate about how to detect Easter eggs and other corruption introduced into security products unknowingly through another vendor’s corrupted hardware. The issue was never resolved but it should be known that our security source code HAD to be provided to the NSA in order to get FIPS certification and they made certain changes to it.So to answer your question, USA military technology is advanced far beyond anyone’s knowledge to describe the extent.On the other hand, the Chinese probably know more about our technology than we do since they perpetrated the greatest security breach in history by compromising the RSA key technology used by almost everyone in the world. We only learned of it through the vigilance of Lockheed-Martin who discovered the breach accidentally.

The US has been doing that for a long time anyway because no country is strong enough to fight the US.That is why many people see the US government as the biggest terrorist in the world!",UNKNOWN,Joan Vredik Broadley,1.4K,12K,40.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-arguments-against-advanced-technology

24,"It’s the other way around! China and Russia have been hell bent on stealing US and western technologies for a long time. In fact, the majority - if not all - of China’s today commercial and military technologies are stolen from the West. China’s ambition for world dominance is quite clear. It’s happening everywhere on this planet today. And China is using all kinds of sleazy, illegal, and immoral tactics to get what it wants, whether it’s natural resources from Africa or technology from the Silicon Valley in California.
