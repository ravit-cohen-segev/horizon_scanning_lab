We take three leaps forward and are smacked back two of them. This pattern has repeated itself many many times for many many reasons - cultural, political, environmental, you name it…So - speculation …There’s a theory going around out there that had we not lost the Library at Alexandria and had Christianity not run roughshod through the West - we probably would have landed a man on the Moon sometime during the 14th or 15th century. Imagine - we would now be in the 600th year or so after man first took to space. Let’s imagine if Mezzo-America were not ravaged by Spain, or Baghdad never fell to the Great Khan - basically imagine we humans were not so prone to clashing violently when cultures first encounter each other, but rather more prone to collaborations, we might have already merged Gravity and Quantum Mechanics a couple of hundred years ago … we may have thought in our current lifetime of cancer as antiquated a problem as bubonic plague. Then again, we might have already produced sapient machines or hyper weapons and gone extinct, or disappeared into virtual reality by now …Basically - the long and short of it is this we are exactly as “advanced” as we “should be” … Because no matter what, there will always be fits and starts - if it wasn’t one thing it would inevitably be another. Learning and progress is a journey of peaks, valleys, detours, switchbacks, circles, and leaps. And while it would be amazing to know Berrosus’ ancient history in three volumes, or the actual original words of Jesus, or the surgical techniques of the pyramid builders, or seen the steam engines and wind turbines invented by Hero of Alexandria… actually accessing those things doesn’t preclude that history would have produced some other unavoidable correction that would have knocked us down a peg or two … or ten.","220,559 followers",Franklin Veaux,3K,47.3K,782.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-would-this-world-be-without-technology-What-would-it-be-like-without-the-top-advancements-in-technology-we-have-today

They are contractors and systems integrators, and they compete for two types of projects, large-scale, decades-long weapons programs and maintenance programs. They also will collaborate with other defense contractors on projects and are occasionally allowed to sellLockheed also works primarily on hardware, which is one of the most difficult and expensive kinds of technology you can work on. There are literally billions of things that can go wrong with millions of component parts that are manufactured by dozens of different companies. Something as simple as aThe projects that defense contractors bid on are few and far between, and in large part, the industry has shrunk from its apex in the 1970s and 1980s at the height of the cold war. Many companies that used to compete with Lockheed either sold out of went out of business because there wasn’t enough money to go around.By comparison, the risk of failure at a software company that focuses primarily on consumer products and services is astronomically low. If a service goes down due to a denial of service attack, you can’t get your email for a few hours - that’s annoying, but no one died. If there is a surge in web traffic on black Friday and the payment processing service goes out, sure you’re losing tens of millions of dollars in lost sales, but more than likely those users will come back at some point in the future and buy things again.Companies like Amazon and Google also have a multitude of revenue streams and lines of businesses. They can afford to experiment and fail many, many times with little or no impact on their core businesses. Their profit isn’t the title wave of funding a company like Lockheed gets on a successful bid, but it is a constant drip of profit that builds to a massive river of profit over time.For example, the most expensive failure Amazon has ever had was the Fire Phone. It probably cost the company $300 million and three hard years of work by hundreds of engineers and designers (I was one of them). A three hundred million dollar loss to Lockheed can happen in a single day with a bad Satelite launch or the stroke of a pen.",256 followers,Priyal Gupta,9.7K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-would-this-world-be-without-technology-What-would-it-be-like-without-the-top-advancements-in-technology-we-have-today

He listens and learns. He is particularly good at finding talent, molding them into a team, and driving them to a goal. He is particularly good at creating excellent long-term strategies.When IBM approached him to produce an operating system for their new personal computer, Bill Gates did not hesitate in accepting. Within a short time, Gates purchased a suitable operating system from Seattle Computer Products, which he renamed MS-DOS, and hired Tim Paterson. He delivered product on time.One should note that Gates had a working version of Unix, XENIX, up and running and designed for the new microprocessors when he was approached by IBM. But he didn’t push it. Instead, he went out and bought a DOS from Seattle Computer Products.The strategic moves he made over the next decades are legend.Businessmen should aspire to be the next Bill Gates, but programmers have nothing to learn from him except how to identify and work effectively with the best engineers and programmers.

As a product idea generator, Steve Jobs (also not a programmer) was better at the game. Even as a programmer in his early years, Gates never worked alone. He always had partners and help. He had an acumen for leadership, a drive to lead, was pragmatically and ruthlessly competitive, and made a lot of sound business decisions.Today, Microsoft has close to 150,000 employees. That’s where all that diverse wealth of programming expertise comes from. There isn’t a line of code by Bill Gates anywhere in Microsoft’s line of software products, and there hasn’t been for a very long time.","129,180 followers",Jessica Su,1.2K,1.5K,49.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-Silicon-Valley-technology-companies-to-produce-the-most-notable-Angel-Investors

I was nowhere close to even a regional-Olympiads, let alone International!I started solving problems during my physics club. It took me dozens of problems before I could up my level. I remember one day how I happily approached my teacher and told her: “Fast forward, two years and I was solving international Olympiad problems in ease!How? What did I do? What’s the secret?The secret is…JUST KEEP GOING.Honestly, just keep solving problems and I guarantee that you would get better in this.But DON’T just look up the solutions, and think that you solved the problem without understanding it and move on.You need to think about the problems but most importantly you have to getInstead, ask yourself, “why couldn’t I solve it? How could I have solved this?”Maybe it’s lack ofMaybe you had to thinkOn and on, you do this, and your problem solving would increase. And not only it would be good in physics, but in math, in computer science, and in life.The key point, however, is this:EVERYONE STARTS FROM THE BOTTOM.Nobody is born solving complex problems. Like any skill, problem-solving is developed.Just keep doing it and you WILL get there.

In that case, feel free to see the editorial or google to look for the solution.When you find it, make sure to understand it, and then code it on your own.First, solve ""Easy"" questions of all sections, and then ""Medium"" questions.In fact, solving some ""Medium"" questions is good enough to call yourself a CP professional.And when you make sure that you’re able to solve Medium questions , then start CP on CodeChef that is a much professional practical area to code.Step 3Codechef long contests are the best. Developing your Competitive Programming skills requires that you are both fast and are able to think deeply about a problem.Codechef long challenges = Deep thinking AND Codeforces rounds = Fast codingIf you want to be good, you should try to be good in both these areas.But it's fine if you are just good at long challenges (deep thinking) or just good with short contests (fast thinking), both will help you become a better programmer.Step 4You can try Topcoder if you want. Or just let it be.With CP, if your goal is to get offers from Google HQ and likes, you will have to do it regularly. That is, give contests, try to rank higher, and build your rating.Otherwise, you can just do it on the side and focus on building other practical skills.These practical skills combined with your decent competitive programming experience will go a long way in helping you secure those jobs and internships you dreamed about.Step 5Keep doing this it will take Some time but it is the best way to be a Competitive Programmer.Don’t Be Frustrated.I need Your upvote ,Hit up if you’re also think Programming is Best <3images - Google images",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,10.5K,996,156M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-Silicon-Valley-technology-companies-to-produce-the-most-notable-Angel-Investors
