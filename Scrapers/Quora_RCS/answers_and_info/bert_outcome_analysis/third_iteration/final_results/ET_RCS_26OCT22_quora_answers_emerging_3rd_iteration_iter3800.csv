The Turks withdrew, and the Peace of Drinapolis in 1568 ensured peace along the Danube. The new sultan, II. Selim decided to continue the conquest in the Mediterranean. Here the Turks were in immense dominance, as the Catholic states struggled with their internal problems, especially the Reformation, and did not want to unite their forces against the Muslims.The strongest proponent of united action was Pope Pius VAfter the unsuccessful Turkish siege of Malta in 1565, the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman I expanded to the northwest and attacked Hungary. The old ruler died during the siege of Szigetvár. The Turks withdrew, and the Peace of Drinapolis in 1568 ensured peace along the Danube. The new sultan, II. Selim decided to continue the conquest in the Mediterranean. Here the Turks were in immense dominance, as the Catholic states struggled with their internal problems, especially the Reformation, and did not want to unite their forces against the Muslims.The strongest proponent of united action was Pope Pius V, who since 1566 had encouraged the Christian powers to launch a new crusade against the Ottoman Empire. Suspicious of their conflicting interests, Spain and the Venetian Republic conspired only in 1570, after the Turks occupied the fertile property of the Venetians, Cyprus. The Holy League was born on May 25, 1571. In the agreement, Venice, Spain and the papal state undertook to launch a joint campaign against the Turks.The Christian fleet gathered in the summer of 1571 in the Gulf of Messina. The more than two hundred galleys were equipped by Venice, the Papal State, the King of Spain, the Republic of Genoa, the Principality of Savoy, the Order of St. Stephen of Tuscany, and the Order of Malta. Half of the costs II. It was King Philip of Spain, who thus gained considerable weight in the selection of the commander-in-chief. His half-brother,The Holy League fleet reached the Greek shores in October, where II. Selim's fleet of about three hundred units was stationed. The commander of the army wasThe two fleets consisted of four units each: a main force, two wings, and a reserve. The Turks had more ships and men, but the artillery of the Christians was much stronger. Pasha Ali therefore left few ships in the reserve, preferring to strengthen the center. The Turks achieved results on their right wing led by Csuluk Mehmed at the beginning of the battle, but were eventually defeated. On their left wing, Pasha Ulucs Ali shattered Giovanni Andrea Doria's unit with an embracing operation and broke into the Christian ships. He caused severe losses to the galleys in Malta, Sicily, and Venice, but eventually had to flee Christian fortification.The battle was decided between the main forces, where the two flagships, La Real and the Sultan, clashed. The Christians managed to repel the attack of the Turks and captured Pasha Ali's ship. This caused confusion among the Turks, many of whom began to flee. In the battle, roughly eight thousand of the Christians lost their lives; the number of fallen Turks is estimated at twenty thousand.Although the Turkish fleet was destroyed, Cyprus did not return to Venetian rule. Although the Holy League soon disintegrated, the Ottoman Empire never regained its former naval strength.","1,413 followers",Sven Jeske,2.3K,634,2.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-wouldve-been-the-impact-of-the-usage-of-galleons-by-the-Holy-League-at-Lepanto-Isnt-the-galleon-a-more-advanced-technology-than-the-galley

2,"Weirdly, Valves.Boring, simple valves. They let water out. They keep water in. So what?But the Romans, lacking machine tools and industrialized manufacturing, produced surprisingly standardized and precise in line valves to finely control the water supply to public baths, fountains and quite often, individual homes.The design was simple, a bronze or bronze alloy junction piece with a tightly fitting plug cylinder sleeved within it. This had holes in.

They let water out. They keep water in. So what?But the Romans, lacking machine tools and industrialized manufacturing, produced surprisingly standardized and precise in line valves to finely control the water supply to public baths, fountains and quite often, individual homes.The design was simple, a bronze or bronze alloy junction piece with a tightly fitting plug cylinder sleeved within it. This had holes in. Turn the spindle at the top and the holes align with the pipe allowing water to pass through and vice versa.Some modern valves you get from the hardware shop work the same way and look surprisingly similar.Simple, but to make it work it must be robust and precisely measured. The plug insert has to be a precise fit or it will leak or Caesar up. Ahem sorry,You see, a valve isn't just a valve.If you work back through the reverse butterfly effect of what is required to make a simple device standard across a whole empire that everyone uses, you see it takes a huge amount of collective effort.We have the benefit of fine machine tools, synthetic polymers, stainless steel, a literate population that can read and count, standardized factories. Decades of craftsmen and engineers talking with each other, comparing designs, sharing best practice.You need people to travel to demonstrate to craftsmen what is required. To travel you need efficient transport, or at least roads, and therefor a robust government administration to put that in place.You have to have literacy and numeracy to a degree, otherwise you will have simply a hundred differing artistic interpretations of “valve”, not an empirical design.You need enough of the workforce producing enough of a food surplus that a segment of the population can specialize in making stuff that isn't food. Like valves.All this has to be in place first.Rome, at its heart, was a slave owning economy based on simple agriculture. Human and animal muscle power drove it, and the wind helped blow its ships. In that respect it was little different from the Minoans, Egyptians, Assyrians or any other nameless, ancient culture.And yet the pre-industrial Romans managed to coordinate themselves to such a degree that small groups of craftsmen, as far apart as northern England and Egypt, with hand tools in simple workshops, could produce a standard device that could, literally, plug into a standard plumbing system in different corners of the empire.We picture the great aqueducts sweeping into the cities dumping water into troughs while the eager plebs gather around with their buckets.In actual fact it was a lot more elegant, and indeed modern, than that.","9,584 followers",Matt Riggsby,996,17.3K,56.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-wouldve-been-the-impact-of-the-usage-of-galleons-by-the-Holy-League-at-Lepanto-Isnt-the-galleon-a-more-advanced-technology-than-the-galley

Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party. Because radiation from nuclear accidents is apparently scarier than way more people dying of regular pollution constantly and the total annihilation of all life on Earth as the oceans boil away.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-wouldve-been-the-impact-of-the-usage-of-galleons-by-the-Holy-League-at-Lepanto-Isnt-the-galleon-a-more-advanced-technology-than-the-galley

7,"Transfer learning in ML models.Humans are really good at generalizing. We only have to see a few dogs before we can recognize a dog when we see one.Machines are not.

It's hypothesized that the reason humans learn so quickly is that we are fitting new examples into our existing knowledge rather than forming entirely new categories. If we could teach machines to do the same, they would learn exponentially faster and apply that learning more effectively.Transfer learning is a very hot topic in AI research right now, so I expect major breakthroughs in the next few years. I think this may be sufficient to achieve artificial general intelligence, but even if not, it will dramatically extend the range of tasks that machines can accomplish.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-basic-and-advance-technology-about-which-a-cs-engineers-should-aware
