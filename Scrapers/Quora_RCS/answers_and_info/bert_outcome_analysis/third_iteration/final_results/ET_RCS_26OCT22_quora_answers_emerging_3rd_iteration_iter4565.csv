This answer proceeds accordingly.One of the biggest headaches every recruiter faces is the fact that usually, we are never as knowledgeable as the professionals we are seeking to recruitMost recruiters have a 4 year degree in whatever discipline was studied in undergrad, precious few have a masters degree, and practically none have successfully defended a dissertation.Most recruiters don’t know what gallium arsenide is, never mind what it’s used in. Heck, I only know because I just Googled it.So there isIn order to overcome that gap, any half-awake recruiter knows that they need to have what is called anIt sounds from the tone of the question that you were engaged by someone who didn’t do the intake properly. And as a recruiter, it frustrates me when someone does this job poorly.However, please don’t take from this data point that it logically can be extrapolated across all people in the profession.","56,304 followers",Jason M.

1,"Technological singularity is an absurd idea from people who do not know how to think. No philosopher would waste time on an insane idea like that.There are other stupid ideas that attract the thoughtless crowds. The idea of Islamic Revival by madmen of ISIS, or the idea of Ku Klux Klan establishing white supremacy or of cryptocurrency as an alternative to the USD are examples. Idiocy sells cheap ideas and acquires a large share of the market of ideas, but it still remains idiocy.","1,084 followers",Olaf Simons,765,1K,2.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-high-tech-companies-eg-semiconductor-pay-exorbitant-fees-and-engage-external-recruitment-agencies-who-barely-understand-the-technology-to-determine-the-quality-of-a-candidate-or-their-prior-work

3,"I would wager that professional philosophers are much more detail oriented.I don't self-identify as a philosopher (that would be unbelievably pompous). I'm just someone who has studied philosophy at undergrad level. But if you were to ask me what areas of philosophy I was interested in, I would answer:Three tremendously broad areas. If you were to ask someone who actually teaches philosophy, they would likely come out with a much smaller, more focused debate, such as:I would wager that professional philosophers are much more detail oriented.I don't self-identify as a philosopher (that would be unbelievably pompous).

4,"I had these debates with my students. They would tell me that this or that view or interpretation had to be valid as it was “their” personal view. (Just as mine was solely mine.)The idea behind it was that they were living in a democracy in which we are allowed to entertain any view just as I should be allowed to have my views. That included that they can defend “their personal views as their most original views” - even if they were old stuff in my eyes. They had thought this themselves, and that is why they were right to think that.Whenever I hear something like this I shrug my shoulders. TheI had these debates with my students.

They had thought this themselves, and that is why they were right to think that.Whenever I hear something like this I shrug my shoulders. They can have any view about anything as part of the electorate. As someone who has studied philosophy I am not interested in my students as human beings (I might be interested in them personally as their teacher but that’s not the point here). Nor would I accept a majority vote on any philosophical question.What I am interested in? I am interested in views as views. I will look at these views and my first question will be: How consistent are these views? What is the theoretical base that could make them consistent?I see philosophy more like a chess player who has studied lots of historical matches. The brilliant move is worth nothing if it is just your move and if you do not know the next moves that turn it into a brilliant move. It does not turn you into a good chess player if you feel that this is “your move” and if you can demand a right to make this move - you have the right to make it, but the professional player has just as much of a right to wipe you off the board with his interest to understand the complications and the consequences. You have the right to lose - but not the right to call yourself an expert among experts who can seriously discuss the problems.My students are ready to fail in arguments - and they will tell me: that does not matter, they will still hold that view - not as a particularly good view but as their personal choice as free citizens. I look at these subjects like this man at the Black Knight - he has lost two arms and wants to continue since he has a personal right to continue:The problem I have as a teacher is usually that my students do not have any original views. They have random selections of views which I can pin down as historical and not so very new. I know the next moves in the game, I know why such a view is inconsistent.They will claim that this is absolutely without interest - they are looking for their own view and if others had such and such a view before, then they will be happy about the good company. My point is here: If I can tell you that others had this very view: why don’t you try to understand the problems they ran into?They are not interested in philosophy but in their own rights.My aim is the student who is not looking for “his” or “her” philosophy like he or she is looking for dress to match his favorite color - good to be used on the favorite occasion - be that a confrontation with enemy theists or good in a personal physical malaise like a cancer diagnosis in which they want to gain super strength from “their philosophy”.I am looking for a student who can move the debate onto the next level of clarity - not in “his (or her) eyes” but with a statement that will spread this clarity among the other participants of the debate.Does my expertise give me a better philosophy - one which I can use if doctors tell me that I have cancer? No. I do not do philosophy as a cure for my soul. I study it.","1,366 followers",Ian Heckman,559,410,1.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-proponents-of-concepts-like-technological-singularity-tend-to-not-be-philosophers-or-at-least-not-engage-much-with-philosophers-despite-their-ideas-having-significant-philosophical-aspects

However, before looking at this image, she would have never known what the colour red actuallyThe fact that Mary learns something new, implies the existence ofThis could lead to the argument that although we might see a ‘blue’ sky for instance, then we might not referring to the same colour since it is almost impossible to accurately describe colour.However, this is partially refuted due to the existence ofThis idea of Qualia and understanding something never experienced before is also demonstrated in the idea of ‘Flatland’ novelised in 1884.In this book, 2D shapes live their flat lives, unable to experience the third dimension. They are unable to comprehend the idea of another dimension until a sphere introduces a square to the concept of depth.Similarly, as we all live 3-dimensional lives, it is almost impossible for anyone to imagine what it would feel like to exist in a 4th dimension.However, like in Mary’s room, we are aware that it exists and it is easy for anyone to discuss the existence of a 4th, 5th or even 100th dimension. But, as in Flatland, we are all 3-dimensional shapes living our 3-dimensional lives unaware of all the n-dimensional beauty around us.","9,670 followers",Paul Mainwood,964,1.5K,16.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-proponents-of-concepts-like-technological-singularity-tend-to-not-be-philosophers-or-at-least-not-engage-much-with-philosophers-despite-their-ideas-having-significant-philosophical-aspects
