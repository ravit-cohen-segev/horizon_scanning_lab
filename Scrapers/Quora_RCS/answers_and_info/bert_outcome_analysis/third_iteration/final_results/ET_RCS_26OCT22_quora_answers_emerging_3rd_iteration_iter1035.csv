1,"Before 2007 all touch screen devices, almost universally, had resistive touch. So you had to actually press on the device to register a touch, rather than it “feeling” your touch. The development of capacitive touchscreens, which sensed when someone was touching it based on the electrical current that exists within the human body, was what made touch screens much improved.

The development of capacitive touchscreens, which sensed when someone was touching it based on the electrical current that exists within the human body, was what made touch screens much improved. It didn’t become practical and low cost enough to include them in consumer devices until around 2007, which is when several mainstream d...",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-form-of-technology-after-nano-technology
2,"I believe the next big thing will be 3D screens, kind of like the nintendo 3Ds. Many people don't realize this, but it could be possible that the popularity of the nintendo DS was the catalyst for touch screen technology in phones, as the DS came out about 3 years before the iPod Touch or iPhone.With the 3Ds, its likely that the next technology will be 3D screens. I am not exactly sure how it could be utilized though.","135,529 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.6M,2014,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-big-thing-in-smartphones-after-touchscreen-technology

It outlined Samsung’s vision of the future – one in which TV displays deliver brilliant visuals and also evolve to integrate seamlessly into people’s lives.“As the world’s first consumer modular MicroLED television, ‘The Wall’ represents another breakthrough. It can transform into any size, and delivers incredible brightness, color gamut, color volume and black levels.First Ever Modular TV with MicroLED: The Screen of the FutureSamsung’s “The Wall,” a 146-inch modular TV with MicroLED technology delivers incredible definition, without restrictions to size, resolution or form. It is a self-emitting TV with micrometer (µm) scale LEDs – which are much smaller than current LEDs, and serve as their own source of light.The MicroLED technology featured in The Wall eliminates the need for color filters or backlight, yet allows the screen to offer consumers the ultimate viewing experience. Also, the MicroLED screen excels in durability and effectiveness, including luminous efficiency, the light source lifetime and power consumption, setting the standard for future screen technology.Featuring a module-based, bezel-less design, “The Wall” also exemplifies how consumers can customize their television sizes and shapes to suit their needs. The screen can adapt to serve different purposes, such as creating a wall-size disp...",7 followers,Rohit Virmani,1.9K,2.3K,86.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-big-thing-in-smartphones-after-touchscreen-technology
