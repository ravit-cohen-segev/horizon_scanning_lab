1,"GRAPHENEIt is a material which is basically graphite compressed into a one atom thick sheet.Potentially, it could revolutionize every single part of technology. It is stiffer than diamond. Conducts electricity 250 times better than silicon. 10 times better heat conductot than copper. Biomedical applications.The only problem is it's incredibly expensive to make. Once someone figures out a way to make cheaper graphene… Oh boy.It can easily become the highest earning industry in the world.","84,238 followers",Igor Markov,3.3K,3.9K,49.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-emerging-technology-will-have-the-most-impact-in-India-by-2020

The agriculture industry will have to wait longer than most industries to reap the benefits of 5G, as 5G networks will largely be deployed in urban areas first.4. Retail5. Financial Services6. Media & Entertainment7. Healthcare8. Transportation9. AR/VRBoth AR and VR technologies require a cheaper, more extensive network with lower latency and more consistency to continue developing successfully. AR and VR require massive amounts of data to be processed. An unreliable and lagging connection can ruin the immersive experiences, even making users physically sick.With a 10x decrease in latency, 100x improvement in traffic capacity, and 100x improvement in network efficiency, 5G could address these issues. This is critical for the mass adoption of AR and VR.10. InsuranceWith more efficient data sharing, health and life insurers could make more informed and accurate decisions when it comes to providing quotes. As wearable 5G-connected healthcare devices gain popularity, health insurers could offer “positive reinforcement” policies, where premiums would be reduced if a certain level of activity or fitness is maintained.11. EducationFor students in high-risk fields such as medicine and aviation, these VR learning experiences could prove to be especially useful.12. Cloud ComputingThe technology’s ultra-low latency and high throughput would also allow the cloud computing experience to rival corporate LAN connectivity to desktops.13. Gaming5G could solve the latency problems that currently face cloud-based gaming. Feedback would feel instantaneous, as latency would be reduced from 4G’s 10 milliseconds to 1-2 milliseconds. This technology would benefit those playing complex multiplayer games like Fornite on their phones — or any other mobile device, for example.14. Real Estate15. Public SafetyAn enhanced network of sensors, cameras, and other automated devices would become help create a fuller picture of any public safety situations, potentially making cities around the world safer to live in.16. Supply Chain Management5G-enabled IoT devices could improve food tracking and waste disposal. Ordering platforms, from menus to drive-throughs, could evolve into more immersive and interactive experiences for customers, as 5G allows enhanced performance with better speeds and lower latency.With all of these new 5G technologies, the restaurant industry is likely to see reduced costs, more efficient food production, and enhanced consumer experiences.18.

It probably will not run out in the next 100 million years. Natural gas will be around as fuel as long as man is here. There is no reason to replace it either. Natural gas is going to come up anyway so all that we do by drilling it is intercept it on it’s way up and get the heat from it. The CO2 will be there regardless.I have explained this a lot but it appears I need to explain this more.The exact reaction sequence that generates the methane in thNatural gas carries in it a gas that tells your answer.

Natural gas will be around as fuel as long as man is here. There is no reason to replace it either. Natural gas is going to come up anyway so all that we do by drilling it is intercept it on it’s way up and get the heat from it. The CO2 will be there regardless.I have explained this a lot but it appears I need to explain this more.The exact reaction sequence that generates the methane in the core or mantle of the earth works like this . The reactor generates Hydrogen gas under extremely high pressure. As the hydrogen gas migrates up through the earth it encounters a lot of carbon and when the pressure drops off to a critical point the carbon forms METHANE. This is below the continental plutons. The methane encounters the granitic plutons of the earth and migrates upwards. This process is more diffusion than through cracks or such.Once it rises above about 60,000 feet down it begins a series or reactions at it encounters catalytic reactive materials largely metal oxides like Calcium Oxide, Iron Oxide etc. This series is in equilibrium with depth favoring Methane at depth and heavier hydrocarbons at shallower depths. It undergoes dehydrogenation synthesis of polymers like those found in crude oil. There remains natural gas (Methane) in the mix to some extent clear up to the surface.As it rises and encounters shale layers above coal veins it dehydrogenates more and collects in geologic layers that are called traps. This is what we tend to drill for oil and gas. Now the reactions above ground are critical because the mixture comes up with water from the shallower depths. This with photosynthesis in plants produces oxygen as well as meeting oxygen in quantity over time from outer space which is a common component of interstellar ion flow it produces over many cycles a surplus of oxygen, water and CO2. In the Oceans it produces with may cycles carbonate shells that wash out the CO2 into insoluble precipitate we know as limestone. (Not technically insoluble but mostly) The net is the atmosphere and oceans on the earth and all life on earth.This is the solution to many major cosmological issues on the formation of the earth, its ocean and atmosphere.Sorry for not explaining more here but I sometimes get tired of explaining again and again here on Quora. Natural gas will remain abundant for the foreseeable future. There is simply too much of it around on earth to run out in many thousands of years. The Bottom of the Gulf of Mexico as most oceans of the earth is covered in the abyssal depths with about 300 feet of Methane Hydrate as a result of this reaction set. That alone could run the entire earth energy demand for thousands of years and they are lots of other places.","220,617 followers",Franklin Veaux,3K,47.3K,782.9M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Which-emerging-technology-will-have-the-most-impact-in-India-by-2020
8,"Hello Sky,Smart question!This is a recognition that solar and wind go together with natural gas like pees and carrots. In many locations, especially those lacking hydro reserves, natural gas is the enabling technology that allows the proliferation of solar and wind. California is an excellent example of this interplay with considerable solar by day and natural gas by night as seen in the ISO data.Hello Sky,Smart question!This is a recognition that solar and wind go together with natural gas like pees and carrots. In many locations, especially those lacking hydro reserves, natural gas is the enabling technology that allows the proliferation of solar and wind. California is an excellent example of this interplay with considerable solar by day and natural gas by night as seen in the ISO data.What are the options?There aren’t many options if you take away natural gas. Folks talk about batteries, but you don’t need to look far to find technotopian descriptions bordering on a religious conviction that the intractable physics problems will be solved.Folks talk about pumped hydro as if this were an easy solution. However, they quickly back down if you ask then to perform the back-of-the-envelope calculation for energy equivalent of one large power plant for a week. Things get even worse when you calculate the amount of material required for these mile long facilities.We could go one to talk about hydrogen, trash, bio, power lines, or other technologies. But in the end the economics all point to the same problem. Without natural gas, the storage solution end up in the wrong economic quadrant. They are all expensive things that are infrequently used. As I’ve said, they are all like trains with low passenger count for the majority of the time. They solutions are expensive assets that are infrequently used.There is one solution that can keep up with our needs. That solution is nuclear. With nuclear, most of those storage problems go away. You could think of it this way, the storage is in the core of the reactor. On a large grid with many reactors, there is ample capacity to meed the energy demands. We need only relatively small amounts of storage to make up for the daily fluctuations. In fact, we routinely operate nuclear with these “tiny” pumped hydro facilities. Here tiny is a recognition that existing pumped hydro facilities are in no way related to the monstrosities required under the no natural gas scenario.Regards,APDahlenP.S.
