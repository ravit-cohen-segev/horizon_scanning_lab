9,"Frankly speaking, ~10 LPA is not that much for a Java developer. If you are above average Java dev with good understanding of Computer science, you should be able to get more than 10L.To prove my point, following are the salaries of junior developers at few good companies:Remember, these are average salaries. In best cases, it will be at least 150% of this salary (in worst case, ~60%).Also, I’ve not included any big pay master in the list.

12,"S&T funding should be capped at 5% of GDP to foster innovation in the country. Developed countries spend roughly 3–4.5% of their GDP on S&T, and hence, they’re so technologically advanced. The government must fund science programs and feed all S&T professionals with gold (i.e. give them huge salaries), so that they will stay in the PH and even work for the government.","17,177 followers",Ryan Carlyle,6.6K,1.5K,15.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Was-the-blockchain-technology-available-before-bitcoin-or-was-the-technology-developed-for-the-cryptocurrency-from-the-beginning
