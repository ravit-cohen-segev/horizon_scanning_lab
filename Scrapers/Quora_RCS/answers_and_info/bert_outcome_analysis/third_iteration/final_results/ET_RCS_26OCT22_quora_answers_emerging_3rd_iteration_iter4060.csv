Ottoman Empire official language was Turkish but Greek was extensively used in early periods and in Christian majority governorates managed by Roman Orthodox governors.International RecognitionWhat is little known even by historians is that the Ottomans declared they were legal continuation of the Roman Enpire and European countries accepted it by acknowledging it in official communication.
