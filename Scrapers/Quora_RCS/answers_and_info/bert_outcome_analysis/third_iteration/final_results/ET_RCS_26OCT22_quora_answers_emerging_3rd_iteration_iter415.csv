I had a colleague who was essentially stuck because he ended up a bad match for the couple of companies in his area that had almost all the Java openings after his previous employer folded, for example.And there's also a versatility issue.  I like C a lot, but I'm not going to build a website with it.  Depending on the kind of website (and my mood and who's available to support it), I'm probably going to reach for C# or Ruby.  If I need to automate something simple, I'll probably just hack out a shell script.  Being able to help an employer make those choices is valuable, especially when the time to market is important.On top of that, I at least like to see what's around in case there's an idea I can integrate into my existing work.  I may never write a line of production code in a functional language, but experience in functional programming (of which I have only the tiniest amount, myself) gives some insight into how to solve some tricky problems and makes it easier to take advantage of functional-like features when they show up in other languages.If you don't like it, it's not necessary--there are people who make successful careers out of very narrowly specialized skills--but think of it like diversifying a portfolio and it might make more sense.","3,720 followers",Endilie Yacop Sucipto,4.4K,124,1.6M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-technology-in-the-world-1

They could be developing a framework, introduce it (such as Rust-lang from Mozilla is in active development), and a year later, the industry could be asking for people who have 5+ years experience in brand-spanking-new-framework tomorrow.What you mention is an industry-tier problem.The other major problem with this closely mirrors the historical question: ""How do you get experience, if no one is willing to give it out."" -- That is to say, the tech industry whines about a lack of talent or candidates, while at the same time moving so fast it's hard to stay abreast all of their changes while also doing a job, AND then try to convince them that your skills relate. It's almost as if you're supposed to have no life. Not every company is as generous as Google used to be, allowing 20% of an employee's time for professional development. Thus, negates the modern work-life balance ""perks"" to have to spend enough personal time to continue professional development as to have no life, and be over-worked in attempt to stay abreast whatever the next random shift is.It's hard to get the experience, if a company looks at a resume and tosses it out. It's even harder when you consider that, related or not, you follow standard things like ""follow-up and follow-through"" (call them) and you get a stone-wall even trying to figure out how to adapt a cover letter to them, let alone get the status of your resume submission or application.And, as I've learned reading around Quora: That HR Departments, despite the modern ""positive"" social media paradigm, are negatively unresponsive so as not to share internal information such as feedback for candidates about what they would need to do. (Or, the other common excuse: ""We're overworked and too lazy to go over all of the resume's. If we don't like your format, it goes in the trash."")The question you pose has no direct answer or explanation, other than you've touched on a convergence of bad attitudes across the technology spectrum. Technology companies ""want,"" but at the same time won't disclose development-in-progress (and, in part, for good reason). Tech companies might list their stack, but, they won't tell you what they're looking forward to in 5 years, or what new frameworks they're using today that you should be abreast of and show experience in. Tomorrow, they could stack-shift. And that leaves a lot of candidates out in the cold. And their internal attitude is one of: ""Meh, whatever.""The question you pose has no direct answer or explanation, other than you've touched on a convergence of bad attitudes across the technology spectrum.

Tomorrow, they could stack-shift. And that leaves a lot of candidates out in the cold. And their internal attitude is one of: ""Meh, whatever.""At first, I liked the following...And then I realized that it is an EXTREMELY BAD EXAMPLE of what does not often happen in the technology industry. A raw stack-shift? It's glorified. But, he *MUST* have known someone internally to get that job, or attracted attention somehow. Attracting attention among everyone out there doing the same thing over and over again a hundred different ways is a crap-shoot.One of the reasons the above article's bad example does not happen often is because of the Recruiting Industry behind tech. Company says ""X,"" and ""recruiters"" search for buzzword ""X."" If you don't have buzzword ""X"" with experience ""Y,"" you're just another piece of meat to be skipped-over. (I say ""Recruiters"" because I don't like them -- but the same holds true for HR departments.) Tech managers RARELY source their own candidates, and when they do, they usually already know the individual, or go looking for someone or something specific; but are usually barred from reaching out and asking someone they've taken note of to apply (because that would invalidate HR and/or Recruiter's efforts at locking the industry into a need for them).It would, honestly, be much simpler if a (Tech) Manager took the initiative to source his or her own candidates based on what they need, industry trends, adaptability, notice (since there's a broader reach and understanding overall)... but this is wholly anti-theitical to the the way the industrial-complex works. (Even though it would be a better, more representative way of doing things.)... I could go on and on ... but ... there's no direct answer to the question you've posed. Repeating myself: The conundrum you've touched on is one of many negative attitudes cutting across the tech industry's various departments and approaches to sourcing candidates.

There was a nice set of timelines and charts and whoozits and whatsits and so on explaining this brilliant plan.The entire team of developers and QA’s was stoked. We were going to do this in like 2 months with plenty of time to hit the 3 month later launch date. Oh, and this was attached to a larger arbitrary goal (ever heard of OKRs? or KRs? Or Quarterly Targets? Or Big Rocks?, it was one of those deals).After the full presentation of the plan was complete, I raised my hand and asked a question.“That’s a great plan, but what happens when it doesn’t work?”The room filled with silence. I got some sour looks, but I continued.“There are a bunch of unknowns. We don’t know how long issues X, Y, and Z will take at all. We are guessing and hoping for the best. Yet, every time we do this we uncover some messy thing that often takes weeks or months to unravel. What makes you think this will be any different?”The PM went on to explain that we really needed to hit our quarterly targets and that reality was basically unacceptable to them or their boss.I said, “Okay, well best case scenario is 6 months, it will probably take 12. Even if you don’t like it, plan accordingly.”Long story short, it took at least 12 months. I left the team before the project finished.The point of the story is not that I was right. It’s that most programmers love optimistic estimates. They want to say that something will be done quickly so that they look good to their boss and teammates.In almost every case something goes wrong that makes things take longer. Unforeseen problems and so on.In my experience, great programmers know that things will go wrong. They plan for it. They can usually tell you in advance what parts of the software are most likely to cause problems and sometimes even can pinpoint why.Unfortunately, honesty can be quite unpopular as great programmers aren’t often listened to unless they are in a position of authority. It is often the opinion of the most optimistic (or foolish) person that wins the day, even if it leads to catastrophe.Great programmers know-BrianP.S.
