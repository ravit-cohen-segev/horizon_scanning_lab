0,"Although the most common transducer is the moving coil-permanent magnet transducer (the one on the image below), many variations of acoustic transducers already exist. Even a “Full Digital” speaker.The Moving Coil permanent magnet uses ferromagnetic or rare earth permanent magnets with high coercivity (resistance to loss of magnetism).There is the Field Coil TranAlthough the most common transducer is the moving coil-permanent magnet transducer (the one on the image below), many variations of acoustic transducers already exist. Even a “Full Digital” speaker.The Moving Coil permanent magnet uses ferromagnetic or rare earth permanent magnets with high coercivity (resistance to loss of magnetism).There is the Field Coil Transducer [ http://www.glowinthedarkaudio.com/speakers.html ] ( electrodynamic loudspeaker). In this one an electro magnet is energized by current through a second pair of connections to the driver.There is the surround-less driver [ http://www.fertinacoustics.com/ ]. As the name suggest this speaker has no surround at the end of the cone.There is the planar magnetic transducer electrostatic [ http://www.soundlab-speakers.com/ ]. The frequency response of a planar driver is not constrained by its mechanical design or construction. The light mass of the diaphragm allows it to reproduce the full audio spectrum as it responds very quickly to fast transient sounds... Imagine several drivers grouped together, because the total area of all the drivers combine and behave as one large and very fast speaker. In contrast to the conventional round drivers, the flat two-dimensional shape of planar drivers project sound in a more ""natural"" dispersion pattern almost like a beam of light instead of the sound radiating out in concentric rings rippling out from a central point as it happens with the conventional cone speaker.You have the concentric loudspeaker Cabasse  [ http://www.cabasse.com/en/ ]calls its version of the coincident source the Spatial Coherent Source, or SCS. This is the same as 3 separate fixed magnet speakers into one (woofer/mid range/tweeter).Another variation of a 2 way concentric speaker has been used by Tannoy [ http://tannoy.com/residential/#!series_118 ] for many years (Woofer/Tweeter).You have the Manger [ http://www.manger-audio.co.uk/manger-speakers.htm ]'s MSW full range driver that has a flat diaphragm which is bent to produce sound waves, rather than pushed and pulled like a regular ""rigid"" speaker cone.You have the drivers German Physics [ http://www.german-physiks.com/ ] uses. An omnidirectional speaker that radiates the wave from the sides of the cone rather than using the front of the cone to radiate the wave.You also have the MBL  [ http://www.mbl.de/?lang=en ]Driver ""Radialstrahler"" In this one several membranes compress and extend in order to create the sound wave.You have the ESS amt-1b Heil Air-Motion-Transformer (AMT) a type of electroacoustic transducer or loudspeaker, also called Air Velocity Transformer (AVT) or JET transducer. Invented by Dr. Oskar Heil. In contrast to a planar ribbon loudspeaker, the diaphragm of the AMT is a pleated shape similar to a bellows. The AMT moves air in an augmented, semi-perpendicular motion using a folded sheet (made of polyethylene, polyester or polyimide), structured around a series of aluminum struts positioned in a high-intensity magnetic field.You have the Ribbon [ https://www.madisoundspeakerstore.com/ribbon-tweeters/ ] and planar magnetic loudspeakers which consist of a thin metal-film ribbon suspended in a magnetic field. The electrical signal is applied to the ribbon, which moves with it to create sound waves. The advantage of a ribbon driver is that the ribbon has very little mass; thus, it can accelerate very quickly, yielding very good high-frequency response. Above and below the ends of the more or less rectangular ribbon, there is less audible output due to phase cancellation, but the precise amount of directivity depends on ribbon length.Planar magnetic Loudspeakers with ribbon and planar-magnetic drivers and a transmission line wooferYou have the Plasma driver [ http://www.lansche-audio.com/english/loudspeakers/plasma-tweeter/ ]. It has no moving parts. It varies air pressure via a high-energy electrical plasma instead of a solid diaphragm.The Eminent Technology TRW17 [ http://www.eminent-tech.com/RWbrochure.htm ] Rotary Subwoofer, the only subwoofer to be able to respond from 1Hz – 30Hz+/- 4dB. As it rotates its blades move to help it produce variations in the pressure wave.You have directional parabolic loudspeaker [ http://www.meyersound.com/product/sb-1/ ]s. The image is self-explanatory.You have the HyperSound Loudspeaker Technology [ http://hypersound.com/hypersound_technology.php ]You have horn and waveguide speakers like these Omni Audio [ http://www.omniaudio.com.au/ ]You have surface transducers, with these, you can turn a solid resonant surface into a ""loudspeaker"" or will convert virtually anything into a ""sound source [ http://www.mkmdisplay.pl/en/intelligent-glass/products/soundpod-audio-transducer/ ]""You have some ""variations"" on this technology like the Greensound Technology Glass Speakers [ http://www.ult...","29,946 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,5.9K,7.7K,249.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Whats-going-to-be-the-next-breakthrough-in-speaker-technology

Even if not, this is still a major step forward towards generating organs to order, without fear of rejection. Even if the heart is rejected and the donor dies, what we learn from the process will enable us to succeed the next time. I reckon this will become the mainstream way we get spare parts by the end of the decade in an optimistic scenario, by the end of the next decade in the pessimistic one.Either way, the moment is as groundbreaking as December 3rd, 1967, when the first human heart ever was transplanted, ushering the era of organ transplants of today.

When was the last one?While we have seen a resurrection of the use of planar magnetic and AMT tweeters, these technologies are are over forty years old and the vast majority of speakers, including the most advanced models, still use cones and domes.While material advances and design and measuring techniques have evolved over the years, most successful speakers are not much different conceptually than they were long ago.If we qualify a breakthrough as an advanced concept that changes the way most speakers operate, it may be too far off to think about.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Whats-going-to-be-the-next-breakthrough-in-speaker-technology
