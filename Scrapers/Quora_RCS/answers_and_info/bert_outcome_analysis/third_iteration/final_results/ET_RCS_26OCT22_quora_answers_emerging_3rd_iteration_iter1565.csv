Sci-fi always makes it look relatively easy, but some of the years have produced basic concepts.Rumor is there is a new device that can transmit 3-D type holographic images in almost real time.

4,"The answer to this question is in some ways elusive but there are answers.

I've spent a great deal of time researching technology, automation, and how it links to economics.Like many people, my hypothesis was that technological advancement implies automation and automation implies loss of jobs. Therefore, technological automation is a threat to the well-being of people because it kills their employment.Let's take a look at this.We've come a long way in the past 100 years. The economy goes through what's called ""business cycles"". That is, it expands and contracts in a cyclical fashion sort of every 10-15 years. When it contacts, it can be said that a recession happens. As the economic theory goes, in a recession is when it's precisely the time when companies and people innovate and need to innovate. For instance, to increase automation in manufacturing in the hopes of lowering manufacturing costs. These lower costs would help the company lower the price to pick up sales in a stagnant, recessed market.Companies then get innovating, hire people, things move forward, and the economy expands.If we compare historical unemployment rates with things like recessions, the story is interesting:If we compare historical unemployment rates with things like recessions, the story is interesting:Great Depression: depending on source, unemployment peaked at close to25%in the US in the 1930s.~10%in 2009 in the US.What are employment rates at the time of this writing? 5.5%.What was the US unemployment rate 63 years ago in 1952? 3%.Also, counter-intuitively, in several countries there are actually less people running their own business than there were 15 years ago. This is counter-intuitive because we think the Internet has made small business explode. But it hasn't.Regardless, it does ""feel"" like technological advancement has caused a loss of jobs. The real chatter on this topic and within economics happened in the 1980s with the spawn of personal computers and advancements with computers in general. One key example was ATMs (bank machines). People thought they would put bank tellers out of work. But as we see, that hasn't happened. What did happened was that new kinds of jobs were created to create things like firmware and software for the ATMs. To maintain them. To fill them with money. And so forth.So with technological advancement can come new kinds of jobs and industries. These latter can supplant, augment, and replace losses of jobs that may be a result of technological advancement. Of things like automation.But then there's other examples that may be counter to this. Likemovie rentals. When Apple announced it was going to start renting movies on iTunes, I told my friend who owned a movie rental store that he'd be out of business in 2 years. And that's exactly what happened. And all the Blockbusters and Rogers and other movie rental stores collapsed and disappeared. All those jobs in retail in the stores. The shipping of DVDs. The packaging of DVDs... an entire industry... gone.How many people does Apple employ to deal with movie rentals? I think we can all agree it would be a fraction of what the industry was before they came along. Sure, it's created a market for digital movie rentals and streaming... and therefore companies like Amazon and Hulu and Netflix pop up in the space... and they employ people... but it's so centralized and automated that the footprint of the industry appears totally curtailed. This may be a case where technological automation has had an adverse effect on employment.My prediction is that we will be heading into the sort ofdark agesof technological advancement.

6,"I would really like to know where you got that ""fact"" that technology is erasing the necessity for jobs faster than it is creating new jobs.I don't think that's true.  Besides ""society"" doesn't exist independently of such phenomena.  It partakes in the process which is slow moving. There is more impact in the fact that people are working longer and retiring later, than the technological effects on job creation.","246,825 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.3M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Is-society-ready-for-the-next-wave-of-technological-advancement
