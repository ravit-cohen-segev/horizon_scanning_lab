The conflicts with their Arab neighbours takes up most of their time and resources to counter and manage their security, hence befriending America and keeping it that way even when they would not have wanted.The Russians on the other hand have had to live with the wrath of the Americans for as long as they can remember and hostilities but there country has stood still, blessed with nearly every form of mineral or raw material, Russia is a country gifted by God, there one true fall back, is they tend to create or engender into their neighbours and the western world a fear and enmity of them than creation of friendship.To conclude, if I wanted a peace of mind and was asked were I would like to spend my days, I would just visit the wilderness of Russia. I would need to think twice before going to Israel, little space and ever on the look out for some religious fundamentalist who wants to knife me or commit suicide. Simply put, whatever the drawbacks and the propaganda from the west how Russians are ugly and rusty and warlike, I would enjoy living there more than in Israel.",UNKNOWN,Ernest W.

2,"Two glaring differences stand out - well, at least two.First, training and organisation.The US military has no conscripts. Its service personnel are motivated to be there as volunteer professionals. They know that promotion depends on learning and improving, so they learn and improve. There is a large and stable NCO cadre to preserve, develop and pass on that training and know-how.Russia conscripts troops. They don’t want to be there and they don’t like it.

I mean dull, boring, mundane stuff that the hoplophiles don’t get stirred up about. I mean spare oil filters for diesel engines, and first-ad kits, and field rations, and waterproof boots.A US general who sent troops into the field with the kind of kit, supplied by the kind of logistics, that Russia has shown in Ukraine would be standing outside the Pentagon, with all his belongings in a cardboard box, in about eight seconds flat.In short, it’s about informed motivation and ingrained professionalism. You’ll find both in abundance in the armed forces of most of the major Western powers.

It’s time to encourage moderate Islam in the Middle East. Russia is doing just that, good for them! Remember that Russia has almost as much to fear from the fundamentalist Islam as anyone else, so that’s vital for her.25% of Israel’s population are Russia’s expats (well, former USSR to be precise; I don’t know statistics for Russia, but it’s probably fairly close, because nearly all Ukrainian, Belorussian, Moldovan, Baltic Jews were killed during WWII), many of whom maintain connections with the “prehistoric homeland”, travel, vote, read, watch movies, do business with, etc.(Food for thought: if Ukrainians had not killed nearly all of their Jews during WWII, or if today’s Ukraine had not heroized those who did, today’s Israel would have probably been much more pro-Ukrainian, would have probably aided Ukraine against Russia, participated in sanctions against Russia, etc.)Israel has so many enemies that it’s not picky. It will establish relations with whoever wants to establish relations with it.Putin is the rare Russian leader who is not an antisemite, and has been in a lot of hot water for it. He’s been friends with Jewish kids since childhood, his circle of friends is largely Jewish, and he’s the first leader in the entire history of Russia who’s been seen in a synagogue wearing a kippah. That alone can mean a death sentence from some of his enemies.

Everything Russian made was substandard. I worked there in the 80s and saw, first hand, how life was. Russia was a 3rd world country pretending to be a modern 1st world country.While there are now more modern buildings in Moscow and a few more middle class people, most of Russia is still 3rd world. The Russian elites still use propaganda and misinformation to convince the Russian people that their lives are just as good or better than people in Western Europe or North America.By attacking Ukraine Vladimir Putin has, unwittingly, exposed Russian weakness. Now the entire world sees what Russia actually is rather than what the Russian government wants to project. Even Russia’s huge international propaganda machine is losing its credibility with most people.Eventually, after Putin and his oligarch clans are gone, Russia will recover. The Russian people are resilient, strong, creative and hard working. But Russians will need to transform their country into a real modern, 1st world country. That will take a great deal of work and courage and time. Corruption will need to be cut back significantly so that most of the money earned in Russia goes to benefit the Russian people and Russia itself rather than a few corrupt, greedy elites.Until then, the Russian people will suffer due to Vladimir Putin, his elite supporters and good people who just sit and watch their country going down the toilet of history.",843 followers,Dee Vesh Ob Roy,3.7K,124,2.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-advantages-does-Israel-have-over-Russia-These-include-advantages-in-economy-wealth-distribution-military-living-standards-leadership-level-of-advancement-technological-achievements-current-and-historical-contributions-to-the-world-etc

Ours was founded over 50 years ago as a complement to the engineering and science schools here.  It was named the College of Technology for a long time, and recently renamed as the Purdue Polytechnic Institute.  They award 4-year BS degrees in several areas of applied technology, including EET (electrical engineering technology), CIT (computer and information technology), and CGT (computer graphics technology).  The Purdue programs all tend to be highly ranked, and the job placement for graduates is outstanding.(For illustration, if you wanted to learn about the fundamentals of computation, including limits of computation, design of data structures, algorithms, and protocols, you would come to Purdue for the Computer Science degree, in the College of Science.  If you wanted to learn about building computer systems, including issues of component design, circuit structure, signal strengths, memory architectures, and embedding processors, you would come to get a degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering in our College of Engineering.
