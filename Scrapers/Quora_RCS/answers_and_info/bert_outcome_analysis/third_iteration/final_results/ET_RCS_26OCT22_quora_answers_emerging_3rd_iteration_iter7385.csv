There are several explanations for this popularity. Kyrrex is a phrase I'm familiar with because of its potential to enhance our quality of life. While it is not well known, it is one of the greatest specimens of its sort. I believe bitcoin influenced the team's decision to create a new kind of virtual bank. An ecosystem seems great to me since it has so many options. The KRRX token grants you access to a broader variety of perks. Kyrrex refers to everything in the above list.Guys, I genuinely mean it when I say that. Simply keeping an eye on this campaign will convince you that it is a success straight away. Despite the fact that this initiative was only a few months old when I first heard about it, I was immediately on board. You may utilize them as a bitcoin exchange if it is more convenient for you.

These are opportunities that need to be really utilized to its maximum.On the date of publication, Steph Brooks did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Steph Brooks, CFA, is a registered investment advisor on a mission to bring simplicity to the world of investing.Bitcoin (BTC)In early November, I stated that bitcoin was looking at another run at $20,000 and probably soon. So far, my forecast has been right on the money, with BTC on the cusp of breaking through the $20,000 level. But what was the basis for my call? That bitcoin was the benchmark for the crypto market?Of course, that’s always going to be a factor. However, because the crypto market “lacks” fundamentals in the sense that most of these assets are virtual currencies, not corporate securities, most investors have to rely on technical analysis. And in bitcoin’s case, it had charted a bullish pennant formation, defined loosely as a convergence of narrowing bullish and bearish price action that ultimately resolves itself to the upside.Again, so far, so good. However, I believe we’re just getting started with bitcoin. Notice that right now, the idea of bitcoin at $20,000 is rather blasé. Previously, market analysts viewed the event as the second coming. With stability at these lofty prices established, BTC may go onto make surprisingly robust gains.Do I hear $50,000, anyone?Ethereum (ETH)Presently the number two to bitcoin, ethereum represents the top echelon of alternative crypto assets, or altcoins for short. Fundamentally, bitcoin and the blockchain innovation that it brought to the mainstream was a proof of concept. For the first time, a decentralized market of tradable assets became a reality. However, bitcoin had a number of opportunities for improvement.One area where the original blockchain fell short was its focus; bitcoin is narrowly defined as a peer-to-peer payment application. However, the developers behind ethereum introduced the concept of smart contracts, or contracts that can be completed without the need for a human (and therefore fallible) intermediary. Beyond the introduction of bitcoin, ethereum arguably represents the most groundbreaking development in the crypto market.Better yet, the upside potential for ETH is significant. Between August 2015 through September 2018, ethereum prices rose via a step-up pattern. Later, it entered a long consolidation phase as bulls and bears fought for control. If recent price action is anything to go by, the optimists are going to win this battle.Ripple (XRP)Hang around various crypto communities and it won’t be long until you come across a recurring theme: hardcore proponents love talking about decentralization. After all, this concept is what allows virtual currencies to break free from the hegemony of the global banking system. And don’t treat this last statement as a conspiracy theory. It’s not called “fiat” currencies for nothing.Logically, you can expect some controversy over ripple. Because XRP is tied to a centralized institution, these altcoins are not minable; instead, their supply is managed by human operators. Right there, this takes away from the street cred associated with crypto assets. At the same time, ripple offers a viable channel to replace cumbersome, inconvenient and expensive wire transfers.That’s especially the case for micro-transfers, where the denomination of transferred currency is so small that it’s not worth considering for traditional exchanges. So, hate on XRP all you want – at least there’s some fundamental value here.Further, ripple looks like it’s performing a bullish pennant formation, similar to that of bitcoin’s chart. If so, don’t be surprised if XRP takes off.",841 followers,Henrietta Sydney,657,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-cryptocurrency-mining-profitable-in-the-USA

Here, I will talk about cryptocurrencies to invest in for the year 2020.You should keep in mind that there is a wide choice of attractive cryptocurrencies you can buy. While investing in cryptocurrencies is risky, some would say that investing in only one is riskier.The fact is, most of the cryptocurrencies have numerous use cases and are looking to bring changes to several industries. Their promise is an excellent way to weigh your risk and boost your chances of participating in the next best cryptocurrencies.Recommended Cryptos1. Bitcoin (BTC)Bitcoin was the first crypto and remains the most widely used in the world. It is the leading cryptocurrency and aims to serve as a global, peer to peer, digital money.Now, let’s move on to the team behind Bitcoin. Bitcoin remains the cryptocurrency with an anonymous founder. Satoshi Nakamoto is said to have created the cryptocurrency. While there continues to be speculation regarding the true identity of Satoshi, no one knows who he/she/they are. However, leading cryptographers, such as Adam Back, regularly update Bitcoin’s open-sourced codebase.Bitcoin is the most significant cryptocurrency in terms of liquidity. With a market cap of over $100 billion, Bitcoin accounts for over 60% of the cryptocurrency market’s total valuation. Investors have no trouble buying or selling Bitcoin as there is no shortage of interested parties. For those who don’t know, when we talk about liquidity, this describes the degree to which an asset can be quickly sold or bought in the market at a price reflecting its intrinsic value. Here the focus is on the ease of converting it to cash.In terms of price volatility, while the Bitcoin price is volatile, it is one of the most stable cryptocurrencies. This means that a lot of money would be needed for anyone to manipulate the BTC price.In terms of the economics of this cryptocurrency, Bitcoin uses the Proof of Work (PoW) system. In this system, miners are rewarded with Bitcoin when they mine and approve transactions. The mining reward is halved every 210,000 blocks, a process that occurs every four years. This helps to reduce inflation over time. BTC has a total coin supply of 21 million, after which no new BTC will be mined. In terms of trading, as demand surges, so would the price.Overall, Bitcoin remains the best cryptocurrency to invest in today. I would advise anyone coming into the crypto space to start by investing in Bitcoin.2. LitecoinRegarded as Bitcoin’s sister, Litecoin is one of the first Bitcoin alternatives. It remains one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy for 2020. It was created with Bitcoin’s source-code, as a fork of BTC, and has a faster processing time, making it ideal for retail payments. Similar to Bitcoin, Litecoin seeks to be a global, peer to peer currency.In terms of the team behind this cryptocurrency, Litecoin was created by Charlie Lee, an experienced computer scientist, and crypto enthusiast. His brother, Bobby Lee, created BTC China, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Charlie Lee is well-respected within the crypto community and he is well connected, working as the Director of Engineer at Coinbase.In terms of liquidity, Litecoin is currently the 6th largest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap, making it highly liquid. In addition, in terms of price volatility, Litecoin is less volatile compared to the smaller market cap cryptocurrencies.Similar to Bitcoin, Litecoin uses the PoW system. Miners were initially rewarded with 50 LTC block rewards when this crypto was introduced but the mining reward is halved at regular intervals. The total coin supply of Litecoin is 84 million. Remember, that Bitcoin only has a supply of 21 million coins.Despite the large number of cryptocurrencies available, Litecoin remains one of the best crypto projects for beginners to invest in for 2020.3. EthereumEthereum has been Bitcoin’s second for years now. It is the first major project to launch smart contracts and is regarded as the blockchain web. Developers are able to create mobile and desktop decentralized applications (dApps) on top of the blockchain, thanks to Ethereum. The Ethereum blockchain houses thousands of tokens and it gave birth to the initial coin offering (ICO) process.In terms of the team behind this digital coin, Vitalik Buterin is the founder of Ethereum. He is a young but experienced crypto expert. Alongside Joseph Lubin, Buterin also founded ConsenSys, a New York based studio committed to dApp development.In terms of liquidity, Ethereum is the second or third most valuable cryptocurrency in terms of market cap, behind BTC. It is easy to buy and sell Ethereum coins at all times. Similar to the other leading cryptos, Ethereum’s price is less volatile. This is as a result of the loyal team and community. It also has the potential to remain stable and move higher over the coming months and years.The crypto economics of Ethereum is interesting. Ethereum has more coins than Bitcoin and Litecoin, however, this is because the Ether coins are crucial in fueling the dApp ecosystem. That is, there are millions of developers and companies that use the coin to execute smart contracts and to launch dApps.Ethereum is the leading smart contract platform and remains a great cryptocurrency to buy in 2020. It has brought many innovations into the world and the potential for its applications to be adopted worldwide is impressive.",2 followers,Kelly Pearson,1.7K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-area-of-cryptocurrency-is-most-interesting

Like most things in California and with PG&E the state and utility regulators lied and broke the rules instituted. We went from selling back excess energy annually to now paying $300+ per year to PG&E. Granted, this is only $25/mth for annual heating & cooling, etc., but it is the principle. (As a side note, CA originally waived bridge tolls for electric vehicles [EV] until there were “too many EVs on the road.” The state reneged on this too, but that's another story.)Would we do it again? Yes. We are still spending much less than our neighbors and friends without solar and several neighbors that installed solar systems in the same time period.We initially computed a 10 year payback. It is now 14 years. This still works for us because we knew we were not going to move when we installed the system and do not plan on moving now that we are retired.

When we started Chronicled, we weren’t thinking about Yeezys specifically, but we did have a goal in mind. That goal was to create a global protocol for blockchain that allows any object to be registered to, verified against, transferred on, or--in the case of the special class of objects that had a chip inside--to sign off on events, messages, accesses, financial transactions, etc.Not sure what that has to do with your sneakers? Let me explain.Chronicled was founded in 2014. We set out to explore non-financial use cases for blockchain. The average person has probably heard of blockchain in the context of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies. And while blockchain does underpin those cryptocurrencies, the terms aren’t interchangeable. Blockchain isn’t Bitcoin, it’s the technology that makes those cryptocurrencies possible.And it turns out that blockchain has plenty of other uses. We founded Chronicled in order to investigate those non-financial uses by building the first IoT x Blockchain laboratory in the world. Much of our early work in that laboratory was focused on fine art, consumer products, and luxury goods. Why? Because those are industries with a high prevalence of counterfeit goods. Some industries, like pharma, lose billions of dollars each year due to supply diversion and counterfeit products.But how could we create a unique identity for a piece of fine art painted on a canvas? Or a bottle of rare wine? Or the designer purse you ordered online last week? The answer: tiny microchips, just like the chip inside your credit card.In 2015, Chronicled began working with companies to embed, or affix, cryptographic microchips in or on luxury and consumer products. We would then register those encrypted identities to a blockchain so they could be authenticated. Those microchips can’t be copied or corrupted. They have a unique identity that allows consumers to determine whether or not the 1947 Cheval Blanc on their dinner table is the real deal.Those were the first two primitive protocols we developed at Chronicle—Register and Verify. There was finally a way to register fine art, luxury goods, and consumer products with an unreproducible identity that could then be verified by the consumer. It’s a game-changing concept that is already creating a safer, more transparent buying process for consumers.But let’s keep moving. Fast forward to 2016 when we were hard at work on the newest uses for blockchain. Many of our clients were interested not only in using the blockchain to register and verify the identity of an object, but also in using the smart contract feature of blockchain to securely transfer custody and/or ownership. In parallel with our own move into smart supply chain, more enterprise players were beginning to work with blockchain technology as the vast possibilities became evident.Even JP Morgan had gotten in on the action with Quorum, their own enterprise ledger and smart contract platform. So, we went from registering and verifying products, to also transferring custody, ledgering data and events, and tracking provenance of an item over time using more powerful systems and smart contracts. In 2016, we began working on our next two protocol primitives, Transfer and Ledger, and our Smart Supply Chain platform was born.The Smart Supply Chain Initiative led us to some incredible projects in several different industries. For instance, we began work on the MediLedger project, a joint venture that set out to solve the problem of counterfeit drugs in the pharmaceutical supply chain. We’ve also worked on a responsible gold venture to track the provenance of the world’s gold supply, and with our partner Ambisafe we will tokenize physical gold by linking the physical gold bullion identities to digital, tradeable ERC20 tokens for the first time in human history. In the future, we can track many kinds of conflict minerals with this same blockchain approach.Notice that industries all across the spectrum are benefitting from blockchain. That’s not a coincidence. Moving forward, the trust, security, and data privacy that blockchain brings is going to change and improve nearly every industry.So, let’s flip ahead on the calendar and start looking at what the future holds. It’s 2018, and our sixth protocol primitive is in place—Value Transfer. Chronicled’s Blockchain x IoT API is not only powering unique product identities and supply chain tracking and provenance, but it can also enable machine payments and IoT economies.Picture this:A drone hitches a ride on an Uber and uses the charging port on top to refuel. Then it makes a micropayment for the ride and the charge before resuming its journey. If you think that sounds futuristic, then you’re going to be in for some surprises in the next few years. We’re talking about decentralized energy grids. Fully secure and connected smart cities. And eventually, a fully connected world running on the protocols that we’ve built.Blockchain technology is set to change everything. It’s time to start paying attention to the innovations that blockchain is creating, because the pace of disruption is only going to increase. The progress we’ve made at Chronicled in just three years has been astounding, and we’ve only just begun.","99,920 followers",Alcatraz Dey,9K,1.4K,68.3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-cryptocurrency-mining-profitable-in-the-USA
