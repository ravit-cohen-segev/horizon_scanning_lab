Even if not, this is still a major step forward towards generating organs to order, without fear of rejection. Even if the heart is rejected and the donor dies, what we learn from the process will enable us to succeed the next time. I reckon this will become the mainstream way we get spare parts by the end of the decade in an optimistic scenario, by the end of the next decade in the pessimistic one.Either way, the moment is as groundbreaking as December 3rd, 1967, when the first human heart ever was transplanted, ushering the era of organ transplants of today. That patient died after 18 days, I hope this guy does better.","29,920 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,5.9K,7.7K,249.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-upcoming-healthcare-technology-trends-in-2020-which-will-lead-to-the-disruption-of-the-whole-market

Here's my ordering of hackathons from veryBeginnerExpertCodeDayCodeDayThis hackathon is really tailored towards high school students and beginner college hackers. There's plenty of guidance for those just getting started with development. Often you'll see kids playing Minecraft or other video games during the night.Startup WeekendSW is designed for you to build a startup in 54 hours. Websites and apps are just one component of a startup so the technical bar is lower than normal. Presentation and design skills play a major roll in how well you do.AT&TSimilar to startup weekend but more focused on building a solid product than researching on your competitive landscape or go-to-market strategy.AmazonAmazon has relatively relaxed hackathons where students get $50-100 AWS credits to use on their hack.GoogleGoogle generally has very intelligent hackers but their hackathons tend to emphasize fun and games (like midnight trivia raffles and swag giveaways) rather than hardcore hacking.FacebookFacebook really knows how to throw hackathons! Hacking embedded in culture and you can tell how serious students are when they bring their external monitors to FB's offices and hack through the night.AngelHackThe stakes get higher when you're competing for a 12 week accelerator and Global Demo Day in SF. You'll not only compete with other students but other 30-40 year olds looking to build a real startup. A few winning teams have formed into startups and have been acquired by companies such as Google.College HackathonsThe larger the hackathon, the more competitive the application process is, and thus the more expert hackers you will find. Often students come from all over the region or even across the US to compete in these hacking marathons. Some of the most competitive ones are MHacks, PennApps, LAHacks, and HackMIT to name a few.YC Hacks/TC DistruptNothing quite beats the hackathons in the Silicon Valley where the talent bar is ridiculously high. YCombinator held a very competitive hackathon where the top interns from Apple, Google, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and other companies battled for a YC interview and other prizes.

You rename them to firstName, surname and dateOfBirth.You never name anything a, b, c again.What’s hard about this is how many poor practices there are.

In that case, feel free to see the editorial or google to look for the solution.When you find it, make sure to understand it, and then code it on your own.First, solve ""Easy"" questions of all sections, and then ""Medium"" questions.In fact, solving some ""Medium"" questions is good enough to call yourself a CP professional.And when you make sure that you’re able to solve Medium questions , then start CP on CodeChef that is a much professional practical area to code.Step 3Codechef long contests are the best. Developing your Competitive Programming skills requires that you are both fast and are able to think deeply about a problem.Codechef long challenges = Deep thinking AND Codeforces rounds = Fast codingIf you want to be good, you should try to be good in both these areas.But it's fine if you are just good at long challenges (deep thinking) or just good with short contests (fast thinking), both will help you become a better programmer.Step 4You can try Topcoder if you want. Or just let it be.With CP, if your goal is to get offers from Google HQ and likes, you will have to do it regularly. That is, give contests, try to rank higher, and build your rating.Otherwise, you can just do it on the side and focus on building other practical skills.These practical skills combined with your decent competitive programming experience will go a long way in helping you secure those jobs and internships you dreamed about.Step 5Keep doing this it will take Some time but it is the best way to be a Competitive Programmer.Don’t Be Frustrated.I need Your upvote ,Hit up if you’re also think Programming is Best <3images - Google images",96 followers,Kevin Hongtongsak,5.6K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-programming-languages-or-new-technology-should-I-learn-before-attending-an-upcoming-hackathon-I-have-2-months-to-learn

I am going to give you a practical answer that will allow you to facilitate the most career success.Become an expert in one language and be familiar with a second language.Thdere are fundamentally two types of programming languages, “imperative” and “declarative”. Declarative languages would include things like F#, Haskell, and Scala. Declarative languages, while interesting, are primarily limited to the academic domain. Therefore, let's confine a discussion to the so-called imperative languages.As you begin to study many programming languages, you'll find that all imperative languages have very much of the same type of ""grammar"". While a detailed discussion of grammar is beyond the scope of this post, suffice to say that the very similar grammars make second, third, and subsequent languages much easier to learn than the first one. This is in stark contrast to “natural languages” that we write and speak to communicate between two human beings, which not only have different symbols but widely varying grammars.The ability to learn subsequent languages after the first one very quickly is not obvious. Consequently, it is important to at least become familiar with a second imperative language. This way, you will be able to tell a potential employer that you can pick up a new language very quickly. Perhaps more importantly, if you were an expert in C# and knew JavaScript, your experience with learning JavaScript quickly would be helpful in knowing that you could pick up PHP or Python very quickly.Would you then be considered an expert in the subsequent languages? No, because being an expert also implies that you have a full understanding of this supporting libraries and frameworks for that language, which could be wildly different.In summary, become an expert in one imperative language, familiarize with a second imperative language, and you will never fear having to learn new programming languages again. True expertise is something else entirely and you'll find that it is very rare to find a true ""expert” in more than a single programming language because of the diverse support libraries and frameworks.",0 followers,Shivam Maindola,585,58,611.5K,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-programming-languages-or-new-technology-should-I-learn-before-attending-an-upcoming-hackathon-I-have-2-months-to-learn

Please Do NOT use it to go hacking some system. You will end up in jail.I like the definition according to Wikipedia:“A computerEasy.The term “hacking” has been grossly misused. Actually, hacking isn’t what you think it is…DISCLAIMER: This information is for educational purposes only. Please Do NOT use it to go hacking some system. You will end up in jail.I like the definition according to Wikipedia:“A computerThere are code libraries to hack into almost any known system in existence.There are code libraries in Assemby, C, C++, Perl, LISP, PHP, JavaScript, Java, C#, Python, Golang, Objective-C, Scala, Kotlin, Clojure, Erlang, Haskel, Visul Basic, COBOL, and every programming language you can think of.You may think that a hacker is someone who wears a T-shirt written “Hacker” in bold letters on the back. How wrong!As the definition says, a hacker is “a skilled computer expert”. This means anyone with good programming skills can become a hacker. One can decide to become an ethical hacker or an unethical hacker, depending on the motive. Just for clarification an ethical hacker is someone who hacks systems for the common good. An unethical hacker is someone who hacks systems for the common harm.It’s not easy to hack into any system/platform if you don’t know the target system’s programming language.To hack into any system/platform, you should know some programming, particularly the programming language of the system/platform. Sometimes you may have to know a lot of programming. Unfortunately, 99% of people do not have an interest in programming.There are many hacking tools out there, depending on the underlying OS/shell.Some programming skills are essential, especially at system level. You just need to choose the right library in any given language you’re targeting. With a little modification on the code you’re good to go.That being said, it’s not as easy as you think. Most hacking involves reverse-engineering therefore reading and understanding the code is essential, sometimes involving many hours of reading and writing code.You should have some coding experience, preferably at system level, depending on your target platform. Hacking is about programming, therefore you can’t access any serious system unless you have some good system-level software engineering skills.If you don’t know programming too bad.According to legendary hacker-turned good guy, Kevin Mitnik, hacking is more of an art than a science.In this regard, the best hackers are software engineers who are good at social engineering. Social engineering refers to a term commonly used to describe the use of psychology together with software engineering to steal passwords from unsuspecting victims.The majority of software, platforms and systems have vulnerabilities, making them an oyster for hackers. Hackers can smell a vulnerable system from far away, using stealth tools and software.80% of websites do not have any serious protection schemes, therefore, with some good tools you can access almost any website and decide what to do with it. According to a survey by WPWhiteSecurity, more than 70% of WordPress installations are vulnerable to attacks and exploits.That being said, hacking is not exactly the same as software engineering. Even if you’re a skilled software engineer, you may not have the expertise required to hack into a system.Here are top programming languages used by ethical hackers:Web Hacking and Pentesting1. HTMLHTML is an important markup language and one of the core technologies of the world wide web (WWW). Knowledge of HTML is therefore essential for hacking websites.2. JavaScriptJavaScript is available on almost every web browser on the planet and the most widely used client-side programming language. Understanding JavaScript code logic can help you find the flaws in web applications and websites.3. SQLSQL is the universal database programming language. Data is stored, retrieved and edited in a database therefore understanding SQL is essential for finding vulnerabilities in the most sensitive area of the Web.4. PHPPHP is the most widely used server-side programming language on the Web. Good knowledge of PHP is essential for hacking and penetration testing.5. PerlPerl is a popular scripting language and one of the earliest web programming languages. Perl is widely used for CGI programming, active web pages and system administration.ExploitsAn exploit is a piece of software, a chunk of data, or a sequence of commands that takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer software, hardware, or something electronic1. C/C++C/C++2. PythonPython is the most preferred language for writing exploits due to its widespread use, simplicity and availability of code libraries. It can be used for Socket Programming and therefore essential for creating exploits.3. RubyRuby is a powerful object-oriented programming language suitable for writing exploits. Ruby is used for meterpreter scripting. The Metasploit Framework is itself programmed in Ruby.4. JavaJava’s philosophy of “write once, run anywhere,” (WORA) underscores its cross-platform capabilities and makes it a prime candidate for creating backdoor exploits as well as exploits that can basically kill a computer.5. LISPLisp is one of the oldest high-level programming languages still in widespread use. LISP is a hacker’s favourite programming language due to its openness and flexibility, which allows you to specify your own syntax and create any programming paradigm of choice.Reverse EngineeringIn software engineering, Reverse Engineering, is a technique used to analyze software with a view to identify and understand the code or algorithms it is written in.The idea is to re-create the software into its constituent parts with a view to build something similar to it, to exploit its vulnerabilities or strengthen its defenses.Assembly LanguageAssembly is a complicated low level programming language which can be used to instruct a machine’s hardware directly. It is the most favourite programming language for reverse engineering hackers.(For obvious reasons, I do not feel obligated to go any further to reveal the exact tools and resources you can use to hack into systems).","29,209 followers",Mattias Petter Johansson,1.9K,1.1K,16.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-programming-languages-or-new-technology-should-I-learn-before-attending-an-upcoming-hackathon-I-have-2-months-to-learn
