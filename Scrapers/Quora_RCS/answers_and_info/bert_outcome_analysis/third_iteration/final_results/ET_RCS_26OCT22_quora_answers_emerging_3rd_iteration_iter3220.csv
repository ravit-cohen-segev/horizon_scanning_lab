6,"“If a day is actually exactly 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds, how do our clocks adjust every day to exactly match 24 hours?”Okay, so the problem here is that a “day” is NOT the same as a full rotation of the Earth. The time period you mentioned, 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds, is a sidereal day. That is the length of time it takes for the Earth to turn 360 degrees, or one full rotation.But that’s not a *solar* day.A solar day is when your position on Earth rotates around to point at the Sun again. That requires roughly *361* degrees of rotation.

That requires roughly *361* degrees of rotation. Every day, the Earth also revolves around the Sun about one degree per day, or 360 degrees per year. So every day, the Earth has to rotate an extra degree or so to “catch up” to the position of the Sun. If the Earth didn’t do this, then our clocks would be off by about four minutes every day, until midnight and noon switched places after six months.We don’t want that to happen, so we set our clocks to when the same point on the Earth is facing the Sun again, so 24 hours is roughly 361 degrees of rotation, not 360.Also, several people have brought up the leap year in the comments, but the leap year has nothing to do with the clock or the length of the day, and everything to do with the *calendar* and the length of the *year,* which is why I haven’t been discussing leap years until this very paragraph, (which I have now edited again just for Bryan Jackson’s deep commitment to grammar and verb tense.)",441 followers,Rohan Jain,5.6K,1.1K,50.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-observe-24-hours-of-weather-patterns-every-day-without-actually-spending-24-hours-per-day-for-it-by-using-some-advanced-technology

That’s a lot of rocks [1]Depending upon what you want to call ‘advanced’ technology, of course.* Composites like hafted spears are advanced, and may be as much as 500,000 years old, perhaps. Other evidence suggests something closer to 120,000 years [3]More ‘modern’ ideas’ such as aviation, spaceflight, most ‘electronics’ and suchlike are arguably just a few hundred years old, if that.

Luck, chance and circumstance had to play out in the right ways, too.* And our survival - at the end of the day - may have had more to do with a higher effective breeding rate, a larger average social cohort, or our unusual fat distribution, t...",0 followers,Claire Jordan,1.8K,45.6K,295.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-advanced-technology-made-us-lazier-and-less-performing

It’s one of the most advanced technologies of all time. Coopers had to serve an apprenticeship for years. The Coopers who failed ended up making “dry barrels” that only held produce or things that wouldn’t spoil. There are very few people who know how to make a barrel today. Even Jack Daniels, the biggest barrel maker in the world, uses an automated process now because making them by hand is too slow. The art of coopering is dying. There are very, very few people who know how to make a barrel left in the world and fewer every year, yet barrel making was an advanced technology that changed the entire world for literally thousands of years.Incidentally. the most prolific barrel in the world today is the ASB or American Standard Barrel that hold 53 gallons because America makes more barrels than anyone else in the world. Many used Jack Daniels barrels are re-used to make other kinds of liquor in other parts of the world.Do you know who the highest paid man in the community was in “ancient times”? It was the Wheelwright.Making a wheel from wood with an axle that attaches to a cart and doesn’t fall apart within a mile or two is one of the most “advanced technologies” of all time. Without it, most civilizations would have failed or failed to spread. Cart wheels are complex and the forces must play against each other continuously to hold the wheel together as it rolls. A Cartwright made as much then as a jet airline pilot back does today. In the 1880s when the average wage was $1.50 a day, the Wheelwright was making 90 dollars a week. On the Mayflower they brought one single cart over to America and it was the most valuable thing on the ship manifest, worth more than 10 times the next most valuable thing on the ship.
