It told the whole of their lives over the last few months. It expressed their feelings and documented their mishaps and their victories. It provided solace for distant friends, lovers and family. It filled the yawning information gap. You could infill a biography through their letters.Now there is no information gap. If I holiday in Noumea, my instagram followers know what colour bikini I’m wearing on the beach while I’m still on the beach. You and I are no longer discrete entities. We don’t store all of our knowledge in our brain and release snippets carefully. Now you are a node, a neuron in a great social brain. Now there are other nodes in your network that hold the same information as you, even as you experience it. There are nodes holding knowledge so you don’t have to. Now if you need to know something, it is a text or a google away.We don’t need to burrow into library archives anymore. We txt Jo or Sam or Aaliya to find out the thing we need to know. We don’t need to hold that information anymore, another node has our ass covered.The internet has changed us from being islands of knowledge into being strands in a web. It has changed communication into a way of storing information outside our own brains.",1 follower,Kirk Scott,664,13.4K,68.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-did-communication-technology-evolve-in-the-21st-century
1,"I think a better question is “why do so many people dislike Obama?” There are reasons, if you’re a Republican, to dislike his policies while in office. Plenty of reasons. But what baffles most of us who like him is the raw personal hatred of a decent man who worked hard for America, and the willingness of so many Americans to believe ANYTHING about him. Look, if I believed he lied about his birthplace, was a closet Muslim pretending to be a Christian, had a wife who dissed the American flag, apologized again and again for America, had an IQ of 102, ran a corrupt administration, and on and on,I think a better question is “why do so many people dislike Obama?” There are reasons, if you’re a Republican, to dislike his policies while in office.

But here’s the thing. . .All of those things, which have been widely spread, have been proven to be lies. That means that people who dislike Obama — apart from his policies — have been used. They have been taught to demonize him in order to enhance GOP policies that again and again screw the very people who hate Obama. Tax cuts for the rich. Damn the deficit (that we blasted Obama for). Screw the environment, especially in rural areas where GOP voters predominate. Screw the future. Give us back our flag and stand tall and make it 1959 again. Infrastructure bill, anyone?One day SOME of those who have hated Obama MAY wake up and realize how they’ve been used. But at this point, as the hatred just keeps on coming almost two years after he left office, I’m beginning to doubt that will ever happen. They will just go on voting against their own interests, fears and hatreds whipped up by the masters.",289 followers,Alan Davis,4.1K,322,395.6K,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-did-communication-technology-evolve-in-the-21st-century

He gave powerful speeches and coherent interviews that proved he was in full control of his faculties.

Today in Sweden, 8% of land is dedicated to farming, and farmers make up 2% of the population.This radical change means that 98% of the population makes something else than food.

The creature’s natural lifespan is less than a year, but species can survive decades under a rock in the desert or frozen in ice in the antarctic, get hit with a raindrop, and be up and copulating in the amount of time it takes you to put on socks. We slapped some on the outside of a spaceship for 10 minutes, and 68% of them survived (that’s a lethal dose of cold and a lethal dose of radiation and a lethal dose of nothing to breathe for pretty much everything else living).The reason I’m droning on about this microscopic marvel is that the only advantage humans have over a tardigrade is a fairly impressive brain. We have done a lot with that single evolutionary trait, but it really isn’t as unique as we like to make it out to be. Other species use tools, other species have communities, and other species haveEdit: It is wise to note that every species is equally evolved. It’s not a process with an end goal in mind, it’s ongoing and random. Traits can come and go, some are beneficial, some are not, some are specialized, others are pretty general. Species that survive something like a mass extinction tend to be highly flexible in the biomes they can live in, and it’s a trait we see in many species across the world today. Those species that can survive the largest range of calamities have the best chances at survival, and that’s probably the highest evolutionary trait, if you want to place them in a completely subjective hierarchy.Can you imagine how many species of single celled organisms died off before the first multicellular organism came into being?

Alice borrows some money from Bob and Bob writes it on a piece of paper signed by Alice. After some days Alice denies the existence of such document and claims that Bob has forged that piece of paper. Bob would now find it difficult to prove that Alice actually owes him Money.In this example Alice and Bob are two nodes.Now assume the same scenario, but among a society. So there are ’k’ pair of people transacting with each other. And the only proof that each pair has, is that piece of paper. Looking at this scenario, one person, Kate comes up with a solution. She suggests maintaining a common notebook of transaction for entire society. She designates town hall to be the place where every exchange takes place. In the common notebook, every pair writes the transaction and then the notebook is kept safely. People rejoice and accept Kate as their leader.That notebook can be called a database.But one day, somebody spills wine on the notebook. This makes the notebook illegible. Taking the advantage of this situation, Alice again denies taking money from Bob.This is the problem databases face - single point of failure.Irritated by this problem, Kate comes up with another solution. She suggests maintaining multiple notebooks. She chooses some trustworthy people from the society and gives them a notebook each. Now every time a transaction or exchange takes place between two people, Kate instructs some of those trustworthy people to mention the transaction in their notebooks. So the data is repeated in the notebooks. Now, even if one notebook is destroyed, chances are that all the data regarding transactions are still present in the combination of other notebooks.This is a distributed database and multiple notebooks are the multiple nodes.But next day, another problem arises. Kate has a friend named Bert who owes a lot of money to some people in the society. He asks Kate for help and she agrees to help him. She instructs all the people with the notebooks to remove the entries where Bert received money. Now Bert doesn’t owe any money based on the notebooks.This is the problem with distributed databases - they are centralized. That means one single entity owns all the nodes/resources and can make changes as they deem fit.When the people from the society come to know of it, they remove Kate from the leadership.* They decide to keep a notebook each. Every time a transaction is made between any two people , all the people from the town come together and mention it in their respective notebooks. So if there are n people in the society, then there are n notebooks and no one person controls the overall representation of the transactions.
