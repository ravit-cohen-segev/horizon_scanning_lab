This limited their economy since they had to rely largely on their own muscles for work, rather than having animals available to increase efficiency. As a result, more people were required to feed the same number of people as in Europe or Asia, leaving fewer people to pursue other lines of work.Another factor that shouldn't be underestimated is that the lack of horses or other pack animals limited trade to whatever people could carry on their own and to rivers. They did have rafts to conduct long distance trade that could carry a significant amount of goods, but much less than the more advanced ships the cultures of Europe, Asia and North Africa had available. Trade helps spread technology and often is responsible for the invention of technology in the first place. The fact that neither North American nor South or Central American civilizations developed anything even close to the kind of ships other civilizations developed indicates that there either just was no need for them or that there was another factor that prohibited the development of ships.We know that metal working, particularly copper was well known in the Americas, iron however was rare. That may be due to the lack of convenient sources or the inability to properly work it. It's anyone's guess if working iron and making steel would have eventually been discovered or not.It's impossible to say whether or not technology in the Americas would have progressed much further or what path it may have taken, but personally I don't think something like an industrial revolution would have happened there without contact to other civilizations. The conditions simply weren't very conductive to the development of more advanced technology, but I also can't rule it out.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,17K,996,156M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-the-new-world-had-been-left-to-its-own-devices-for-a-few-more-centuries-would-they-have-developed-advanced-technology-in-a-completely-different-way-from-the-old-world-or-would-they-have-followed-a-similar

When you use Quora, you’re accessing Quora’s servers.The client today takes many form factors such as cell phones, tablets, laptops.What makes mobile communication so powerful is coverage. One is no longer chained to a LAN point or a wifi hotspot. You can stay connected driving in tunnels, jogging in the park, taking the subway, even swimming in the pool.How is coverage achieved? Well, you build a network to blanket the area.America has absolute dominance at both ends. On the client side, we have consumer Apple, and SOC supplier Qualcomm that has a huge lead in 5G modem technology. On the server side, Intel and AMD power the majority of the world’s computers while Cisco and Broadcom provide the switching necessary to direct traffic.But America dropped out of the network game some years ago, the spiderweb depicted above. There is no American 5G network gear. The only choices today are five Scandinavian and Far Eastern companies.Huawei has had negligible presence in the US market because they have been denied access. Some networks deploy Huawei 4G gear to provide affordable coverage for rural areas and small numbers of Honor handsets are sold.The American government further implemented a legal ban on Huawei equipment in telecommunications networks, completely barring Huawei from the American market.At this point, any concerns about future Huawei threats to America’s national security is zero, because Huawei cannot even come near American networks. No network gear, cell phones, tablets or laptops. Zilch.But this was not enough.

I am an early adopter (within the limits of my budget). I understand that brain-computer interface chips do not work now except for very limited neurosurgical interventions. The sort of more direct brain-computer technology I dream about would require big breakthroughs in understanding how the brain stores and processes information, the brain’s software, if you will. (I recognize that comparing a brain to a computer is a metaphor. They are two very different sorts of things. Figuring out precisely what those differences are is a work in progress. But it’s a useful rough metaphor at this stage if we don’t take it too seriously.)

Likely influenced by Western critical thought (and I consider rejection and critique as a form of influence) as several prominent proponents, including Ghana’s founding prime minister Kwame Nkrumah, were educated at the universities of Paris, London and Pennsylvania. Where they mixed and found solidarity with each other much like how citizens of nations like France and Germany, through social mixing, have gone from bitter rivals to being very good friends.See, Africa has a slight problem in that while it is absolutely chock full of different ethnic groups who are as similar to each other as Frenchmen are to Poles, they’re pretty divided between themselves. George Peter Murdock, a 20th century American anthropologist, made a hit-and-miss attempt in 1959 to figure out what the ethnic makeup of Africa actually looks like. What he found however, was a continent that wasAfrica’s general lack of any unifying ideology, such as what Europe had with Christianity, created a continent where local inhabitants could be completely different from a group just a fifty miles away, and this was the case across most of the continent. The interior of Africa was almost unreachable until the European empires began laying railway lines in the 19th century (long after the slave trade was popular) and developing resistances to various exotic diseases.Murdock wasn’t 100% in his observations but this is the kind of continent we’re talking about. A land where the relationship between ethic groups runs the entire spectrum of cooperation along with a list of groups who don’t give a single fig about a number of others. Even the largest native kingdoms in its history were barely able to unite even half of it, so before the arrival of Europeans there was very little you could say united a large number of Africans.Some groups get along, others hate each others’ guts. Some are deeply divided inside themselves. Wakanda even suffered from this intra-continental fighting as evidenced by the British Museum possessing a 7th century warhammer from Benin that was actually from Wakanda. Suggesting some conflict between Wakanda and another African nation (likely the Fon people). They don’t mention it in the movie but it is very likely the first people the Wakandan barrier was built to hide from were other Africans.Wakandans, like many Africans before the spread of Pan-Africanism, are ethnic nationalists; the Europeans who came to the continent during the age of empires were likely as foreign to the Wakandan groups as the Fon, Igbo or Zulus were because foreign-ness in Africa is not about the colour of your skin, but where you came from. Their extended isolation would have fostered a disinterest in helping other Africans against foreigners because as far as they were concerned, the various European nations were just another tribe looking to carve their own piece of Africa. They just happened to be damn good at enforcing order in their really big territories.If Wakanda really did think of marching out of their bubble and single-handedly ending the Atlantic slave trade, there would have been p","18,451 followers",Nathan Stanish,12.5K,2.3K,62.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-the-new-world-had-been-left-to-its-own-devices-for-a-few-more-centuries-would-they-have-developed-advanced-technology-in-a-completely-different-way-from-the-old-world-or-would-they-have-followed-a-similar

But it's not a simple answer.Let's start by debunking the popular misconception about African slavery: It wasn’t European merchants trekking into deepest Africa with nets or snares to catch black people.

What made it an operation on such a phenomenal scale was that African chieftains quickly worked out that these merchants were buying as many slaves as they could get. There appeaPossibly.

It was black people catching and sellingSlavers from Spain, America and Britain were only buying captives offered to them in villages and merchant ports. What made it an operation on such a phenomenal scale was that African chieftains quickly worked out that these merchants were buying as many slaves as they could get. There appeared to be no limit to how many slaves these foreigners needed and they were paying for them with powerful weapons, cool trinkets and luxurious textiles. Again, an almost boundless quantity. So these chieftains figured they can handle going on more slave raids. More raids means more slaves to sell means more stuff for the chief or tribe. Most weren’t that bothered they were “selling off their own kind” because for a number of tribes, these sea-people were no more foreign than the people of the village twenty miles away. See the current cultural divides and genocides in Africa to get what I mean.Plus it wasn’t just Europeans. Merchants from Arabia and India were doing the same thing on the continent’s eastern coastline. For far longer too.Now, if a super-advanced kingdom like Wakanda actually existed then it’s actuallyBefore the laser-drills would have come picks and carts. Who are you going to give those to?Rome conquered as much as it did for one primary reason: Security. The more of the known world they could pacify, the more comfortable they’d feel. Wakanda was, like Rome before it, surrounded by various tribes who hated each other as much as they hated this place. And Wakanda considers them all to be as foreign as the white people from across the sea. There’s precedent for a martial culture and a desire to pacify the neighbors and that’s the foundation stones of a Rome on Lake Turkana if there ever was one.Not only that, once they’ve got the material they have this super-cool metal that not only is capable of absorbing any blow, but put a current through it and you can make things explode with it! I get it, immense power, dangerous technology, don’t want it to fall into the wrong hands yadda-yadda-yadda. That kind of thinking only went nuclear (pardon the pun) after the super-advanced toys were used on other advanced nations. Before then, Europeans were buying people, salt and food with guns as early as 1495 if not earlier. It’s possible an early Wakanda-like would have also bought slaves and food with stuff made with or using vibranium (possibly the latter if the empire decided to sit on this super-material that other nations begged for).In the comics this wasn’t so much the case because the vibranium space rock was accompanied by a divine request for the Panther Tribe to be guardians. It was ingrained on their very culture to protect the Great Mount. In the real world however, the Panther King has a divine right to rule as he saw fit. Being chosen by the panther god and blessed accordingly, all that fun stuff.A super-advanced nation with technology centuries beyond its neighbors ruled over by a genuine superhuman god-king?It is possible that this Wakandan Empire could interfere with the Trans-Atlantic triangle. Because now you have an empire that might just have a Manifest Destiny claim on the African continent. A nation that’s more advanced than even the European leaders hungry for resources and with desires backed by weapons and devices that made then-modern cannon look anemic. Or the Wakandan Imperial nobility make a centralised system where they sell slaves captured on their frontiers to Europeans in exchange for exotic goods like clothes, Belgian woodworking, ceremonial swords and what have you. Wakanda may be advanced but I bet they would still pay a fortune for a caribou fur coat or a pet Siberian mink because you can’t get either of them natively in Africa. It took a global conflict among equals that flattened one continent and devastated the others to put an end to ideas of empires being a good thing.The saving grace of this rather dark image is if in their engorgement of wealth, Wakandans get their own Enlightenment Period. They might have developed an idea of all Africans being kin (or certain Africans) and using it to unify their super-nation. Kick-starting the birth of Pan-Africanism by two centuries if not more. But bear in mind that even today, as the Black Panther movie demonstrates, African-Americans can be treated as distinct from Africans as Africans are to Europeans, by Africans. So there’s no guarantee that a Wakandan-born Pan Africanism would include African-Americans or even all Africans.Would the Atlantic Slave Trade have gone on as long as it did if there was a Wakandan empire? Probably. Rather than stopping the trade in the 17th century, they might use the system as a form of income or harshly responded to any human trafficking, but only in their territory.It’s hard to say what could have happened come to think of it. Depends on how such a nation develops when it comes to how they understand people outside the founding five tribes.P.S. I went on a colossal tangent with this answer so depending on the answer’s reception I might keep a version on my blog",0 followers,Syed Asghar,1K,137,1.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-the-new-world-had-been-left-to-its-own-devices-for-a-few-more-centuries-would-they-have-developed-advanced-technology-in-a-completely-different-way-from-the-old-world-or-would-they-have-followed-a-similar

Asgard:1, Wakanda: 0CommunicationHere, we just aren’t sure about the effectiveness of Odin’s Crows. But other than that, Wakandan communication involves direct transfer but the Asgardian (confirmed) system involves a medium and thus isn’t very effective.

Asgard:1, Wakanda: 1MetalsCaptain America is using Vibranium Shield which is made of Vibranium, the best metal available to Wakandans. While Thanos’ Sword is made of Uru metal, which is commonly used by Asgardians. Indirect Comparison. Asgard:2, Wakanda:1ArmorsBut Earthlings are mortal and more vulnerable. Asgardians don't need any such armors since their bodies are strong enough. Though Asgardians have the potential, Wakandans are better off. Asgard:2, Wakanda:2WeaponsIs that even a competition? Asgard:3, Wakanda:2ArchitectureSorry Wakandans but they have developed a planet and have higher skyscrapers. Asgard:4, Wakanda:2SafetyThor: The Dark World showed that Asgard has a pretty weak defense system. Wakanda wins here. Asgard:4, Wakanda:3Both have made many more feats but I can’t remember anything else. Mention in Comments if you feel like it should be included.To conclude, it can be plausibly said that Asgard is the home of Gods while Wakanda is just an advanced nation on Earth (thanks to Vibranium). Ultimately, we humans can’t even realize what these Gods are up to and what powers they possess. Asgard is much more advanced than Wakanda in any case.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-the-new-world-had-been-left-to-its-own-devices-for-a-few-more-centuries-would-they-have-developed-advanced-technology-in-a-completely-different-way-from-the-old-world-or-would-they-have-followed-a-similar
