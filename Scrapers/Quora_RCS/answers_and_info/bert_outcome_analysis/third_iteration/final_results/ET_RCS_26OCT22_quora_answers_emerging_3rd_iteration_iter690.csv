But we do have key things that will shift our thinking into that we are technologically superior.Arms ExportsThe USA has led the world in arms exports since atleast 1950 with more than $47 billion dollars in sales per year. Russia comes in second with around $33 billion. Let’s say Russia is selling a pistol and the USA is selling a pistol, the countries test and deem the USA one “better” thus the world would prefer the pistol made in the USA rather than Russia. It begs the question, Why would the world buy a product that is inferior to the other? Countries aren’t stupid, they try to spend their money wisely when choosing weapons of different varieties. They will throughly test and score which is better. Which ever they deem is “better” they will most likely purchase. Also, sometimes the cost of the product will be a factor but rarely is.Battle TestedThis might stir the pot but let’s not. The USA has been at war for the better part of the 21st century and one of the enemies whom we later defeated, was a rather menacing enemy in the world and the Middle East. America’s equipment has been put to the test. Going up against a well established military (Iraq) and militias (Afghanistan). In both conflicts, equipment performed tremendously well. The USA lost 2 planes in the entire conflict, one was lost due to friendly fire, and the other was shot down by a Surface to air missile while it was performing a “gun run” and was rather close to the ground. The M1A1/A2 Abrams tank has so far when in control of American crews has not been lost due to enemy fire. The Abrams has only been lost due to friendly fire and even then they weren’t “lost” most could be repaired but some were scuttled in order to keep the enemy away from the classified controls and systems. Also, American weaponry performed really well with the M-16A4 working well as always. And the M39 EMR, and MK 14 EBR making a stunning appearance for the first time in combat and it was a phenomenal rifle, according to my cousin who used it and trained with it and I’m sure from people who use it.VouchingIt really shouldn’t be any doubt in anyone’s minds that America’s Nimitz-Class and forth coming Ford-Class Aircraft carriers are the best in the world. Only 1 country outside the USA has nuclear powered carriers and that’s France with only 1 which is the R91 Charles de Gaulle. Also, they are the longest in the world and can carry almost double the amount of planes of the next carrier with around 95 planes. The US’s Seawolf-class submarines are among the most quietest in the world, with experts saying that a seawolf traveling at 25 knots underwater is quieter than an Akula III Class...","5,084 followers",Bobby Tatro,5.2K,2.2K,45.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Have-there-ever-been-any-top-secret-technological-advancements-such-as-weapons-that-governments-of-the-world-successfully-kept-secret-from-the-public-and-other-countries

Freedom of Speech, according to our Founders, was for all of Mankind, not just the Socialist Student, that for the first time in their lives, have been given some form of Freedom to Choose. Because of the Uncertainty, plague, that has spread through these Ideological Autoclaves, we call Institutions of Higher Learning, when in fact; These are Institutions of Socialist Indoctrination. Herein lies the Problem. They could care less about the Safety of Information, the Protection of Classified, TOP SECRET Documents or Programs.We have Foreign Nationals, from several Countries, that come here as Spies, they come in Droves, approved by our State Department and in Exchange Programs and Why? These individuals, have not been thoroughly Vetted by the FBI .. CIA … NSA …Therefore, they should Never be Granted Access to the United States.

These Countries, China, Iranian, North Korea, Russian, have all Hacked into our Military Industrial Companies. That is except for Boeing. Boeing learned in the 1970’s to protect their Secret Programs, both Civilian and Military. Others, haven’t been so intent. In fact, if you look, do some research, you will find, many Foreign Nationals have been caught, convicted, and in some cases, go to Prison and then Deported. Other more High Profile Cases, the State Dept., in concert with our Intelligence Agencies, will Exchange certain individuals, for American’s held in other Countries. Country’s like Iran, North Korea and China, rarely exchange Prisoners. They will sacrifice their own, to make the US Families of those they hold.The United States has lost many many secret Technologies because of this. However, one of our most serious issues is with our Socialist Democratic Led House of Representatives.
