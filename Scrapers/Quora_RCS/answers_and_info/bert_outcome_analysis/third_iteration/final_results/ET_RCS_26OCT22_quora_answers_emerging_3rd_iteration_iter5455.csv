3,"I had been wanting to take a stab at this one since a few days, but it always looked like an enormous task, because this question has used too many words. In addition, this is a question on which a lot of people have their eyes, and a lot of others have already written elaborate answers.Let me first re-order all the important words:Imagine that you want to become a data scientist, and work in a big organization like Amazon, Intel, Google, FB, Apple and so on.How would that look like?I had been wanting to take a stab at this one since a few days, but it always looked like an enormous task, because this question has used too many words.

I only extracted a few sections out of it conveniently because I only wanted to add on the top of someone elseâ€™s knowledge, and put together these concepts like a story so as to inspire the people to think about this subject and begin their own journeys.Big data: The next frontier for innovation, competition, and productivityI will answer a few questions step by step, and wherever possible, I will give a few pictures, or plots to show you how things look like.McKinsey consultants! You are amazing, so if you read things written in this answer that were typed by you at some point in time, I give full credit to you.Let us now talk about analysis: This is big part of being a data scientist.Hope this somewhat elaborate write up gives you some inspiration to hold on to.","12,843 followers",Bradley Voytek,651,193,4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/With-the-emergence-of-Big-Data-technologies-e-g-Hadoop-NoSQL-in-memory-DB-etc-will-data-warehouse-data-mining-ETL-technologies-die
4,"Get a Digital Ocean box (cheapest for $5/month, but you only pay for usage) and visit their community/faq section. They have tutorials on just about everything including setting up all kinds of different services.The most important one; however, is an ""expert"" level tutorial on horizontal and vertical scaling.

8,"Never repeat a mistake. Thatâ€™s as fast as youâ€™ll get.Quick example: you name your variables a, b and c. You learn that it is important to name them more descriptively. You rename them to firstName, surname and dateOfBirth.You never name anything a, b, c again.Whatâ€™s hard about this is how many poor practices there are. You inevitably will repeat mistakes through lack of knowledge.But every time you learn a better way, build it into every piece of code you write.",17 followers,Kruti Naik,1K,361,5.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-fastest-way-for-a-developer-to-learn-about-emerging-cloud-technology
