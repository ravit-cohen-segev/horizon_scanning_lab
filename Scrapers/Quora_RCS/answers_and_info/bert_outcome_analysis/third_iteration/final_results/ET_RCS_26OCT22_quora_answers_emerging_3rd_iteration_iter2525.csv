Reasoning, logic, and objective approaches formed the very core of his life.My family is deep-rooted in Christianity and thus his stance looked oddly outlandish.He was very rich, at least compared to most people in my family. My mom and dad do not have a car even now. But this man had three cars ten years ago. He was a dog lover. He had five dogs.Frequent international tours. Finest food. Stunning cars. Grand lifestyle. Put all these with this: kind, altruistic, balanced, and charismatic personality.That was him. The perfect package.Naturally, as a young man, I considered him my role model. I could not sense a false note anywhere.The final year of my engineering.He was diagnosed with Pancreatic cancer. The news struck us like lightning. The whole family scrabbled its way to his home.His life came crashing like a meteor. The whole town was in disbelief and shock.Many stupid but concerned questions were raised: ‚ÄúHow could this happen to HIM?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy HIM, of all people?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow could this happen to a Doctor?‚ÄùRegardless of the commotion, his time kept ticking. I remember visiting him during his last two months.I literally stopped breathing for a moment when I entered his home.The curtains had been enveloped with dust. The floor had not been mopped. The beautiful plants outside had started dying. The cars stood there begging for attention.Three of the five dogs had been given away. ‚ÄúHe wanted to keep Fido and Henry until‚Ä¶‚Äù the maid said with a trembling voice, holding on to my mom.Every face in the home was grief-stricken. Death prevailed in the room. There was an absolute silence in the home. Deafening silence.When I walked to his bed-side, every tinge of charm, glamour, and life his face once had had deserted him. He was pale and lifeless.There were pastors in his home. He had apparently requested for people from all faiths to pray for him. There were bibles all over. Verses from the Quran and bible had been pasted all over the wall.His wife told me about the changes he had been showing ever since the diagnosis. That night, I witnessed the horrors of his pain.I was in the hall and I could hear him wailing in his room. ‚ÄúSomeone save me. Take this pain away from me. Jesus, please hear me. I beg you. IS THERE A GOD WHO HEARS ME?‚ÄùI could clearly hear him sobbing like a 10-year old. I could hear thumps. Slaps. Something clawing the ground. Something being dragged on the floor. Something wriggling.A few minutes later.‚ÄúDarling, forgive me. PLEASE FORGIVE ME. PLEASE TELL ME I WILL LIVE.. JUST TELL ME‚Ä¶JUST‚Ä¶.ahhhhhhh‚ÄùAnd then some unintelligible mumbling. Muffled screams. Muted and menacing.This continued for almost an hour. And then, silence, marred intermittently by a woman sobbing. His wife.The next morning, the wife said that such nights had become a norm. She said how badly she wished he died instead of enduring the pain.I heard her crying into my mom‚Äôs chests: ‚ÄúAkka, I want him to die, but he keeps saying some miracle will happen and he will survive.‚ÄùI left his home, but my mom told me of how his final hours were.‚ÄúHe kept begging to ALL the gods before stumbling into unconsciousness.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe sobbed, pleadingly.‚ÄùHe kept believing in a miracle. He waited.We hold on to so many ideologies. Beliefs. Plans. Rules. Policies. Everything is just a facade.When your oxygen runs out. When the last drop of your blood trickles down. When the last month of your life nears. When the last moment arrives.When your life is on the cliffhanger, the human inside you kicks his way out. Trembling. Begging. Pleading. Disproving all the massive facades you had built all your life.Every brick of the wall you have built will be blown to smithereens. Your knowledge will vanish. Remember, the man who waited for a miracle was a doctor.You and I are fragile. Just wet fluttering tissues.Stop building facades. Be whoever you want to be. Atheist. Religious. Fat. Thin. Rich. Poor. Famous. Obscured.It does not matter. Just Start living while you still can. Love more. Live more. Lose the hatred.
