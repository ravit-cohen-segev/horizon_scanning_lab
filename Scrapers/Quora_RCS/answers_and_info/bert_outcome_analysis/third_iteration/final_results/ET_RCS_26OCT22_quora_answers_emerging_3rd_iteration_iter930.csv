0,"Have you ever seen a personal computer from the 1970s? Here’s the Commodore PET from 1977. It came with 8K of RAM, and a tape deck for storage.The IBM Personal Computer in 1981 didn’t replace the PET with a wholly different thing. But it did make improvements, and of course, as an independent development, no compatibility between them. But that’s the default. New things replace old, they don’t cooperate with old.The Macintosh in 1984 also didn’t toss out the idea of the personal computer, but it made improvements.So did the Amiga computer.Laptop computers didn’t change the whole idea, either.Have you ever seen a personal computer from the 1970s?

They did come up with a name for the class of personal computer: “laptop” or, later on, “notebook.” But they were still personal computers.And 42 years later, we still have laptops, which are still personal computers.Along the way, we added another new subclass, the tablet. They’re still personal computers, but there has been a revolution along the way, even if it happened a bit at a time.Sometimes we took a branch off to make something new, but still kind of the same thing. Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) were very low performance personal computers. We didn’t want to say “PC” most of the time with these. Except Microsoft, who initially called them “Pocket PC”, because, yes, they were pocket personal computers. Still faster and more capable than that old PET 2001.Today we have these things. They’re still personal computers as well, but they also got another subclass name: smartphone. Why? Well, they are personal computers with several data radio modems, one of which uses the same kind of cellular networks that cellphones used, back when plain old cellphones were a thing.One of the reasons you know a thing is a personal computer is that it can adapt to nearly any purpose, given time. Compared to that PET 2001, your phone — I have an Honor Magic4 Pro phone here in my hand — isn’t the same thing at all. And yet, yes it is. I can chose the programs I want to run on it, I can personalize it, and it’s mine, not something owned by my company, my university, etc. It’s vastly more powerful than the PET, the IBM PC, the Macintosh, the Grid, the Amiga, etc. And yes, it can be used as a telephone (though in fact, being a European model in the USA, not so much), but that’s kind of a side effect of having a data network. In fact, in about a week, the voice networks on my cellular carrier, T-Mobile, go away forever. It’s all computer from here on, all data!I will make the claim that the Personal Computer represented a major change in the way computers are used, marking the smart of the second generation. And that smartphones did as well, being part of the third generation. Those generations were about access and portability, though, not the fact that you’re using a computer:Of course, these are just my distinctions. None of this happened all at once, but over time. The first members of a new generation weren’t terribly useful yet. I could have a typical PDA with me all the time, but it didn’t network. Networking was a completely different technological revolution that overlays all of personal computing today.So whatever comes next, it’ll probably start out kind of crappy, and it’ll be made from the personal computers we use today, but if it’s a true revolution, it’ll drive that evolution to new places. The one I have in mind is this:In short, it’s a revolution not in wide-area communications, not in computing power, not in mobility, but more than anything, a revolution in man-machine communications. That’s happened before, and in fact, continuously. The GUIs in Amiga, Macintosh, and Windows were a huge change. The GUIs in mobile devices, especially tablets and smartphones, were a predictable but important change as well, a compromise in efficiency necessary to enable mobility. Along the way we got other interfaces, like good speech recognition between machine and man.The ultimate end is to eliminate the interface, or at least as much of the interface as possible, and connect machine to our brains. I don’t know if we’re jacking in, entering enhanced AR/VR, sticking anIn fact, if we’re going the VR/AR way next, that’s already a thing. In fact, I work out in a VR app calledRead More",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,2.8K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-thing-after-mobile-technology
1,"I think that kinda technology is already there, it's the Smartwatches or wearables tech, the Apple watch can make calls independent of a smartphone and it's the reason it may overtake the popularity of smartphones, for it to happen though following things must be done by all smartphone manufactures.1.

2,"Just as the mobile phone has replaced the desktop computer as our primary means of accessing the internet, augmented reality will replace the mobile phone as our primary means of interacting with the world around us.Augmented reality is a technology that overlays digital information on top of the physical world, in real time. This could be anything from text or graphics to sound or video. For example, you might be walking down the street and see a restaurant sign in Chinese. With augmented reality, you would be able to hold up your phone and see a translation of the sign appear right above it.Just as the mobile phone has replaced the desktop computer as our primary means of accessing the internet, augmented reality will replace the mobile phone as our primary means of interacting with the world around us.Augmented reality is a technology that overlays digital information on top of the physical world, in real time.

3,"Mobile phones will be transformed into all in one versatile tech gadget very soon. You will find your phones interacting on your behalf, responding to your clients, friends on your behalf, with builtin mini printers, controlling your appliances and vehicles etc.. This is going to happen in near future for sure.","5,861 followers",Terry Dinerman,696,27K,56.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-thing-after-mobile-technology
