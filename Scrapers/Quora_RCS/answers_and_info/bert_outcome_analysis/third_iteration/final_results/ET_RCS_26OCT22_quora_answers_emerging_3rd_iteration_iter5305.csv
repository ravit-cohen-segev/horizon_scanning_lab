Soon enough, technology will render him obsolete.Maverick, ever the rebel, is aware of that inevitability, but he’s not one to surrender. And he knows what he does is worth a premium, for the time being at least.The subtext however, is more intriguing.Rear Admiral:Those days are over. IP and franchises rule the roost now. CGI-fests are the order of the day. The entertainment world and all the stakeholders within it will replace you and your kind. The end is nigh.Tom CruiseA day may come when movie stars go extinct. When practical filmmaking dies a violent death. An hour of wolves and shattered budgets when the age of the movie star comes crashing down. But it is not this day, this day I fight.So, who’s the next Tom Cruise?Well, asTom Cruise is the next Tom Cruise.There’s no one quite like him, and there’s not going to be one like him for a long while. Until that chosen one arrives, Cruise will keep the movie star flag flying high.","15,677 followers",Sarthak Raj Baral,1.3K,550,66M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Is-Hadoop-on-its-way-out-Is-there-a-technology-coming-that-could-replace-the-whole-MapReduce-way-you-query-over-a-cluster-of-machines-Cant-you-just-automate-the-way-you-run-these-queries-Is-this-what-Blaze-is-trying-to-accomplish

3,"There is no NEXT Tom Cruise.Tom Cruise is basically a terrible actor. His best role wasThere is no NEXT Tom Cruise.Tom Cruise is basically a terrible actor. His best role wasTom Cruise has a very open secret to his success and well deserved fame.Tom Cruise is completely insane.If Tom Cruise wasn’t famous for being an actor he’d still be successful no matter what he did. I could see him being an excellent salesman. Whereas other actors use charm, skill, wit or good looks (and most women I know don’t find him particularly attractive) - Tom Cruise just replaces all that with sheer insanity and next to no regard for his personal safety. Tom CruiseClimb the Burj Khalifa?Break your foot jumping off a roof?Strap yourself to a plane taking off (multiple times)THIS IS REAL! HE WASN’T EVEN ASKED TO DO THIS!Tom Cruise is completely insane.On a milder note, he taught himself to bartend for thisA film with like five minutes showing him actually doing it.Tom Cruise has clearly never heard of post-production.Most actors would either get a stunt guy to do this or demand it be done in a green screen environment. Let’s talk about why that makes Tom special.When a stunt person does something, or some other trickery like green screen or CGI is used, it impacts the kinds of shots the camera crew can get. Maybe you can’t directly shoot the actor's face. Maybe certain angles are off-limits. Maybe the CGI limits how much time you can actually spend on the scene. Not with Tom. Tom will just do it, even when most producers and directorsWe spend a lot of time making fun of Tom for being so batshit crazy, but we shouldn’t. Tom’s insanity is his brand. It’s his special sauce and nobody else anywhere in Hollywood is as insane as him.",11 followers,Michael McTighe,1.9K,1.3K,10.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-actor-under-30-will-be-the-next-Tom-Cruise
