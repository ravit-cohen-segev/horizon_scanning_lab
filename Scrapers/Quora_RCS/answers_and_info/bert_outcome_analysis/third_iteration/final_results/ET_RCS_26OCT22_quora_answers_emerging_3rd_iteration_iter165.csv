0,The basic thing is this.. you must make yourself useful and resourceful for the company you are working in.Good educational credentials do have some advantage but in rare cases. You will be preferred when the company has to make a choice between equals in work.Otherwise the only thing matters is how much you contribute to the company. We are only worried about our career prospects. Having a concern for the company also helps and the side effect of this is that you learn as well as the company grows.Personally this approach has helped me a lot.

1,A degree from a good engineering college is just a gate pass into the havens of a company. A degree from a good engineering college does not always ensure that you land up in your dream company though it does ensure that your chances are higher.A degree from a good engineering college is just a gate pass into the havens of a company.

2,"If the person has already graduated and holds a good position in a top tech firm, then I guess it should not matter much to him/her.However, to answer the question, I would say that if that person had studied from an Ivy league college, then it could have benefited him in two ways as per my understanding:-An Ivy league college would have students placed in various top tech firms around the world and hence, one can wield the strong alumni network for further growth in career.If the person has already graduated and holds a good position in a top tech firm, then I guess it should not matter much to him/her.However, to answer the question, I would say that if that person had studied from an Ivy league college, then it could have benefited him in two ways as per my understanding:-An Ivy league college would have students placed in various top tech firms around the world and hence, one can wield the strong alumni network for further growth in career.Well the second point is not particularly a benefit related only to Ivy league colleges, but the probability of finding such bright & passion driven individuals would be higher in ivy league institutes.Rest as others have mentioned in their answers that now when you have started working in a good company, your career growth will depend on how you hone your skill set and take on challenges.Hope it Helps!All the best!","21,936 followers",Vidhi Khandel,20K,182,11.1M,2014,https://www.quora.com/How-much-did-studying-at-a-good-engineering-college-matter-if-the-person-has-already-graduated-and-currently-holding-a-good-position-in-a-top-technology-company-Does-where-you-studied-effect-your-future-career-prospects-somewhere-down-the-line

4,"Don't do it. People from TIER-1 colleges are not getting placed. Most of the people switch to IT, consulting or finance. Those who wake up late( people like me) prepare for ESE and state engineering exams, and live with constant job insecurity for eternity. Core engineering is a big no in India. Join Computer Science or Electronics in any good engineering college in India. You will have at least something to work for. In CSE and electronics, although you are in TIER-3 colleges, you have some hope in life. Civil engineering is dead.!",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,1.2K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-much-did-studying-at-a-good-engineering-college-matter-if-the-person-has-already-graduated-and-currently-holding-a-good-position-in-a-top-technology-company-Does-where-you-studied-effect-your-future-career-prospects-somewhere-down-the-line
5,"If all companies have their own character, the spectrum of what sort character is far, far broadened in the tech industry.Some tech companies are a wonderful and creative free-for-all. Others are extremely hierarchical and Machiavellian. Most tech companies hire larger than life leaders, and also accommodate a developer culture (either integrated with the whole, or carefully segmented as a developer hot house) which doesn’t always conform to societal norms.

I have to make progess in the pending cards and pick up new cards to the workstream if needed. My boss and I prioritize these tasks as my team doesn't work on sprints. There will be 2–3 meetings per day, this increases as you go up the ladder. Since most of my team is collocated i like to stop by their desk and have a quick chat than set up formal meetings.At the end of the year you are mostly judged based on the extra initiatives you do outside regular work stream. I believe this part makes everyday work interesting as you always have to be open to new innovative ideas.","91,584 followers",Roland Bartetzko,1.5K,3.4K,314.5M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-much-did-studying-at-a-good-engineering-college-matter-if-the-person-has-already-graduated-and-currently-holding-a-good-position-in-a-top-technology-company-Does-where-you-studied-effect-your-future-career-prospects-somewhere-down-the-line
