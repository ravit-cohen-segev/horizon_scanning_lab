But the Salesforce tower is absolutely unlike megaprojects like the Hoover or Grand Coulee dams in scale, immensity, and staying power. No projects of a similar physical scale has been attempted in the US since the 1970s.Why? That’s a long debate, so take your pick of:The SR 99 tunnel is one of the safest tunnels ever constructed, built to withstand strong earthquakes and equipped with smart safety systems designed to keep traffic moving and people safe. In the rare event an emergency requires drivers and passengers to leave the roadway, there are doors every 650 feet leading to safe areas to wait or exit the tunnel. An exit pathway runs the entire length of the tunnel and is equipped with its own state-of-the-art ventilation and fire suppression systems. Tunnel operators will monitor the SR 99 tunnel 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, utilizing an extensive camera system able to detect anything unusual inside the SR 99 tunnel.100 years in the future, will any of these trends reverse? I can’t imagine how. When countries get rich,What ancient “technology” do conspiracy theories and science fiction most commonly associate with alien interference? It wasn’t the loom, steel production, agriculture, or otherWhy? Because the scale of the pyramids — coupled with the nominal frivolity they served — is far beyond what we would attempt in 2019.Cell phones will look ancient. Laptops will be a joke. Airplanes will be in museums next to bows-and-arrows. But mega-infrastructure will look like it was stolen from an alternate-timeline, more ambitious, future.","4,736 followers",Ben Podgursky,5.1K,337,9.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-technology-will-look-like-after-20-years

Regenerative medicine and stem cell therapy would address most of the organ transplant cases.(Image credit:Bio fuelsWith depleting natural resources like petroleum and coals, bio fuels will soon take over that empty space.

They could afford to do that back then and still manage to retire at a reasonable age?Why are things so different now that the average middle-class family can’t get near affording that without both parents workingWe already know the answer to this.You could argue that it would look like the America most conservatives want to get back to. That time back in the ’50s before the dirty hippies screwed everything up and family values reigned supreme.Dad went to work at a good honest 9–5 job, Mom stayed home with the 3 kids and kept the baby out of Alice’s way while she vacuumed.What’s that you say? They could afford to do that back then and still manage to retire at a reasonable age?Why are things so different now that the average middle-class family can’t get near affording that without both parents working at least one job? What was so different then?20 years of Democratic Control followed by 8 years under the single most fiscally liberal Republican of the 20th century, followed by 8 more years of Democratic control?I see. Well, what’s happened since then?20 years of Republican control with a 4-year break, during which time the power of Labor Unions were eroded, workers' rights were sacrificed at the corporate altar. Pensions went away, wages stagnated while consumer costs skyrocketed, and the wealth gap between the lower and middle class and the crème de la crème grew to astronomical proportions.Meanwhile, the annual increases in national debt grew from $6 billion to $347 BillionIs the US Budget Deficit Really That Bad?Bill Clinton took office and work began on getting things back on track. By the year chads were hanging in Florida, the national debt increase was down to $18 Billion, within $1B of where it was back in 1970.Naturally, we just couldn’t have “Tax and Spend” liberals out there managing debt and turning in budget surpluses with impunity, so what did we do? We let the tyranny of the minority put a good “fiscally responsible” Republican in office for the next 8 years.And the National Debt increases skyrocketed from something the US could have paid off with Uncle Sam’s pocket change to $1.6 Trillion with a T. Yeah. In 8 years, we multiplied the annual national debt increases by x90. No. That wasn’t the “Tax and Spend Liberals.”(Yes, I included 2009, because that number has the problems caused by the previous administration in it.)So we got a good solid centrist In office for the next 8 years, but of course, he had a “D” next to his weird foreign-sounding name, so he must have been a socialist. And naturally, the national debt went wild, Right? Right? Hello? It did, right?Yeah. Obama saw increases lower than 1990 in 2015, and in his last fiscal year 35% of where it was after the Auto Industry Bailout. (2017 is the last year of his budget.)Of course he left the Economy in tatters, right? I mean Unemployment was terrible until just last week right?What? That can’t be…that would mean that of the 6.3% unemployment has gone down since the height of the housing crisis, Obama was responsible for 5.8%, and Trump has been in office for a .5% decrease, and that we are just seeing a 10-year trend, not some Trump miracle???!!! WHAT???? NO!But the markets suffered….I mean surely the way the markets have behaved during Trump's first 3 years in office is unprecedented, right? I mean It's YUGE!!!! The Dow is up 43.7% After Trump’s first 3 years!What? It was up 50.6% at this point in Obama’s Presidency? Yup.Dow Jones - DJIA - 100 Year Historical ChartBut we had no Growth!!!!Right. None at all. Just terrible. </sarcasm>But…Surely the debt increases have gone down, right???Not so much.Look, I’ve made this point a few different ways. People ask me what made me move from being a staunch Republican in my youth to my much more liberal attitudes now. The answer is in the evidence.As much as Republicans like to brand themselves as “Fiscally Responsible” the evidence shows that Democrats are significantly more fiscally responsible, that the economy does better under Democrats, that Keynesian economic theory works much better for the vast majority of Americans while Chicago School economic theory only benefits large corporations & the financial elite, and no, the promised investments that are supposed to benefit the little guy never happen, no, the economic growth that is supposed to cover the reduced taxes never materializes, and yes, deregulation has the effect it has to. It crashes the markets.What would happen with 20 years of Democratic control? We already know. And it was GREAT. It can be again.Yeah.

Unlike humans, robots will be able to read hundreds of books and articles a day and remember every bit of information.

25,I believe that authentication is playing a very important role today. Now that everyone is working from home there needs to be a better way to identify people. Passwords are not enough. One time passwords that are sent via SMS. This messaging system does not have the security protocols in place to make it secure. We cannot get a fingerprint scanner or a retina scanner in every home.

27,"I really think it will be the ability to manipulate our biome. That is the bacteria in our bodies that make up over 95% of our cells. They may be really small, but they probably are very important for health. When I was growing up all bacteria were bad. Turns out many are good, many are bad. The vast majority are unknown.Probiotics are probably our first toe in the water. Take all the studies you read about probiotics with a HUGE helping of salt both for and against.
