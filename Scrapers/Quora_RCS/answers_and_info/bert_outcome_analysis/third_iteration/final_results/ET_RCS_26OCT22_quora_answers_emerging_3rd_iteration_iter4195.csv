1,"Yes, of course. We have had for quite a while too.Let’s look at causes. A majority of greenhouse gas emissions comes from our sources of energy: fossil fuels. The big three chunks are electrical generation, transportation and industrial primary energy. That’s about two-thirds of the problem.After the past decade, we can unequivocally say that wind, water and solar energy are completely adequate toYes, of course. We have had for quite a while too.Let’s look at causes. A majority of greenhouse gas emissions comes from our sources of energy: fossil fuels. The big three chunks are electrical generation, transportation and industrial primary energy. That’s about two-thirds of the problem.After the past decade, we can unequivocally say that wind, water and solar energy are completely adequate to the task of displacing fossil fuels for all primary energy. We can generate far more electricity using renewable sources than all energy consumed on the planet or projected to be consumed on the planet in a hundred years. We can put that energy into batteries or carry it through wires to power the vast majority of transportation, and we can use it as the primary energy source to create synthetic fuels for the things where we can just use electricity directly. We can displace all primary energy use for industry with electricity too.We have proven, lower-cost or reasonable cost technologies which do all that today. We have biofuels which are certified for jet aircraft, as one example, and biofuels have dropped in terms of carbon-debt for creation by a huge amount in the past decade alone. As we electrify production of biofuels, they’ll drop further.Then we have the question of land use, roughly the other third. We’ve managed to cut down half of all the trees in the world, about three trillion of the six trillion that used to exist. And we’ve applied pretty crappy tillage techniques to our agriculture. Those are fixable problems. If the 100 richest countries committed to tree planting, we could get to a trillion more trees in a few years. We can shift agricultural practices fairly easily; they are just processes. And when we do so, we can ensure that we spread the soil fungus which is the primary pathway to soil carbon capture at the same time in a reasonably priced approach.And then there are things like fixing our refrigeration coolants, and a few other things.But this is all known stuff that’s just work. We don’t have to invent anything to make all of this happen, we just have to do it.That’s actually the problem, because it requires all of the fossil fuel companies in the world and all of the coun...",113 followers,Bruce Lin,6.1K,82,485K,2019,https://www.quora.com/Silicon-Valley-is-about-to-commercialize-revolutionary-technology-that-will-enable-huge-breakthroughs-in-the-battle-against-global-warming-How-will-the-next-batteries-change-the-world
2,"There is only one fact that matters. It doesn't matter what 97% of scientists say, what Al Gore says or what NASA says.It’s a simple equation:1: Energy coming inEarth constantly receives 342 watts/m2 of energy by the sun. That’s the average, on the equator it’s more, on the poles it’s less.2: Energy absorbedOf those 342 watts, a total of 235 watts are absorbed, 67 watts by the atmosphere, 168 by the surface, and 77+30 = 107 watts are reflected back into space.Compared to preindustrial times, Greenhouse gases absorb an additional 2.6 watts/m2. This is calledThere is only one fact that matters.

That’s the average, on the equator it’s more, on the poles it’s less.2: Energy absorbedOf those 342 watts, a total of 235 watts are absorbed, 67 watts by the atmosphere, 168 by the surface, and 77+30 = 107 watts are reflected back into space.Compared to preindustrial times, Greenhouse gases absorb an additional 2.6 watts/m2. This is calledThe present radiative forcings of each greenhouse gas (compared to their greenhouse effects in pre-industrial times) are:3: Energy absorbed through CO2Since CO2 makes up 1.5 watts/m2 out of the total radiative forcings of 2.6 watts/m2. Thus, at present, carbon dioxide is responsible for 55% of the anthropogenic greenhouse effect, methane is responsible for 18%, nitrous oxide, water vapor and halocarbons for 9% each.This is easy to understand.4: The consequencesThis leads to a cascading greenhouse effect that takes decades to centuries to come into full effect:Due to this effect, a 1% increase in energy absorption results inThis is where we are at right now and this cascading effect is not reversible for several hundred years even if we stopped all CO2 emissions now, since it takes 200 years on average for CO2 to be reabsorbed by the surface or by the oceans.With another doubling of CO2, we can look at a total increase of 10% in energy absorption. Here is what happens when the sun delivered 10% more energy in the past. It led to an average temperature increase of 4 degrees Celcius.A temperature increase of 4 degrees would make the home of 90% of the world’s population uninhabitable and destroy 90% of arable land.Potentially moving to newly thawn land on the poles is also not feasible, because it takes5: What it is notOne of the popular arguments is that water vapor is responsible for the greenhouse effect. It is responsible for 60% of the greenhouse effect, but we cannot contribute to it via human emissions, because human water vapor emissionsThe only way we can contribute to it, is through increased CO2, which heats up oceans and increases water vaporization that goes into the atmosphere.Methane is also a strong greenhouse gas, in fact it is 84 times stronger by volume than CO2. However, its concentration is 250 times less than that of CO2 (0.00017% vs 0.04%). That’s why its contribution to climate change is 5 times less than that of CO2 (4% vs. 26%).Secondly, 80% of the Methane disappears from the atmosphere within 25 years on average while it takes 250 years for 80% of the CO2.So, if we reduced Methane emissions drastically, we would already remove most of its greenhouse effect. However, even if we reduced all CO2 emissions drastically right now, we would not see a reduction of the greenhouse effect and experience the entire cascading effect of CO2 for 200 years.That’s why CO2 is such a bigger problem than Methane or any other greenhouse gas.Read more about this here.This chart also shows how much the increase in those greenhouse gases increased their heat trapping.Here, just some more of those arguments that shows just how little effort is put into fact-checking:You’ve seen that people jump on sound bites like “CO2 is a heavy gas that sinks”, “medival warm period”, believe blatantly fake data without any doubt or fact-checking.This is the oldest technique in the book of pseudo-science, overwhelming the reader with 50 arguments, using scientific words and it works, so that they think it’s true and don’t fact check them.SummaryEarth receives 324 watts/m2 of energy from the sun constantly.Of those 324 watts, a total of 235 watts is absorbed, 67 watts by the atmosphere, 168 by the surface, and 107 watts are reflected back into space.Greenhouse gases increase the energy absorption of sunlight by 1.1% directly compared to pre-industrial times and by 3.3% overall due to the cascading effect.This increases total absorbed watts/m2 by 7.2 watts/m2 from 235 watts to 242.3 watts/m2.This effect is not reversible even if we stopped all CO2 emissions now, since it takes CO2 200 years on average to be reabsorbed by land or by the ocean.We can only try to slow down the cascading effect.All in all, the recent climate change is man-made and these numbers prove it without a doubt.",0 followers,Paul Noel,1.9K,14.2K,22M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Silicon-Valley-is-about-to-commercialize-revolutionary-technology-that-will-enable-huge-breakthroughs-in-the-battle-against-global-warming-How-will-the-next-batteries-change-the-world
