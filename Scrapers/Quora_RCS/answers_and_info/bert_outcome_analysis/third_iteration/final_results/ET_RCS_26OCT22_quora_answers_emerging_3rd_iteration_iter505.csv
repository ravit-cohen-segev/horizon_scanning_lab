1,"Q: What technology did we humans make that put us on top of the food chain?A: Farming and domestication.With farming came the ability to change the landscape to suit us and not the other way around. It also made us independent of the wilderness. We could stay in one controlled environment, and not venture out into the wilderness.With domestication, we changed animals to suit us: to give us milk and fur, meat, protection, leather, horns and bone, making it even more unnecessary to venture out into the wilderness.","358,809 followers",Sean Kernan,8.6K,5.6K,726.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-did-we-humans-make-that-put-us-on-top-of-the-food-chain

The Rolls Royce engine is what made the P-51 into the stud plane that made long distance bombing possible, and ended the Luftwaffe's fighter threat permanently.  The wooden Mosquito was arguably the finest medium bomber deployed by any Air Force, and early on the Lancaster was a top notch bomber.  And I haven't even mentioned the Spitfire.Another forgotten fact is that the British did a great deal of the foundation work for the Manhattan Project.  All of this work was eventually passed along to the US under the codenames Tuballoy and Uralloy, and a number of British scientists came to the US to directly support research in the US.Lastly, the British invented the pebble-skipping dambuster bombs.  There impact was not huge, but it did affect Ruhr Valley manufacturing and was one of history's great examples of wartime ingenuity.The US is a close second with the Atomic Bomb, the Proximity Fuse, and Super-heavy bomber (B-29).  The US also developed early computers, improved radar enormously, and designed and built the greatest mass produced ship in history (the Liberty ship).Germany comes in third.  They developed incredible things, including the jet engine (the British also developed this in parallel), guided bombs, ballistic missiles (the vengeance weapons), and some world beating tanks.  They also built the first assault rifle and designed a machine gun (the MG-42) which is basically still in service in the US military (as the M-60).All in all, though, I think the British lead the tech front in WW 2.  Just my opinion though.Postscript : The British also developed the Sherman Firefly, which could outgun any tank in the entire war, King Tigers included.",150 followers,David Jones,3.2K,270,841K,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-did-we-humans-make-that-put-us-on-top-of-the-food-chain

Around 9,600 missiles were launched to London totally. By September 1944, the V-1 threat to England was temporarily halted when the launch sites on the French coast were overrun by the advancing Allied armies. 4,261 V-1s had been destroyed by fighters, anti-aircraft fire and barrage balloons.After the war, the armed forces of France, the Soviet Union and the United States experimented with the V-1.​​The V2 was the worlds first long range guided ballistic missile. This was developed as ""vengeance weapon"" designed to attack allied cities as retaliation for the allied bombing against German cities. The V2 rocket was also the first man-made object to enter the fringes of space. According to a 2011 BBC documentary, the attacks resulted in the deaths of an estimated 9,000 civilians and military personnel, while 12,000 forced laborers and concentration camp prisoners were killed producing the weapons.After the war allied powers, especially the Americans, profited immensely from captured German technology and expertise in the development of rocket vehicles capable of space travel.7.Schwerer Gustav [Great Gustaf]​Gustav was the name of a German 80 cm railway gun. It was developed in the late 1930's for the purpose of destroying main Forts of French. The gun weighed nearly 1,350 tons, and could fire shells weighing seven tonnes to a range of 47 kilometers (29 mi).Height of this gun was 38 feet and 23 feet in width.

Rate of fire of this gun was very slow, one round every 30 to 45 minutes. Usually 14 rounds a day.Gustav was destroyed near the end of the war in 1945 to avoid capture by the Red Army.

Unfortunately for both of them, the Germans attacked their industrial bases fairly quickly and their technological advance really only came into play later in the war after they began to receive aid from the United States.

But this plane couldn’t perform at altitude because of limitations imposed by its originally equipped Allison engines. The British suggested adding the Spitfire’s outstanding Rolls-Royce Merlin engine, which the US manufactured under license, andThe British had a huge head start on code-breaking methodology and technology to defeat the German Enigma machine, but they were having trouble successfully manufacturing the pre-computer “bombes” that were needed to crack late-war German refinements in the coding system—partly a result of adding a fourth rotor to their Enigma encoder (which vastly increase the difficulty of breaking the code circa 1943). The US came up with a better, more reliable bombe that they could could manufacture quickly, and they shared these bombes with the Brits. The combined efforts of the US and Britain with radar and code-breaking helped to win the Battle Atlantic by 1943, and the Western Allies held that edge for the rest of the war, allowing the buildup that led to operation Overlord in June 1944.The British adopted many US lend-lease weapons with great alacrity, including the M4 Sherman tank (named, like the Mustang, by the British) and motorized 105mm artillery, which the Brits called the Priest. The British Firefly, a Sherman mounting a British 17-pounder anti-tank gun, was the best Allied tank killer of the war.Due to doctrinal issues, the British had had significant trouble developing a successful carrier-based fighter plane. The US supplied Wildcat fighters (British Marlet’s) early in the war, and later the high-performance Vaught F4U Corsair, which, for a variety of reasons, the US had trouble figuring out how land safely on a carrier. The Brits, desperate for a high-performance carrier based fighter, worked hard on tactics for landing the Corsair on the flattop, and they also made some simple but effective modifications to the fuselage that improved handling during a carrier landing. The US adopted these tactics and modifications—which made the Corsair into a carrier-based killing machine that was still in use during the Korean War. In this case, the US supplied the potent weapon, and the Brits found a way to use it most effectively.Together, the British and American invented a successful doctrine for amphibious assault. This involved many layers of technology, extensive cooperative planning, and a sharing of different tactics, weapons, and methodologies, including the LST (Landing Ship Tank), which could disgorge large quantities of supplies and motorized weaponry over open beaches. The LST was a mostly-British design built in US factories. Many of these LSTs were built in well inland and floated out to sea on US rivers.US / British cooperation was not always perfect, and contrary examples could be cited. The US might have done better if they had accepted the gun the Brits put into their Sherman Fireflies, for instance. But cooperation succeeded far more often than not, and this was, IMHO, a principal reason the western Allies maintained the technological edge, especially in the later years of the war, when their sharing of technology and tactics was at its peak.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,16.1K,996,155.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-were-the-top-3-countries-in-terms-of-military-technology-during-WW2

Over 90% of German armour in the west was destroyed by the British. Montgomery had to give the US armies an infantry role as they were not equipped to engage massed German SS armour.Montgomery stopped the Germans in every event they attacked him:♦ August 1942 - Alem el Halfa♦ October 1942 - El Alamein♦ March 1943 - Medenine♦ June 1944 - Normandy♦ Sept/Oct 1944 - Holland♦ December 1944 - Battle of the BulgeNot on one occasion were Monty's ground armies (British & US under his command) pushed back into a retreat by the Germans. The Americans under their own command didn't perform all that great east of Aachen, then the Hurtgen Forest defeat with 33,000 casualties and Patton's Lorraine crawl of 10 miles in three months with over 50,000 casualties - a 1985 US Army report on the operation heavily castigated the man. These operations have been erased from mainstream US history, with few American ever hearing of the Hurtgen Forest operation. The US Army were struggling in 1944/45 ""retreating"" in the Ardennes. The Battle of the Bulge took all the US effort, and vital help from Montgomery and the British 21st Army Group, who took command of two US armies, just to get back to the start line. The Germans took 20,000 US POWs in the Battle of The Bulge in Dec 1944. No other allied country had that many prisoners taken in the 1944-45 timeframe, and just under 100,000 casualties in total. The USA retreat at the Bulge, again, the only allied army to be pushed back into a retreat in the 1944-45 timeframe.The US was losing so many men; men allocated for the Far East were being sent to Europe to plug the manpower gap. They sent so many fearing future heavy losses that they outnumbered British forces. The US sent so many men to Europe the British had more ground troops in the Far East than the US, with 2.6 million men rolling into Burma, besides the Eastern and British Pacific fleets.Montgomery was effectively in charge of the Bulge having to take control of the US 1st and 9th armies. Eisenhower for the best part of a month never communicated with Montgomery locking himself away - in Paris well away from the war zone. The US 9th army stayed under Monty's control until the end of the war just about.Normandy was planned and commanded by the British which was a great success coming in ahead of schedule with less casualties than predicted. The German armour in the west was wiped out by primarily British - the US forces were largely impotent against massed panzers, using only one inadequate tank. Monty assessed the US armies (he was in charge of them) and had to give them a supporting infantry role, as they were just not equipped to fight tank v tank battles. On 3 Sept 1944 when Eisenhower took over overall allied command of ground forces everything went at a snail's pace. The fastest advance of any western army in Autumn/early 1945 was the 60 mile thrust by the British XXX Corps to the Rhine at Arnhem.Eisenhower was the least responsible for the Normandy operation, compared to Montgomery and Morgan, yet he gets the big share of the victory, when Montgomery, having control of all armies, Dempsey and Bradley, of their respective armies, are left in the background. In the book Pegasus Bridge US author Ambrose says complete fallacies such as ""Eisenhower chose Normandy as the landing ground"", and that ""Eisenhower knew that the right flank would be unprotected, hence the airborne drops"" and other nonsense. Well he does write friction dressed up as fact. It was British officers Morgan and Cossac, before Eisenhower had even arrived that chose Normandy, and then Monty's revision, which was when Eisenhower was out of country.During the Battle of the Bulge Eisenhower was stuck self imprisoned on his HQ in des-res Versailles in fear of ""German paratroopers wearing US uniforms with the objective to kill allied generals"". He had remained locked up more than 30 days without sending a single message or order to Montgomery, and that is when he thought he was doing ""ground control"" of the campaign, when in effect Montgomery was in control as two US armies had to be put under his control after the German attack, the 1st and 9th armies. The 9th stayed under Monty's control until the end of the war, just about.And yet biased American authors such as Stephen Ambrose said that Eisenhower took control of the Bulge and made the battle ""his"" glossing it as an all American victory. Someone should have told him about the British 21st Army group being involved and that Coningham of the RAF had to take control of US air force units. Ambrose completely falsified history. In fact the only thing Eisenhower did was tell Monty to get control of the out of controlBEF in France in 1940 was only one third of the British Army and 9% of all allied forces. In about a month all units were fully re-equipped with factories turning out the latest armaments 24/7. Right after the retreat at Dunkirk, up until early 1941, the British had:• Destroyed the German surface fleet.• Neutralised most of the French fleet by sinking or starving it of fuel.• Disabled a major part of the Italian fleet and starving it from fuel.• Freely moving around the Mediterranean.• Starving Germany of food and resources with the effective Royal Navy blockade.• Beat the Luftwaffe over Dunkirk.• Beat the Luftwaffe in the misnomer the Battle of Britain as Britain was never threatened.• Pushed the Italians out of East Africa.• Decimated the Italian army in North Africa.• Were about to take all the southern Mediterranean coast.• Germany was being bombed from the air with raids of over 100 bombers - 150 over Nuremberg - using the new navigational device, Gee.• A massive air bombing fleet was being assembled.• The RAF shot down over 700 German fighters over Continental Europe in 1941.• Supplying the USSR with vital lend-lease tanks and planes - 40% of medium and heavy tanks used in the vital Battle of Moscow were British supplied.After the small BEF left France in June 1940, the British went on the rampage. So much so Franco told Hitler the British would win and he would not join in with Germany, fearing British occupation of Spanish territory. The Turkish ambassador stated Britain will win as it has a pool of men in its empire to create an army of 45 million (later an army of 2.6 million moved into Burma).In 1941 the British suppressed an uprising in Iraq, beat the Vichy French in Syria and secured Iran and the oil by invading. The British determined where the battlefields with the Axis were going to be.After France 1940 Germany never had a significant campaign victory over the British Commonwealth ever again in WW2. The Germans FAILED:• To win the Battle of Britain in 1940;• To win the Battle of the Atlantic in 1940/41;• To control the eastern Atlantic ;• To control the Mediterranean in 1940/41;• To control North Africa and the Middle East in 1940/41.The British Commonwealth stopped the Nazis/Axis achieving all this well before the USA joined WW2 or even sent Lend Lease. Even the expensive pyrrhic victory in Crete meant little in the end to the Nazis because the Royal Navy still dominated the eastern Mediterranean with Crete not leading to any campaign winning difference.Sorry to rain on your parade, but the US only had mediocre generals, their record ""proves"" that. If Clark was German he would have been shot for disobeying orders and taking his troops into Rome allowing the Germans to get away. But the US high command did nothing. When the Germans pounded through the Ardennes (a British SHAEF officer personally travelled from London to Bradley to tell him of the German build up, who ignored him) three SHAEF officers (2 British one US) saw how the US 1st and 9th armies' high command were operating after visiting them then recommended that the two armies be put under British control - US general Bedell Smith in a rage fired the two British men on the spot for such a recommendation and then took their advise and reinstated them. After WW2 the US has tried to change history putting them in a brighter light, because contrasted against the British they were shown to be not up to the job.Years ago the myth was that the the US were key in defeating Hitler because Hollywood told us so. The Yanks were hustlers and the British sat around drinking tea - if only. When I started to read WW2 books (TV documentaries were tabloid and not worth watching for deep content but OK for seeing bangs) and quickly concluded that the British were key - overall they fought longer and smarter and destroyed over 90% of German armour in the west.When American ships were being sunk during the so called second ‘Happy Time’, what were the Americans doing? The British were doing the fighting for them. We were told the US supplied the war and without them all would be lost. Even the US high command concluded that the British and Soviets would defeat the Nazis without the USA. About 11% of British needs were supplied by the USA and about 4% of Soviet. What was normal trade pre war to the USA became ‘supplying the British war effort’ after 1939. The UK since the 1800s took its wheat from North America - many farms were British owned. The food the US supplied was enough to feed the small city of Bradford. The millions of US troops in the UK were mainly fed and housed by the British. The cans of bully beef eaten by British soldiers came from British ranches in Argentina. The British sourced food in different continents to counter any likely famine - famine was a problem in the 1800s. In 1944/45 more people were working making planes in Britain (the British made the best planes of WW2) than were in the UK based army. The British army in the Far East accounted for 2.6 million men.",12 followers,Dave Miller,1.6K,160,528.2K,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-were-the-top-3-countries-in-terms-of-military-technology-during-WW2

Despite getting hit by the Great depression. It maintained the world’s largest economy by a big margin.The US has the largest population out of all the western world. The US therefore has plenty of workforce to get from. It is also very rich in natural resources. It is also an agricultural superpower. The economy is also recovering from the Great depression.Also, the Atlantic and the Pacific is protecting all the goodies the US has, so the US is very much safe from attacks.Being the birthplace of the Industrial revolution, Britain has one of the world’s largest economies with a decent per capita. Despite losing ground over the years from the rising nations of the US, Germany and Russia.However when merged with its empire. The modest 30 Billon more than doubles to 72. With the British raj alone adding up to $28 Billion. Along with the access of endless natural resources, land and manpower. The British empire was an economic behemoth. Per capita wise though its quite low.The English channel protects the UK in any war time, which saved it during WW2.The USSR has a very large GDP, population and supply of natural resources. The Soviet union was seeing an average of 5.7% GDP growth even during the Great depression which made its Communistic economy seem superior to some desperate Westerners.The USSR though suffers from a low per capita. It’s economy is not as developed as those on the West. And a lot of people are still working on agriculture.China despite the century of humiliation and losing a lot of economic ground to westerners, still has a lot of money to juggle. It had a high GDP. The highest in East Asia. China is also home to 411 million, giving it an endless supply of manpower.However, it’s biggest weakness is its lacks in industry. China doesn’t really have a advanced economy by this point and has a very low GDP per capita. One of the lowest in the world.These weaknesses meant that they were at a very big disadvantage when japan invaded.Germany, despite losing WW1. Quickly gained ground to become one of the world’s economic superpowers. It had a lot of industry and a population much higher than their rivals (Except for the USSR). Germany’s GDP per capita is also good.However, Germany’s main weakness is it lacked natural resources. Which is one of the reasons that drove it into starting the Second world war.Japan was the only East Asian country to industrialize until then. It has a decent industry, and a large population. Per capita wise, Japan is doing good.Japan’s population though would not be of much use against her main adversary and target at the time, China, Japan’s answer to the endless Chinese manpower was their much more advanced military doctrine and equipment which is funded by their much more advanced economy.Japan’s weakness was it’s lack of resources. Like Germany, which also drove it into starting wars.France was doing OK at the time economically. Not the best but still good. France has a decent industry and has plenty of natural resources from its colonial empire. France also has a good per capita. France was building an advanced economy.However, France is not doing great demographically because of the Napoleonic wars and WW1. It has a much lower population compared to the other Great powers of Europe and its birth rate is one of the lowest in the world. While it had already industrialized. A big part of France’s people are still working in agriculture.France would probably rank above Japan if I include the Colonial empire. Unfortunately I can’t find any data on the GDP of France’s colonies.Italy has a good GDP. However it is doing much worse than France. Italian industry is much weaker and a large part of the population still work in agriculture. Italy’s population is similar to France so it’s population is mediocre. Its per capita is not the best by European standards. They don’t have a lot of natural resources either unless you include the colonies.I can’t really find any strengths Italy has. However on the good side. Italy has seen a bit of industrialization since WW1 and Italy has done pretty well during the great depression.Like France. Italy should have a higher GDP if the colonial empire’s GDP can be included. But I can’t find any info on the entire Italian empire’s GDP unfortunately.Canada was a part of the British empire at the time so I wasn’t sure if I should include this. But i did so here you go.Canada has a good industry, a large amount of natural resources, and a good per capita. It has a advanced economy.However, their weakness is that they lacked manpower. Canada was only home to 11 million at the time.Poland was growing during the interwar period. Poland has a modest population, and a small industry. Per capita wise its quite is I would say quite small by European standards. But its improving. Growing at around 5% a year,Despite this. Poland is still mostly a rural country. 75% of poles work in agriculture. Poland has a modest population but it couldn't really match that of Germany which would invade in 1939.So yeah this is the list. If I would remove Canada, Poland will take 9th place and Argentina would take 10th place.",14 followers,Neil Roy,2.9K,59,496.6K,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-were-the-top-3-countries-in-terms-of-military-technology-during-WW2

This would put you in the top 1000 blockchain developers woldwide.Here is how you can do it. I also put the time behind how long each point will probably takeOnce, you have done that, you are already very far ahead in terms of blockchain development. There are probably less than 1,000 developers that have done the above things and there is currently a lot of demand for blockchain developers.Currently blockchain developers are mostly only needed by people who want to start their own cryptocurrency, which aren’t that many.Once banks, government, large companies will start to adopt blockchain, this need will explode, because blockchain will go into the mainstream.If you want to complete your blockchain knowledge and know everything about blockchain development, you can also do these 2 thingsThen you are among only 200 developers worldwide probably and very in demand.ConclusionSo, these are the steps to become a real blockchain developer. This all only takes 2–3 months in total, so the learning curve is very steep.I believe blockchain developers will be the developers most in demand in 2 years, so it’s definitely a worthwhile investment.The best way to learn this is by joining a blockchain company, so this way you will actually get paid.There are only a few dozen blockchain companies per country right now, but they are looking for good developers all the time.Some good ones areThey all already have several blockchain projects and some also a couple of ICOs under their belt and are looking for good developers.If you found this answer helpful, please give an upvote.","29,209 followers",Mattias Petter Johansson,1.9K,1.1K,16.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-did-we-humans-make-that-put-us-on-top-of-the-food-chain

As the blockchain technology is a vast field, the programming languages vary according to requirements.Here is the complete list of different languages used for blockchain technology.C++One of the best-known programming languages, C++, is an object-oriented language. It basically packs the data in the form of objects and sends it across to the user only to be opened at their end. Since the principle use ofJavaJava is primarily used in website designing as it is easy to connect the link between blocks of information. Creating the relationship between the data and sending it across to the user is quite simple with the use of Java language. One of the reasons why it is coveted amidst the programmers is the fact that it can run on almost any format of computers with a small installation of JRE or the Java runtime environment.PythonOne of the latest languages that have worked up the world of programming languages in its direction is Python. With time, it has become the most preferred language for website development and Blockchain. It is primarily because you can perform many tasks with a single command in this language. It makes the work of building the block with the relevant information and linking them together a much easier one to accomplish. It is so easy to learn and run the programs with the help of Python that even artificial intelligence companies have adopted the use of this program.RubyIf you are looking forward to obtaining a programming language that is up to the mark in every aspect of the word and lets you run the object-oriented programming without any doubts, then you should learn Ruby. It is quite versatile and enables you to use a heady mix of languages to create the required blockchain that cannot be easily hacked by the users. It is widely accepted across the world, and the best part about the software is that if you are a user, you can easily customize it according to your requirements. And, it is available for users all around the globe for free.SoliditySolidity is a contract-based language that is primarily used to enhance the use of EVM machines. One of the reasons why programmers prefer using this language to build the blockchain is the fact that it can catch hold of any iteration at the time of coding. It saves you a lot of time while creating the message to send across to another user. You can easily procure information and tutorials on the language that makes it accessible to the masses. It is one of the best expressions that you can use for smart contracts or blockchain for that matter.Learn Blockchain Technology 2019·What is Blockchain Technology in 2019 | Future of Blockchain Technology·Blockchain Problems in 2019 That Need to be Addressed·Blockchain Technology Applications in 2019·Blockchain Generations Explained in 2019 | Blockchain History·Ethereum dapps List to Consider in 2019·Enjin Wallet Review | Best Cryptocurrency Wallet App in 2019·Best Cryptocurrency Under a Penny to invest in 2018",8 followers,Harish Kedar,623,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-did-we-humans-make-that-put-us-on-top-of-the-food-chain

The problem here is that getting 11 000 horsepower out of a 500 cubic inch/8 liter engine, involves pushing that engine well beyond the limits where it will run for much longer than 4 seconds.Ignoring the reliability/cooling/etc: 11 000 horsepower, in two different “top speed from horsepower” gives between 550 and 650 mph.So, it’s pretty much impossible to figure out how fast it could go more realistically without either losing power or breaking the engine.","91,587 followers",Roland Bartetzko,567,3.4K,314.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-did-we-humans-make-that-put-us-on-top-of-the-food-chain
