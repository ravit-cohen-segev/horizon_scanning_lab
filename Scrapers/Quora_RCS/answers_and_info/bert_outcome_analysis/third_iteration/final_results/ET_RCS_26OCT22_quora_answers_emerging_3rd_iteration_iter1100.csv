I think these areThere will be increases in computational power for various devices but we’re reaching the limit at this point. I think this will spur more interest in different forms of computing and heterogeneous computing technologies (highly specialized chips). The number of IoT connected devices is expected to more than double in the next decade. This could bring about changes in healthcare, agriculture and manufacturing as well as things like home automation.Autonomous vehicles are being commercialized now and while I’m not really confident they’ll be much better by 2031 I imagine they will be more common. In addition several large automobile manufacturers have made more aggressive pledges for manufacturing electric vehicles.I think cryptocurrencies will be adopted by a number of countries and they may seem some legitimate use. Cryptocurrencies like Cardano have applicable uses which could generate innovation in different areas like law I imagine.I believe that the demand for electric vehicles and computer chips will cause a major conflict relating to the supply of various metals.I also think the increased scrutiny over privacy and the power of tech companies may end or cripple several of them (Google and Facebook).","5,084 followers",Bobby Tatro,3.9K,2.2K,45.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-think-that-technology-will-evolve-over-the-next-decade

Politics, as the art of preserving the possibility of choices and debate on those choices, is therefore at the heart of technological dynamics.[3]To begin, we can examine the work of American PhilosopherKeeping the future open by refraining from making irrevocable decisions that one could eventually regret, requires vigilance, reflection, and sagacity at all times. Politics, as the art of preserving the possibility of choices and debate on those choices, is therefore at the heart of technological dynamics.[3]However, in comparing Feenberg to his predecessors from the perspective of incorporating the philosophy of technology. The core foundations of Feenberg's governing principles, are that -- invariably, technology and society influence each other. That said, upon reverse engineering to first principles -- Feenberg separates himself from the “instrumentalists” who view technology merely as instruments which are within human's full control.Consequently, it is considered that Feenberg's most noted contribution to the philosophy of technology is his argument for the democratic transformation of technology -- from his book Transforming Technology:""What human beings are and will become is decided in the shape of our tools no less than in the action of statesmen and political movements. The design of technology is thus an ontological decision fraught with political consequences. The exclusion of the vast majority from participation in this decision is profoundly undemocratic.”This is an excerpt from my one of my previous answers which can be considered as semantically similar:To begin, it can be said that technology is the application of knowledge about how existence works to achieve things we want as intelligent beings. This is a basic understanding that many people do not seem to understand. Intelligence is determined by the genes we inherit and may be reduced by encounters with the environment (disease, toxins, and head trauma). Nothing in the environment will increase your intelligence.Carl Jung said in his book“[4]Now, looking at how life has progressed with the technological development over the past 4+ billion years and there is a clear pattern of that progress becoming faster, and faster, making an exponential pattern of progress. It is not a perfectly smooth path, there are surges, slows, and if you zoom into some sections it might more resemble a roller coaster, but overall the pattern is clear.","11,943 followers",Tikhon Jelvis,742,1.8K,14.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-think-that-technology-will-evolve-over-the-next-decade

Some of them are good but some are shaping us in directions that are increasingly harmful to us and to our society. We are coevolving with our technologies, as we did for hundreds of thousands to even millions of years, ever since we acquired fire, which shaped our digestive system because it provided us with an easier way of extracting nutrients from our food and that in turn provided us with excess energy to feed our growing brain. Or ever since the stone age, which shaped the evolution of the dexterity of our hands for creating and using stone tools or shoulders for throwing weapons made with stone tools when we were hunting.The question was: Has technology already affected human evolution?","105,666 followers",Dave Consiglio,544,6.8K,91.6M,2001,https://www.quora.com/Will-human-evolution-in-the-future-be-more-biological-or-technological
