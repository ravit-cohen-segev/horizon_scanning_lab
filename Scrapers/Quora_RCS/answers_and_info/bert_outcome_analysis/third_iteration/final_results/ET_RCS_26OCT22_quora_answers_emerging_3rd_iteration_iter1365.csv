Such a technology would be“…the first replicator assembles a copy in one thousand seconds, the two replicators then build two more in the next thousand seconds, the four build another four . . in less than two days, they would outweigh the Earth; in another four hours, they would exceed the mass of the Sun and all the planets combined …”Of course, self-replicators require materials, so they aren’t going to spread through space or anything. But they would have an abundance of material on Earth, especially of carbon, which would likely be the building blocks of such an assemblers. If you were carrying a jar of them and tripped and they spilled out, and they had no limit, they would quickly devour the entire earth with no way of stopping them.But here is where things get interesting: These tiny robots would have the ability to construct molecules from atoms, giving them the ability to produce amazing materials like graphene, cubes of apple, and even brain material.With advanced nanotechnology in the form of self-replicators, the entire world would experience a revolution. Think for a second about what wouldn’t change in the face of machines that can produceProduction jobs would cease. The price of every item ever created would be lowered massively. Supercomputers and experiments regarding brain material would become almost commonplace. Terraforming other planets would take years if not months.

Through drying and friction it turns out to dust and through air is going to all surfaces, at first stage the uro-genital organs, causing UTI, and later to all house, causing food contamination.That phenomenon is more intense in hospitals, as the patients are usually debilitated, weak, with mobility restriction etc, particularly if there are hemorrhoids or anus hair and are unable to wipe properly. So the flying fecal dust reaches to all ward surfaces, dispersing its pathogenic microbes and so being the cause, among others, of the known HAI.The flying fecal dust emerges mainly from cloths of patients that can MOVE around, not the ones that are on pampers. Have in mind that in a more than 2 beds hospital wards, moisture and temperature conditions harbor microbes and also microbe density, due to constant feeding from feces residue on patients, is a one more factor that increases microbe chances in developing antibiotic resistance.It is obvious that the known hygiene measures, as is hand washing etc, are not enough, as now a new microbe source, up to now ignored, is added.Up to now NOT A SINGLE scientific study have ever doubted fecal dust’s existence and its role on microbe dispersion, but however no hygiene measures are imposed or advice is given by Health Institutes, particularly to women to prevent UTI, or any guiding to hospital hygiene managers to reduce HAI and the growing danger of microbe resistant to antibiotics.CDC, responding to my relative question about fecal dust’s role in HAI, said they could not give me any answer positive or negative.

When I heard the doctor tell her “six months”, it felt likeI met my wife, Jess, twenty-one years ago when she was nineteen.Our parents owned side-by-side cabins in the northern part of New York and we both happened to be along for the week-long hunting trip our fathers planned that year.Jess' father was a skilled hunter and could hit a headshot from a mile away — same as my dad.Jess and I didn't hunt with them — we hung out by the lake.The moment I saw Jess I fell in love. We've been together ever since.But now, now that she has an expiration date, I just don't know what to do — I'm scared and lost.Monday morning at work I was telling my best friend and supervisor, Timmy, about my wife's condition. Timmy told me that I.T. or Intelligent Terrestrial just came out with their latest models.These models are different than those of yesteryear because they are 52% mechanical and 48% biological.Timmy said all you have to do is mail a sample of DNA to I.T. and upload a digital copy of your consciousness through an app. You can then purchase a custom made clone at an age of your choice. When the clone arrives it will turn on, study it's surroundings and await a consciousness download.“Oh my God Timmy, what's the catch?”“The price, Leon.”When I got home from work, Jess and I plugged in and uploaded a digital copy of our entire conscious catalog to I.T. and then mailed off DNA samples.Jess asked me what age I wanted her to be. It felt awkward to say “twenty”, but I did it — I was honest. I miss her smooth, youthful skin and I want her to be young and healthy — especially if I have to cash my entire 401K in to afford it.We told her parents that we were going to basically bring her back from the dead and her father threatened to shoot any abomination that we brought into this world.One month later, on a day that Jess was particularly ill, the doorbell rang.Jess and I dragged the box through the door and laid it on the living room floor. I gently cut along the lines and when I opened the flaps, there,she,was.The last time my heart fluttered like this was the day I met her.Jess helped me lift I.T. out of the box and sit I.T. up.I.T. was warm and soft. I.T. was mine. I paid for I.T. I own I.T.Machines like this don't have rights — even though they are part biological, the governments recognize them in the same way they would a lawnmower — so, as I said, I.T. is my possession.The science behind uploading a digital consciousness is so cutting edge, that the laws just haven't caught up yet.Jess turned I.T. on and I.T. looked right into my eyes. I was in love — with two women, but, it was the same woman. We hadn't uploaded Jess' consciousness yet, so, I.T. was running on basic programming, but I.T. was gorgeous.Jess asked me what I wanted to do, and for the first time in a very long time — I lied to her.I told her we should go shopping and buy I.T. some clothes.I.T. doesn't seem to have a personality yet.“Hello…. Smile…”Jess picked outfits for both of them and we went for a walk through the park together. It was amazing — I was so happy.We walked down a cozy little trail and found a tuck away to sit and talk.I.T. watched and studied every move Jess and I made. I.T. was learning and adapting.I.T. was becoming aware.At one point Jess and I got distracted and I.T. wandered off. When we found I.T., I.T. was gazing at the sky.I asked I.T. what it was doing. I.T. said, “Where do I come from?”“You come from Heaven. You are my angel.”That answer seemed to work for I.T. We all walked back to the car and headed home.When we got home, Jess immediately started coughing. She fell to the ground and I tried to help her, but I didn't know what to do.Jess passed away right then. It was finally over.I called her family and the police. It took an hour for them to remove the body. I had Jess 2.0 sitting in my back room waiting for them to leave.After the police left, I plugged I.T. into my laptop and downloaded Jess' consciousness.After the download was complete, we walked outside and I looked into her gigantic brown eyes. I asked her, “Is it you, Jess?”She smiled and said, “It is, silly — now kiss me.”Her head slammed back. I didn't know if she was glitching or what and then I heard a bang and saw a hole above her left eye.My beautiful Jessica died twice today. I was crushed.Over the next two decades, I fell into a deep, dark, alcohol-fueled depression. Although I had developed a serious alcohol problem, I was able to work and save every single penny I earned.After twenty years of saving, I decided I wanted both of them back — the twenty-year-old Jess and the forty-year-old Jess.I sent my entire life savings off to I.T. and in one month, my doorbell rang.I cut the box open and wept when I saw my angel(s).I turned them on.I also clothed them. The younger version of me may have left them in the nude, but at this age, I just want my companion(s) back.The ladies helped me back to my room to lay down. I was so tired from all the excitement.I've waited and worked an entire lifetime to be with the woman I love. And now, at long last — she is beside me.I died, on that very night as a happy man.One day later, the doorbell rang. It seems my beautiful Jessicas used my direct deposit life insurance benefit to make a purchase.They gently cut the box open.And turned me on.You ask where technology will be in 2050?We will be everywhere.LeonSpecial thanks:Cameron — Dear friend. Thank you so much for all your help with bringing this idea to life. You are awesome. I'm proud to call you friend.Kinsalynn — My sister and friend.

We were human. We invented and developed the technologies to change our life to its best. Now that technology is changing our lives every second.Robots are our new human model and at the end, only robots control this world. Technology is now trying to go inside our body it’s almost there and the target is human blood and emotions. So, far! Technology is successful in that.In business, the use of Artificial Intelligence, cloud computing, machine learning, predictive analytics, and business intelligence tools, applications now creating new methods to conduct, operate and manage the business.The rise of cloud computing, cloud storage, Artificial intelligence, and Machine learning is the example, that we will be soon on the node that connects our body and capture the data of human activities in real time.Invention and development of Technology have changed our life positively and negatively.

Sleep 8 Hours a NightNo ‘ifs’, ‘and’s’, or ‘buts’, you must get 8 hours of HIGH quality sleep everynight if you want to have the best life possible.Sure, you might sacrifice a few hours of productivity, however, if you look at any credible study, the research clearly shows that (unless you have a rare DEC2 genetic mutation) you need 5 sleep cycles to perform at your best.Sleep cycles occur every 90 minutes and, since it takes the average person 20 minutes to fall asleep, going to bed 8 hours before you need to be awake is ideal for optimal performance.5 Sleep Cycles x 90 Minutes = 7.5 Hours + 20 Minutes to Fall Asleep = 7 Hours 50 Minutes + 10 Minute buffer = 8 hours2. Make Sure You Sleep WELLJust because you are sleeping 8 hours doesn’t mean that you are getting 8 hours of quality sleep.To ensure that you are maximizing your “Z’s” I suggest that you:3. Exercise DailyThis might seem a little cliche, but it’s the single most important habit to ensure a high quality of life.If I don’t exercise daily (typically by lifting weights, doing yoga, or riding my bike), I can tell.I’m tired, ornery, and generally a bastard to be around.You need to get exercise as frequently as possible.Your body evolved to move so MOVE baby MOVE!4. MeditateAgain, this is cliche but it works.Taking 10 minutes every morning to sit in silence and simply reconnect with my breath and body has done miracles for my quality of life.Meditation has been scientifically shown to reduce stress, promote empathy, spark creativity, and improve overall well being tremendously.5. LaughThis is a big one that people often forget about.Laughter truly is the best medicine and starting out your mornings with a short stand-up comedy or a few clips from a funny talk show can put you into a positive mood that will permeate the rest of your day.I recommend that you find 2–3 comedians that you really love and purchase all of their stand-ups.Then, when you are cooking breakfast, play the show in the background and let the laughter roll.Oh, speaking of breakfast6. Eat BreakfastSeriously, I know a lot of you are probably avid practitioners of Intermittent Fasting, and that’s great, but unless you are counting calories and know for a fact that you are still getting enough fuel despite your fasting, you need to eat breakfast.It will charge you up for the rest of the day and prevent early afternoon “Hangriness”.7. Get Out in Nature (Preferably Near a Large Body of Water)Getting out in nature has been shown time and time again to be a HUGE factor in a person’s overall happiness and well being.We’ve evolved over the past 6,000 years to be surrounded by nature, not concrete.Make it a priority to get out in nature for at least 30 minutes a day.You won’t regret it.8. Connect with Someone You Love Every DayThis is a simple habit that will instantly and dramatically improve your quality of life.Humans are inherently social creatures and, despite the massive technological advancements we’ve recently experienced, we are more disconnected and solitary than ever before.Everyday I challenge you to connect with someone you love.Whether you Skype your mom, sit down for coffee with your girlfriend, or go hang out with amigos at the bar, spend at least 10 hours a week really connecting with people that you care about.9. Express GratitudeEvery single day ask yourself the question, “What do I have to be grateful for?”If you answer that question each morning when you wake up and each night before you go to sleep, I promise your life will change forever.10. RelaxDo something fun everyday.Play guitar, play video games, read a good book, walk by the beach.Just do something that will make you happy and help you relax.Your mind, body, and spirit will thank you for it.Stay Grounded,Learn more about my work and mission by visiting my Quora profile","90,985 followers",Divyansh Mundra,2.8K,1.2K,61.8M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Will-we-see-life-changing-technology-in-the-next-decade

So far, these thinking units have all been biological brains, just like for long ages all flying things on this planet were biological entities. In the last few centuries, non-biological flight was achieved through human technology, and soon far surpassed biology.

To fully emulate the function of one neuron you need about the same processing power as one laptop of today. On supercomputer level, we are getting close to the processing power that would be needed to recreate the function of a human brain in real time. Around mid-century, in past trends hold, this kind of processing power should be quite trivial — about as common as a smartphone of today.And there is no reason to stop with emulations of a mere 86 billion neurons. Human brains can only get so big and no bigger, for at the end of the day, a baby’s head must actually be able to pass through a woman’s vagina without both mother and child dying in the process.

Other mental health challenges are also on the rise—Those suffering from Autism Spectral Disorder make up approximately 1 in 132 individuals (and growing)Biomedical Research: Focus on the BrainIn 2011 nearly a quarter of the National Institutes of Health $32B budget went to ‘neurosciences’ related projects.While some areas of basic research have legitimate reasons to complain about stagnating funding, medical research cannot. The NIH currently provides 50% greater funding than it did in the year 2000. Much of this growth has occurred in brain research. That being said, it is also easy to say that it isn’t enough to meet the demand and needs of those afflicted with debilitating disease. When the quality of life of 1 in 5 humans is on the line, mental health issues should continue to take a front and center position among public policy issues. That is all I will say about the politics of biomedical research right now—I promise.Many technologies are developing which, if successful, could have an immediate and massive impact on the treatment of brain disorders. One such device takes advantage of microarrays of stimulating electrodes to mimic the communication that occurs between populations of neurons in the brain. There are several examples of these types of devices already in the marketplace, including: cochlear implants, retinal implants, deep brain stimulation, and a proposed hippocampal prosthesis.There is hardly a science fiction book that hasn’t tried to imagine what part of the human experience couldn’t be improved by having a better understanding of our own brains. While the task of healing a sick brain is daunting due to the sheer complexity and inaccessibility of our brains, the benefits of doing so are incalculable.
