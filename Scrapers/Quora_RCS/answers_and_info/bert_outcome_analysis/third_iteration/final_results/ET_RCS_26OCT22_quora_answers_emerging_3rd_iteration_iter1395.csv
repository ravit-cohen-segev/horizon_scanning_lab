What are its competitive advantages? What future applications do we foresee?While we’re still looking for answers on these questions, one thing we know for sure: Blockchain — this immutable, encrypted, decentralized ledger — has the potential of making every centralized process, activity, and organization fully autonomous. This means we can eliminate intermediaries, authorities, and churn.But what do we have to do actually to build blockchain as a sustainable, mass-adopted technology?On July 2nd we’ve been on stage at IPSX Community Meetup #1 (a full review of the entire event is available here) 120+ people, speakers from 4 countries have attended the event in a beautiful venue, in Bucharest, and we’d like to thank them for the opportunity to share our vision with the Romanian blockchain community.Samuel Kurtmann, the CEO & Founder of Impetus One, spoke about the lifeblood of blockchain: how this technology will evolve in the next 5 years. Here’s how we see it.A throwback history…What’s happening today with cryptocurrency and blockchain is reminiscent of the dot-com boom in the 90s and even a little bit earlier.1903: “The horse is here to stay, but the automobile is only a novelty — a fad.” — The president of the Michigan Savings Bank advising Henry Ford’s lawyer, Horace Rackham, not to invest in the Ford Motor Co. One of the worst predictions in history.1921: “The wireless music box has no imaginable commercial value. Who would pay for a message sent to nobody in particular?” David Sarnoff’s associates in response to his urgings for investment in the radio in the 1920's.1946: “Television won’t be able to hold on to any market it captures after the first six months. People will soon get tired of staring at a plywood box every night.” — Darryl Zanuck, 20th Century Fox.1959: “Before man reaches the moon, your mail will be delivered within hours from New York to Australia by guided missiles. We stand on the threshold of rocket mail.” — Arthur Summerfield, U.S. Postmaster General.1981: “Cellular phones will absolutely not replace local wire systems” Marty Cooper, inventor.1995: “I predict the Internet will soon go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophically collapse.” — Robert Metcalfe, founder of 3Com.In a sense, that’s precisely what’s happening in the blockchain space today. History repeats itself. There’s no doubt about that! With all the talk about blockchain today, one might entirely dismiss it as a fad, but don’t let the hype fool you. Blockchain has legitimate potential to change the world, but it might also fail if it doesn’t manage to be mass adopted. Might remain a tool of the nerds.3 critical steps to foster the development of blockchain technologyLike the early days of the Internet, some of the most significant and most impactful blockchain platforms will one day become mainstream in the everyday society. But it also means many others will fall by the wayside to leave only the most useful and innovative standing. The blockchain is not a miracle for every technological issue and, as history has shown, powerful innovations come with unintended consequences.","5,084 followers",Bobby Tatro,3.9K,2.2K,45.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-see-blockchain-technology-evolving-over-the-next-five-years

It is changing not only the financial and insurance sectors but is now also beginning to influence other industries just as profoundly including healthcare, retail, but also the public sector. And it is expected that in a few years’ time blockchain to have the disruptive standard in modern commerce.

What about general AI in the next 20 years? That would be within 2037. Let’s see, if Trump doesn’t get re-elected then we could have a published theory in 2021. The soonest we could have a working prototype would be 2027. What would the prototype be good for? Not much. You would need another generation (2033) to get down to mainframe level. Still not much help. You could get down to minicomputer/workstation level by 2039. That’s outside of the 20 year timeframe and it would still cost perhaps a million dollars. That isn’t going to replace half the workforce as the ultra-hypers keep claiming. By 2045 you could have something around $40,000. That could be cheap enough to have some effect but what exactly would it do? It is unlikely to be the servant robot that has been depicted since movies likeThe main benefit that I’ve been able to see is that it could get Moore’s law (which has now ground to a halt) through another few generations. It looks like we won’t be able to get below 7nm and it’s even uncertain at this point if production at 7nm will be profitable. So, this research provides a way to get around the chip shrink problem while keeping the cost down. You might get another order of magnitude in logic speed. However, memory is another issue. You could get multiple orders of magnitude improvement. Other possibilities include improvements in programmer productivity by using abstract oriented programming. Other actual improvements are things that the hypers aren’t talking about. This includes increases in economic efficiency, mainly for very large and very small companies. It also improves personal access to information.","68,787 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-see-blockchain-technology-evolving-over-the-next-five-years

My guess is that General AI is at least a century away.That said, our current mindless calculating machines will getThe level of breakthrough required is equivalent to what Issac Newton did for physics in the 1680’s . Physics at that time was a disjointed collection of observations and rules with no systematic foundation or mathematical framework. Newton singlehandedly changed “everything” with the publication of “Principia”. Today AI is very much is the same state as was physics in the early 1600’s. There are tricks that work and a few general rules of thumb and we can do interesting things but there is no foundational framework. We lack a mathematical theory of consciousness. So we wait for another Newton.The field of AI is only 50 or 60 years old. As sciences go it is “brand new” and all the important discoveries are yet to be made. For this reason it is a great field to work in either professionally or even as a hobby. The field is still so young that it is possible to make fundamental discoveries.","20,170 followers",Sriraman Madhavan,4.1K,186,7.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-see-blockchain-technology-evolving-over-the-next-five-years

The Web was its first application, created by Tim Berners-Lee.Web1 was designed as a ""hyperlinked information system.""Sounds familiar?30 years later, three billion users are connected to a much bigger, faster and more ubiquitous Web, powered by monstrous data centres. The clicking around has remained largely the same.In its early days, the Web was a niche tool, used almost exclusively by academics. Mass adoption came five years later with the introduction of browsers like Mosaic and Microsoft Internet Explorer.These were the good old surfing days. You'd dial in. Downloading a picture took years. Altavista was the default search engine. Nobody had thought of web design yet.Web1 was:Web1's decentralised infrastructure symbolised its original ethos.Web2Fast-forward 10 years, the Wild West had grouped around winners like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, pulling in huge numbers of users and talent black-hole style.For the first time, anyone could publish online. As barriers faded, users and usage surged. The Internet had something for everyone.In the backend, three big shifts shaped Web2 as we know it today:The Internet has become centralised.Big Tech is extracting youAs we suddenly gained access to more people, ideas and technologies than our brains knew what to do with, the central platforms blew up like mushroom clouds, consolidating network effects into monopoly power.Networks become exponentially more valuable as they gain more users. You join WhatsApp to talk to your friends. Mom joins WhatsApp to talk to you. Dad joins WhatsApp to talk to mom. Before you know it, the whole world uses WhatsApp. You can't leave.In February 2021, WhatsApp changed its privacy rules in a take-it-or-leave-it announcement: it would harvest more user data for profit. Millions swore they would ditch the app for more private alternatives — including yours truly. Not enough to escape the network's gravitational pull, it turns out. While many chat on Signal and Telegram these days, few managed to get off WhatsApp completely. You still want to talk to Mom and Mom still wants to talk to Dad.In this digital era, customer value is a direct function of network size. Users can't leave. Startups can't compete. Media, developers and creators have no choice but to play ball. The network's pull is too strong.Locked in, we pay the price not in dollars but in personal data and content. To be mined, sold and fed back into secret algorithms that hijack our attention so we'd give more. All under the veil of ""free"" and ""improving user experience.""Your self-expression = their market cap.Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon (GAFA) control our conversations, searches, content, media and data. The open forum has become a walled garden.Why web2 sucksWe need a new Internet because the current one is broken. It's a multivariate problem.The attention economyStarting out, the Web didn't have a way for exchanging value. People weren't keen on pulling out credit cards online. So the default business model became to attract users with free stuff and sell access to their eyeballs: advertising.Attention became the Internet's native currency.Farming attention isn't new. The business of media has always been to keep you watching. To actually inform you might get you to tune out and take action in the physical world. But watching TV we are at least synced within the same self-perpetuating loop of opinions.On Web2, we are each fed a personalised diet of whatever triggers us most. Different opinions have become different facts. And as your alternative reality clashes with mine, Facebook's stock price goes up. The bigger the fire, the higher the profits. Social media brings the world together to tear it apart. Because it's good for business.When clicks equal revenue, there is no incentive to tell the truth. The result is clickbait, misinformation, fake news, ad blockers, and ad blocker-blockers.The Internet isPlatforms own everything you create online.Quite literally: whenever you upload anything to an internet platform, the file is copied onto its servers and ownership is passed to the company. It becomes the raw material algorithms mine to generate the attention advertisers pull out their wallets for. You sow, the platform reaps.There are returns for you too, to be sure. We wouldn't play ball if there weren't. Sharing content online builds reputation, audiences and connections. The kind of social capital that can be monetised in its own right. Artists and creators never had such instant access to so many potential fans.Still, all of it happens not thanks to but by mercy of the platforms. They own both your work and your followers. You'd lose it all if you'd left to try and make it outside the walls. And so you have no choice but to keep turning the wheels of their money making machine.Deplatforming & censorshipWhen Twitter and Facebook banned Donald Trump, he told his supporters to follow him to Parler. Next thing Apple and Google removed Parler's mobile app from their app stores. Whereupon Amazon delivered the final blow by kicking Parler's website from its hosting servers. Trump is digitally homeless.Here's how that works.Close to 90% of the Web is stored with four hosting providers,These companies control the gates to the global marketplace of ideas. You play by their rules or don't play at all.Even if you behave, you can still be guilty of living in the wrong place. Censorship is easy when all it takes is blocking a handful central servers, as governments know all too well. Take China's Great Firewall: as effective at keeping state secrets as at keeping Facebook, Twitter, Google and Wikipedia from its citizens. If (when)Hacker paradiseAn interconnected economy that combines decentralised data creation with centralised storage provides enormous rewards for hackers.Billions of devices uploading their data to a handful of giant data centres is like a central bank with infinite doors to break in. It means I could steal your bank credentials by hacking my neighbour's smart fridge.Today's Web is a chilling case of the maxim that a system can only ever be as secure as its weakest link. The crucial flaw is that the weakest link can't be fixed because new links are added every day. By design, the solution can never match the scale of the problem. And as commerce becomes ever more peer-to-peer and device-to-device, the problem is bound to snowball into systemic bankruptcy.Cybersecurity in its current form is aData breaches are the new standard for privacy. Cyberterrorism the new normal of geopolitics.The trust problemHow did we get here?The pioneers of the Internet never meant for it to be centralised.Trust is the certainty not to be scammed. When you trust someone, you're sure they'll behave along the lines you expect them to.In pre-civilised times this meant that, to stay safe, you only directly interact with friends and family. No trading information and value with strangers. If I don't know you, I don't do business with you. This capped the first hunter-gatherer societies at around 150 people: the maximum number of stable social relationships a human brain can supposedly manage (known asUnits of civilisationWhen the last ice age ended around 11,000 BCE, the nomads settled down in the Agricultural Revolution. Staying put for extended periods of time gave rise to private property and valuable possession (stored agricultural output). This was the cue for trust's alter ego to rear its ugly head. The incentive to steal had never been greater. To moderate the escalating violence between stranger tribes, we came up with third parties all strangers could trust: institutions.Institutions widen the perimeter of trust between strangers by keeping records of what happened. Who owns what, who owes what. Taxes, payments, properties, exchanges. Records affirm truth and truth constructs trust.In this sense, institutions are the basic units of civilisation. Offline economies can't exist without them. As it turns out, neither could the first online economy. The early Web too leaned into the old habit of centralised trust management shortly after its decentralised inception.Gatekeeper v2Unbounded by space and time, today's internet institutions have slashed the latency and cost of economic exchanges - unlocking instant global business.Networked software subverts the bureaucratic, fee-collecting middleman to reward individuals on both sides of supply and demand. Strangers can transact at scale in a peer-to-peer economy. The kicker is that the networks are owned and the house still takes most of the winnings.Institutions keep failing us because they are humanEvery institution that distributes power, money or status eventually falls to bias and corruption. Centralised internet platforms are no exception. It's fundamentally self-interested human behaviour playing out at scale: a feature, not a bug.That is not a fancy way of saying ""f*ck the system"" nor is it blaming bankers and Mark Zuckerberg for all of the world's problems.Blockchain: mathematics > humansThe diagnosis is two-tiered:The word 'trust' in itself suggests the possibility of fraud. They're two sides of the same coin.How can we keep records that are objective and immune to human bias?Minimum viable explanationDifferent blockchains demand different value. It can be security, storage, computation, bandwidth, attention. The wild multitude of possible applications is beyond the introductory scope of this post. And bound only by your imagination.Bitcoin — O.G. blockchainCryptodaddy Bitcoin makes for an intuitive case of how blockchains work. Its ledger keeps track of how much currency each user holds and rewards miners for securing the records.Ethereum — Distributed global supercomputerIf Bitcoin is a spreadsheet, Ethereum is a spreadsheet with macros.‍The idea of a network running applications should sound familiar.It's the original vision for the Web come true. Unhackable, uncensorable. Governed by its users and rewarding the work the network needs with a native currency. A trinity of Internet, free market and democracy.Web3: The Internet Of ValueDon't limit your imagination to decentralised versions of Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.Value exchanges follow a prototypical contractual pattern. There's a performance and a reward. If I do X, you give me Y. Bitcoin provides a simple example of how blockchains automatically verify both performance and reward, fulfilling the contract with 100% guarantee that no party gets duped.Think art, insurance, real estate, intellectual property, credit cards, lawyers. You'll be able to trade it all without middlemen, using dapps built on Ethereum or other smart contract blockchains like Solana instead. Trustless and permissionless. Cheaper and faster.The superior economic efficiency will open up previously impossible business models and possibly reinvent companies altogether.Blockchains allow everyone in the world with a phone and an internet connection to participate directly, immediately and without permission in the global economy.Web3 realmsSmart contracts unlock new modes for trade, work, and play. Here's a taste of where it's going.DeFi (Decentralised Finance)DeFi is crypto’s way of Wall Street.DeFi dapps let you swap, invest, earn, lend, borrow and insure financial assets directly with others users. Bankers are coded out: smart contracts automatically verify both ends of a transaction on the blockchain — slashing costs, overhead and bias. As of October 2021, ~$200bn of total asset value has been locked in DeFi protocols.NFT (Non-Fungible Token)A token is non-fungible when its value is perceived as unique, i.e. when it's not 1:1 interchangeable with another token. It's the perception that matters: dollar bills all have unique serial numbers, but qualify as fungible because the purchasing power of each is the same. It's a different story if you're a collector and care about the serial number.In that sense, NFTs are just tokens with serial numbers that matter. If you issue 1,000 entry tokens for a giveaway, those tokens are non-fungible if a higher number increases chances of winning. They're fungible if the token number doesn't matter.As I write this, NFTs have become hard to ignore. But as people and companies spend millions for Cryptopunks and Bored Apes,First, NFTs are on-chain tokens proving ownership of off-chain assets. They're not the assets themselves. Everyone can right-click + save a Cryptopunk .JPG, but only one wallet can hold its NFT.Second, NFTs are not synonymous with digital artwork or even digital assets.DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation)As noted earlier, organisations can be simplified as synced webs of contracts.A DAO puts this idea on steroids, automating value transfers through smart contracts. Human managers are programmed out by code that is democratically agreed on by token holders. Each member owns a fraction of the DAOs assets and can weigh in on decisions proportional to token holdings — as programmed per smart contract.Integrating economic and social features, the DAO model makes companies more like communities and communities more like companies.‍Social tokensTokens capture the economic value of community membership,This is as true for ETH holders as it can be for any group of people. Brands, artists, creators, influencers can turn communities in economies through tokenisation. I myself could airdrop $GIL tokens to subscribers and mint NFTs of pieces I write. The more readers I get, the higher the economic value. More so if tokens also unlock exclusive content, a Discord group, events and other fun stuff.Play2earnNext, you can gamify the community by rewarding achievements with tokens.If you’ve ever chased Pokémon, World Of Warcraft weapons and FIFA player packs, you understand the value of digital assets. With a blockchain, digital assets become economically scarce. There’ll be only one Pikachu in crypto-Pokemon. And it won't have a central corporate game developer non-stop pulling in cash from players through infinite duplication of game items out of thin air. Instead, scarce assets are earned, owned and traded among game players in what is a proper economy. Yes, your kids will make a living playing video games.The MetaverseHuman-to-human economies, NFTs, tokenised communities and play2earn converge in what's known as the Metaverse: a virtual world for people to work, play and live. Not as distant a future as you might think. Big parts of our lives are already spent online. Further immersion will happen gradually over the next few decades.If the prospect of living in the cloud sends shivers up your spine, mind that in sci-fi virtual worlds feel dystopian mostly because of the central power that designs and controls them. These are web2’s version of the Metaverse, a virtual Facebook.A crypto-Metaverse is open and decentralised, built from the collaborative creativity of all its creators, economically allocated through supply and demand mechanicsInitially published in",75 followers,Alex Jansen,5.3K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-see-blockchain-technology-evolving-over-the-next-five-years
