We donImmortal jellyfish are immortal in a reallyTrying to add this mechanism for biological immortality to humans would be really, really complicated. We don't have separate forms and life stages we can switch between. Human biology would have to be heavily redesigned. Maybe humans would be like werewolves, when you get old or injured or sick you turn into something else, and then later you turn back into an adolescent human? Or maybe we'd just go into immobile cocoon sort of things? Interesting science-fiction ideas, but waaaaay more complicated than just moving some genes into the human genome.The ageless animals most closely related to humans, which would probably be easier to adapt to our biology, are olm (a blind cave-dwelling salamander that retains juvenile biology its entire life) and some species of tortoise and rockfish. These animals accumulate age-related cell damage very slowly, instead of making themselves young again.EDIT, 4/5/2016: removed incorrect photo depictingPhoto by Takashi Murai/The New York Times Syndicate/Redux.","220,624 followers",Franklin Veaux,2K,47.3K,783M,2016,https://www.quora.com/If-we-find-out-why-immortal-jellyfish-live-forever-how-will-we-transfer-the-immortality-over-to-humans-Would-we-need-to-use-a-retrovirus-or-nano-scissors-to-transfer-key-genes-Would-we-need-to-redesign-the-human-body-to-work-like-the-jellyfish
1,"Is there any great mystery about how those jellyfish live forever? It's the same way as bacteria and other single cell organisms do it. Their cells don't contain the mechanisms for senescence. That's an added complication in us organisms with sexual reproduction and death from old age (the two go together). The benefit for us, at cell level, is that immortal cells require more maintenance, so we can do more on less food than if we were immortal.Nor is it true that all human cells are mortal. The germ line cells (ova and sperm) are already immortal in the same way as the bacteria and jellyfish.Is there any great mystery about how those jellyfish live forever?

The germ line cells (ova and sperm) are already immortal in the same way as the bacteria and jellyfish. If they weren't, humanity would die out in one generation.If humans are to become immortal as multi-celled individuals, rather than single-celled gametes, it won't be by the same process as jellyfish. That would require too fundamental a redesign of our body chemistry. Instead, we will have to find ways of delaying or stopping the senescence of our kind of somatic cells (which those jellyfish don't have), while retaining a kind of cell chemistry that is deeply engineered around senescence. It's a much harder proposition, but not necessarily impossible.As to how that ability would be delivered, I don't know. I don't think work is far enough advanced to be able to say yet, but others may know better.",UNKNOWN,Devin O'Keefe,21.8K,0,0,2016,https://www.quora.com/If-we-find-out-why-immortal-jellyfish-live-forever-how-will-we-transfer-the-immortality-over-to-humans-Would-we-need-to-use-a-retrovirus-or-nano-scissors-to-transfer-key-genes-Would-we-need-to-redesign-the-human-body-to-work-like-the-jellyfish

If you brought a baby forward, it would learn like any other baby. If you brought and adult forward, you’d have a lot of teaching/explaining to do.I didn’t grow up in Asia, Russia, or Middle-East, so there is a lot of those culture that I am missing.

3,"Well, there’s that funny word “evolved”.The human brain has a tremendous capacity and plasticity. It could be argued that at the moment the brain evolved this plasticity was the moment humanity started.Evolutionarily speaking, we are the same people we were 3,000 years ago. But the viral disease that goes around and never stops evolving is technological learning. We know what we know now and we play with the toys we play with now because of all the knowledge and technology that came before this moment, back to the beginning of history.There was a documentary series in the 1970s calledWell, there’s that funny word “evolved”.The human brain has a tremendous capacity and plasticity.

4,"It depends on how you define “thinking”.Computers are fundamentally computing machines. They just do basic arithmetic very fast. You can setup this arithmatic toBut there are two caveats.First, this “thinking” is incredibly simplistic at the moment. Do you consider bugs to be “thinking” when they make decisions? If so, then yes, some supercomputers can be at least be intelligent as a bug.

Computer hardware is fundamentally based in simple arithmetic, and this arithmetic is used to represent, or toThere are processors being designed, like Intel’s Loihi processor, which is a neural network on a hardware level without using a simulation. However, a fruit fly has about 250,000 neurons, and a single one of these processors has about 130,000 neurons. So if you consider what these processors are doing to be “thinking”, then their thinking is half that of a fruit fly.Direct neuron-to-neuron comparison is also not a perfect comparison as the implementation of neurons in human-made hardware is not the same as the implementation in organic brains.","220,624 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.2K,47.3K,783M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-we-find-out-why-immortal-jellyfish-live-forever-how-will-we-transfer-the-immortality-over-to-humans-Would-we-need-to-use-a-retrovirus-or-nano-scissors-to-transfer-key-genes-Would-we-need-to-redesign-the-human-body-to-work-like-the-jellyfish
