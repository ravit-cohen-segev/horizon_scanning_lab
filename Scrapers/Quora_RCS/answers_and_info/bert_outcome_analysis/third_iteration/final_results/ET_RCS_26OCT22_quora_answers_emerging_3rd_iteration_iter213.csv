0,we would stagnate and die by our own hand in very short order.the folks that argue against going to space are those that would thrive for a short time. but then those of us who need to go to the places with no foot prints would soon kill them or die trying.our current level of tech that we have on display would spell the end and i don't think it would take a hundred years to see human extinction. this close to having the galaxy in our grasp would kill us all.,691 followers,Neil Bravo,758,196,2.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-if-humans-have-reached-the-peak-of-their-technology
1,"I believe we have a problem with diminishing returns overall, even with technology to an extent. In many cases, each generation is faster, smaller, loaded with more features, like the laptop for example.Consider the stock market. Every time the market doubles in value, it will take that much longer for it to double again. For example, if you invest in Nasdaq today at about 7K, it will take 14K to double your money, then 28K to double your money again.Take the processor of computers, starting at 8-bit, then 16-bit, then 32-bit, then 64-bit, then you hit diminishing returns.

Who wants a 128-bit integer without terabytes of memory? The same applies to a single-core, dual-core, quad-core, six-core, eight-core and sixteen-core parallel processor system. Quantum computers are out now too, but that takes a lot of specialized algorithms, and try getting one on your desk anytime soon.Dark Energy was discovered with a telescope. In the next decade, there are dozens of experiments and missions planed just to see how consistent it is across the universe.All of this is great for jobs, ongoing research, the economy in general, but we have some big challenges to solve this century, especially in the way of energy and environment.It’s not that we won’t eventually get there, but will it be in time?Case in point… Dark Matter is probably going on its 100 year anniversary soon, and to predict when we will have an answer, or more importantly will it even help, is like trying to predict when you will win the lottery!You can roll the dice on this one!","220,567 followers",Franklin Veaux,739,47.3K,782.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-if-humans-have-reached-the-peak-of-their-technology
2,"We haven't though, not even close!Technology is any device which takes advantage of physical laws to do something humans want to do; for example a water wheel takes advantage of water’s fluid properties, gravity and the water cycle to do work, like crushing grain, or more recently turning a generator. Similarly an electric razor uses takes advantage of the properties of acids and bases to store electricity, and EM properties to turn a small motor which is connected to joints which are designed to transfer rotational kinetic energy into vibration energy to shake a specially cut multi-blade backWe haven't though, not even close!Technology is any device which takes advantage of physical laws to do something humans want to do; for example a water wheel takes advantage of water’s fluid properties, gravity and the water cycle to do work, like crushing grain, or more recently turning a generator. Similarly an electric razor uses takes advantage of the properties of acids and bases to store electricity, and EM properties to turn a small motor which is connected to joints which are designed to transfer rotational kinetic energy into vibration energy to shake a specially cut multi-blade back and forth over another to cut hair.Each step of a device takes advantage of some property of matter, usually several different properties at once.If you think about it in this way; you can see that new technology relies on three different things;- new material properties-newly understood physics-human creativityNew material properties sounds like a tough one; after all we’ve discovered all of the elements which are atomically stable, what more is there?After all there are not just countless combinations of atoms, but they take up different arrangements based on their environment.Physics is nowhere near its end- there are a great many things which we don’t understand, or can only partially model. New particles like dark matter, the Higgs boson, and many others are only just starting to be understood.Finally human ingenuity may or may not have a limit, but we’re currently just scratching the surface. There are a great many theoretical machines we haven’t been able to build yet because our tools arn’t precise enough, or our methods aren’t refined enough- like space elevators, or active-support towers (which use particle beams instead of steel to stay standing)We have so much farther we can go.","220,567 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,782.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-if-humans-have-reached-the-peak-of-their-technology
3,In that case we are almost certainly all doomed to extinction in the near future.Our long-term survival depends on developing new technology to dig ourselves out of the environmental holes we have dug for ourselves.,0 followers,Peter,873,43.6K,167.4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-if-humans-have-reached-the-peak-of-their-technology
4,"Thematically, Star Wars is extremely simplistic, with a trite and unoriginal, morally absolute good vs evil plot lacking in satisfying or meaningful resolution and stuffed to the brim with immature, frustratingly stupid/silly characters.Additionally, it is lacking in scientific and literary depth, with an unchallenging setting inspiring only to the lowest common denominator audiences, which happen to be the largest and most profitable.Iain Banks and Isaac Asimov are the flagship examples of sophisticated, complex, and intensely intelligent science fiction.
