Brin and Page are young, smart and ambitious, and they’re the founders, which doesn’t apply to the leadership of Apple and Microsoft. I explain the importance of thisIn Google’s early days, they set out to dominate search without knowing how they’d make money. AdWords wasn’t as obvious then as it is now. But Brin and Page knew all along that if they could dominate search they’d monetise somehow.And that has been how they’ve approached everything they’ve gone into. They don’t care about the money as the money will eventually come when they dominate.Chromebook, Android, Google Docs, YouTube, Gmail, their leadership in self-driving cars are all seeds that Google have planted, that will make them huge returns at some point. They’re patient.I mean, despite going in well after Apple into the smartphone arena, they now run 82% of the world’s smartphones. An absolutely incredible achievement. They knew this was a space they had to dominate at whatever short-term cost. And just imagine how much money they’ll make from this in the coming decades.The fact that Google trades at a broadly similar PE to Microsoft just shows how short-sighted Wall Street can be…",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,8.7K,996,156.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-advise-should-I-give-to-my-tech-eecutives-to-modernise-the-core-systems-and-meet-evolving-technology-and-business-demands

4,"Manage your people well.You can be very successful with a B-grade product & an A+ team.You will likely fail with an A+ product but a B-grade team.Lots of businesses build great products that never take off. It’s the people behind them that really matter.And one last thing: Whatever bothers you about someone when you hire them is going to get 10x worse when they work for you. If they lie at the start, they will lie even more. If they are slow responders at the start, they will only move slower.

8,Until the late 1800’s. The cap on the tip of the Washington Monument is Aluminum and was considered pretty cool at the time. Napoleon dined on Aluminum flatware because it was more valuable than the Gold/Silver flatware he was used to. Then Hall/Perrault went and screwed everything up and made aluminum inexpensive enough that everyone could afford it. Before that it had to be reduced by some process using the Reductive power of Sodium metal to pull off the Oxygen from the Alumina and leave pure metal.,52 followers,Kiran Kumar,1.5K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-advise-should-I-give-to-my-tech-eecutives-to-modernise-the-core-systems-and-meet-evolving-technology-and-business-demands

11,"How do you define precious metal? Isn't the most valuable metal also precious by definition? Assuming that's correct, it's a choice of Berkelium 249 or Californium 249, at $186 million per gram. Since you want something that's not only the most valuable but also something else (you didn't specify what), I'll go with Californium 249, which is also used in neutron radiography to detect defects in things like aircraft and weapon parts, along with other uses like starting nuclear reactors.
