1,"I’m a self-taught web developer and have been doing web development for more years than I care to count.My advice is to start with the very basics—and only the very basics. Don’t run before you learn to walk. Get the fundamentals down and gradually work your way up.In the beginning, you’re going to want to learn HTML 5. Then learn CSS 3 (which will quickly overlap with HTML 5). Focus on these in the very beginning. They are foundational and *everything* else you do in web development will build off this foundation. Udacity has a good free class to get you started:I’m a self-taught web developer and have been doing web development for more years than I care to count.My advice is to start with the very basics—and only the very basics.

Udacity has a good free class to get you started:After you get the basics down, you’ll start branching out. You’ll want to start learning how responsive design works. You don’t have to master it, but understand theOnce you’ve got those things down, you may want to look into a framework like Bootstrap. It’ll make more sense when you get to that point.At some point, you’ll want to learn the basics of Javascript. This is where you’ll start delving into actualOnce you get past the intro tutorials and class projects, I highly recommend working on your own unique projects. Find reasonable web pages you like and learn to duplicate the look of them. Don’t merely copy their code, but try to figure out how they did it. As you come up with your own projects, you’ll learn to startOnce you’ve reached this point in your learning, you’ll want to start asking where you want to go next. If your interest is mostly in the visuals and interfaces a user interacts with, then you’ll focus on frontend web development.If you have a greater interest in the programming that goes on behind the scenes, then you’re going to start digging into backend web development. This is where PHP, Node.js, Django, Rails, .NET, and many other options come in.If you’re like me and you enjoy both front and backend, then you’ll move into fullstack web development—where you’re able to do all of it. The upside of that is that it’s fun and stays interesting. The downside is that you have less time to master any specific area of development.All of this is my opinion, and I’m sure other developers may have suggestions or changes to what I’ve mentioned.",107 followers,Carlos Esteban Lopez Jaramillo,554,128,318.8K,2019,https://www.quora.com/As-a-new-web-application-developer-What-technologies-should-I-use-learn
