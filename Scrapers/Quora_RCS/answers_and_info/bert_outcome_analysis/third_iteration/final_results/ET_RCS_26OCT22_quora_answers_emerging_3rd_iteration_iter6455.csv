Or even the entire world? Vaccination has boosted our immune systems to the point that we do not get measles, smallpox, mumps, or even tetanus.Modern agriculture, food distribution, animal husbandry, etc. have provided proper nutrition so that our physiology is working at near optimum. No scurvy, beri-beri, rickets, or general malnourishment. Of course, the use of lead based paint, faulty water supplies, and the widespread use of leaded gasoline has put lead into our environment so that the neural physiology of a significant number of people have been affected by lead poisoning.Bottom line, human technology has already influenced human physiology. How will that continue in the future? Depends on what technology is adopted and what its intended, and unintended, effects are. No one thought widespread use of asbestos would alter our physiology to produce mesothelioma, but it did. Nor did people think that widespread use of the technology of cigarette manufacture would affect lung physiology like it did.",3 followers,Samuel Bateman,1.1K,102,56.3K,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-will-our-ever-developing-technology-begin-to-evolve-the-physiology-of-humans

What can be done? Somehow, we must block these foreign entities from pushing our evolution buttons by anything other than random chance and chaos. Elsewise, how can we protect our concept of evolution, that great mental crutch that supports us as we limp through this baffling chaos blind to the guides given to us for our well being as part of the creation by God?We should ban the patent office and abolish any laws or education supporting individual initiative to think originally or creatively, and we must make every effort to support this invasion by the alien, abstract organism which is clearly taking us over by making us believe that we have a mind of our own that is able to reject the false concept of relentless evolution that grips us in an inexplicable river of change that we might miss out on. We must join the flow of evolution brought by outside forces, but how? Which is which? What can we do?Obviously, our physiology is the product of evolution already begun by technology, elsewise, from where did these mysterious products come?Oh, so confusing. What to do, what to do, what to do? Do not give up the crutch at any cost, cling to it mindlessly because evolution is forgiving of those gulls who believe in it, but punishes those who understand that we are the product of direct creation by God, knowing that we can rationally look at the evidence and draw our own conclusions, and see beyond the scope of those who want to control us.Exercise self control.

Humans today are taller, stronger, and heavier than back then; mostly because we are better nourished and therefore grow more fully.

10,"So where did your delusion that human evolution stopped when humans started using tools and technology come from? The paleontological evidence shows early stone tools in layers associated with early hominids, a quick Google search will give you loads of detail on this. If we restrict ourselves to Homo Sapiens (modern man), genetic evidence shows adaptations to a high cereal diet and adults drinking milk, a response to the move from hunter/gatherer to agricultural or pastural societies.
