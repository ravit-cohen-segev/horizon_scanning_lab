0,"Ship for ship, sub for sub, the Royal Navy is a near peer equal to the US Navy in terms of both training and technology.Any one on one engagement between individual ships and it's place your bets and take your chances.The problem is size. The USN is many times larger than the RN.Yes, they can sink some of our ships just as we can also sink theirs.But we have more.Hands down the outcome is nearly a forgone conclusion.But such an event would never happen. There are no two allies anywhere in the world that are closer than the American and British.

1,"The Spanish Armarda and French fleets at Trafalgar, though superior in numbers, were beaten by the much better tactics and training of the British Fleets. In a simulated battle between the British and American navies, given similar numbers, the side with the better training and tactics would very likely win. It could be either side. In reality, the very size of the US Navy would likely give it a win, but with a very bloody nose. In the recent Mojave Desert exercises between the US Marines and UK Commandos, plus others, the superior tactics and training of the British-led team won out.

As Stalin, and no doubt others before him, said “Quantity has a quality all it's own”. Where numbers are roughly equal, quality wins, although, as the Armada and Trafalgar show, even superior numbers don't guarantee victory.","1,185 followers",Jules Gillespie,761,4K,10.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-the-US-Navy-and-the-U-K-Navy-had-a-battle-would-the-UK-be-able-to-sink-any-US-ships-at-all-or-is-the-US-too-powerful
2,"Without doubt the shear size of the US Navy would be odds on to win such one sided encounter. However the question was; would the UK be able to sink any US ships at all. I would point out that the UK fleet would have a major advantage on this point. From character of the UK forces this would represent , ( I quote from a previous similar position) , “ A target rich scenario,” Such is the mentality of these heart of oaks. that the damage to US ships would be immense. That is the tradition of The Senior Service.

4,I think the RN would absolutely hold it’s own and would 100% sink some valuable assets. The USN just absolutely dwarfs it and it comparable in training and technology.

6,"ships can be attacked. Ships can be sunk. How much prep time are you giving each side? How much warning?If the US came under direct unprovoked attack from a massive hostile navy, especially one directly connected to a foreign power, discussion of retargeting nuclear missiles would soon be on the table.

But imagine a couple hundred thousand of tanks aiming at you ready to fire, 1 million people shooting guns at you, even though you are a god, you still can’t run away from all this bullets. So imagine the soilders fire 5 bullets per second, Thor will have 4 million bullets coming at him per second!
