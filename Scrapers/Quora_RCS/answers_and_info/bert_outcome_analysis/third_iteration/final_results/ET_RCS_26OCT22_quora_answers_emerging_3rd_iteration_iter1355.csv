The site looks pretty awesome now, but does it really work ?Do those buttons do something or are they just there to make the site look pretty ?Our site currently is like that cute and good looking girlfriend who cannot interact.What I mean by interactivity of a website is that does your website respond when you click a button?Nobody needs a website or a girlfriend that does not interact with you no matter how pretty they are.To add interactivity at the front-end we use a client side programming language like JavaScript.JavaScript:This is where need arises that you learn a programming language.With JavaScript, you can interact with your website by keyboard inputs, mouse movements, clicks etc.Which is what will make your site interactive.As you now have learned JavaScript, you will be able to build simple front-end based applications like a calculator:That’s alright, now we are done with the front end part. Lets get to the back end.Back end(server side):Lets assume you want to build a complex application like a banking system where you wish to record and store thousands of transactions every day.To build a site like that, you can easily use HTML,CSS & JS for the front-end but how exactly will you store the user data?Here is where we need databases to record all those transactions. Its like a central location where all of your site data is stored.The back end is not only responsible for storing the user and transaction data, but it also should be able to serve web pages upon request.For example, when a user wants to have a look at his transaction, he may visit the URL like “http://www.bank.com/mytransactions” when the user does so, the server should be smart enough to return a web page that has transaction details of that specific person.Like the above URL request, thousands of users might be making different kinds of requests to the server and the server is responsible for serving all those respective requests.How do we program the server so that it can handle user requests and serve them ?This is where back-end programming languages like Python, PHP, C#, Ruby, Perl, Java come into play.You may use any one of these languages to program your server to handle and server incoming requests.These languages not only let you to handle request but they also allow you to query the database to get information and also allow you to save information into the database.There is one problem though, programming a server from scratch is a pain in the head!Here is where back-end frameworks come into play.These frameworks allow you to build your web-app much quicker and in a proper manner.Each programming language has associated frameworks.Python has Django, Flask etc.PHP has CodeIgniter, cakePHP, Aura etcC# has .NETRuby has Rails.Java has Spring.These frameworks not only allow you to build database oriented web apps but also handle complex things like authentication.Here are the steps to be a full-stack developer:I’m assuming you know nothing and are starting from scratch.I would highly recommend that you start from the back end first, the front end stuff is relatively easier to learn if you first start with the back end.Step 1:Python, C#, Ruby, Java, PHP are your choices.JavaScript can also be your choice as with Node.js you will still be able to work on the backend.You don’t necessarily need to keep at a single language, instead you can try learning different ones and pick the one which you find suitable.I would personally choose and recommend Python as it is relatively simple to use.I have written a detailed answer about how you can start learning Python which you can readover here:Step 2:Depending on the programming language you learned, you can now pick a back-end framework accordingly.Popular choices are:Django/ Flask for Python.Spring for Java.Node.js/ Express for JavaScript (although node is a run-time and not a framework)..NET for C#.Rails for ruby.Step 3:After learning back-end programming language and a back-end framework, learning HTML & CSS will feel like a child’s play.Although don’t get me wrong, being able to build good looking websites still would need a lot of practice.Step 4:If you chose JavaScript in the 1st step, you can skip this step.Step 5:jQuery is a lightweight JavaScript library. jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.Step 6:My choice of front-end frameworks are React.js & Vue.js.Vue.js is actually a JavaScript framework with various optional tools for building user interfaces.ReactJS on the other hand is an open-source JavaScript library which is used for building user interfaces specifically for single page applications. It’s used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components.Read my other answers:Saurav Sharma's answer to What are the best learning sites for Python?Saurav Sharma's answer to What is it like to earn 50 LPA in India?",UNKNOWN,Saurav Sharma,1.8K,267,12M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-become-a-full-stack-developer-in-next-5%E2%80%9310-years-with-no-experience-in-J2EE-and-experience-in-Frontend-technologies

5,"The next few years look like lots of little incremental improvement and price cuts.

There are no “less than 2 year” devices climbing the slope of enlightenment. Last time we had so few technologies moving through the trough of disillusionment was 2008 (this looks a little more like 2017 than I would like) the only item near the slope of enlightenment is corporate blogging.

6,"It appears to me that advances in technology come in jerks and spurts.

Our society is working very, very hard to adjust to the effects of computers in all their many guises, and computers are being adjusted to serve many more uses and desires than imagined even a few years ago.This will continue until the arrival of the next “black swan.” Someone will stumble upon a new and revolutionary use for magnetic monopoles, stem cells, gravity, probability, or nutrition and the rest of us will be astounded again.
