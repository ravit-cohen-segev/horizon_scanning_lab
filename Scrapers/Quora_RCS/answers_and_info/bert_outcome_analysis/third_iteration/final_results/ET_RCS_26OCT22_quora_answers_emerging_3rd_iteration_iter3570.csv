1,"It wouldn’t. To reduce the warming effect by 1/6 by only changing methane concentration one would need to remove all of the atmospheric methane. That is more than 5 billion tons.The most likely source of the discrepancy is that you didn’t mention the time period of the warming calculation. By convention, global warming potentials are given at 100 years. Methanes atmospheric lifetime is quite short. So if you only care about short term effects then you get to remove less and get the same","2,397 followers",Harold Zwanepol,1.3K,7.5K,9.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-country-has-the-most-advanced-technology-to-prevent-the-greenhouse-gasses-from-the-livestock-such-as-methane

3,"The exact same way. Give the resources to the researchers that need them, and let them get on with it. A huge amount of research was done without a known profitable application. The researchers in that case basically beg for what they need, and organisations, and mostly the government, give it to them. There’s always someone who wants to learn something in a field you’re interested in, it’s just a question of giving them what they need to continue their work.Honestly, capital is more of a limiting factor, because a lot of advancement doesn’t happen because you can’t make it pay for itself in 6The exact same way.

5,"It is known for some time that brain waves does not ""encode thoughts"". They are just external byproduct of brain activity, somewhat like a sound of a car engine. It is possible to determine which parts of the brain are active by looking at brain waves, just like it is possible to determine which parts of engine are moving and with what speed by listening carefully. This analogy goes further: trying to teach somebody by inserting brain patterns into his brain is like trying to upgrade car engine by inducing some sound resonance.

6,"Why do we humans, who have conquered the Earth, created society, and advanced technology, still believe in stupid conspiracy theories that make absolutely no sense?Because most people play no part in that kind of achievement, or can even truly conceive of it and for many, their lives are dominated by ignorance and fear.

7,"First of all, we haven’t conquered anything, the earth will still be here long after we are gone. We have utilized some of the earth and in the process caused great harm because of an idiotic belief that “God” created the earth for us. If we are still so primitive that we believe in an invisible man who sees everything we do it doesn’t surprise me at all. Just look at the most insane conspiracy theory, Q-Anon. The majority of people who believe that nonsense are religious fundamentalists.

The majority of people who believe that nonsense are religious fundamentalists. And fools who already think the earth is flat and that the Illuminati control all the world's governments. You have to remember that about 30% of the population is not educated and not very bright. And because we have platforms on the net that allow any crackpot theory to be aired the result is stupid conspiracy theories believed by stupid people. We have to improve education in this country by teaching more science, history, and especially civics. Certain people in order to maintain political power have been dumbing down America for the last 40 years and it has to stop. And those internet platforms have to be more responsible for, and about what they allow to be posted. If it cannot be proven it should not be allowed or at least labeled as something for which there is no proof. YouTube will kick you off and no longer allow sign-ins if you make a mistake with copyrights but will allow all manner of absurd lies to be posted on their platform.

12,"i agree that there are a lot of conspiracy theories that are stupid and make no sense, but not everything that is called a conspiracy theory falls into that category. There are quite a few conspiracy theories based on solid fact, which point out aspects of official narratives that are impossible.

It was all, like most things, just about money.This makes complete sense to me, because I cannot see how any rational person (who isn't rich enough to not give a shit about society at large) could actually think that Brexit will be good for the UK.But it also ticks all the boxes for a conspiracy theory.",UNKNOWN,Mercedes R.
