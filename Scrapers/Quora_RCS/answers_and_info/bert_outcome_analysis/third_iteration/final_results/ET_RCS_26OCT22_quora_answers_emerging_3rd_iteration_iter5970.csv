Because there are onlyThus, there’s bound to be a lack of demand of jobs.Auto industry is hard. The proof is that there hasn’t been many new entrants into this field since about a century or so. The biggest corporations in this field are also the oldest. Only few like Tesla and Rivian, both which happen to be EV companies are the new entrants. And the corporations that are already operating, focus more on ICE than EV.Had they made separate EV platforms or EV sub-brands like Hyundai’s new Ioniq line to make ground up EVs, there’d be greater demand for jobs — you need so many job profiles — powertrain, battery tech, software, and many which can be overlapped from parent company like ventilation, bodywork, suspension etc.Presently, even Tata and Mahindra’s focus doesn’t seem to be too much on EVs. And I hate this. When foreign brands will come, and bring cheaper/better EVs, these same lazy folks will ask government to strengthen import laws to prevent their own market share from falling. But they’ll not innovate and make a reputation for themselves by making globally competitive models.",0 followers,James Burkill,614,315,1.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-scope-of-a-job-very-less-in-India-for-electric-vehicles-despite-being-an-emerging-technology

But they catch fire far less often per car in service than than what the public considers ordinary.There may be some more things that can be done, and in some cases is being done, but one other thing about them. Unless it is a very high speed crash that causes the eventual fire in the battery pack, and that crash has trapped the more often than not foolish driver that lost control at immense speed, and ran right into a tree (in the two most notorious such fatal accidents I know of) the fire in them starts quite slowly, and the occupants have time to pull over and get out. This also happens with the vast number of ICE vehicle fires.I see one or two of these ICE car fires on the side of the road quite often when I traverse the Los Angeles freeway system, and I do that fairly often. I have yet to see an EV in that situation, but it may yet happen. EVs today are still fairly new to the people who drive them, and a lot of the ICE car fires I see are older cars, often looking poorly maintained. That will become more likely as time goes by as EVs become the “beater” cars that working people can afford to buy, but like that type of ICE vehicle, it is not necessarily the manufacturers responsibility for the maintenance conditions at that stage, or it hasn’t tended for them to be found liable in a court since the days of the Pinto and Chevrolet pick-up trucks with particularly bad locations for their gasoline tanks. By the way, those Chevys as I recall had a roll-over problem as well. Some of the best EVs could not be rolled over at all by the government testing process those older vehicles inspired.But we humans seem able to abuse just about anything manufacturers can make. We accept a daily fatality rate on our highways with no news about most, except very local to the accident. I predict that will become the same for EVs, though at a lower rate as we transition.",3 followers,Steve Baker,513,27.4K,163.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-scope-of-a-job-very-less-in-India-for-electric-vehicles-despite-being-an-emerging-technology

I think that people are somewhat complacent in regard to the economic impact of AI, and will likely be ill-prepared for the changes we have to adapt to in the not-so-distant future.First, let's start with the comparisons to machinery and automation. They did indeed put factory workers out of work. In that respect, I agree AI today is similar in many applications, replacing workers who have less specialized skills, perhaps call center operators, office assistants (in a limited extent), and maybe soon, taxi drivers and truck drivers. But I would argue that AI is fundamentally different from machinery or most of the other analogies commonly made when answering this question, because AI is growing and is unlikely to stop growing. It's growing in breadth (of applications and industries), in geographic and economic scope, and in power (it's capacity to address increasingly complex tasks). A more fitting analogy would be machinery in an automobile plant that not only made the parts one day, but then learned how to assemble them the week after, and then how to design cars a year later.I think that there is little that is out of reach for advanced AI of the future. Let's leave the question of the AI singularity alone for now. Instead, I think that deep learning efforts at Google and elsewhere are making AI systems learn faster and faster, with a growing rate of acceleration. Advanced AI can now address increasingly complex tasks including medical diagnosis, stock market trading, weather prediction and human behavioral modeling. Very soon, it will be able to take the place of certain types of teachers, and find a role in education. It can already deal with complex systems in software and mathematics, and seems to be only limited in applications that require interactions with the physical world (sensors are still imperfect), and with people.So without projecting too far into the future, we can ask the question, what jobs will NOT be killed by AI? Jobs that involve labor are already (or soon to be) replaced. Jobs that require logical reasoning are being replaced, albeit at a slower rate. What are the qualities that humans have that cannot be captured by AI? Perhaps creativity, emotional responses? So perhaps researchers in academia will survive longer than most, and artists (though AI stylistic mimicry is already quite impressive and their results enjoyable), and counselors/psychologists/case workers, and decision makers like CEOs who cannot be predictable or error prone. And hopefully software engineers and algorithm designers who develop AI systems.This leaves a very, very small portion of today's jobs intact. Many say: we just need to train people to fill higher level jobs created by AI, e.g. Programmers, ML researchers. But this is no easy feat. The US educational system is struggling to meet the demands created by advanced technology today. This failure is in part responsible for the economic divide plaguing the country today. The challenge of educating the public for a job market that is both decreasing in scope and increasing in complexity, is nothing we've ever faced before.I am far from original in this opinion. But if I had to guess, I would say that AI will put far more people out of work than we can (re)train in time. That will have significant economic repercussions as corporations seeking to minimize cost will do so at the cost of rising unemployment. There will need to be dramatic changes in social policies in order to avert large scale economic disaster, first dramatic rises in minimum wage, then eventually some type of universal income/welfare. It's the kind of change that requires significant leadership in our government, something that seems woefully absent today.",36 followers,Adam Ambrozy,579,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-scope-of-a-job-very-less-in-India-for-electric-vehicles-despite-being-an-emerging-technology

15,"A question like this is going to get a lot of differentFirst off, C and C++ are largely related. Many say C++ is a superset of C. That’s fine if you want to think about it that way, but if you have C++, there are some things that are clearly better doing the C++ way than the C way. You can still do them the C way, but I would wonder why you’d want to.C# and Java are also closely related, though not nearly as closely as C and C++.

That’s fine if you want to think about it that way, but if you have C++, there are some things that are clearly better doing the C++ way than the C way. You can still do them the C way, but I would wonder why you’d want to.C# and Java are also closely related, though not nearly as closely as C and C++. If C and C++ are father and son, C# and Java are cousins who hate each other. I won’t go into the history of the two languages, but both Java and C# are good OO languages that are easy to understand and work in. I prefer C#, but that’s another opinion. Working with C# is like painting in oils, where using Java is like finger-painting. But you can accomplish great things in both languages, mostly in backend programming these days.Python will let you do a great deal of things with little code. That’s both good and bad. It’s like a race car driver who knows nothing about how an internal combustion engine works. “I just want to get from point A to point B, damnit! I don’t care how the damn car gets me there!”But it’s not the fastest either. So it’s like a race car driver driving a station wagon. ItAnalogies out of the way, to me C++ is the hardest language. At its basic level, it isn’t bad. Classes are easy to write and understand, and execution is fast. But as soon as you start investigating templates and meta-programming, prepare to lose your mind.I have a confession to make: I started my software engineering career in C++. That was in 1993, when C++ was still relatively sane. Yes, there were templates and operator overloading, but if you were smart, you knew when to use them and when to just leave them alone.The STL didn’t exist then, so some data structures were harder to implement. “You want a vector that takes generic data types? Well, son, you’re gonna have to write that yourself.” But it had some great facilities that were a big step up from C.But it had a lot of blemishes as well. I guess the easiest way to describe it is it was a strong, fast teenager who had great potential. As they modified it over the years, they just made it more and more complex, trying to get it to do everything and in every way that every programmer might want to use it.Not a great idea. Even the inventor of C++, Bjarne Stroustrup, says that modern C++ is too complex and over-engineered.It’s like Stroustrup built a yacht and later engineers thought, “Hey, you know, some people might want to drive this on land!” So they added wheels. Then other engineers came along and said, “Hey, you know, someone might want to fly this like a plane!” So they added wings. Another engineer said, “Hey, I think some people will want to fly this like a helicopter!” So they added rotors. So now they have a vehicle which can move in the water, on land and through the airAnd it’s harder to understand as well.I worked again with C++11* recently and I nearly lost my mind. I understood and worked well in C++ through 2007 (with a few short diversions into Java and C#), but C++11 is a totally different beast. That promising teenager grew a third arm, another eye and two more legs… or are those more arms? It’s amazing to behold, but complex to understand.Yeah, C++ takes the cake. If you just use its two arms, two eyes and two legs, you’ll probably be fine. As soon as you start using those extra appendages and limbs, abandon all hope.* That’s the 2011 revision of C++, where using new and delete is discouraged (you use smart pointers for everything instead).

19,"There are two reasons why C is not sufficient in generalThere are two reasons why C is not sufficient in generalNote that C++, Java and especially C# are relatively new languages (compiler support for C++ was limited in the 1990s, and it was not taught well at many universities). So, these languages were not as critical to interviews 15 years ago. However, with every passing year the number of pure-C holdouts decreases :)Large companies (Amazon, Microsoft) may have open projects for people with different language backgrounds, especially at the entry level. Google and Facebook use a number of languages in various projects and don't tie the interview process to particular positions (so, if you know Java, you can then be matched to a project where knowing Java is important). Microsoft, Google and Apple use their own languages (C#, Go, Objective C and Swift) for a good number of projects, so you will have to learn those anyway, and the interview process is flexible. However, if you don't know any object-oriented language, it will be difficult for you to learn a new object-oriented language.You may be able to find teams that cannot compete with the Googles and Facebooks of this world for top talent, and so will not be as demanding.

I called these functions 1 millLet’s write a simple function that adds up all numbers in an array.In C, you get:This is the equivalent in python:It is the same algorithm, yet they have drastically different performance. I called these functions 1 million times for 1K arrays, the python version took 32 seconds with cpython and 1.032 seconds with pypy, the C version took 2.12 seconds without optimization and just 0.03s with -O2 optimization.Why?Let’s consider the C version,The compiler knows thatThe numbers in the array are in memory one after another, going through the array in order means the processor fetches them from memory in chunks. The next value will be loaded in the cache when the processor needs it.Since the compiler knows they are all integers, a good C compiler can use SIMD instructions (MMX, AVX, AltiVec, NEON), and do 4 or 8 additions simultaneously in every single iteration.There will be just a handful of instructions and jump back to the beginning of the loop over and over. This is ideal for the CPU’s branch predictor.Notice -O2 made a huge difference. The compiler can take its time figuring out ways to optimize this code. It does not matter if it takes a few seconds to compile something.Let’s consider python now.dataEach element inSince the interpreter does not know if all elements are integers, and they are not in the actual array, SIMD instructions are not an option, each iteration must add one number at a time.Running under an intepreter (cpython) means that there is a program in native code that reads one python statement at a time, figures out what it means and performs the necessary steps. That is a lot of code that needs to be executed for every single python statement.Interpreters are notorious for being hard for the CPU branch predictor, there will be lots of mispredicts, which means the CPU will stall a lot.Running under a JIT compiler (pypy) is different. There is a program that reads the python code, and produces equivalent native code. Running the function means executing the native code, which is much faster.The native code still needs to find the type of variables as it runs, and it still will not be able to use SIMD. Moreover, the user is waiting for results, the JIT can’t spend much time running some of the more advanced optimizations that a C compiler does.Even though using the JIT is much better, it is still an order of magnitude slower than what a decent C compiler can do.Here are some unscientific performance comparisons between python and C++:As you can see, they are not in the same league when it comes to performance.You can get full details and more examples here:Python 3 vs C++C compilers have a much easier job optimizing code than python JIT compilers and interpreters.",0 followers,Conner Davis,572,1.1K,9.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-approach-the-controversy-of-the-emergence-of-new-technologies-and-the-belief-that-it-improves-education
21,"It’s fairly idiotic.Python could (by some measure or other) become moreThe claim is roughly equivalent to noting that Tesla has been selling a lot more cars recently, and based on that claiming that electric cars are likely to replace boats and airplanes.Yes, until recently electric cars were a tiny niche, and now they’re growing fairly quickly. At some point it’s entirely possible that they’ll outsell boats or aircraft (and eventually the combined total of both).

But, regardless of number sold, an electric car isn’t generally a viable replacement for either a boat or an airplane.Python replacing C for writing things like operating system kernels is about as likely as an airline trying to transport people from the US to Europe by driving across the Atlantic ocean in a Tesla.",517 followers,Mario Klingemann,1.4K,136,908.4K,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-approach-the-controversy-of-the-emergence-of-new-technologies-and-the-belief-that-it-improves-education
