You can Join the Digital currency investment platform focused on growth and empowerment with awesome timing for a world class experience with high Return On Investments (ROI) in 10 days. they are diligent and fast in payment.We laud the government's intent towards creating a CBDC. Several central banks around the world have been working on CBDC, and India can't be sitting on the sidelines while other countries experiment and launch their own digital currency. CBDC will reduce the cost of providing financial services and lead to greater innovations that will empower faster business operations globally.However, the second part, which mentions banning 'private crypto assets' is concerning. It's an incorrect term fuelled with misconceptions about crypto. Bitcoin, Ether, etc. are public crypto assets built on public blockchains and have their own specific use cases.It's also a misconception that CBDCs will render other crypto assets useless. They are digitised rupee, whereas crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum have their own use cases. People use Bitcoin as a store of value, and Ethereum's smart contracts to create decentralised applications (DApps). While CBDC would be helpful, it solves completely different problems compared to what existing crypto assets solve. Every blockchain needs its own native token to operate to maintain the sanctity of the ecosystem.Look at the crypto ecosystem as the internet and each crypto asset as a website. The government having its own website does not mean citizens and businesses cannot create their own websites as well.Crypto is the financial internet of the future, and global decentralised apps would be built on blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Over 1 crore Indians are already saving, earning, and investing in this thriving global crypto economy. Banning it would be like banning the Internet in 1990s which will set India back by years while the rest of the world moves forward.Next Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube will be built on decentralised platforms like Ethereum. To use it, Indians will have to pay in Ether. But more importantly, the next Facebook or WhatsApp could be built by an Indian startup on Ethereum. India's technological talent has the potential to accomplish this. But such a ban could hamper the formation and growth of the next billion-dollar company out of India.We are all well aware of the devastating impact that COVID-19 has had on the Indian economy. Despite this, crypto has been generating jobs across a variety of functions in India and abroad. As of today, over 300 startups are generating tens of thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and taxes. A blanket ban will not only adversely affect investors, but also honest businesses, the employment of thousands of people, and the economy.Before passing any ban in haste, the government should also take a cue from developed countries like the US, UK, Switzerland, Japan, and New Zealand, etc. which are trying to regulate crypto assets. We have examples of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issuing a letter allowing US banks to interact with crypto, CTFC classifying Bitcoin and Ether as commodities, Germany allowing banks to buy/sell crypto, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) talking about regulation of Global Stablecoin (GSC), and many more.Regulatory clarity has also prompted top global fintech giants and institutions like pension funds, unions, and endowments, etc. to hedge their investments with Bitcoin. For instance, Tesla has recently bought $1.5 Billion worth of Bitcoin, Nasdaq-listed MicroStrategy has bought over $425 million worth of Bitcoin, PayPal allows all of its around 350 million users access to buy crypto assets on its platform, MasterCard has announced bringing crypto onto its network, Square has invested $50 million in Bitcoin, and many more. In comparison, India has lesser institutional participation, and regulatory uncertainty is to be blamed for this. A blanket ban will further deprive Indian companies of participating in this technological revolution.Industry participants understand the ground realities of crypto and welcome positive regulations. But a blanket ban is something that will harm the entire country's financial and technology ecosystem.That being said, positive regulations will give crypto adoption a big boost in India, leading to more job creation and increase in the tax revenue for the government. It will also foster innovation and fight crime at the same time. The government should take notice and hold discussions with the crypto industry of India before moving ahead with regulations for this sector.",2 followers,Kelly Pearson,1.7K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/People-claim-cryptocurrency-is-the-future-How-true-is-this

Cryptocurrencies leverage blockchain technology to gain decentralization, transparency, and immutability. The most important feature of a cryptocurrency is that it is not controlled by any central authority: the decentralized nature of the technology behind the blockchain of cryptocurrency control and interference. Cryptocurrency has grabbed the attention of investors around the globe, as well as businesses and consumers. The advantages of cryptocurrency is diverse: They provide security, privacy, efficiency, and wide access, all at the same time. Their unique advantage—their decentralized and autonomous nature—has led to rapid growth in crypto transactions.Blockchain and CryptocurrencyThe transaction is known almost immediately by the whole network. But only after a specific amount of time it gets confirmed. Confirmation is a critical concept in cryptocurrencies. You could say that cryptocurrencies are all about confirmation.As long as a transaction is unconfirmed, it is pending and can be forged. When a transaction is confirmed, it is set in stone. It is no longer forgeable, it can‘t be reversed, it is part of an immutable record of historical transactions: of the so-called blockchain. Only miners can confirm transactions.This is their job in a cryptocurrency-network. They take transactions, stamp them as legit and spread them in the network. After a transaction is confirmed by a miner, every node has to add it to its database. It has become part of the blockchain.Understanding cryptocurrency: Dawn of a new economyMostly due to its revolutionary properties cryptocurrencies have become a success their inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto, didn‘t dare to dream of it. While every other attempt to create a digital cash system didn‘t attract a critical mass of users, Bitcoin had something that provoked enthusiasm and fascination. Sometimes it feels more like religion than technology.Cryptocurrencies to replace fiat currencies?Cryptocurrencies might not be able to completely replace fiat currencies, which are backed by governments and credit and are highly centralized. However, in places where confidence in the government is weak or inflation runs rampant, cryptocurrency usage could rise. It’s no news that cryptocurrency is a big thing in this age and the good thing is that aside buying and holding cryptocurrency for potentialIs cryptocurrency the future?There's much debate about cryptocurrencies’ future. Some argue that because cryptocurrencies' usage is limited to transactions, they're more vulnerable to collapse. Others reason that cryptocurrencies’ advantages far outweigh their shortcomings, and that its underlying technology is robust and has diverse usage.ConclusionThe market of cryptocurrencies is fast and wild. Nearly every day new cryptocurrencies emerge, old die, early adopters get wealthy and investors lose money. Every cryptocurrency comes with a promise, mostly a big story to turn the world around. Few survive the first months, and most are pumped and dumped by speculators and live on as zombie coins until the last bagholder loses hope ever to see a return on his investment.",5 followers,Russell Woodrow,634,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/People-claim-cryptocurrency-is-the-future-How-true-is-this

This caused a global recession, which cost the world tens of trillions of dollars, 30 million people unemployed and doubled the national debt in the United States, not to talk about other countries, esWhat I’m going to write is a story.

This caused a global recession, which cost the world tens of trillions of dollars, 30 million people unemployed and doubled the national debt in the United States, not to talk about other countries, especially in Europe.Was that an accident that could not be controlled? No! It was caused by an industry that was out of control and by people who wanted to get more and more because their millions were not enough. People who supposed to regulate and control the financial stability of the Country.1980–1989It is known as 2008 financial crisis, but when did it start? I believe that the first important mistake was made in 1982, when the Reagan administration deregulated savings-and-loan companies, allowing them to make risky investments with depositors' money.1990–1999The deregulation of the financial system continued with Greenspan, till we arrive at the end of '90s, in which the financial system was consolidated into a few gigantic firms, each of them so large that their failure could threaten the whole system.Citigroup Market Capitalization from 1989 to 2000.JP Morgan Market Capitalization from 1989 to 2000.Imagine a giant like Citigroup taking the money of their clients and investing. Billions of dollars moved around the financial system. And this is just one bank.Was it legal? It wasn't. Citigroup was born by the acquisition of Travellers by Citicorp. This merger violated the Glass-Steagall Act, a law passed after the Great Depression, which prevented banks with consumer deposits from engaging in risky investment-banking activities.In the 1990s, new financial products were created. They are called derivatives. Warren Buffet said that they created weapons of mass destruction.2000–2008Let's talk about the old and the new system to get a mortgage.In the old system, when a homeowner paid his/her mortgage every month, the money went to his/her local lender. Since mortgages took decades to repay, lenders were careful.There are home buyers, who ask for the mortgage. Lenders grant the mortgage, but they ""sell it"" to investment banks. Investment banks combine all the kind of mortgages and loans that they have, such as home mortgages, car loans, student loans and many others, and they create derivatives with them. They create a financial product to invest in.These CDOs are then sold to investors all around the world. So the real transition of money is from the investors to the home buyers.In this system, lenders can grant any kind of mortgage, because they are not getting paid anymore by the home buyers, so they don't care.This was just risky by itself, but it was not enough for bankers. Investment banks paid rating agencies (Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch mainly) to assure that these products got a rating ranging from BBB to AAA, which means that they are safe investments with a practical chance to lose investors' money that is close to 0.Today with BitcoinWhat is happening in these years is that an incredibly high number of new hedge funds are being created every day, with the sole purpose of investing in cryptocurrencies. They create different portfolios with cryptocurrencies in there, allowing people all around the world to invest their money in these new products.This is risky. This is scary.Another trait is very similar to the previous financial crisis: the market is not regulated. In this case, I would say that it is even worse. Exchanges are not regulated either.With all of this and all the other good answers here, you may think that I'm going to write: “But I'm not going to do it. I'm actually going to write: “I write this for one reason. CDOs reached a monstrous volume of money because they were sold as products with an extremely low risk and high profits.""The bigger they are, the harder they fall""It can be said that there is a bubble, it can be said that this will end sooner or later, but it is hard to imagine that this will ever lead to a financial crisis of the same proportion of the one that we had in 2008.Also, the CFM (Centre For Macroeconomics) conducted a survey, asking the following question:“Do you agree that cryptocurrencies are currently a threat to the stability of the financial system, or can be expected to become a threat in the next couple of years?”I'm reporting the results weighted by experts' self-assessed confidence levels:The majority of leading European economists do not believe that cryptocurrencies are a threat to the stability of the financial system, either now or in the next couple of years, according to the latest Centre for Macroeconomics and CEPR survey.In writing this, I was inspired by the film “Inside Job”, Michael Lewis’ book “The Big Short” and by tens of books about Bitcoin and the blockchain technology.Federico SellittiWebsiteFacebookTwitter",0 followers,Glen Boston,2.2K,71,1.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/People-claim-cryptocurrency-is-the-future-How-true-is-this

Ten years later, a single Bitcoin is worth four figures, and it appears to have found some stability in tandem with its growing maturity. The same can’t be said for the sector which now includes thousands of coins and tokens, each of which exhibits varying degrees of success.Moreover, for all their promise, cryptocurrencies still can't seem to break into the mainstream. There are still very few merchants that accept crypto payments, and most financial services continue to be settled in fiat currencies. Critics say crypto may have been a flash in the pan. For supporters, though, the signs are clear that even with the current culling of the crypto ranks, the sector will emerge stronger.The real question is, which group is right?Key TakeawaysWhat the Skeptics SayThe number of cryptocurrencies on the market lies somewhere above 2,000.The trouble starts with Bitcoin itself, as the cryptocurrency faced substantial difficulty in 2018. After reaching stratospheric heights with a near-$20,000 valuation in December 2017, Bitcoin prices came crashing down in January, and have struggled to reach its previous highs. Additionally, the value of crypto transactions carried out, which was astronomical in the first quarter of 2018, collapsed by nearly 75% during the second quarter.Bitcoin transactions have steadily risen since they crashed, reaching 365,972 as of April 15, 2019.The lack of acceptance, especially in the investment arena can partially be attributed to the U.S. SEC’s denial of more than a dozen applications to list Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). More importantly, the leeway and freedom cryptocurrencies enjoyed as unregulated commodities is rapidly coming to an end. There's been a drastic upswing in regulatory efforts, with countries across the globe taking a more serious and deliberate stance. This, many skeptics say, could be yet another nail in the coffin, stifling growth and limiting the sector’s true potential as a disintermediating force.Argument for CryptocurrenciesWhile it is true that Bitcoin prices—and by extension most other cryptocurrencies’—crashed in early 2018, the volatility that once defined the market appears to be gradually fading. While this is bad news for speculators, it is excellent news for institutional investors—who many believe are the key to unlocking crypto’s future.Cryptocurrencies, and blockchain in general, are starting to garner more mainstream adoption. While merchants remain wary of digital currencies, banks, major tech firms, and other corporations have already started employing them.“Cryptocurrency is nowhere near dead,"" according to Ceek VR CEO and founder Mary Spio. ""It’s just scratching the tip of the iceberg toward mainstream adoption, when companies offer purposeful real life value and integration of cryptocurrencies, we will begin to see the next wave and resurgence of cryptocurrency. It’s all about creating more natural demand and less speculation and hype.” Indeed, it seems many of the cryptocurrencies that have faded were those based on hype and little else.Satoshi Nakamoto is the name used by the unknown creator of Bitcoin.“Even though 2018 has seen a downturn in the market following the bull run in 2017, we are convinced that the future holds a rebound, driven by institutional capital flowing into crypto assets. Within crypto assets, the wealth distribution will shift away from utility tokens towards Bitcoin and likely security tokens,” said Agada Nameri from iCapital an iAngels subsidiary dedicated to blockchain opportunities.While many have shot down the idea that bitcoin and the crypto market are mainstream, the sector is determined to prove them wrong. While cryptocurrencies may still not be a standard for payments and value exchanges, the technology that underlies them—blockchain—is quickly becoming a standard in different sectors and industries. Perhaps more crucially, the services these tools provide are all based on, and powered by, cryptocurrencies and tokens. As companies continue to fix pain points and uncover new frictionless solutions to old problems with blockchain, crypto will flex its muscles even further.After much investigations and research i have made about how to earn more profit on cryptocurrency legitimately, I will recommend CryptoExchangeFX Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www.cryptoexchangefx,com) as it is relatively on for a while now (launched at mid-summer 2017) but has become the largest Cryptocurrency Investment Platform right now (total volume over 120 million dollars) where you get 20% profit of your invested cryptocurrency after every 10 days.
