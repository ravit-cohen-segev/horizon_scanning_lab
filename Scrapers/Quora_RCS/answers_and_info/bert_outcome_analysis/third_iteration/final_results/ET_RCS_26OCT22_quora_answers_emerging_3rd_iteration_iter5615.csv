Where would you mount the thing? If you took a perfectly intact and undamaged aircraft (passenger jet sized) and attempted to suspend it by a rope from even the strongest point on the airframe, would something break? Would the cabin open up? Big airplanes (actually all airplanes) are designed to handle air loads (lots of force distributed across lots of area). The parachute deployment or suspension by rope wouldn't exactly be distributed across, for example, the surface area of the wings.Then there is the notion of where you are going to land. From, say 5 or 6 miles up above the ground, and considering the very high winds-aloft speed where would a great big parachuting crippled Airbus drift to on the way down? Into a mountain peak? Into the sea? Once deployed, the parachute eliminates all pilot control.Personally, I think I would rather trust the skill, training, and decision-making ability of the pilots up front to choose the best place to get a crippled aircraft down to the surface.",0 followers,Richard Binder,23.1K,1.7K,4M,2014,https://www.quora.com/How-does-technology-emerge-socially

However, it prompted me to see if I could figure out just how large a parachute -- or collection of parachutes -- might actually be required to bring off a save of this type.TheI remembered this question being asked before, so I merged it with the earlier version.  However, it prompted me to see if I could figure out just how large a parachute -- or collection of parachutes -- might actually be required to bring off a save of this type.TheBoth of these systems lower the aircraft suspended underneath them at more than 20 feet per second; this translates to a descent rate of more than 1,300 feet per minute, which is a pretty hard jolt but easily survivable, especially when an aircraft seat is doing some of the shock-absorbing.  (As one astute commenter noted below, it also could be pretty uncomfortable for the occupants if the jet is hanging nose-down instead of more or less level.)The biggest MILSPEC parachute is the G-11, which has a 100 foot diameter (which translates into about 31,000 square feet of area), and is rated to bring down about a 5,000 pound load by itself.  When rigged in a cluster of 8 G-11s, the combined suspension weight that can be handled is about 42,000 pounds, under about 250,000 square feet of canopy.  That's maybe a quarter of the weight of an aircraft in the Boeing 737/Airbus A320 weight class at takeoff, and maybe a tenth of the weight of a Boeing 767.Assuming some kind of system could be set up to deploy 32 G-11 parachutes (weighing a minimum of 8,000 pounds of their own, which would cut into the useful load each airplane could carry), if they all fired off and opened successfully, you'd wind up hanging a modest-sized single-aisle airliner under about just shy of 1 million square feet of parachute canopies.How much parachute material is that, really?  The Superdome in New Orleans is 680 feet in diameter; covering it would require about 1.5 million square feet of material.  That's aSo, taking into consideration the added complexity of design, installing and maintaining an emergency parachute system for a typical passenger jet, the amount of revenue lost by carrying at least 40-45 fewer passengers to compensate for installing such a heavy system, and the extremely unlikelihood such a recovery ever would be required, I can't see trying to scale up a parachute recovery capability for airliner use.(And yeah, I need a life, I guess.)","5,668 followers",Gaku Sato,5.9K,5.3K,10.7M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-airplanes-have-giant-parachutes-attached-to-them-to-save-the-plane-and-its-passengers-in-times-of-emergency-Would-it-not-be-feasible-to-have-this-sort-of-parachute-If-not-why
7,"Impractical. To begin with, to slow an airliner down, especially as big as they are today, it would have to be extraordinarily huge just to work. To carry them would just add extra weight and more maintenance. In the 1950’s, B-47’s did have “approach chutes” which they deployed on final approach. This was because of slow “spool-up” (acceleration) of the engines of that day. The B-47 would deploy its approach chutes to slow it down, while leaving the engines at fairly high power.

The B-47 would deploy its approach chutes to slow it down, while leaving the engines at fairly high power. If an emergency go-around was required, the chutes were jettisoned—and the engines firewalled, if not, they were kept, and at this point I’m not sure, but I believe that additional chutes could be deployed upon successful landing to further decrease roll out. Another problem is that any sort of drag chute has an upper limit airspeed at which it can be deployed. Above a certain speed, the chute will simply fail and become a streamer of flapping cloth. Many fighters designed in the 50’s and 60’s had drag chutes, normally installed in the tail of the plane. Although they could be used to decrease landing roll, and help stabilize the fighter when landing on icy runways, the biggest thing that the drag chute did was aid in spin recovery. Deploying the chute would usually stop the plane from spinning—usually. The F-101 Voodoo had some very violent departure and spin characteristics that could shred the chute. While it might seem like a good idea for passenger jets, it’s just not practical. It would also change the flight control characteristics of the plane in such a way that the pilots would not be used to.",78 followers,Chris Drouganis,5.5K,118,623K,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-airplanes-have-giant-parachutes-attached-to-them-to-save-the-plane-and-its-passengers-in-times-of-emergency-Would-it-not-be-feasible-to-have-this-sort-of-parachute-If-not-why

22,"The term technology is everywhere, in every field. Assuming that you have asked in the Computer Science genre, let me answer your question based on the computer technologies.If I want to know something about the present, I should know something about the past. So, to this question, I could explain using a timeline through which you could map the emerging technologies over the years. I don’t want to dig much deeper into the history since that would be irrelevant to the question.–1980: The period before 1980 was completely dedicated to the development of modern computers.

Assuming that you have asked in the Computer Science genre, let me answer your question based on the computer technologies.If I want to know something about the present, I should know something about the past. So, to this question, I could explain using a timeline through which you could map the emerging technologies over the years. I don’t want to dig much deeper into the history since that would be irrelevant to the question.–1980: The period before 1980 was completely dedicated to the development of modern computers. Starting from Vacuum tubes, Digital Electronic Circuits Turing machines, Transistors, Integrated Circuits, modern computers became dominant.1980–2000: People had enough computation machines. They wanted to share that information generated by their computing machines to others. From rockets to news, to security, to everything, everyone wanted to share the information. Boom! The Internet! The new technology became dominant. The Internet Era!2000–2015: Yeah! People share the information. But what did they want to do with that information? There came the technologies for storing lots of data, analyzing those data, concluding what the data says. Yeah! There began the technologies Data Science, Big Data, Cloud Computing. They became dominant and started a new aspect of computing.2015-: So we have the power to store, analyze, conclude about lots of data. What’s next? Educate the computers what to do with that data! Educate the computers what to do when! Educate the computers to make its own decision! Educate the computers to learn by itself. Educate the computers to understand the humans better! Yeah! So began the era of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence.Future: We made the computers to be human assisting. Why not the computers be like humans? You got what I’m saying? Robots!Since these are mainstream technologies that are and will be dominant, they can’t be independently dominant. The other technologies which also contribute in the emerging technologies are Quantum Computing, Cybersecurity, nanotechnology, eye-controlled technologies, 3D printing, Genetic Computing, IoT, etc.So we got some list of technologies! How will it shape our future?* Self-driving cars* Intelligent Wearable devices* Robotic Workforce* Smart Machines* Multi-planetary Civilization.These are some of the results that will be contributed by computer technologies. Hope this answer satisfies your question.PS: The timeline says about the years during which the technologies started and exploded. It no way means that they are not in usage after that period.Cheers!",21 followers,William Chen,998,930,28.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-airplanes-have-giant-parachutes-attached-to-them-to-save-the-plane-and-its-passengers-in-times-of-emergency-Would-it-not-be-feasible-to-have-this-sort-of-parachute-If-not-why
