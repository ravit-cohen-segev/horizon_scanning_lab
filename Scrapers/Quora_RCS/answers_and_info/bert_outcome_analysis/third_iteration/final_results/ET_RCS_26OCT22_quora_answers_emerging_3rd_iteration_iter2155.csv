I don't have luxury of over specialization as we are developing new code and logical structures and I gave up my weeknight entertainment for the lab and learning.As to what do we learn? I'd say 60 percent new technologies, generally cloud based material. Thirty percent “old” stuff that needs to be brushed up but helpful. Deep dives into packet dissection, new protocols, advances in statistics every two years, etc. Whatever I feel the need and interested. The last ten percent entails keeping up on industry trends, gossip and vulnerabilities of all stripes. Now plan to keep up for several decades not a couple of years and you'll see the difference in career tracks and longevity in the field.I love alpha geeks or get out.","112,824 followers",Samantha Kannan,1.6K,3.2K,151.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-much-time-do-hackers-and-cyber-security-experts-spend-per-unit-time-to-keep-up-with-the-world-of-technology-learning-the-new-upcoming-stuff-and-what-exactly-are-they-learning-about

Here are some current trends I'm observing:* Oversized is still in - oversized has been all the rage these past two seasons. There's basically no indication of this dying down anytime soon (and I suspect that we haven't even seen the peak of this trend yet). One interesting thing worth noting is that this trend hasn't made its way to the mainstream yet, which I imagine is a large reason for why this trend is still in* Texture is a big point of focus - texture is becoming a really critical part of outfits these next few seasons. Brands are experimenting really heavily with materials like silk, denim, wool, and ""feel"" heavy fabrics. An extension of this is that industrial fabrics and materials are really in right now.* Clashing pieces - to finish out this theme, clashing patterns and pieces are also a big point of focus right now. This comes in the form of pieces being put together that wouldn't normally go together but also in singular pieces being altered to contain multiple clashing patterns or textures* Sportswear - athleisure and sportswear are a staple right now of any major label. It does't seem like sportswear is ending soon (though pieces like sweatshirts and sweatpants are out). Tracksuits are in.","246,825 followers",Dushka Zapata,957,8.5K,232.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-upcoming-gadgets-and-technologies-in-2018-and-also-bad-things-to-avoid-in-2018

Cant explain within quora. I have added a detailedControl of the car via appA growing number of new models have the implementation of an application that allows you to open the locks, touch the horn, turn on the lights and even start the car remotely, without being near the vehicle.This functionality promises great comfort and a certain freedom: imagine lending your vehicle to a friend without having to worry about leaving your keys, or leaving your keys at home when you take a long vacation and start your car in the airport garage with your phone.Among the brands that offer these applications (such as Ford and Chevrolet) this functionality is usually included at no charge or possibly with a small subscription fee.Semi-autonomous drivingAfter several years of research and development, autonomous driving technology is having a real impact on the industry.Tesla has attracted great attention in this area, but other manufacturers such as Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Cadillac, Nissan and Volvo have similar systems.It is expected that in the coming years, more brands will join the list with technologies of this type.And even for enthusiasts who enjoy taking control of the car at all times, it is obvious to recognize that autonomous technology has the potential to transform the less pleasant aspects of the driving experience.like in a city with a very dense traffic or on a congested road when everyone goes on vacation.Anti collision systemThe evidence that the adoption of driver assistance technologies is increasing is evident in the wide variety of active driving systems that are coming to market, particularly those that can maneuver to avoid an accident.Volvo and Lexus have recently launched active driving systems that not only keep the vehicle in its lane, but also maneuver to avoid possible collisions.Automatic braking systems are already impressive technological feats, but driving systems that avoid collisions go further, by actually taking control of the steering wheel to reduce the risk of an accident.Cameras and rearview mirrorsThe benefits of assist cameras for reverse maneuvers are obvious and are no longer new, but now rear-view mirrors and rear-view cameras are used for more functions than we expect.The most recent Honda Odyssey minivan, for example, has a function called ""CabinWatch"" that uses a camera to see passengers in the second and third row.This function will be very useful to reduce distractions when driving, for example, by not having to look back to control unruly children, or eliminating blind spots, as in several Cadillac models, which converts the rearview mirror into a 180 degree monitor. degrees to have a total view of what happens behind, even when driving.360 degree camerasThe 360 ​​vision assistance camera system is just one of the many advances in technology that facilitate daily management.This safety technology included as part of the standard equipment in the Volvo 90 series - Volvo S90 and the Volvo V90 trolley, is part of the wide range of systems such as the Pilot Assist, which practically allows to experience autonomous driving in certain circumstances, such as in traffic of road.In this case, the assistance camera system for parking maneuvers that has 360 vision is projected on the 12.3-inch screen with a ""bird's eye"" image thanks to the graphics integrated in the software.","75,361 followers",Charissa Enget,3.1K,874,75.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-upcoming-gadgets-and-technologies-in-2018-and-also-bad-things-to-avoid-in-2018
