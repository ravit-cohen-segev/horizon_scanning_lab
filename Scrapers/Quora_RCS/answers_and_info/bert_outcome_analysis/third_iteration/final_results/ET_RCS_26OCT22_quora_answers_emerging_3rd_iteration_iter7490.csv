There are many people on Quora as well as in general who keep on asking about what will happen when all the Bitcoins are mined. Let me get to this straight.

Let me get to this straight. Well it is a very well thought and smart algorithm that generates new Bitcoins. Bitcoins are based on the blockchain technology. What really is Blockchain? Blockchain is a chain of blocks. Now what is a block? A block is a random block in space that contains your Bitcoins. Now this block cannot be opened arbitrarily or randomly. To open this Block and get hold of the Bitcoins inside you have to open it with a key. Now this key is some number which you cannot predict. You can open it only by hit and trial method. The one who opens it,owns the Bitcoins contained inside the block. I'll not discuss the details involved with the miners(the one who opens the block) here. If you wish to know about it then you can comment below or message me. Now coming back to our blocks. Initially when the Bitcoin was found one Block used to contain 50 Bitcoins which after a period of 4 years was halfed to 25 Bitcoins which again after a period of 4 years was halfed to 12.5 Bitcoins per block. These Bitcoins are called rewards to the miners. Now this rewards keeps on dividing by a factor of 2 every 4 years. Now there is a fixed period of time in which a block opens. A new Block is opened in every 10 minutes on an average. Doing the maths we can calculate1 block in 10 mins6 in an hour144 blocks in a day144*365= 52,560 in an year52560*4= 2,10,240 in a cycle of 4 yearsNow coming back to our rewardIt'sAdding these we get50+25+12.5+6.25+3.125+………. = (50)/(1–0.5)= 50/0.5= 50*2=We can see that when we find total no. of Bitcoins that will be mined in this process will be2,10,240*100= 2,10,24,000This is roughly equal to 21 million which is the said total possible no. of Bitcoins.Now we can see thatAnd thus the Bitcoin Miners will always be called Miners.I hope I made all the points clear still if there is any doubt you can ask in comments or even message me.

In order for an individual to join the mining environment, they need to figure out if it is worth it by calculating a bunch of different factors.

With all the large data facilities and pools these days people often wonder what it takes to get involved with mining.A Few Calculations Before You Start MiningMany people are interested in mining bitcoins from home, but these days it’s become increasingly harder for home based users to make a profit. In order for an individual to join the mining environment, they need to figure out if it is worth it by calculating a bunch of different factors. Then they must either build a machine capable of mining or purchase a pre-built mining rig to join this aggressively competitive sector.The first thing people need to do is check a few statistics. This includes the mining hardware’s hashrate execution, the Bitcoin network’s current difficulty, and the electrical costs associated with a mining device. These steps are needed to assess the performance of a custom built or purchased a mining computer. Building custom mining rigs are slowly becoming a dying art as pre-assembled mining computers with Application-Specific Integrated Circuitry (ASIC) have become a dominant force within the industry. Getting into the bitcoin mining game isn’t easy, and it can be difficult meeting the original investment. For some machines, it could take a year or longer to get an ROI with today’s difficulty. Moreover, machines have to be maintained and being technically savvy can help a great deal as there are a lot more variables to deal with when beginning to mine bitcoins. A lot of people say that individual mining isn’t worth it these days so many people join pool mining or cloud mining to better their chances at reward. Personally, i am involved in clHashrateA pre-built mining device from a well-known manufacturer will give you the details of the machines hashrate execution or the speed at which the device can perform mining calculations. Device performance is typically measured in terahashes for every calculation solved per second. Mining difficulty changes every 2016 blocks and the current network difficulty is over 460,769,358,091 at the time of writing.ElectricityMining also includes the cost of electrical consumption. Unless someone is stealing or getting free electricity, the cost to power a mining rig always comes into play. Large mining facilities have found ways to offset electrical costs by utilizing more different types of resources such as hydropower and geothermal power. Electric power has different costs depending on where you live, for instance, the U.S. the average people pay is roughly 12 cents per kilowatt-hour. In other areas around the world, electricity is cheaper particularly in regions like China, and India.Device CostAnother calculation to figure into the equation is the cost to acquire a mining device. Pre-manufactured mining rigs can be anywhere from US$500 to $2,000 depending on performance and if the device is new or used. To get ahead of your original investment you have to mine enough bitcoins to cover the price of a machine and only after meeting this cost a person then can profit. Other things to consider are buying racks for multiple machines, connectors to tether all of the miners together in unison, and keeping capital handy for replacement parts.Time and MaintenanceBitcoin mining also takes time to set up the machines and maintain them. Also just like any computer that operates consistently, factory parts can malfunction, and bitcoin miners often need fan replacements because devices run so hot. Additionally, it helps to be computer savvy and know how to use software, command lines, and be able to configure wiring and replacement parts. Larger data facilities hire employees to take care of thousands of machines running 24-hours a day.Furthermore, some people mine just to help support the network and participate because it can be a fun hobby. Whatever the case may be preparing to mine bitcoins is a bit more complicated than it used to be.","44,107 followers",Jordan B Peterson,15.3K,93,11.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-get-coins-in-Bitcoin-Miner

Now Bitcoin works according to this blockchain system only. Let's find out how.Bitcoin miningJust like mining in the real world allows us to procure gold, Bitcoin mining allows individuals to procure new Bitcoin units or bitcoins. This is an inbuilt feature of its blockchain technology that helps in keeping the Bitcoin system decentralized. The individuals who mine the blocks are known as miners.Need to mine the blocksSince the Bitcoin network supports peer-to-peer transactions without a central authority, the network’s participants need to verify these transactions instead. The miners verify these transactions and mine them in the block. These miners receive a mining reward/block reward in the form of new bitcoins.Another reason why Bitcoin mining is important is that this block reward is the only way of adding new Bitcoin units to the supply chain.Process of miningThe process of Bitcoin mining is not solely limited to verifying transactions. The miners also need to solve a complex hexadecimal numeric problem. The first miner to verify the transaction and solve the numerical problem receives the mining reward.Now how does Bitcoin work?And the process keeps on repeating.Who pays for the mining done?As clear by now, the Bitcoin system rewards the fastest miner with a mining reward in the form of a few Bitcoin units. Currently, the mining reward is at 6.25 bitcoins. This type of mining system is known as the 'proof of work' model.The cost of mining that a miner incurs in the form of an electricity bill for powering the high-processing devices to solve the numeric problem is borne by the miner only.","29,208 followers",Mattias Petter Johansson,1.1K,1.1K,16.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-get-coins-in-Bitcoin-Miner

He was full and had some leftovers for the day. He wanted to cap off his perfect meal with a can of beer which he could only get from Jouzur the Brewer. In an uncharacteristically peaceful manner, they exchanged the meat and a six-pack between each other.Eventually, the trade became quite cumbersome. Sometimes it felt absurd to share a good 50 lbs venison cut for only half a can of beer (which was all Jouzur had left to share on weekend nights). They, therefore, came up with an idea of assigning value to their goods using pebbles.A can of beer would therefore be worth 5 pebbles, and 10 lbs of deer meat would be worth 10 pebbles.For a while this arrangement worked, until Jouzur realized that Rurlork has been bringing much more pebbles than he should’ve had. He started counting the stones he was handing out to Rurlork, only to realize that Rurlork was cheating by just picking random stones from ground to get his liquor.Stones would’ve worked fine as a currency, but they weren’t aRurlork and Jouzur went to the local elder, an honest guy with an impeccable reputation who went by the name Dredhurk the Mueller. Everyone trusted Dredhurk. He came up with an ingenious solution. He would carve a big fat check mark on pebbles and only those pebbles would be usable for trade. Whereas before Rurlork the Caveman could pick up any stones from the beach he now had to rely on Dredhurk for “vetted” stones.Pretty soon he recognized the need for learning engraving skills and enrolled in the local community college. After a couple of month he had learned enough to be able to carve his own check marks into random stones. A man gotta get his free beer.So while the currency was scarce, it was notThe need for a scarce and verifiable currency eventually led the gentlemen to many other forms of currency. Along the way there were other mishaps (some currencies were not portable, not divisible or not durable) but we’ll skip those failures and focus on the result. Gold.Gold was scarce, it had to be mined from somewhere which wasn’t an easy task. If someone had a coin of gold, it was okay to trust its value. Someone at some point must have done some work to mine this piece of gold, and he wouldn’t have given it to someone else for free. Therefore, if Rurlork presented half a gold coin Jouzur agreed to give him a keg full of beer. The coins could later be reused by Jouzur to buy the iPhone X that he’d had his sights on for weeks.(Thanks toLet’s revisit some of the properties that made gold such a successful currency. Somehow these properties apply to BitCoin as well, we’ll get to the “how” section a little later.Part II: The Digital Revolution and KhanCoinYour music is digital. Your movies are digital. Your health records are digital. Your friends are, to some extent, digital. Why isn’t your currency digital?(Again, thanks toLet’s make it completelyThe way KhanCoin works is, people type in clear English the transactions they want to make. Something like,The problem now is, anyone can type those characters on his keyboard. This stuff ain’t scarce.To add scarcity, we add a stipulation that khancoins transactions should contain products of really big numbers. That is,We are on a roll. In one shot we made khancoins scarce and we also made it somewhat verifiable. It’s easy for someone to verify whether this is a correct khancoin transaction, they can just multiply the numbers and check the result. It still doesn’t let others verify that Kamran Khan was indeed the legitimate owner of theOr worse, maybe he did own the original coin and someone changed the text and replaced “Paul” with “John” in order toWe can try to tackle these problems one by one. For proof of possession, we use something calledOur KhanCoin transactions now look like this:“I, Kamran Khan, am transferring one khancoin to Paul. The serial number for this coin is:Anyone can verify that if Kamran indeed authorized the transaction part that came before the “—” dashes, the signature would indeed beThink of it this way, only Kamran knows how to draw his perfect signature on paper. Anyone else can look at the signature and recognize it as Kamran’s. They cannot replicate the same signature though on more documents. It’s the same concept solidified with strong mathematics.The problem of forged transactions is solved. But Kamran Khan can still use the sameOne way to do this would be to have a central authority, e.g., Federal Bank, issue and keep track of serial numbers. They could issue new serial numbers, such asMost of the glaring issues are solved now, but the currency is stillPart III: BitCoin: We are all BanksSuppose there are 100 khancoin in the world in total. Somehow, all of them are assigned to separate individuals. That is, when things start everyone already knows that Kamran owns khancoinInstead of vetting transactions through a central bank, when Kamran wants to pay Peter with his khancoinThey all verify that Kamran indeed owns khancoinIn this sense,Still, why would they all help out in letting other people do transactions?This is the drums roll moment…They would help out in validating transactions because everytime they do, they get to claim some new khancoins.This sentence is the absolute core of BitCoin. Every time I confirm a bunch of transactions (called “a block”), I can insert a transaction of my own saying “I, Kamran Khan, pay Kamran KhanWhy doesn’t everyone get reward then? Because to confirm transactions you have to find a mathematical solution. Support, for example, that we assign values to each and every letter in English. A is 1, B is 2 and so on. You could add all the values, multiply them, take a factorial, divide the answer by 11347, multiply the resulting digits with each other, take a factorial againThe “difficulty” of findingThe final block, would therefore look something like this:Anyone can verify the solution, i.e.,The final step is to give this block a number, e.g., blockAgain, everyone else will verify thatThe actual BitCoin protocol does not use real names.

At its foundational-base, every ten minute cycle continuously produces a new block (currently at 12.5 BTC / lowers to 6.25 BTC) as this magical phenomenon happens every 210,000 blocks.These days, there are a lot of legitimate offers online that gives great advantage to cryptocurrency investors where they get double of their invested cryptocurrency on platforms like www.underatedcryptos.store. These are opportunities that need to be really utilized to its maximum.First, a reduction from 50 BTC to 25 BTC in November 2012, then the second halving shifted the pre-determined goalposts from 25 to 12.5 BTC in July 2016. Now, the anticipation of the next halving event will see the block rewards drop from 12 to 6.25 BTC in May 2020. This permanent change in the mining rewards system for newly-minted bitcoins is Satoshi's vision for designing a deflationary, digitally-scarce cryptoasset.The excitement is now building up about what effects the halving will have on bitcoin's price and the entire cryptocurrency market, knowing the 18th million BTC (85% of all) has already been issued to-date.For reference, the 2024 bitcoin halving date (in May/June) will be whenever the blockchain reaches a block height number of 840,000, effectively lowering the block rewards generation from 6.25 BTC down to 3.125 BTC per 10 minute increment. With exactly 30 Bitcoin halving events remaining (all 21 million bitcoins in circulation by 2140) there's under 300,000 blocks to mine before the next blockhalf; let's review the history, the celebratory party events and all-intriguing price volatility fluctuations bound to happen.Bitcoin Mining Halving Sentiment: The Bulls vs BearsFor the rest of 2019 and first half of 2020, bitcoin users to see if the consensus comes true. In the words of Mr. Tepper regarding the 2016 bitcoin halving, Fitz said, “It's Halvening!!!”There is no shortage of #BTC hope and optimism (hopium) being tossed around into all kinds of bold outcomes about this major mining milestone. In traditional markets, a simple rule of thumb usually concludes if you reduce the overall supply of newly issued coins it will more than likely lead to higher price per coin. So far, history sides with bitcoin's price seeing a substantial rise in the past due to increased demand overtime.It may be commonly accepted in the crypto world that the block reward halvings are bullish for bitcoin price due to the charts outlined below. Indeed, when you look at the price charts for the past two $BTC halvenings, this obviously appears true from a zoomed-out historical viewpoint. The November 28, 2012 halving the bitcoin price was $12.35 BTC/USD and 5 months later was $127 USD. The July, 9 2016 bitcoin halving day's price was at $650 USD and was nearly $760 just five months later. The needle is moving once again.The Bitcoin network software is built-upon a few invariable premises. At 12.5 BTC x 6 (six 10 minute cycles per hour) is 75 bitcoins minted per hour x 24 hours per day is 1,800 BTC per day issued. Then, quick math for 2020 halving and beyond to the next for years until 2024, shows it will be 6.25 BTC x 6 equals 37.5 per hour x 24 hours per day is only 900 BTC per day rewarded. This is a 50% reduction, effective instantly.Further, simple math puts the past four years of block rewards mining system going from 1,800 per day, which is 657,000 BTC annually, to 900 BTC per day which is only 328,500 BTC annually in comparison. Sprinkle in some natural cryptocurrency adoption, regulation clarity and payment tech optimization and it is a recipe for a very entertaining 2020 pre and post bitcoin halving year.It does not take an economic savant to apply simple supply and demand consensus mechanisms regarding scarcity of supply and rising demand. The debate about bitcoin being a possible safe haven asset shelter upon global turmoil and uncertainty is growing daily, weekly and monthly. Once the 2020 bitcoin mining halving happens, the on-chain effects are immediate and impact formulated forever. When these scales are tipped in the favor of lowering the newly created bitcoins granted for successfully mining a block and getting the reward to the miner trading computational power and securing the Bitcoin network, price volatility is bound to unfold.Bitcoin Halving Charts: Historical Price Action AnalysisClick on image to enlarge and see entire bitcoin halving price history chartOne caveat to consider is to know what can enhance the upward trend following the halving, like it has historically in the charts in 2012 and 2016. An acceptance as a reservoir can really build a strong foundation and bigger base. As the man (or women), or they, myth or legend Satoshi Nakamoto put it:“It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on. If enough people think the same way, that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.”Many want to know what will the price be at the date of halving. Here is a visual representation overview of the historical timeline.The two previous price peaks have both occurred approximately one year after the halvings, suggesting perhaps the next peak will occur in mid-2021 if the pattern repeats. Will the third time be a crypto charm?Before comparing the first 2012 halving to the 2016 bitcoin halving, the quote on controlled supply from Bernard Dempsey hits home:A fixed money supply, or a supply altered only in accord with objective and calculable criteria, is a necessary condition to a meaningful just price of money.As the era of decentralized finance emerges, here is what we know so far.With roughly 360,000 blocks left to mine with nearly 200 days left before the official btc blockchain mining halving in the middle of May 2020, and factoring in what the 2012 all time high and low prices of $12 to $1,163 peaks (96x return) and falling back down to $220 range or the 2016 value of $658 USD and seeing nearly $20,000 all time highs (30x return) and falling back down to $3,100 range, many love to speculate about how the bitcoin halving will effect the BTC price in the new few months before and after the block rewards are cut in half for the third time in history.Here are the flagship crypto cliffnotes about the past bitcoin mining block reward halvings:image courtesy of huddlFirst HalvingThe summarizes into bitcoin bull market price action lasted a full 24 months, or two years long.That is in the same timeframe we are in now gearing up for the third bitcoin mining halving event.Second HalvingThe second halving symbolizes the bottom of bitcoin's price to be 10X of the first halving support.Third HalvingHowever, the real question is whether the price action of the past has been caused by the block reward halvings, or if it was merely a coincidence. Most people in the cryptocurrency industry will suggest that the former is true, but the need for verification needs to be thought out in multiple ways. Nothing is guaranteed.While the first mining halving cycle was referred to as the retail cycle, followed by a venture cycle, the third phase is dubbed the institutional cycle. That puts only 2.6 million blocks out of 21M total left. #digitalscarcityBut First, A Background Drop on the BTC HalvingsThe first two bitcoin halvings saw extremely similar patterns surface as the stages transpired as such:beforeaftercrashthe fallfoundationOne of the greatest features of Bitcoin is it’s capped supply of 21 million and it’s predictable inflation schedule, which is a native part of the Bitcoin code. In the chart below, you can see the existing supply of bitcoins vs. the rate at which 1,800 new coins are being mined (144 blocks per day x 12.5 BTC).coinmetrics new bitcoin mined daily graphicAt first glance, the block halvings are certainly a disadvantage for those who mine Bitcoins. However, this is a crucial step to reduce currency inflation — bolstering Bitcoin’s main value proposition. And, so long as more people believe in that value proposition, the “real world” value of mining new blocks can keep increasing over time even as the block reward is halved. The next halving cycle will depreciate to 900 new coins daily.If 1 BTC is worth $100k, a 6.25 BTC block reward would be worth significantly more to miners than a 12.5 BTC block reward when BTC is worth just $10k. On top of that, miners profit from transaction fees, which can become more and more valuable over time as the Bitcoin network continues to grow.Reviewing the previous halvingsAt the time of the first halving in November 2012, the entire Bitcoin economy was too small to be noticed by institutions. In fact, Bitcoin’s price had fallen by over 90% — from $ 31 to $ 2 — about 1 year prior. The price started to rebound in November 2011 and continued to rise through the halving in 2012 until it reached an all-time high of over $1200 in November 2013.Of course, Bitcoin had another collapse that began at the end of 2013 and lasted until 2015. Then, about 8 months ahead of the next halving that would occur in July 2016, Bitcoin’s price started to recover. During this time, several venture capital companies and hedge funds became involved in the cryptocurrency market along with millions of new retail investors, ultimately pushing Bitcoin to a value of nearly $20k in December 2017. Again, ,ost of the appreciation came after the halving: BTC was worth $650 at the time of the halving, and subsequently increased by more than 30x.Halvings and bull markets pastThe brief review of these two cycles shows an obvious trend in which Bitcoin’s price starts to rise 8-12 months before a halving is anticipated to occur and continues for about 1 year following it. What needs to be investigated is whether the halvings are causing this positive price trend, or if the bull markets and halving events are merely correlated by coincidence.Factors that affect Bitcoin’s priceLet’s analyze the factors that could provide us with explanations on how the halving leads to an increase in the value of Bitcoin. First of all, we need to analyze the activity of the miners.The most trusted crypto company graph showing the all time high rate power of the bitcoin blockchainBitcoin miners play a key role in the Bitcoin network by confirming transactions. However, miners are also considered marginal suppliers because it’s thought that they typically sell their newly mined bitcoins as soon as possible. All other factors being equal, if miners have fewer bitcoins to sell after a halving, they reduce the total sell volume (i.e. the supply side of the market). As we know, when supply decreases while demand stays constant, price increases.Another component to consider is that Bitcoin miners have two sources of revenue: the newly minted bitcoins and the transaction fees. When all 21 million bitcoins have been mined, transaction fees will remain the only source of revenue. Even though transaction fees are taken from the existing supply of Bitcoin, for miners they are a source of revenue just like block rewards. In fact, miners are equally likely to sell them to cover their operating expenses. Therefore, the value of transaction fees must also be considered as part of the supply side.Of course, the other side of the market is demand, which has increased significantly over time as retail, venture, and institutional money have all gotten involved. This growing demand has no doubt had a massive impact on price increases — further muddying the waters as to whether the halvings have been major causes of the past bull markets or if it’s just a coincidence that they occurred during times when demand was taking off.Popular Theory: “Halving Reduces Liquid Supply Significantly”The “liquid supply” of a currency is the portion of the total supply which is actively circulating. In other words, HODLing your Bitcoin for months or years on end removes them from the liquid supply, because they aren’t being traded or exchanged.It’s believed that miners aren’t typically HODLers because they have to sell into fiat currencies to pay operational expenses. This means that newly mined BTC are part of the liquid supply.In the first ~4 years of Bitcoin’s existence, 7500-8000 BTC were mined every day and added to the circulating supply. After the first halving, this amount fell to 3700-4000. Currently, 1900–2000 Bitcoins are added to the supply every single day, which will drop below 1000 Bitcoins a day after the next halving.In terms of US dollars, what emerges is a somewhat different view. As we mentioned, Bitcoin’s price was $13 on the day of the first halving. So when the daily amount mined was cut by about 4000 BTC (from 8000 to 4000), this amounted to a ~$52k reduction in value of Bitcoins joining the liquid supply each day. For the second halving when BTC was $650, this amounted to approximately $1.3M reduction.But what does that mean?Well, think about it this way: a reduction of any sizeable amount in liquid supply means that even if demand stagnated and remained flat, the price would increase as a result of the halving. This, ultimately, is why many people think that halvings are bullish.Contradicting Theory: Efficient Market HypothesisThere is one HUGE point that the halving bulls tend to ignore or explain away: the efficient market hypoyhesis. This essentially states that in a rational market, assets always trade at their fair value on exchanges.Of course, no market is perfectly rational. The question is:Bitcoin’s inflation schedule is knownIf this is public knowledge, the EMH states that the effects of the halving should be priced in by the marketWith venture and institutional funds now holding heavy bags of Bitcoin, it seems likely that the market is far more rational today than ever before. So with that being said, how likely is it that the next halving will actually trigger another huge bull run?If the Bitcoin market isn’t efficient, why didn’t hashrate drop after past halvings?One final point to consider is the important metric of network hashrate. That is, the total computing power of all the miners in the Bitcoin network at the time of the halving.If miners have to sell most or all of their coins immediately after receiving them to pay for their operational costs, you would expect the halvings to make mining unprofitable for many miners.However, based on the historical hash rate, halvings have not caused any noteworthy drops in total hashing power. This indicates that perhaps the EMH is valid, and miners are rational enough to include halvings when they calculate future costs and revenue.In a non-techy way, in the past it was easier to solve blocks and generate new bitcoins for miners. Lower competition, mining difficulty adjustments were smaller and less powerful hardware equipment (ASICs) to solve cryptographic algorithms was required than today. The new halving it will usher in a whole new era of the mining industry.Conclusion: Causation or Coincidence?Reflecting on the two contradictory theories above, one thing we can say is that the next halving is not guaranteed to cause another bull run to a new all-time high. It could just as easily be the case that the next halving makes mining unprofitable for a large portion of the current miners, leading to a shard drop in hashrate and decrease in public sentiment about the stability of the Bitcoin network.Maybe Bitcoin’s market is efficient, and halvings do get priced in ahead of time. That would explain why price action has turned positive many months before each of the past halvings. At the same time, isn’t it possible that the months of positive price action leading up to the halvings garner significant attention from new investors, driving up demand and fueling the latter portion of the bull markets following the halvings?It’s hard to say for sure now, but maybe we’ll have our answer after another halving or two. Many are in agreement that given the fixed-supply asset, a price appreciation will occur. This scarcity enhances value motto in the bitcoin world will have an even greater compelling tendency to be bullish going into the 2020 bitcoin halving event.We’ll leave you with one last thought and a few questions…with the honorary wisdom of Satoshi Nakamoto, lets close out this bitcoin halving guide with a poignant message he/she/they sent to the early-adopting crypo community:“If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.”Should investors take the bite and bet big on bitcoin and see these sub $8,000-$10,000 prices today as a one-time buying opportunity? As a smart investor, there is a market opportunity where the world is watching and can predict when the reduction of any commodity supply by 50% is going to happen. This is likely to have ripple effects felt all across the ethereal realm of virtual currencies and cryptoassets led by the number one crypto, Bitcoin.",0 followers,James Larsson,525,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-get-coins-in-Bitcoin-Miner

The Bitcoin community itself doesn’t even know for sure who invented Bitcoin – I even met one of those who claims to be the big founder.But there are definitions of Bitcoin that even a five-year-old could understand. Bitcoin is an online form of money. So, when you read “cryptocurrency”, think digital gold. Think virtual money.You can buy and sell bitcoins or exchange them for goods and services in the physical world, and a small but growing number of businesses you’ve heard of accept them. Investment platforms like the Coinstarhaven company (www.coinstarhaven,com) for example, accepts and doubles your Bitcoins after 7 days, they also return double of a number of other cryptocurrencies after 7 days. What takes place is a wholly digital trade – no physical coins or notes exchange hands. If you want to cash out into physical paper money, you’ll probably have to pay a fee, or the fee gets paid by the company you’re dealing with.From old to newWhen you send a dollar elsewhere online it is usually a bank that verifies the transaction – and takes a fee for its trouble. Your money is usually in the hands of age-old institutions, many of whom we now mistrust due to decades of corruption and profiteering.But bitcoins can be bought and sold without the need for those organisations. It does this by distributing what used to be our trust in one organisation across a system of many people. Trust is shared out. And here another metaphor borrowed from the physical world comes into play. We ensure that our digital transactions are true and secure by writing them onto a shared, public “ledger”. It’s a big, open, digital book of truth and openness.This ledger is secure and transparent. It isn’t owned by one corporation – it’s shared and kept up to date by the Bitcoin community. And no one charges you for recording your transactions into that ledger. Instead, those who verify the truthfulness and reliability of those transactions are the bitcoin miners. They all compete to verify the bitcoin transactions we all make, and those who succeed, are rewarded with bitcoins. In a way, it’s a game. A clever competition, with high stakes. And the winners not only win bitcoins but also help the whole thing to keep working reliably.A bit like gold, not all bitcoins have yet been discovered. You can buy and sell the ones that are “out there”. On average their value has been rising over the years. The ones yet to be discovered are prospected for by “mining”.When Bitcoin was founded, a finite limit on the number of bitcoins was set, just as there is a finite amount of gold in the physical world. The number was 21m. So far, more than 12m are in circulation. That means that a little fewer than 9m bitcoins are waiting to be discovered. So there are people buying and selling already existing bitcoins. There are people buying and selling goods and services with bitcoins – some of whom exchange them for stuff and money back in the physical world. And then there are people trying to find those increasingly elusive golden tickets – they are mining the undiscovered bitcoins.So how do you mine bitcoins?Anthony Volastro offers a clearer description than most: “‘Mining’ is lingo for the discovery of new bitcoins – just like finding gold. In reality, it’s simply the verification of bitcoin transactions.” And how is that done? “It’s not just one transaction individuals are trying to verify; it’s many. All the transactions are gathered into boxes with a virtual padlock on them – called ‘block chains’ … Miners run software to find the key that will open that padlock.” And when they achieve that, new bitcoins are released as a reward.They are tending the bitcoin garden, playing a kind of functional game – keeping the ledger true and the transactions verified. And it has all been set up so that, by doing that, you can find the unreleased bitcoins and dig them up.In the early days, it was easier to be a miner. There were fewer miners around. As the bitcoin universe has expanded, however, more people are after the finite digital gold, just as in real gold prospecting. People have banded together, created “pools”, sharing ever more expensive hardware, processing capability and even electricity costs that go with finding those precious bitcoin golden nuggets. You see, it isn’t easy to find a bitcoin. The easier days are over. The view on the street now is that “only the biggest centralized miners will profit.”So is it worth becoming a miner?To answer that question, it’s worth hearing from the practitioners – the digital diggers and drillers. “It took ages for me to mine bitcoins because of enormous competent people mining with excellent machines,” said one.Mining has become more competitive and tougher. On discussion boards the advice is not to even attempt it solo. You’ll have to join a “pool” – a group mining together, with some pretty impressive computer kit. (Most are all-night coders in China). You’ll need access to some hardcore hardware and be ready to burn 24/7 electricity.Some now claim that the hold just a few groups have now over the mining operation is a significant barrier to entry for anyone else, especially a rookie. There’s no going it alone. You’ll have to join a “mining pool” and you might just feel like you’ve ended up in another institution. Ironic, eh?There are alternatives to Bitcoin, such as Litecoin or Quarkcoin. Yet these alternative forms of digital money are becoming increasingly competitive as well. And as they evolve and become more competitively turbulent, the rewards diminish as well.. If you are just starting out as a potential miner, you stand a better chance going for one of these newer alternatives.So, unless you are ready to dive in with some serious hardware, investment of time and even real money, bitcoin mining is probably not for the little guy any more, if it ever truly was. Bitcoin is institutionalising around centralised groups and may well be becoming similar to the organisations the whole thing was set up to replace.",0 followers,Melissa Aldridge,501,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-get-coins-in-Bitcoin-Miner
21,"Yes the cost of mining will instantly become twice as expensive after the halving, but there will be about the same number of miners. Most mining is done by big commercial operations that aren't going anywhere.And once most of the Bitcoins mined prior to the halving are sold and out of circulation, around a year after the halving, only the new, doubly expensive coins will exist, and most of them will be in those big miners’ wallets.And they won't sell.And the price will rise.
