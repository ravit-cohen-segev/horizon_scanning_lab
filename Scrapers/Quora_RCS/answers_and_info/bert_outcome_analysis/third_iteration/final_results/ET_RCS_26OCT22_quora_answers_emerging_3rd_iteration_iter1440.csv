4,"Transfer learning in ML models.Humans are really good at generalizing. We only have to see a few dogs before we can recognize a dog when we see one.Machines are not. ML models require millions of examples before forming a reliable classifier, and that classifier is very specific to the data on which it was trained. If your training data doesn't include dogs with three legs, the model won't recognize them. A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one.

It's hypothesized that the reason humans learn so quickly is that we are fitting new examples into our existing knowledge rather than forming entirely new categories. If we could teach machines to do the same, they would learn exponentially faster and apply that learning more effectively.Transfer learning is a very hot topic in AI research right now, so I expect major breakthroughs in the next few years. I think this may be sufficient to achieve artificial general intelligence, but even if not, it will dramatically extend the range of tasks that machines can accomplish.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-energy-technologies-that-have-yet-to-become-commercialized-will-be-winners-within-the-sector-over-the-next-several-years
5,"Yes, they already are.In my home town Gothenburg in Sweden, which is also the home town of Volvo, I have frequently met self driving test cars on public roads. They still have a driver for observation and surveillance, but the cars are 100% self driving through dense rush hour city traffic in snow and rain.Tesla has had an option for autonomous cars for several years.My own, much more humble Volvo, is perfectly capable of holding its speed based on the vehicles around me, keep itself in the selected lane, autobrake and even automatically take evasive actions if needed, without me touching theYes, they already are.In my home town Gothenburg in Sweden, which is also the home town of Volvo, I have frequently met self driving test cars on public roads.

Of course it will disengage with a dismayed red icon in the dashboard and a sound signal as soon as I release the steering wheel for more than a few seconds. It is not a self-driving car after all, but still, surprisingly close.The problems with self-driving cars are not primarily technical, but legal.Like, who is resonsible for a crash in a completely self-driving car that maybe doesn’t even have a steering wheel, like the concept in the illustrations below? The owner? The passenger? The manufacturer? And if you get out of the car asking it to park itself and then it bumps into another vehicle? Whose insurance will take the cost? It is all pretty unclear.However, as soon as we have the legal system worked out, I am quite sure that we will see more and more automatic vehicles on our roads, until in maybe 50 years, manually driven cars will no longer exist as they will be regarded as too dangerous.I have to say, while the concept images below are intriguing, I think we need to see a generation shift for the passengers to be able to relax, read and sleep and not hold on to dear life, looking for the brake pedal on floor as the car automatically plunges through a black Swedish forest at 120 kmh in the middle of the night.

6,"There was a highly ridiculed Quora thread in 1912 that asked if automobiles were the future.

Horse heads (people that were really into modding horses, not the actual horse heads themselves) were outraged. They saw the rickety, raucous buggies bumbling along, smoke billowing and owners cursing, and were convinced it was all hokum. Unrelated and decades later, a host of thoughtful, intelligent scientists and engineers announced that few people would ever own a computer. They were the size of a room, the cost of a house, and less useful than a canker sore.The impossibilities of yesterday are stacking up as the common of today. We continue to find that if physics doesn’t explicitly limit something, it’s likely going to come to pass sometime. The moon? Been there. Test tube babies? Common. Artificial body parts? Coming along slow, but steady (humans are tough to experiment on). The list keeps growing.Let’s face it, if we could make cars ever safer, climbing that linear path toward mishap-free conveyances that anyone can operate, afford, and maintain, we’d be doing that. That’s not happening. These last 10 years are as safe as we’ve been in almost the last century, but we have continued to kill and maim at high rates. We’ve modified and improved every aspect of the vehicle save one: the operator. Until we do that, we’re going to continue to condemn millions every year to death or debilitation. Unfortunately, no one is willing to invest in better mandatory, periodic training and harsher penalties for transgressions (which is understandable when 75% of people consider themselves superior drivers). When you look at the amount of resources being thrown at the computer side of the problem, it’s astounding that so many people are pessimistic about the outcome. We live in the age of miracles! Of course, we also live in the age of the Kardashians and Twitter trolls, so I can see how it might be easier to just assume the worst.Since we don’t have very good auto-driving systems now, it’s easy to be blinded by the slow progress. This might be rooted in our view of the past. Progress has been going at a certain pace, so it’s natural so extrapolate that, making it look like a linear climb. But that’s not how progress works. It’s exponential. People in ancient Greece would likely fit in pretty well with those living in the 17th century, but our founding fathers would freak out if you dropped them into 1945. A couple decades ago my grandparents couldn’t even get their VCRs to stop flashing 12:00. Today, our kids don’t have to plan anything, because they can text and access maps on the fly in real time.Auto driving is not only going to be “the future,” (echo-y voice), but it’s going to come quicker than most realize. Once cars can drive around on nice streets on clear days (meaning right now), they are going to really learn what driving is like in the real world. There may be times when the conditions are such that they have to pull over, but that’s only going to be because they are programmed better than we are and have a realization of the risks at every point in the drive. They aren’t going to pound a few beers and head home based on having done so dozens of times before. They aren’t going to forget to look left and just pull out absentmindedly due to changing the radio because it’s the Perry Como hour. They aren’t going to have this inherent optimistic blind spot that we have (“I just assume that person coming at me sees me, too, and will stay in the other lane”).I love to drive (and I’m better than average at it). Of course, IThe adoption is going to be slow at first, like everything else, then rise rapidly, curtailing off toward the top as the hold-out Luddites pay to drive on private roads (whichAs soon as I can get in my electric car and tell it to take me to get pancakes and sex, I’ll know I’m living in the future.I’m adding the bad stuff below the fun comic. During this change, because Autos are going to adhere to the rules of the road and safety aspects, traffic is going to get worse. The early adopters, especially, are going to have a rough go at it. Drivers will be cutting them off, boxing them in, and shunting them farther and farther back in traffic. There will eventually need to be laws that restrict the most egregious actions, like teams of drivers boxing in and stopping Autos for a lark (maybe even to highjack them, but with all the cameras, it’s going to be well-documented). It’s going to be ugly and if you think the large trucks “icing” electric charging stalls and “","135,528 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-big-thing-in-technology-apart-from-AI-and-driverless-car
7,"Eventually, the end of car ownership as we’ve known it. If there’s always a ride to be had nearby, self-driving or otherwise, why would you want the hassle of car ownership? American car culture has been on the decline for quite some time, and autonomous vehicles will hasten its demise.
