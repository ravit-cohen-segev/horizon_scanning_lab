1,"China does spend more on green technology, producing 95% of wind turbines and 90% of solar panels. Then they are exported to provide funding for coal powered plants. The current plants produce 28% of global CO2, and the final project will produce 44% by the end of the building project in 2035; China is ahead of schedule.The USA contributes 16% of global CO2. China is doing nothing to contribute to the use of “green technologies” other than building and selling the devices.",4 followers,Randy Weir,2K,13K,70.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-come-China-spends-more-than-the-rest-of-the-world-on-green-technology-and-the-U-S-under-allegedly-climate-change-emergency-president-cannot
2,Because in the United States’ federal system of government it is the congress that has the power of the purse… so without the legislature passing a bill authorizing additional spending the president is powerless.,2 followers,Richard Muller,7.3K,2.3K,202.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-come-China-spends-more-than-the-rest-of-the-world-on-green-technology-and-the-U-S-under-allegedly-climate-change-emergency-president-cannot
3,"China has deployed more solar capability than any other nation. It has been closing dirty coal mines for quite a while and also shutting down old inefficient coal power stations. These are being replaced with more modern power stations and they are opening new higher grade coal mines.They have a continual group of their army planting trees wherever they can to help reduce atmospheric CO2. They have the worlds largest dam - The Three Gorges Dam - which is pollution free and is the worlds largest dam generating electricity.But there is another issue that many people disregard or are event unawarChina has deployed more solar capability than any other nation.

They have the worlds largest dam - The Three Gorges Dam - which is pollution free and is the worlds largest dam generating electricity.But there is another issue that many people disregard or are event unaware of and that is that manufacturing creates pollution/waste/emissions/etc. At times you can have low-pollution high costs products or you can have moderate/high pollution creating products at low cost. Not everyone can afford the ‘better’ products. Do you expect them to go without products that, at times, are vital to their quality of life?So China is, in effect, polluting their own country so that developed countries don’t have to! There are other issues of course but what I have written above is generally never considered.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,12.7K,996,156M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-come-China-spends-more-than-the-rest-of-the-world-on-green-technology-and-the-U-S-under-allegedly-climate-change-emergency-president-cannot

Traditional Core Networks (2G, 3G and 4G) have used a one size fits all approach. It is always a challenge to optimise different Core Network instances with new characteristics, e.g. bandwidth, Quality_of_Service, etc..Network slicing will help to ensure that a collection of Core Network Services can be Virtualised (via software) and used by an application, e.g. MVNO. Network Slicing ensures that end to end Core Network resources can be configured and “doled out” to Applications that have a specific set of characteristics.Reference:Network Slicing:https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/NS-Final.pdf","9,883 followers",Kenzi Mudge,1.8K,1.3K,8.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-come-China-spends-more-than-the-rest-of-the-world-on-green-technology-and-the-U-S-under-allegedly-climate-change-emergency-president-cannot
5,"4G is good enough for me.Just me. When I was the only bloke in the village streaming data. When I am the only bloke on the train, bus, or tram using the WiFi, linking the vehicle up by 4G is fine.But when everyone wants data, the available bandwidth becomes clogged. We need more of it. The two ways of fixing that is to widen the chunk of spectrum we are using, or make all of us faster, so we leave more blank time for others.Neither of those can be done with the chipsets in the existing phones. Which we call 4G. So we need another specification update, called 5G. And 5G does both of those thing4G is good enough for me.Just me. When I was the only bloke in the village streaming data.

6,"As a business owner, you may be wondering what new technologies are emerging in eCommerce.

While most of these technologies aren't quite ready to enter the mainstream, they are positioned to make a significant impact. These emerging technologies include augmented reality, virtual reality, immersive technology, and even voice search. While some people may be concerned about the POS system getting eaten up by software, others are optimistic about the future of the POS system.As an e-commerce veteran, I've enjoyed witnessing some of these innovations in action. The most exciting ones are subscription services, making repeat purchases much more manageable. The subscription services that offer convenient one-page checkouts, flexible payment options, and a personalized experience are already significantly impacting e-commerce. As an e-commerce leader, you can capitalize on these innovations while staying ahead of the hype cycle.Many believe VR-based marketing and selling is a novel idea, but business experts predict that it will hit the mainstream soon. Some companies are already offering VR shopping and product demonstrations to enhance the consumer experience. Some companies invest heavily in this technology to provide a complete omnichannel experience to their customers. IBM's ""Consumer wants it all"" report states that retailers must adapt their sustainability strategies and cater to changing consumer demands in 2022.In-store AR experiences will soon become the norm for most shoppers. With these new technologies, the e-Commerce sector will be able to bridge the gap between brick-and-mortar shopping and digital e-commerce storefronts. The future of e-commerce is dependent on these innovations. Therefore, it's essential to keep up with the trends. Furthermore, you can benefit from the latest eCommerce technologies by using them.As the year progresses, the e-Commerce industry will continue growing and evolving. The following year will see more technological innovations that make e-commerce easier, more personalized, and more profitable. Intelligent devices such as beacons and dash buttons will help improve the customer experience. The internet of Things is an era of connected things. It is a vast network of interconnected devices that can communicate with each other. These devices can relay commands and information to one another. Ultimately, this allows them to track where the product is and when.As the market for eCommerce continues to grow, these technologies will become even more critical to business. In the case of innovative home technology, voice search can lead to higher conversions and increased customer satisfaction. The omnichannel experience is the future of e-commerce. Besides omnichannel technology, augmented reality apps have been designed to improve store user experience. They will also help users interact with products in real life, including interacting with agents via a digital screen.","58,988 followers",Michael Wolfe,504,2K,17.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-come-China-spends-more-than-the-rest-of-the-world-on-green-technology-and-the-U-S-under-allegedly-climate-change-emergency-president-cannot
