Including emergency contact information. it could contain any or all of your credit cards. On your home PC you would load up the info on the credit cards you want to use, and set the applicable priorities. For example you could set the default to use the card with the highest available credit, or the lowest APR, etc. When working with a compatible scanner you could make changes on the fly. It serves as both your passport and any other applicable id that may be required. Like Military ID, or here in the states it would have been a Social Security card. It was yet another step of having everything bundled together. There were a lot of security concerns, as well as some big brother concerns, but ultimately it became moot as most of that functionality can now be done with smart phone apps.3.4.The second was an oven with an integrated INTERNAL webcam. You could watch that turkey roast while you were at home without having to open the oven. Or if you were cooking a roast, you could time it to be done when you got home from work. But you are delayed. So when it is done cooking it would go to a warming temperature, and then eventually a COOLING temperature.

Even so, the rate of advancement is accelerating. So much so, in fact, that it is difficult, if not impossible, to project what things might look like by the middle of this century.Anyone who tells you differently is either engaging in wishful thinking, or is convinced that dystopia is nigh, or simply is not taking a holistic look at what is happening across the board.** We’ve all seen and, hopefully, recognized some of the worst of the non-holistic looks at the future. These would be science-fiction shows or stories where the heroes dash about in spaceships instead of in cars or on horses, use beam weapons or “blasters” instead of firearms, and force fields instead of body armor, but where almost nothing else is substantially different. They still age and die as quickly as we do, lose limbs, go bald, fight over resources that should be easily obtainable with spaceships, send humans into dangerous situations where they could use robots or surogates, and don’t seem to have integrated or augmented any part of their minds or communications with technology (and don’t even have an entrenched belief system forbidding them to do so).","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-futuristic-and-technologically-advanced-technology-we-haven-t-heard-of-yet
9,"There is here a total lack of knowledge of military affairs and the situation in Iraq that needs addressed here.First, our commitments in Iraq are tiny. Only a few thousand troops that are weighted heavily with tactical aircraft, NCOs, special forces, intelligence analysts, hospitals, and artillery.

Only a few thousand troops that are weighted heavily with tactical aircraft, NCOs, special forces, intelligence analysts, hospitals, and artillery. For comparison, there are more US troops in Poland alone than the whole of the middle east. There are also only a few NATO SAM sites in the middle east that must each defend a wide area, hence why many enemy rockets aren’t shot down. The reason for this is we have far more powerful and disciplined enemies to deal with in Eastern Europe, while the Iraqis are as liable to fight each other and collaborate with us as anything else (entire Iraqi militias switch sides with sufficient bribes).The grunt work in Iraq is outsourced to hundreds of thousands of friendly locals which the aforementioned NCOs train. The effectiveness of this arrangement can be shown by how the hundreds of security walls and manned roadblocks in Baghdad were never abandoned when the US left Iraq during the Obama administration, but rather they were handed over to the Iraqi Army. The Iraqis have no intention of removing martial law, as the last time they scaled down travel restrictions there were general riots full of mob assaults on soldiers and government buildings as well as widespread looting and gang violence.Our local allies are pretty useless, however. NATO trainers consistently report they arrive to find a simple untrained militia and these men instill a rigorous training program getting them into shape and teaching them how to fight, how to shoot, and how to set up a fortified bases and patrol the area. Only these trainers leave and come back later to find the same men settling back into the same old habits. Soldiers housed in town wherever convenient in rental property, systemic absenteeism, and the only place you’d consistently find soldiers are manning roadblocks enforcing arbitrary rules in order to collect bribes and play politics.The Iraqis also don’t get along with each other, even if they’re on the same side. Government forces, for instance, are divided between the Iraqi military and the “Popular Mobilization Units (PMU).” Which is an officious name for a conglomerate of government allied tribal militias and gangs. There are also the Iraqi Kurds divided into many tribal and clan militias. These have no central government simply because their officers can’t agree on anything including essentials like their relationship to Syrian/Turkish Kurds and Baghdad. There are also Iran allied militias that originally formed due to Iran’s efforts against DAESH. These are the guys that show up in the news for their indiscriminate attacks on Americans in Iraq. But vital to note is these groupings only really represent spheres of influence as each soldier, clan, tribe, and township switches loyalties lightly. This is what causes the total lawlessness of northern Iraq around Mosul, as the sheer volume of warring factions is mind boggling as Baghdad, NATO, Kurdish, Iranian, and Turkish forces operate in that area.But more importantly, the strikes by Iran allied militias are laughably ineffective. Namely, they’re firing whatever rocket or mortar they can get their hands on blindly into large airfields at long range. They rarely hit anything at all and soldiers garrisoned there learn not to care about the occasional blast. This is also not remotely new, as one army mechanic told me that back during the COIN he was stationed in Mosul. The local al-Qaeda affiliates would firing a mortar rounds into the airbase several times week. It wasn’t long before the soldiers could tell from the sound how far away the shelling was, and hence whether they should bother dropping their work to take cover. The reason behind these highly ineffective attacks is the Iraqi militias don’t necessarily want to kill their enemies, but rather terrorize them into submission. They are also quite unwilling to take personal risks and have little if any training, so the wars in Iraq were mostly just noise rather than actual fighting.That doesn’t mean the press doesn’t flip out every time anything happens, mostly because of the politicized conflicts and potential for larger wars in other parts of the region. But while a rocket attack in Baghdad that produces no damage might be front page news, there’s actually many small wars across the world that generate far less notice. Each of the below examples are at least just as proportionately bloody as Iraq:This is more an indictment on Iraq’s poor fighting quality more than anything else, though. But nonetheless it shows how the questioner and many others are mislead by volumes of poorly educated editorials and silly activists.Reality is that NATO has predatory dominance in Iraq. Just last February Biden signed off on an airstrike that neutered one Iran allied militia that was behind a rocket attack on a US base. The ability to obliterate anyone we find annoying is just the tip of the iceberg, as among the best trained and equipped indigenous Iraqi forces are the ones in our pocket. Don’t let their attempts to prove otherwise fool you, we own their worthless butts as they often receive orders directly from US commanders. To be fair, it is impossible to calculate the actual effectiveness of these guys, since they only report their successes and their enemy’s real or imagined crimes (most homicides go unreported in Iraq).","7,339 followers",Eleftherios Tserkezis,1.8K,4.3K,34.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-cost-was-not-a-factor-what-are-some-of-the-currently-available-advanced-technologies-that-could-be-readily-used-to-make-commercial-aviation-safer-1
