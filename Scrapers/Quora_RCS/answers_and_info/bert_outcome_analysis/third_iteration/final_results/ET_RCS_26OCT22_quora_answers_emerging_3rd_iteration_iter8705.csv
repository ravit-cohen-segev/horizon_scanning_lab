Most people don't realize that hypersonic flight was common in the 1960s, that you could fly from Boston to Los Angeles faster than you can today.This willingness to get in the way and make rules for what qualifies as innovation always slows down innovation dramatically.Optometry is not nearly as regulated as most of medicine, and glasses and contact lenses, and laser surgery has advanced dramatically compared to other forms of medicine with much stronger FDA oversight.Of course, there's a more direct reason. It has to do with the advantages of miniaturization. That's at the heart of advances in computing. The beauty of computing is that more is better. More transistors makes a better computer. And it's a very linear relationship. Smaller transistors tend to make a faster computer in another linear relationship. Smaller transistors also make a cheaper computer in another linear relationship. But the linear relationships tend to multiply together which makes the computing power grow exponentially.This 3 fold relationship,smaller = faster and cheaper,andmore = better,does not exist in many other fields.More cylinders don't necessarily make a better car. More rooms don't make a better house. More people don't make a better company. There are these limits that come into play, how far you can walk, how many people you can relate to, or how much the weight it takes to carry any additional cylinders.There's also diminishing returns in other places. While increasing computing ability seems to always add to the value, increasing car power requires better safety tools to insure a human driver can maintain control of the car, for instance.However, as more and more things become based on computers more of Moore's Law has the ability to apply. Part of the problem, though, that isn't obvious, is that computers are general purpose. If you came up with the world's greatest Hair Dryer, I doubt I'd buy it. My hair dries naturally, so quickly, that there's just no reason for me to bother. Most products are like that, not having a use for most people. Niche products don't gain new customers by having gains in ability in the way that computers do.  The fact that gains in ability don't necessarily gain new customers limits the investment virtuous cycle's virtue.",2 followers,Richard Muller,3.9K,2.3K,202.4M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-other-industries-follow-Moores-law

That phrase is also losing the precision of its original meaning. There is a very important distinction that is frequently overlooked.Our thoughts, more particularly, our concepts are not real in the sense that a rock is real, for example. The real and objective world is out there. Concepts are different. I can’t just hand you a concept like I could a pebble. But, are the laws of nature real or just a concept? We easily slip into assuming that our conception of the laws of nature are as real as the laws themselves. It is a seductive mistake.The laws of nature, exist independent of us. We form a concept, an idea of how those real laws operate. In a specific case we call it a hypothesis. In some cases, we can figure out a way to make a prediction based on our hypothesis and compare what we think will happen with whatever does happen. That is the scientific method.After many repetitions of making that comparison, we may develop a near certain expectation that our hypothesis is correct. We can then act as if our hypothesis were a “law of nature”. But we should also keep in mind the limits of our knowledge gained from the experiments. It is never possible to test every conceivable starting conditions. In other words, the range of values that have been verified has limits. The precision of the measurements also have limits.Take the law of gravity, for example. They are a good example because our understanding of gravity has changed. Newtons formulation was remarkably accurate and useful - up to a point. There were a few places, like Mercury’s orbit, that didn’t match predictions exactly. Einstein figured out why. Newton’s theory was not thrown out, but modified with additional terms that were insignificant within the range that Newton’s theory had been verified in. At extreme distances, even Einstein’s theory is running into trouble. When we are told that according to general relativity and the measurements made by astronomers, most of the mass of the universe is missing, we should re-examine our assumptions, calculations, and even our theory.That may be a problem with assuming that the range of gravity is infinite. But there is a fundamental limit to the precision of our measurements and it not just the observer effect, where we change something when we measure it. There seems to be a graininess to the universe at the scale of the tiniest things. Energy itself is not divisible into parts that are not integer multiples of Planck’s constant times energy.We have to force ourselves to remember that our concepts are not real. At best, they will be good analogies of the universe, which will continue to be whatever it is, really.",229 followers,Pulkit Aggarwal,27.3K,170,1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-science-based-on-bold-and-unjustified-assumptions-Any-phenomena-can-be-understood-as-an-effect-of-the-laws-of-nature-that-are-the-same-everywhere-This-sounds-like-a-self-fulfilling-prophecy-saying-science-is-true-because-science-is-true

In all possible ways.From what I can see, China is preparing itself for the future and it is going to have a bright future. I do not really see these things from current day USA. The infrastructure is old in the US, crumbling and as far as I know, there's no plan upgrading it nationwide. And i don't know, there seems to be no long term strategic plan for the future, key sectors to invest in or anything else that may secure USAs future. It seems like USAs long term future plan is to find ways to stop China from becoming successful rather than making their own plan for how to remain a leading nation.Also i know that China also has serious problems with disputed territories and a problem with its international image after its encounters with Taiwan, Hong Kong, south china sea and what's happening in xinjiang. I do not think China can become a leading country without resolving these issues. I also think that the only way China can solve these problems is by compromising and giving up some of their claims.

Egypt is usually called the oldest civilization but the Chinese have been an Empire since before the time of Christ and the dimensions are not even comparable. The Chinese had a civil service exam 2000 years ago. Think about that. They had iron foundries 1500 years before the West. They had printing presses using wood before iron. Democratic.

China thinks, China imagines if he was to play it, how would he deal with all these challenges.One day when China has barely that kind money to buy the computer to play the game, China amazes everyone — fewer mistakes, dodges monsters, mad skills. So good that someone even claims that China cheats.Sooner or later China is going to reach the level, like anyone else, where no one has ever been before.There will be no one there to show China how this game is played.How will China deal with it then? No one knows. No one can know.But, what we know for sure is, whatever China does next, is anything but boring.What happens in the next few decades is going to be interesting either way. Whether China fails, because the transformation to a great world power based on new technology didn’t quite clutch with the failing old industrial paradigm; or China succeed in transforming by something industrial-revolution-worthy new technology, something hard for others to imitate, and complete refresh the way people think, live, fight wars, trade, produce.Now, I notices folk in this question mentioned Japan’s anticipation to overtake the USA in the 1980s, and of course that attempt was shattered by the 1989 Plaza Accord. (Although everyone kind of knows it’s massing a huge bubble, the Plaza Accord just kind of popped the bubble prematurely)I just want to add here how Japan’s success story inspired China in the 1980s and 1990s.We are kind of Communist Country (we are not, but…) and we study the Communism Doctrine. And that means we analyze things through the lens of Marxism’s basic pattern of human society evolution. Long story short, before Japan made its success, we were… kind of pessimistic.Why? Because Marx said that to develop a Capitalism, a country must have a primitive accumulation of wealth. The west did it by pillaging and taking over resources from the colonies. Obviously we couldn’t do that any more, the moment had passed. That is why in Mao’s era we were “skipping Capitalism and straight into Communism”. Not because Capitalism was evil or anything (mostly), but because we thought it was not possible to develop capitalism the way the west had (1. we were a victim of such brutal process, we would not do it to some other countries again; 2. even if we get past this moral constraint, the free world would be all over our asses for doing it, because they are hypocrites. They might even resort to military confrontations)Yes, that was kind of a failure, and it was met with a less than delightful ending — the infamous Cultural Revolution.After it had died down together with the dearest supreme leader Mao Zedong. We were confused — where to go?Then Japan came along.What is Japan’s story exactly?After the WWII, Japan was a war marred country in smoking ruins. Americans occupied it, all its glory and dignity gone. No resources, typhoon and earthquake ridden lands…Somehow, it managed to survive. And not just survive, it thrived!Ha, how about that Karl Marx and Adam Smith!Japan grew, and grew. It defied everything taught in the Marxist doctrine.It took the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party some time to study before they get to the slogan that brought us this far today.“Technology is the first tier drive for productivity.” — 1988.You think all Deng Xiaoping did was having some table tennis with Nixon, opened up some ports in Southern China? The leadership back then did a whole lot of things that are not well known in the west.Screw ideology! Screw system! Screw “everyone should be equal”!Really? It surprises you? China suddenly has all that new gizmo and gadgets? Do you think all of that happens overnight?We worked hard for 40 years for today.40 fucking years.And you just noticed it now?It will be interesting to see where China is headed.I witnessed all of that by myself, and I shall continue to witness a little more.","13,151 followers",Godfree Roberts,583,615,12.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-is-China-preparing-to-become-the-nation-of-the-future
