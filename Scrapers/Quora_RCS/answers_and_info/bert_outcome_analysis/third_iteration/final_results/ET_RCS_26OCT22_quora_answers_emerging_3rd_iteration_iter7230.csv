The thing is we have to take a look at the innards of a country to really know whether or not you are truly developed. That Chinese are so obsessed with portraying the facade that they are technologically advanced and ahead is actually an indication that they have not fully developed yet. Because fully developed countries have no need to show off things like that. Everyone knows they are developed.For example, here is San Francisco:Look, not many skyscrapers right? And look at those old cable cars going around! That must mean they are undeveloped right? Nope. Everyone knows San Francisco is a developed city. That’s why it has no need to show off with luxury skyscrapers and such things.Or how about Florence, Italy?Again, no skyscrapers here. But everyone knows it’s a developed city and Italy is a developed country.My point is, you have got to look at the people and the innards of a country to truly know if they are developed.This is the true face of China:You have got to look at the average person. Does the average Chinese have good access to healthcare (which is ranked near the bottom in WHO rankings btw)? Can they drink tap water safely? Do they have access to quality food? Do all have access to electricity or paved roads or a quality education? The answer is: probably, yes, if you are living in the rich east coast provinces of Jiangsu or Zhejiang or Guangdong- but not if you are living in say - Xinjiang or Gansu or Tibet. China’s wealth is not spread equally, neither is it developed equally. Even though the CCP has developed China quite fast - there is still a lot of work to be done making sure *every Chinese* have equal access to everything.And then you got to look at the attitude of the people. When I was in China I found that you really got to look out for who you trust, because there is a lot of scams going on all the time. You never know what is real, what is fake, what is real price of anything. Why do these scams exist? Because people have to be desperate to make money that’s why.Why are people desperate to make money? Probably because they are not making enough to survive, which is an indication that the country is still developing. You’ll notice that in general, the more developed a country is, the less likely there will be scams. In Korea/Japan/Taiwan, you will not find very many scams. In China and Eastern Europe it’s likely.Another aside I want to note is that Chinese bathrooms don’t contain any toilet paper. Do you know the reason why? It’s because people steal it. Now, in what developed country does this happen? I can’t think of any. Only in a developing country would you need to bring your own toilet paper to the bathroom because there isn’t any there due to fear of people stealing it.I find GDP/capita to be generally a pretty good indicator of how developed a country is. The average GDP/capita (PPP) of China is still around $8k/person. While that is higher than most Asian countries - it’s still below the 4 East Asian tigers + Japan and far from the $62k/person that the USA has.The true measure of a developed society is to observe the people that live in the country and not the appearance of the country itself. Chinese “face” culture is the same. You can just obviously see that China has developed really really fast, and mentality wise people are still harping about luxury products and consumerism - this is where Americans were back in the 50s, 60s and 70s, not now.The biggest consumers of luxury products are Chinese people, not Americans or Europeans. The more developed you are, the less need you have to validate your self worth with materialism. The less desire you have to spend thousands of dollars on your children's schooling just to send them to be educated abroad. The less need to travel to countries like Canada or USA for giving birth so that your child becomes a US or Canadian citizen, or to launder your money by buying up real estate in other countries. Developed countries do not need to do things like that.Thats why you should always pay attention to the old adage -Edit:Of course, Chinese commenters love to bring up the USA. Yes, USA has lots of impoverished areas too; every country has developed areas and undeveloped areas, however my point is that for China there is significantly more undeveloped areas at a higher % compared to the USA. The poverty rate for China is 16% as of 2019 and for USA it is 1.5% as of 2019.

In other words, an average person in Taiwan is much better placed in income than most Europeans.In short, technology is not making it harder for countries to become developed. Rather it creates more opportunities by reducing the advantages of big companies in developed countries and levels the playing field [think Finnish Nokia vs. Korea's Samsung or the British Philips vs. LG in TVs]. Africa and South Asia got connected by phones in no time through mobile revolution.I will now address the question details.Think People not just ProductionWhen you try to understand development, look in terms of people not merely in terms of what the country produces. New Zealand and Norway don't produce a lot of high tech things. They import their iPads, software, luxury cars and other tech from other countries. However, they really rank high in human development and are considered developed nations.Thus, countries that dream to become developed should primarily focus on building a highly educated workforce and making sure the rules & infrastructure are there for these people to get employed by businesses. It is as simple.Highly educated people make quite a good salary almost everywhere in the world. If you are a good accountant, software engineer, doctor, dentist, petroleum engineer, insurance actuary, construction manager or a investment banker, you can make $30,000/year even in a poor country like India and that works to $100000/year in percapita income [adjusted to purchase power parity]. If India can get everyone to that level of education/expertise, India becomes developed [developed nations have about $35000/year in average incomes].The role of a governmentIn summary, there are really only 3 key steps to become developed:That's all a good government needs to do.","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,631,1.5K,2.9M,2014,https://www.quora.com/Which-country-first-developed-technology

Java is also the language of Android, the most broadly deployed smartphone OS on the planet.More recently popular high-level languages like python or ruby can be better for developer productivity, flexibility, and fast iteration due to less code verbosity and cruft. But the dynamic nature of these languages, while fantastic for many broad applications, starts to break down when a project becomes very large, lots of developers are involved, or when speed and fault-tolerance are critical. There are techniques and conventions to work around the code stability problems of dynamic typing, but techniques and conventions mean people need to follow them, and even then, there are vulnerabilities that are difficult to prevent.PHP, which is used throughout Facebook for back-end coding, was extended by Facebook to give it static typing and dynamic compilation so that it could deliver the speed and stability of Java.Exotic languages, like Scala, Haskel, Erlang, and Golang, will mainly be for specific applications best suited to them.Java isAnd also theSo Java is here to stay, even though it may be becoming the new COBOL.EDIT in 2020 — Some have pointed out in the comments that Rust is an up-and-coming language, and Go is getting a strong foothold as a scalable back-end server language.

So Designers and architects are using Non-blocking IO languages/frameworks which are lightweight like node.js+express. Complex reusable APIs that require orchestration, Database interaction will, however, be written in Java.So my prediction for the future is more existing Java(Spring MVC etc) will be replaced with Javascript SPAs front end and Node+express backend REST APIs. The “throw-away” Node-express APIs will talk to “reusable” Java(or .net or python) “middleware” APIs which will do all the heavy lifting computation.AndroidThanks to Oracle’s lawsuit against Google, there is a strategic shift in Android to move towards Kotlin. Also, there are wide verity of mobile development frameworks to choose from like Flutter(dart), React Native(Javascript), Native Script(Javascript).
