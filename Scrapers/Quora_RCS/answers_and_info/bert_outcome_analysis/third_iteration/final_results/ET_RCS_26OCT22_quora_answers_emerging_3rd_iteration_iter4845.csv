Their thought process still followed somewhat to how ships of the line would fight, with many dozens of smaller secondary guns doing the heavy work against an opponent. This line of thought is the reason why some pre dreadnoughts can have a very wild mix of gun calibers, with only a very small number of primary guns (usually 4 at most). An extreme example of this line of thought could be seen most clearly with the design of the French pre dreadnoughts, such as the Bouvet, which had SIX different gun calibers.Look at that insanityNow the reason why this line of thought was popular was because of the technological limits of the time, especially with aiming systems. Back then, the aiming systems were simply far too innacurate to fully utilize the longer range of the larger guns. And at closer ranges, these big guns simply reloaded too slowly to be useful.And then came the HMS DreadnoughtWith aiming systems finally catching up to gun technology. Now they can fully utilize the full potential of these big guns. And they made a battleship with 10 of these massive cannons. (With 8 per broadside)Now keep in mind that this is in contrast to the older battleships with only 2–4 big guns. With this, the Dreadnought is simply able to outrange the older battleships. Also helping was the installation of a steam turbine, which gave the Dreadnought a higher top speed than older Pre-dreadnoughts.So essentially what you have is a battleship that can completely outrange and outspeed the pre-dreadnoughts. Essentially making it invulnerable to those older battleships.And now you can see where the panic by other navies sets in. This new class of battleship will essentially be able to pound the older vessels with impunity and there is nothing that the other side could do other than also engage in building dreadnoughts (which is what happened).",46 followers,Derron Ong,743,562,398.1K,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-should-a-business-post-on-social-media

If you don’t readWhat makes the Guard fearsome is the Departmento Munitorum, which by normal Earth standards would make up the majority of the Imperium’s interstellar army (with the regiments of the Guard being the relatively small proportion of the army that are combat arms). The Munitorum gives the Guard an interstellar heavy lift capacity that no other faction in the game can match. Haphazard as warp travel may be, nobody else can move as many men and as much war materiel with the precision of the Munitorum. Some factions can move faster (space marines, eldar), and some can move more (orks, tyranids), and some can move more precisely (necrons, eldar, tau), but nobody can match the Munitorum’s sum total. In particular, the Munitorum beats your average Chaos cultist army all hollow in the logistics department. The strategic reason that the Imperium is so concerned about heresy is that most Chaos armies aren’t actually very mobile on an interstellar scale. They’re homegrown rebellions planted by a couple of seeds.

Highly trained and well equipped, and the best his planet can muster. And these are his stats;Now, many people have commented and said that this doesn’t represent the average guardsman, just the elites, like the Cadians, Death Korps and other such famous regiments. However, there are separate stats for those units;So now we know what a standard guardsman looks like, let’s compare him to the line infantry of some other factions.Chaos Cultists - random civilians given weapons and pressed into service by the ruinous powers - have a worse save and a random Ld (1 D6 +2) which can, at best, be a 8, but has a 50% chance of being worse than the Guardsman’s.A neophyte hybrid - a mutant human controlled by the Tyranid Hive Mind - has a better leadership (for obvious reasons) but is otherwise on par with a guardsman. It should be noted that the guardsman has access to better weapons and vehicles.Battle Sisters - fanatical nuns with power armour and superior weapons - have roughly 17% better aim, slightly better leadership (they’re fanatics) and a better save (because of their power armour).Space Marines - centuries old super humans with some of the best equipment and armour the Imperium can produce - are slightly better with melee and shooting, are tougher and stronger, and have better leadership and armour.T’au Fire Warriors are basically on par with Guardsmen - they have better armour but are worse in melee.Ork boyz - insanely strong and tough brutish aliens - are far better in melee but much worse at shooting, and are stronger and tougher.Skitarrii - elite cyborgs far tougher and stronger than normal humans - are better shots and have better armour than guardsmen.The main thing to remember is that, when facing these line troops, guardsmen are not meant to face them one on one. They are meant to crush their enemies through sheer weight of numbers. While they are (one on one) weaker than most enemies they will face, the points value plays into it as well.One guardsman* is 4 points.A Battle Sister (who has a slightly better weapon skills, leadership and save) is 9 points.So any pure infantry Sisters army will be outnumbered 2:1 by a pure infantry Guard army. And since the Sister has one attack and the guardsmen have access to orders which allow them to fire twice (among other things) their aim will be to obliterate the Sisters’ army by sheer volume of fire.And they have a very good chance of doing just that.*= As of 8th Edition",1 follower,Jaehoon Kim,703,567,5.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-should-a-business-post-on-social-media

Guardsmen seem pretty good because you occasionally have to at least fight a huge group of them, it is rare to find ONE guardsman with a lasgun who is completely alone.Honestly, guardsmen are better as corpse shields and are very much expendable, I mean, the Imperial Guard is said to have trillions of them at max.","5,913 followers",Christopher Aeneadas,1K,8.9K,27M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-Guardsman-troops-so-weak-when-it-comes-to-1v1-They-are-supposed-to-be-the-elite-of-their-planets

25,"Trade protectionism will cause bad things to the US but in the context of this question, it will not affect technological development much. How much is not really quantifiable.Where it will affect technological development would be in the area of competition.

These people go where the money to fund their research or to make their goods is. At some point they will care about trade protectionism but if the mouse trap is high tech enough, other countries may even beat a path to get to it.There are also tit for tat responses from other countries e.g. if America increases the tax on solar panels, then Korea may stop Girls Generation from coming over. Such issues would create localized problems but America is the 2nd largest market in the world, so even if Korea doesn’t sell the US solar panels, China can and Korea has more to lose with antagonizing its markets. Of course, America would suffer if the other countries were say the EU, which is the largest market in the world. But I doubt that Pres Trump, being a businessman, would want to do something like that.What WOULD hurt technology development isDeVos defends Trump-backed education cutsThe reason why America leads in technology is because academics and researchers are attracted to US institutions and research centers and companies. Cuts to these institutions would be cuts to the budget that allows academics and researchers to do their work but even worse, would result in the lessening of opportunities to give students the best so that they can be the best.",21 followers,Timothy Singleton,4.1K,3.1K,3.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-should-a-business-post-on-social-media
26,"The US is the most technologically advanced nation there ever was, so obviously not! I had the privilege of living there for 4 years in the 90s.

She turned to me and said, “Do you have washing machines in Scotland?” Obviously, I was forced to admit, that no we didn’t. Instead we just went down to the river and bashed our clothes off rocks to clean them.2) Transport - I spent two weeks in the lovely town of Columbia. Missouri. There I amazed the locals with my insistence on using a strange outmoded form of transport known as “walking”. Locals would slow down as they passed in their modern cars, pointing and laughing. To them, it must have been like watching a live action version of the Flintstones.3) Voting – would you believe it, but in the UK we still vote by drawing a little X next to the candidate we want to vote for. No sign of the advanced electronic voting they have over in the states. Indeed, we are so old fashioned that we haven’t even outsourced our voting to the Russians yet!4) Guns – It may be hard for an American to believe but almost nobody in the UK owns their own guns. This means that if we have to rise up and overthrow our own government (currently seems like a good plan) then we will be armed with nothing more than some particularly well sharpened sarcasm.Still, perhaps one day we can hope to be as advanced as the US.
