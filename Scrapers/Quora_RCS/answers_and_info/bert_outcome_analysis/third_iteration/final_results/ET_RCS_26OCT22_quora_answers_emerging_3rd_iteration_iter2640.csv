1,"If it’s a passive dislike, nothing really, except that they aren’t interested in them. I know a lot of electricians who begrudgingly carry a mobile phone; they use it to get work from their customers. Hardly any of them send text messages and if they do use it for internet then it’s to look at the price of parts. Similarly I don’t like medical technology. I don’t know why but I just find things like MMR and PET arse-achingly dull, and X-ray machines just don’t set my tail wagging either.

They are fearful that the tech will take their jobs. Historically as automation comes in skilled workers lose out and have to retrain. Some can’t. It’s unlikely that a robot will take my job in the near future, at least not until I’m retired, but when I look at what our admin workers do all day I am too aware that we could code up an app that would do most of their jobs in minutes and we could sack two-thirds of them at least. Not that I’m telling anybody that because I know whose job it will be to look after this thing if it breaks.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-does-it-say-about-a-person-if-they-dislike-robots-and-advanced-technology

5,"Firstly, it increases the countries efficiency. Immagine being able to produce 2 kg of wheat per square meter rather than 0.5 kg, just by having the technology to do it, or being able to produce and export more products, because the factories become more efficient. (maybe by starting to use robots) Also advanced technology, it increases the average quality of life, by allowing more services to the citizens, and therefore attracting world wide attention.

7,"No. Nobody has ever come close to what we have today, technologically. If ancient peoples had been making CAT scan machines or nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, we would know about it.It's possible that there have been societies that took care of their people better than we do, ensuring that everyone had a vote and access to justice and health care (such as it was).

That was not homo sapien. Nor was stone tools.Stone tool use extends back 3.3 million years ago. Without that start, we wouldn’t have a start. Nor would Neanderthal. Each invention builds upon the next. When stone tools are not enough, there are chipped tools, edge tools. When those are not enough, there are pounded metal tools.We needed the invention of better tools for more energy to advance our growing brains. Without the invention of those much older tools, we’d never have steam engines or computers. So thank Homo erectus for the head start.We also went through the dark ages.Basically the decline of cultural and intellectual society for a few hundred years. But here is a surprise for you, Mr “only last 100 years” see this modern marvel of technology in farming?The core “technology” of the combine is an Archimedes Screw from the 3rd century BC. But he didn’t invent it. He merely documented it. Its other name is the Egyptian Screw. He documented its use when it was discovered that this marvelous technology was used to move water throughout the Nile region.As I said, all technology builds on existing technology. One invention leads to another. We have in the past 100 years invented more because the prior 100 years before that invented more. And before that. And well… take a gap for the dark ages, eventually, but before that there were inventions again, and before that, and before that, and before that, and before that. All the way back to those stone tools.Take away those tools, you take away the energy for our brains and homo sapiens never has a large enough brain to invent the locomotive or the computer. Every invention is important across 3.3 million years. Even math.Basically, Babylon had multi-base math and trig in 3700 BCE. Ouchers. Greeks had to reinvent it all over again.There has been no end of invention across 3.3 million years. You just decided out of ego to discount the foundation that all current technology is based on.

You see the same pattern at almost all sites, huge foundation stones with precision fitting that in most cases a razor blade can’t be fit between these huge stones, and in such places as Baalbek in Lebanon, at the Temple of Baal the foundation stones are around 900 tons, quarried from a quarry miles away, down hill from the Temple and raised 30 feet off the ground ( they were placed upon 400 ton blocks), the Romans later built upon this structure as well as others, and you can physically see the difference in the work between the Romans and earlier builders ,the same can be seen in Peru, the Incas built upon an earlier civilizations ruins, the same is true in Egypt with the Pyramids and later attempts to duplicate , or repair them in modern times, our cement today is inferior to the quality of mortar used in building the pyramid and structures around it . Our modern Historians attribute the ruins at Baalbek to the Romans, the ruins in Peru to the Incas, and even in Egypt there is evidence of an early superior civilization, I always wondered why if the Egyptians built the Pyramids, why is it that the Egyptians of Today cannot translate the hyrogliphics of ruins all over Egypt. It is a language from an earlier civilization. The Bible as well as other historical records speak of a global flood, there is evidence of this in the fossil record as you find marine species and land animals fossilized together in mass graveyards, marine fossils in mountainous areas, they are now with modern technology are finding sunken structures, off the coast of India is the most recent as well as Cuba, there is a lot of evidence out there, but our Archeologist today rely on funding and grants, so their work is biased by these funding institutions, creating their own narratives of History. If you read the ancient historical records, such as the work of Josephus, he acknowledged a global flood and other events spoke about in history considered today as myths, all the ancient libraries around the world were systematically burned down and looted, through conquest and wars, one of the last was at Alexandria in the 3rd century, it was the last surviving library of historical records and knowledge, the Romans and early Catholic Church were responsible for this act, so if you wanted to find surviving records and books, the Vatican Libraries would be the first place I would look if it were accessible.",0 followers,Abdelhak Benachour,2K,1.5K,594.5K,2020,https://www.quora.com/Does-advanced-technology-contribute-to-your-economy
