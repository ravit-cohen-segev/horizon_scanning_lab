Let real buyer see your profile on social media and there will be no shortage of work for you.Just a small warning - ArduThere is real need of IOT devices in India.We are small business developing and selling IOT devices and we are finding lot of orders, shortage of time and acute shortage of skilled manpower to do the work.This acute shortage of skilled man power ensure good business opportunity for skilled people.Sadly there are very few real developers, most of the IOT experts you meet are consultants, trainers, mentors who never worked on IOT.How to enjoy the scope- Build up your profile. Let real buyer see your profile on social media and there will be no shortage of work for you.Just a small warning - Arduino+things speak + RaspberryPi is not IOT. Here is what real IOT work involves -this is me , working on Internet Controlled Traffic Lights in India. Over 90% of applicants run away when they see this pic. They want to work in airconditioned office and not in field. Real IOT devices are installed in field and you need to test/debug in real places.In short more scope as there is demand and not many to work and deliver results.Best wishes","15,503 followers",Vinay Chaddha,1K,925,3.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-scope-and-future-of-the-Internet-of-Things
1,"The Sky is the limit.There is no place or field that IoT cannot be used. Any thing that we use in real life can be made smarter, the same way the device can be connected to a grid or internet. This increases not only that device but also the grid’s performance, efficiency, and accuracy. IoT has a lot of scope and prospect. The only field that has shown some progress is Industrial and Home automation. Fields like Biomedical, Security, Smart cities, etc. are still in development and research stage.In the near future, any device no matter how insignificant it may be connected to the internet.

Every small detail will be stored in huge servers, and this is going to make digital security the next sought after skill.But the flip side is shows anyone who has access to your private cloud can control your whole life if we become too dependent on these. So before we make much advancement in this we need up to strengthen our security and enforce more research into preventing cyber crime.I urge you to watch this anime called",85 followers,Ben Taylor,3.4K,84,1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-scope-and-future-of-the-Internet-of-Things
2,"Short answer (As common and obvious as it may sound):  practice.while effectiveness of a learning techniques vary based on a person's intellect, experience and academic training, one (almost) fool proof technique is practice.  Practice, however, does not just mean following texts , or online guides (which are in abundance on IoT) blindly.1. Ask yourself ""why IoT ?"" :Short answer (As common and obvious as it may sound):  practice.while effectiveness of a learning techniques vary based on a person's intellect, experience and academic training, one (almost) fool proof technique is practice.

3,"Not very much.First off, the Internet of Things is just built on top of the existing Internet. No new architecture. Zero. All that’s happening is that people are putting more computers inside of things that probably shouldn’t have computers and then putting them on the Internet. Do you REALLY need a processor in your fridge? In your toaster? In your stove? How is that a win?Second, remember that the S in IoT is for security.Wait, there’s no S in IoT.Exactly my point. All of the IoT devices that are about to become smart are about to become gigantic security problems.Have you noticed that yourNot very much.First off, the Internet of Things is just built on top of the existing Internet.

All of the IoT devices that are about to become smart are about to become gigantic security problems.Have you noticed that your laptop operating system vendor issues a security update about once a month? And that you have to upgrade and reboot your laptop?Well, guess what, your smart appliances are going to be in the exact same situation. There are going to be tons of security holes that are discovered over time. And are the vendors going to generate updates for their devices? So far, it’s really looking to be Not Good. I have a few smart devices already. I don’t see updates. Are other vendors going to be better about issuing updates and fixing bugs? It seems doubtful.What happens when everyone’s home has a thousand computers in it, all of which have some giant well-known vulnerabilities in them? That’s the distant future that we can foresee. Every house is part of a giant botnet. DDoS attacks with orders of magnitude more bandwidth than today. And we won’t even talk about the increased power consumption.Welcome to my nightmare: the Internet of Insecurity.",UNKNOWN,Amarnath,13.1K,131,2.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-scope-and-future-of-the-Internet-of-Things
