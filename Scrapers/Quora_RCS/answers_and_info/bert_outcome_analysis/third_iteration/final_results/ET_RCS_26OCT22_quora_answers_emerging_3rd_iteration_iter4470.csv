They are used to social distancing constantly! I have to break it up. In fact recently I contemplated a cell phone jail. One very funny line from a show I watched recently was, “You are going to call her? Are you a psycho? We text!”. And that made me wonder if seeing herself on video is intimidating. I actually hate watching myself interact with my doctors, but there I am. It could be a shyness issue related to things going on with her.I know that you asked for answers and I think that communication by voice is really important right now. This is something that has been somewhat of a blessing in my eyes because we are realizing how much we need people! Even if it is just going through a line with a cashier.

1,I think you should discuss this directly with your client. It seems that social distancing and likely the whole Covid-19 situation is having a marked effect on her.

4,"My “knowing"" that I was connected to my therapist came as an epiphany. I was driving home from my therapy appointment when it occurred to me that I was using my therapist for proximity. I would come to therapy every week with some drama or another and she would listen and tell me I was doing OK. It was what I needed to fill the void left by my mother. I realized that she was giving me a sense of self value, something I had never felt before.

So has the air industry and we started trying to implement it globally to allow controllers to type simple things like frequency changes so they wouldn’t have to say them over the radio. We’re almost using it too. Almost. Oh, that capability was initially out when the Star Wars special edition movies came out. Not the prequels, the original 3 remastered with the new CGI. Remember that? Can you even remember that far back? Yeah, the airlines still can’t text message yet so that gives you an idea of how long things take in air terms vs civil computers.So will 6th gen fighters be unmanned? Sure.
