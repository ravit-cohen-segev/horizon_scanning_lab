Because fully devNo.Online you might find many Chinese brag about this:And thisThen they exclaim, that there are more skyscrapers, high speed trains, etc. in China than America, so they are developed.This is not the right definition of ‘developed’You don’t measure a city or country by outer appearance alone. The thing is we have to take a look at the innards of a country to really know whether or not you are truly developed. That Chinese are so obsessed with portraying the facade that they are technologically advanced and ahead is actually an indication that they have not fully developed yet. Because fully developed countries have no need to show off things like that. Everyone knows they are developed.For example, here is San Francisco:Look, not many skyscrapers right? And look at those old cable cars going around! That must mean they are undeveloped right? Nope. Everyone knows San Francisco is a developed city. That’s why it has no need to show off with luxury skyscrapers and such things.Or how about Florence, Italy?Again, no skyscrapers here. But everyone knows it’s a developed city and Italy is a developed country.My point is, you have got to look at the people and the innards of a country to truly know if they are developed.This is the true face of China:You have got to look at the average person. Does the average Chinese have good access to healthcare (which is ranked near the bottom in WHO rankings btw)? Can they drink tap water safely? Do they have access to quality food? Do all have access to electricity or paved roads or a quality education? The answer is: probably, yes, if you are living in the rich east coast provinces of Jiangsu or Zhejiang or Guangdong- but not if you are living in say - Xinjiang or Gansu or Tibet. China’s wealth is not spread equally, neither is it developed equally. Even though the CCP has developed China quite fast - there is still a lot of work to be done making sure *every Chinese* have equal access to everything.And then you got to look at the attitude of the people. When I was in China I found that you really got to look out for who you trust, because there is a lot of scams going on all the time. You never know what is real, what is fake, what is real price of anything. Why do these scams exist? Because people have to be desperate to make money that’s why.Why are people desperate to make money? Probably because they are not making enough to survive, which is an indication that the country is still developing. You’ll notice that in general, the more developed a country is, the less likely there will be scams. In Korea/Japan/Taiwan, you will not find very many scams. In China and Eastern Europe it’s likely.Another aside I want to note is that Chinese bathrooms don’t contain any toilet paper. Do you know the reason why? It’s because people steal it. Now, in what developed country does this happen? I can’t think of any. Only in a developing country would you need to bring your own toilet paper to the bathroom because there isn’t any there due to fear of people stealing it.I find GDP/capita to be generally a pretty good indicator of how developed a country is. The average GDP/capita (PPP) of China is still around $8k/person. While that is higher than most Asian countries - it’s still below the 4 East Asian tigers + Japan and far from the $62k/person that the USA has.The true measure of a developed society is to observe the people that live in the country and not the appearance of the country itself. Chinese “face” culture is the same. You can just obviously see that China has developed really really fast, and mentality wise people are still harping about luxury products and consumerism - this is where Americans were back in the 50s, 60s and 70s, not now.The biggest consumers of luxury products are Chinese people, not Americans or Europeans. The more developed you are, the less need you have to validate your self worth with materialism. The less desire you have to spend thousands of dollars on your children's schooling just to send them to be educated abroad. The less need to travel to countries like Canada or USA for giving birth so that your child becomes a US or Canadian citizen, or to launder your money by buying up real estate in other countries. Developed countries do not need to do things like that.Thats why you should always pay attention to the old adage -Edit:Of course, Chinese commenters love to bring up the USA. Yes, USA has lots of impoverished areas too; every country has developed areas and undeveloped areas, however my point is that for China there is significantly more undeveloped areas at a higher % compared to the USA. The poverty rate for China is 16% as of 2019 and for USA it is 1.5% as of 2019.

3,"Yes. Pakistan can become a developed country, far more developed than India, even when India is far ahead right now. For this Pakistan government has to take some hard decisions and policy changes. There are some short term steps and some long term. Remember that India was near bankrupt in 1991 and today is hugely successful - long way to go still but blooming.(There are some comparisons to India which are inevitable but the comparison is not to demean Pakistan; rather to show the way to emulate.)Cut down on India rhetoric:Yes.

Remember that India was near bankrupt in 1991 and today is hugely successful - long way to go still but blooming.(There are some comparisons to India which are inevitable but the comparison is not to demean Pakistan; rather to show the way to emulate.)Cut down on India rhetoric:Focus on own people:Edit: A rather nasty and abusive comment I received was about happiness. The person quoted World Happiness Index figures and how Pakistan was way ahead than India. He told me to go and build toilets and then f*** myself. My current answer is very sincerely meant. To that misguided person my only answer is that if you are happy with the state of affairs in Pakistan, the state of the economy, the crashing PKR, then what can I say? Be happy and let things run its course.Land Reforms:Education:Women Education:Infrastructure Development:But ports, roads and bridges are not the only infra. Pakistan has to focus on power including renewable sources, irrigation, housing development, development of new cities, etc. India lags here too.Give up on Terror; hug peace:Forget Kashmir. Increase Trade with India:There are a few more options. Not all are simple. Not all may bring immediate benefits but in the long run they will. It is a matter of setting aside the ego.Edit 2 (30-May-2019):The whole thing has been misunderstood. The rhetoric lies in the minds of the Establishment and not general populace (maybe). The survival of the Army Generals depends upon the anti India stance. Let me also explain how India rhetoric, the unbalanced arms race, terror funding, etc., have crippled Pakistan.In 1985, the Per Capita GDP of Pakistan was about 27.7% higher than India’s (Pak US$350 : Ind US$274). Today, the Pakistan per capita GDP is some US$ 1222.50 and forecasted to grow to US$ 1400 in 2020 while India’s PCGDP is US$ 1963.55 and forecasted to grow to US$ 2350 in 2020. India is 60.1% ahead. How did Pakistan lose out by about 88%?Pakistan, while a smaller nation, is a much blessed nation. Almost whole land is fertile, it has a unique geographic advantageous location, it is rich in minerals, its population is lower (but growing at an alarming rate 2.5 times of India), the problems are lower, etc. Smaller nations grow much more than larger nations. The growth rate till 1985 was about 6% and exceeded India’s measly 2.75%.It was around this time (1985) that Pakistan started funding terrorism against India and started the Kashmiri insurgency heavily. They also started heavy military purchases including the F-16s. Pakistan's general thought that we won the war in Afghanistan by attrition. We can do the same to India. The US was funding Pakistan to fight against Afghans. Some of the heavy funding was to take care of the huge Afghan refugees. But a lot of these funds were misused and ended in terror funding or the corrupt. Pakistan still had to shelter the refugees. The money came from the exchequer.This is what I mean by India rhetoric and it is deeply coupled with Kashmir.People have also questioned on terror and how IK is sincere and wanting to talk and Modi isn't. There are reasons for this. Why did the bus to Lahore in 1999 end up in Kargil? The Kashmir problem was almost solved at that time. Who helped the attack on J&K assembly and later the Indian Parliament? Who sent terrorists to Mumbai on 26/11/2008? Modi invited Nawaz Sharif and he gracefully agreed. Yet pretty soon there were Uri, Pathankot incidents and later Pulwama. Pakistan can’t honestly say that they were ‘freedom fighters’ fighting alone. JeM have taken responsibility of these events. Pakistan can’t hide behind excuses such as ‘give us the proofs’. Where do all these people get the training and logistics support? How is 240+ kg of RDX, detonators, timing devices obtained and where does the training to assemble it come from?Pakistan is always in denial mode. They denied whereabouts of Osama Bin Laden. What happened exactly?All this not only creates mistrust but that logistics support to “freedom fighters” is costing huge amount of money. The army/ISI can’t provide their own arms to the terrorists; they provide funds. The terrorists buy their arms and ammunition from global arms dealers at open market (much higher) price. Hence they require more money - the same money that could be used to build better roads, dams, canals, higher educational institutes, etc.Just a fortnight ago, Pakistan got some $6 billion from IMF and the first result was deep PKR devaluation. What is $6 billion? It is loose change for tea/coffee. A similar sum was spent by Laxmi Mittal to purchase the bankrupt Essar Steel of India. And yet, this money was direly needed. It has come with deep consequences. We went thru same crisis in 1991 and I know what happened. How long will this money last. Without fresh global investments, Pakistan will have to back to IMF in a year. The world views Pakistan as an unsafe place. Reality may be different but perceptions matter.Just imagine ... if peace accord had been signed in 1999. The Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline would have been complete - bringing huge revenues for Pakistan. A road transit would have been created from New Delhi to Central Asia bringing customs duty, cess and road tolls to Pakistan. These two would have earned more than $6b per annum. This is the benefit of bilateral trade.I have told to forget Kashmir and India. Cut down on (useless) defence spending.I could go on. My answer and advice is to take good things.

Indians proudly describe their country as the world's largest democracy, and rightly so. Corruption remains a big problem in India, but it seems to be on the wane, and I think we can expect great things from there over the next century.From its film production business to its software companies and military might, India is shaping up to become a major influencer on the world stage.

Let's take my country SENEGAL (not banned by M. Trump) where more than 92% of the population is Muslim and the rest Christian. It's one of the few countries in Africa where there is stability and democracy since our independence in 1960. Keep in mind that the FIRST PRESIDENT OF THE COUNTRY IN 1960 was CHRISTIAN (Leopold Sedar SENGHOR) reelected during 20 years and it's still the most loved among our presidents.I know it can be difficult to imagine, in 1960, a country mostly Muslim to elect a Christian president but Senegalese people don't give a damn about that kind of thing. Christmas and Easter are celebrated by everyone and foreigners are always surprised by the euphoria going on in December. During the All Saints' Day (Toussaint in French), Muslims clean Christian cemeteries (the picture below); in fact in many families, you'll find the two religions.I always like the celebrations for Eid al-Adha (Tabaski) and Easter in my country because in the first one, many Christians families buy sheep like Muslims and in the second, the Christians cook a special meal called ""Ngalakh"" for all the Muslims families in their neighborhood.Despite the fact that Senegal is mostly inhabited by Muslims, the country is lay and if you think about women's rights or liberty of speech, you won't have to worry there. Actually, sometimes, the girls are more modern in their style than many Europeans. We think that people should have the right to live their life like they want. Some girls (the majority) are more into the classic Scarlett Johansson, Kerry Washington, Anne Hathaway style, some others (specially young girls) will go with the sexy Beyonce or Nicki Minaj style, some others with the traditional Senegalese African style and others girls (a few) prefer casual or modern outfits with a hijab on their head (I have noticed that many girls use the hijab like a fashion thing actually like some Indonesians girls do).Some girls having fun!This woman, Viviane Ndour, is one of the greatest Senegalese singer!Beautiful Africa!Nice hijab!Dakar, capital of Senegal, is one of the hottest cities to go out in Africa with plenty of night clubs, pool parties, students parties, romantic restaurants, etc.",3 followers,Rahul Sharma,2.8K,1.1K,49.2M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Why-have-some-developing-countries-been-very-successful-in-adapting-and-adopting-advanced-technologies-and-other-countries-complete-failures

But realistically speaking, it is hard to envision this leading to a more advanced final fighter than the above.If I recall the canon correctly, the TIEs ion engines are brand new technology and pound for pound significantly superior in performance to the engines in the first iteration of the X-wing.The X-wing was an evolutionary incremental improvement on the proven technology of the Clone Wars, while TIE was a revolutionary break from the old, intended to be used with an entirely new doctrine.While an X-wing was marginally superior to a TIE one on one and could do a lot more, the TIE was deliberately designed for a more limited role and to be cheaper. A squadron of two TIE fighters and one TIE bomber can accomplish everything an X-wing can tactically, still cost a little less, AND crush that single X-wing in direct combat, given equivalent piloting skill.Now, it does turn out that the revolution in doctrine behind the TIE design turned out to be wrongheaded, and the battle-proven doctrine to which the X-wing was designed proved to be superior, but that has nothing to do with the actual technology of the two platforms.When you take the TIE technology and apply it to the same design doctrine as the X-wing, you get a TIE Defender, which wipes the floor with X-wings.","2,425 followers",Yauming,895,3.9K,14.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-have-some-developing-countries-been-very-successful-in-adapting-and-adopting-advanced-technologies-and-other-countries-complete-failures

Republic naval doctrine in the Clone Wars was fighter-based, with armed carriers operating in support of the fighters. Separatist naval doctrine was the opposite, with carrier-based fighters operating in support of cruisers and battleships. The X-wing has a hyperdrive, it has long-range sensors, it has a torpedo complement only slightly inferior to that of a Clone Wars-era light bomber; it does everything but make julienne fries. It’s the sort of starfighter you would design if you expected starfighters to do most of your fighting, especially against a near-peer opponent where long-range striking capability that doesn’t commit your capital ships to danger (and ferry duty) might be important.The TIE fighter, on the other hand, seems designedNot only that, the X-wing seems like a very conservative design in other ways. It has four engines but is no faster than a TIE fighter. It relies on maneuvering thrusters to maneuver, rather than its main engines. This suggests to me a slightly lower-tech approach than the TIE.There isn’t a lot of hard data to go on at all. I expect that if we ever get a real answer it will basically be that their technology is essentially of equivalent level.

Sure Lucas came up with the story but it was left to others to fill in the blanks.When war began, the Imperial Japanese military forces seemed invincible.The Imperial Japanese Navy’s main carrier fighter plane, the A6M2 Zero was very agile, had a superb climb rate, and had long range. In the hands of its elite pilots, it could fly rings around the US counterparts (in 1941, ie. the Wildcat, Buffalo, and P40). US pilots were advised to avoid dogfights with them.Does that look strangely familiar to you?The problem with the A6M Zero fighter plane was its performance was achieved at the expense of armor. It lacked self-sealing fuel tanks. It lacked armor plating that was standard in Allied fighters. The small engine that the Zero fighter had did not enable it the luxury of having both.The Japanese idea was that speed and its maneuverability was its “armor”. It would use its maneuverability to avoid the enemy’s bullets. In the hands of a skilled pilot, this was possible (most of the time).The Japanese also didn’t place high priority on its pilots’ safety. Their military philosophy was that it was glorious to die for their Emperor. Everything was committed to attack, very little was given over to defense. This thinking permeated their entire force. It enabled them to achieve great feat of arms but they were vulnerable to the enemy’s counter attack.At the start of WW2 they had a highly trained and experienced cadre of pilots. By 1944, they were down to novices. And eventually resorted to kamikaze tactics, and attempted to overwhelm the American and British naval defenses through mass air assaults.Sounds familiar?The Japanese fighter plane engine wasn’t as large as the American fighters. So the Japanese designers decided to forgo self-sealing fuel tanks, armor plating, etc.. so that their plane could fly faster and be more maneuverable.But yeah without shields… I mean armor protection… the A6M Zero had a tendency to blow up if it got hit.Later on the Japanese tried to put armor protection onto the Zero but its small air frame and small engine made that too impractical. Sounds familiar?One good look at the TIE-fighter (Twin ION Engine fighter) and you’ll realize that its too small to accommodate much more than a pilot, lasers, and its TIE engine. They didn’t even bother with a pressurized cockpit. TIE pilots had to wear space suits into battle. The small TIE powerplant and air frame was too small to power or hold much else.Like the A6M2, the Tie fighter was designed to be nimble and fast (and should have been) easy to mass produce. (Although I hasten to add that the A6M due to Japan’s poor WW2 manufacturing capabilities was not able to mass produce as effectively as America.)Same thing.If you’re wondering about the specs for the A6M2 - check it out here.Mitsubishi A6M Zero - WikipediaYou could say that the X-wing was like the P-38 Lightning, bigger, complex, powerful, more heavily armed.But their adversary the A6M2 (like the TIE-fighter) being lighter was more nimble and could outturn them at low speeds.For more info click here:The Complete Conceptual History of the Millennium Falcon",1 follower,Eric Lowe,560,4.1K,37.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-have-some-developing-countries-been-very-successful-in-adapting-and-adopting-advanced-technologies-and-other-countries-complete-failures
