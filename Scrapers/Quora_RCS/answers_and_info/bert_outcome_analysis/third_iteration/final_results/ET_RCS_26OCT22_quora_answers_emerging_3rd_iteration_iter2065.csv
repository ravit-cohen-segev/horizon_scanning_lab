1,"Nanotechnology, but in a really cool way.You remember the microbots in Big Hero 6, right? Well, unfortunately, those microbots are impossible, but there is a similar technology that’s being developed in real life.The idea is to build tiny replicators that can create more of themselves, like a sort of super bacteria that never stops replicating. Such a technology would be“…the first replicator assembles a copy in one thousand seconds, the two replicators then build two more in the next thousand seconds, the four build another four . . in less than two days, theyNanotechnology, but in a really cool way.You remember the microbots in Big Hero 6, right?

Such a technology would be“…the first replicator assembles a copy in one thousand seconds, the two replicators then build two more in the next thousand seconds, the four build another four . . in less than two days, they would outweigh the Earth; in another four hours, they would exceed the mass of the Sun and all the planets combined …”Of course, self-replicators require materials, so they aren’t going to spread through space or anything. But they would have an abundance of material on Earth, especially of carbon, which would likely be the building blocks of such an assemblers. If you were carrying a jar of them and tripped and they spilled out, and they had no limit, they would quickly devour the entire earth with no way of stopping them.But here is where things get interesting: These tiny robots would have the ability to construct molecules from atoms, giving them the ability to produce amazing materials like graphene, cubes of apple, and even brain material.With advanced nanotechnology in the form of self-replicators, the entire world would experience a revolution. Think for a second about what wouldn’t change in the face of machines that can produceProduction jobs would cease. The price of every item ever created would be lowered massively. Supercomputers and experiments regarding brain material would become almost commonplace. Terraforming other planets would take years if not months. And all of this is actuallyThere is a lot of power contained within those tiny machines.","58,988 followers",Michael Wolfe,504,2K,17.3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-latest-technology-in-the-mobile-of-the-upcoming-generation
2,"Automation. Automation is going to become practical at much lower costs & much greater complexity than it currently exists in industry, where it’s mainly limited to purpose-built assembly lines because those are the places it currently makes economic sense.Probably the first big field to be affected this decade will be driving. Most people focus on personal vehicles, but I think logistics companies buying autonomous trucks is going to be a game-changer (& something most commentators overlooked when Tesla announced its semi-truck). Truck Driver is an incredibly common job in a lot of countries:Automation.

Most people focus on personal vehicles, but I think logistics companies buying autonomous trucks is going to be a game-changer (& something most commentators overlooked when Tesla announced its semi-truck). Truck Driver is an incredibly common job in a lot of countries:Logistics companies regularly invest in new vehicles, & those vehicles mainly drive along highways from one depot to another depot, so they have to handle a much smaller set of possible conditions, plus the vehicles will pay for themselves pretty quickly if they don’t have drivers who need a) rest & b) wages.Delivery drivers, taxi drivers, bus drivers; they’ll all be replaced soon afterwards too. Uber, DiDi & Tesla are all developing plans for fleets of autonomous taxis, for example. I imagine it’ll become fairly common for people to buy a second autonomous vehicle just to deploy it as a vehicle in an autonomous taxi service like Uber, so the car can be off earning a second wage for you 24/7 while you get on with your life. I also suspect that long-term Tesla will become a company which makes self-driving tech & batteries for other manufacturers, & their car line will become a side-gig.AThis is going to put countries in a tricky position - either they introduce a universal basic income & possibly shorter working weeks, paid for by increased taxation of the companies enjoying greater profits due to automation, or else countless millions of people (in increasingly middle-class jobs too) will become unemployed & have no way to support themselves. The Automation Revolution is likely to impact society as significantly as The Industrial Revolution, only considerably faster.This is not a far-off scenario. Recent Teslas have the tech to self-drive already built in. As soon as a region approves autonomous vehicles, Tesla will push out an update overnight & enable the feature. Lots of places are cautiously jockeying to be first to pass autonomous vehicle legislation. As soon as one place does it & we can all see that it works, the floodgates will open. I’d be surprised if autonomous vehicles haven’t been approved for public use s",89 followers,Anish Ambavat,3.7K,61,216K,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-latest-technology-in-the-mobile-of-the-upcoming-generation
