This radiation precisely matched calculations of what the radiation from the Big Bang would look like.You can even see it yourself. Get an old CRT television and tune it to a blank station. About a third of the static is remnants of the Big Bang. The rest is from local sources.So, we know there was a Big Bang because we can still see its results.","46,118 followers",Steven Haddock,1.6K,25.6K,343.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Will-there-be-once-so-advanced-technology-to-prove-that-the-Big-Bang-n-ever-happened

10,"Though China has made impressive progress in exploiting several applications, claims being made in some international media that China will be the world leader in these technologies in a few years, are exaggerated and premature.

In AI,Though China has made impressive progress in exploiting several applications, claims being made in some international media that China will be the world leader in these technologies in a few years, are exaggerated and premature. Large Chinese investments have not always translated into technological successes. However, India has to take note of China’s achievements in critical technologies given our adversarial strategic relationship.China has made an early start in setting up the 5G infrastructure and decided to roll out this technology from 2020, the second country after South Korea. In AI, China has progressed in facial and image recognition, manufacturing drones and robots; on the military side, China is researching air, land, sea and undersea autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles which can assist in reconnaissance and attacks on enemy aircraft and vessels. China’s army is trying to use advances in quantum radar and sensing to gain advantages in stealth technology. Its navy is trying to develop a quantum compass for its submarines which would not require satellite based navigation.In semiconductors and microchips the Chinese story has, so far, been more of failures than successes. Since the 1990s, it has made numerous efforts to design and fabricate its own chips investing billions of dollars in several companies but mostly not succeeded. China imports about 80% of its microchip requirement; in 2017, it spent $260 billion on imports of semiconductors and chips, more than its imports of crude oil. China is aggressively continuing with its chip making efforts trying to acquire foreign technologies through outright purchase, joint venture, stealth and local innovation; it is believed that China will take about 20 years to reach the current levels of chip specialisation in the West.In AI, lot of credit for China’s successes goes to American and other non-Chinese researchers and companies. According to a Tsinghua University study, more than half of China’s AI papers were international joint publications. All the software development of Chinese drone maker DJI is performed at DJI’s American office. China’s strength is mainly in AI applications and it is still weak in core technologies of AI, such as hardware and algorithm development.In quantum computing also, many problems remain unresolved such as mastering materials use, quantum chip design and manufacturing; also the development of a functional quantum computer remains several years away. From here on, progress in these technologies will be slowed down by a number of factors. The US has started denying access to leading Chinese companies in its market, imposed restraints on Chinese students studying robotics, aerospace, semiconductors and quantum computing in US universities, and is urging its allies and friends not to allow Chinese companies in their countries for national security reasons.However, compared to India, China has made considerable progress in developing several applications of these technologies which will impinge on our economy, defence and foreign policy. India will have to live with a much stronger and aggressive China whose economy is already five times bigger than ours.Its military will become even more challenging with new weapons in cyber warfare, missiles, drone and robot technologies, space, stealth and quantum technology based platforms. India’s investments and research programmes in these technologies are presently at an incipient stage, very far behind those of China. Our political leadership, defence establishment, scientific and academic institutions, and industry have to work together and craft a suitable strategy to jointly develop select applications at an accelerated pace, to defend our critical interests.If we lag behind too much, it will lead to further erosion of India’s economic and military standing and marginalisation of India’s position in the regional and global power matrix.Hope you like Article.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,12.7K,996,156M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Will-there-be-once-so-advanced-technology-to-prove-that-the-Big-Bang-n-ever-happened

Our team at Grammarly has compiled a handy list of common grammatical errors to help make your writing accurate, clear, and professional.Ambiguous (“Squinting”) modifiersA squinting modifier is a misplaced modifier that, because of its location in a sentence, could modify either the phrase that precedes it or the one that follows it. In the example sentence, is the subject listening to music slowly or slowly getting a headache? To correct a squinting modifier, move its position in the sentence to clarify to the reader which word you intend to modify.Misuse of lie/layIf you plan to place or put an object somewhere, such as a plate on a table, you should use “lay.” If you intend to stretch out on a bed for a nap, you should use “lie.” The verb “lie” is an intransitive verb, which means it does not need an object. The transitive verb “lay” requires an object.It may take some getting used to this “lay” or “lie” business; after all, misuse of these verbs is common. But if you remember to lay down your fork before you’re full, then you won’t have to lie down later from overeating.Comma splicesHe was very hungry, so he ate a whole pizza.To splice means to connect or join. When a writer joins two independent sentences with a comma instead of separating them with a period or coordinating conjunction, that’s a comma splice.The comma has its jobs to do, but connecting two independent sentences isn’t one of them. Besides, the period gets testy when his sister, the comma, steals his thunder. Periods have their jobs, and so do commas, but never the twain shall meet—unless it’s in the form of a semicolon. Semicolons can also take the place of a coordinating conjunction, such as “and,” “but,” or “so,” among others.Run-on sentencesRun-on sentences, also known as fused sentences, occur when two complete sentences are squashed together without using a coordinating conjunction or proper punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon. Run-on sentences can be short or long. A long sentence isn’t necessarily a run-on sentence.To avoid run-on sentences, see if there is more than one idea communicated by two or more independent clauses. In our examples, there are two complete sentences:Example:Example:Both sentences are complete ideas by themselves; therefore, use a semicolon or a period to indicate that they are separate independent clauses.Using “could of” instead of “could have”“Could have” is always correct; “could of” never is. Writers probably make this grammar gaffe because, when we speak, the contraction “could’ve” sounds an awful lot like “could of.”TautologiesTautologies express the same thing twice with different words. In our example, the word “made” implies that Jack used his own two hands to create the pail. The prepositional phrase “with his own hands” creates a redundancy. Once you know what they are, it’s fun to discover tautologies: dilapidated ruins, close proximity, added bonus, large crowd...The list goes on and on!After reading through this list of common grammatical mistakes, you might be wondering how to remember all these rules as you write.
