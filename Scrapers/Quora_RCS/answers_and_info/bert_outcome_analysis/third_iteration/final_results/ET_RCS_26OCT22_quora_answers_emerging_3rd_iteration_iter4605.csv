Teachers at preschools and elementary schools will gladly seize on opportunities to inculcate certain types of behavior; amongst which is patience.It should be noted that, “patience”, has a number of different meanings depending on context.","46,118 followers",Steven Haddock,919,25.6K,343.4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-encourage-Japanese-high-school-students-to-be-less-resistant-to-technology-We-have-an-app-that-allows-them-to-learn-languages-but-they-are-resistant-to-using-it-and-they-are-uncomfortable-thus-there-is

2,"“Successful” can mean many things to different people.My vote is for the General Dynamics F-16 (now Lockheed).Successful because 1) it set a new bar for aerodynamic performance, an order of magnitude beyond other jet aircraft at the time, and 2) it enjoyed broad popularity, continual upgrades, and remains the gold standard by which all modern aircraft are judged (“Is it as good as the F-16?”)It’s hard to capture how dramatic the aerodynamic improvements were for the YF-16 (and YF-17).

And then not only did the USAF buy thousands, but so did dozens of other countries. Huge success. And continual upgrades have kept the F-16 competitive. So yeah…successful.F-16 vs F-4 max performance turn. I once saw this performed live.

And it makes sense why. If you’re in the horrible situation where you know there’s a missile coming after you, you have seconds to get it to break lock. To do that, you really need to get that missile chasing something else.So, our tactics are to spit out some expendables and pull like the dickens. The idea is to give the missile a nice, big, shiny object to target and then get the hell out of the way so it doesn’t see you anymore. It’d be more efficient to pump out only those expendables that will affect the missile (flares for IR guided, chaff for RADAR guided, and some others), but we usually just tell the weapons system to release a program that is optimized to the threats in the area. We can plan that on the ground and upload the optimal program of expendables.Think of it like this…the missile being shot at you is really being steered toward a cube in the sky that is defined by the missile’s characteristics. Some cubes are small, others are bigger. The goal is to drop some shiny objects into that cube and then get the hell out of that cube. High maneuverability helps the pilot get the plane outside of that cube. It’s still a 50/50 shot, but that’s worlds better than certain defeat.","18,029 followers",John Chesire,867,5.2K,67.5M,2022,https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-encourage-Japanese-high-school-students-to-be-less-resistant-to-technology-We-have-an-app-that-allows-them-to-learn-languages-but-they-are-resistant-to-using-it-and-they-are-uncomfortable-thus-there-is

Image courtesy ofThe hunchbacked Yak-7, that was where the instructor pilot was going to sit. For literally inexplicable reasons it was faster than the Yak-1.Also, good look recognizing Yak-1b vs. Yak-7b vs Yak-9, this is the Yak-1b.And the Yak-7b.And the early Yak-9. Yes the last three are completely different aircraft, and at one point all three were in production simultaneously as the Yak-9 production came online. All Yak profiles above courtesy ofThe next improved version was theThe Yak-9 and its variants were the primary Yak aircraft with the VVS from 1943 onwardAnd that’s in fact the recognition method the Luftwaffe used, and in late 1944 they issued orders that prohibited combat with Yak fighters lacking oil coolers under 15,000 ft/4500m. The Yak-3 was a full 30mph/48kph faster than the Yak-9, and that’s more than enough to ruin the day of someone used to fighting Yak-9s.TheThe way they managed that performance improvement was reducing weight through the shrinking of the airframe of a Yak-1bThe Yak-3 aka Yak-1M.After this design miniaturization, takeoff weight of the Yak-3 was 500kg less than that of the Yak-9, and the only downside was that the Yak-3 ended up with slightly higher wing loading. That primarily affected the landing speed, as the weight reduction program more than compensated for the increase in wing loading, and all reports I’ve read say it was not only faster but it had a much better roll rate than the Yak-9 and could outturn its bigger brother. Wait strike that, one more downside, because of the reduced size the Yak-3 could not carry as much fuel as the -9 and therefore had a shorter range.This is a Yak-3 of the French Normandie-Niemen Squadron serving in the Soviet VVS, note the blue/white/red of the French flag on the spinner. Somehow the Yak-3 looks not only willing but fully capable of going out and kicking Nazi ass. And that’s pretty much what it did. Image courtesy aviationgraphic.com:Ivan! Point me at the 109s and FWs! Image courtesy of Pavel Vanka, CC by NC 3.0Anyway, they then kept the Yak-3 AND various variants of the Yak-9 (-9D, -9DD, -9U, -9T, etc.) in production to the end of the warAnd finally the Yak-3 had a pilot’s favorite armament arrangement with all guns on the nose, with two 12.7mm MGs and one 20mm Shvak cannon, that’s essentially the same armament as the 109 G series. Pilots, at least ones who could shoot, always preferred nose-mounted armament if for no other reason that it meant that the closer you get, the more bullets hit. With wing-mounted armament harmonized to 250 yards, if you get close and shoot there’s a good chance 50% of the rounds are missing even when the pipper is right on the bad guy.","2,072 followers",Che Tianyi,603,111,6.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-fighter-aircraft-in-this-day-and-age-still-focus-on-maneuverability-I-understand-that-fighter-engagements-nowadays-take-place-at-very-long-ranges-and-missiles-technology-is-now-well-developed-and-reliable

Additionally, the fact that they can be launched from the back of trucks- giving them mobility- makes them far more survivable on the modern battlefield than fighter jets, which spend most of their time at fixed, known bases. Truck mounted missiles can hide in caves, mines, warehouses or under bridges, only to pop out for a few minutes and launch their payload. These missiles can perform many of the same missions as fighter jets, without risking the loss of human life or expensive equipment.Currently these missiles need assistance spotting targets, nevertheless as AI becomes more mature they should be able to autonomously identify targets. Nevertheless, there is a strong chance that there will be treaties in the future that place restrictions on the use of AI for missile targeting.
