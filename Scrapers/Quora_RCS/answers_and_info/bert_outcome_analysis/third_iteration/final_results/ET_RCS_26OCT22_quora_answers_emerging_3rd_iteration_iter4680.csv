2,"In a corporation there's a concept of limited liability.All of the corporation's assets and liabilities must be kept seperate from those of the owners (and anyone else). Think of the owner as a person: it owns its own stuff, files its own taxes, has its own bank accounts and loans, etc. Except looking at the big picture, the owners still have a residual claim in those underlying assets and liabilities.

They determine the share price (for a publicly traded company) and in the event of a liquidation, those owners have a claim on the proceeds.Ultimately, the distinction between corporation assets and personal assets is there to protect the investor. While they don't directly own the corporation's assets, they are also not responsible for the corporation's liabilities. If the corporation gets sued or goes bankrupt or owes massive debts, all of the owner's personal assets are protected. The only thing the owner can lose is their investment in the corporation.This can be very beneficial, especially for entrepreneurs and small business owners. It allows them to start or invest in a startup while also limiting their risk. They can still lose whatever they invest if the business doesn't work out, but they can't lose their house or car or other personal assets when the debt collectors come calling.","135,533 followers",Hector Quintanilla,1.4K,1.2K,88.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-digital-store
