3,"1. Wind PowerHuge strides have been made over the past 20 years to harvest the power of wind. Progress is bred from necessity, of course, as growing global concerns about global warming and ecological damage caused by pollution call for cleaner, sustainable energy.2. Solar EnergyMuch like wind energy, solar energy has seen an increase in efficiency and a decrease in price in recent years, making solar power a $3-billion industry.

Progress is bred from necessity, of course, as growing global concerns about global warming and ecological damage caused by pollution call for cleaner, sustainable energy.2. Solar EnergyMuch like wind energy, solar energy has seen an increase in efficiency and a decrease in price in recent years, making solar power a $3-billion industry. New legislation and regulations which make it affordable for businesses and homeowners to convert to solar are responsible for solar energy’s growth over the past 5 years, and 2016 will be no different.While only a third of the solar energy available in the US is currently harnessed in the west, this area is geographically superior for solar power generation, and improved government incentives in California indicate this will be the fastest-growing market.3. 3D PrintingThe new millennium has brought us some mind-blowing technology, but none has more potential for impacting the entire world quite like 3D printing.If you’re not familiar with the concept, 3D printers are loaded with additives which can be used like ink to create 3-dimensional objects. That’s4. Legal MarijuanaLegal marijuana sales have grown exponentially since 2012, when Colorado legalized the drug and created the world’s first fully regulated market for recreational marijuana use. In addition to selling the raw plant, it is also being sold as concentrates, edibles, and even beauty products in order to expand the market.Marijuana sales are expected to surpass $20 billion between now and 2020, and that’s if the market stays its course. If other states legalize recreational marijuana use in that time, the industry could experience even greater success.5. Video GamesOver the years, video game developers have been expanding their appeal to reach new markets, including adults and females. This effort has been paid back many times, as the video game industry commands healthy growth year after year. Consumer confidence continues to improve, and there is speculative excitement regarding new virtual reality (VR) technology.While VR will certainly have an effect on the gaming industry, it also has potential in other markets. Whether or not other industries will adopt VR for practical purposes, such as training medical professionals, remains to be seen.6. Artificial IntelligenceFor having come so far, artificial intelligence still has a long way to go. With hopes that AI will one day be able to help solve humanity’s most pressing concerns, billions of dollars fund the research of artificial intelligence every year. Major players include IT companies like Google and Apple, who are already leaders in the field, providing us with such AI amenities as voice-recognition software and self-driving cars.Experts expect the global demand for “smart” machines will increase 20% every year until at least 2020.7. Sustainable Construction MaterialsIn the wake of an international recession, many countries, including the United States, are creating an initiative to boost construction jobs. There are plenty of post-industrial sites around the developed world which need to be rebuilt, and much like the call for sustainable energy sources, governments and consumers alike are calling for greener building materials.Green construction is currently a $36-billion industry, and it is expected to grow an additional 10% by 2020.This industry depends heavily on consumer demand, and may have an even greater outlook with increased government regulations and successful marketing.8. Cyber Fraud DetectionWhere there’s an opportunity to make a quick buck, be sure that there are criminals out there concocting a plan. The trend of doing business and keeping sensitive information on computers will increase, and so will the demand for protection against cyber criminals.Businesses and individuals alike will require protection from cyber fraud for the foreseeable future, but in the next 5 years, this industry is expected to grow over 12% annually.9. DronesDrone technology is new, but the potential for application in a variety of other industries including agriculture, the military, and parcel delivery have already caught the attention of investors. This creates an excellent opportunity in the market to expand research and development of drones, making them more viable with each in iteration. With a projected annual growth of almost 17% annually until 2022, very little is likely to stifle the growth of this industry.10. SiliconRelated to the demand for solar panels, silicon has also been a slowly but steadily growing market in the past decades. In addition to solar panels, silicon is also required to make electronics and building materials, which you may notice are also on this list. For this reason, experts expect to see silicon’s demand increase in the coming years as other industries take hold.These 10 industries show tremendous potential in 2016 and beyond, indicating a future of environmental consciousness and an even greater focus on electronics and AI.",586 followers,Goran Poleksic,1.8K,158,1.4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-emerging-technologies-are-likely-to-be-mainstream-within-the-next-ten-years

15,"The orbital tether and the mass driver.The orbital tether is a proposed system for launching payloads into orbit, in which a heavy mass (either launched from the earth in pieces, or a small asteroid captured and towed into earth orbit) has a long tether (possibly several miles) attached to it and set spinning in the vertical axis.

In this way the end of the tether will drop into the upper atmosphere at the lowest part of its swing.What would happen then is that a small rocket, designet to reach space but not actually get into orbit (not unlike blue origins rocket in that regard) would launch at such at time that it would be able to intercept the end of the tether at the bottom of its swing and “hook on”. The kinetic energy of the large mass would then be transferred to the launch vehicle throught he tether a bit like a trapeze artist giving an acrobat and “alley oop!” and boosting it into a higher orbit.The wonderful thing about the orbital tether is that, unlike a lot of cool space tech (particle fountains, space elevators etc) its feasible to build it with existing technology, no fundamental advances in materials or anything are required. Although it would cost a metric f**k tonne of money to build (that’s a scientific term, by the way) one it was built, the cost of launching would be very low, so I personally consider it key to the expansion of space travel.The mass driver is a bit like a mag lev train, it propels a vehicle along rails (without touching) and reaches escape velocity, but by accelerating over a very long distance (tens or hundreds of miles) keeps the forces to a bearable amount. In order to combat aerodynamic drag, the rail is inside a long tunnel made up of sections which are kept under vacuum, and would open and close sequentially as the vehicle passes through. At the end , the tunnel would curve upward (not necessarily vertially but probably 30 to 45 degrees) and reach as high an altitude as possible, for this reason the trunnel might be built along the slope of a high mountain. This is to put the launch vehicle above as much of the earth’s atmosphere as possible to minimise drag. Like the tether, this would cost an enormous amount up front but in theory would make space launches very cheap, but unlike the tether, depends on some fundamental advances in superconducting materials to mage the mag lev feasible.Combined (with the mass driver accelerating a launch vehicle up to an altitude to hook on to the orbital tether), these technologies could mean space launches become a daily occurance like catching a train.",UNKNOWN,Ernest W.
