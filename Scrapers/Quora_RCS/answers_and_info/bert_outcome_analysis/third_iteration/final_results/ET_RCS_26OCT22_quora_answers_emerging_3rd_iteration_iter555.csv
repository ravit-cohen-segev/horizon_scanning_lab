4,"IQ tests purport to measure intelligence, not actuate it. Modestly accurate, at best.Intelligence and motivation in a certain direction are not the same.Most often revolutionizing anything just takes methodical, persistent pursuit of a solution to a problem you have focused on, with the ability to push through the many failures along the way.

I’ve read a small library of complicated, esoteric books many of which I think I actually understood pretty well. So, it seems like I’m pretty smart, right? But wait…I’m not very good at standardized tests, at least not as good as you might think. I have a very bad sense of direction and have literally, no joke, gotten lost driving around the block of my house. I frequently have to wash my hair two or three times in the shower, because I can’t remember if I’ve already washed it. Sometimes I wake-up in the middle of the night and panic, because I can’t remember if I remembered to pick my kids up from swim lessons, church, etc. that evening. I waste twenty to thirty minutes, every day, EVERY DAY, looking for things I’ve misplaced, e.g. my glasses, car keys, wallet, cell phone, etc.I don’t actually think I’m that smart at all. I’m not really even sure what it means to be smart except that I’m pretty sure it doesn’t have much to do with knowing which word doesn’t fit in this group of words, which number is next in this series or any of the other asinine questions on standardized tests that I can’t even force myself to care about. I've known many people who are really good at those sorts of tests that were nonetheless morons.Nor does being smart seem to me to have much to do with making a lot of money. I took a couple of business courses as an undergrad. They were so boring I wanted to shoot myself. Nor is it is figuring out how to make a better app for people to watch more porn (seriously, isn’t already too much porn?) like they do at Apple, Google, MIT, or wherever else they’re doing STEM, whatever exactly that means.Most people I talk to seem like idiots to me, even and especially other people with Ph.Ds, which I talk to frequently. Consequently, the only thing I know is that I’m sort of an idiot, but that most everybody else seems to me a much bigger idiot.",496 followers,Tau Chang,24.5K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-would-be-the-top-5-UX-UI-technologies-that-would-effect-industries-in-future

I shrugged,“Big deal.” I was an English Major andThe poem was subtle, strangely wise for a 16 year old, and original; beyond anything I’d seen from my college peers. I had to remind myself that a sophomore in high school wrote it. He was also a “mathlete,” meaning he participated in math competitions and mentored fellow students. And then it got better: My dad admitted that this student’s understanding of math surpassed his own.“Come on!” I screamed.“He’s already tested my limits in calculus.”I couldn’t comprehend how this recent post-adolescent had exquisite taste in poetry, which struck a chord in me,As if that weren’t enough, he was an exceptional pianist, and remains one of the most memorable students from his school.He is an excellent example of one way we can define intelligence: the ability to use all areas of the brain.*Edit*I couldn’t find his poem, but I did find him. He’s a PhD candidate for one of the leading research institutes in the US, performing experiments on things I can’t pronounce. I won’t reveal what he’s researching because anyone can merely google “PhD” with his area of expertise to find him, which violates his privacy.","135,499 followers",Hector Quintanilla,11.6K,1.2K,88.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-IQ-somehow-determines-intelligence-why-are-people-on-the-top-1-not-revolutionizing-science-or-technology
