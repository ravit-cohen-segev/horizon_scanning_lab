Right Now, AI is the biggest topic of discussion in the technology world.A machine with the ability to perform cognitive functions such as Prediction, classification, clustering, reinforcement learning is deemed to hold artificial intelligence.Artificial intelligence exists when a machine has a cognitive ability. The benchmark for AI is the human level concerning reasoning, speech, and vision.There are so many emerging technologies in the technology world but one specific technology I like is “Artificial Intelligence”.

Obviously, the hardware isn’t enough at the moment and needs to be revamped which could probably take a few years.The idea I am trying to put forth or currently going around in people working in the AR/VR sector.Interactive environment.Imagine while commuting to work you are taking your virtual dog out for a walk and no one without a smart glass can see it. To some you will look like an idiot but to others who are on smart glasses they can see what you are doing.Another scenario, you are in bad mood today so you play god and turn on the devil filter on your glasses which picks every thing that you see and changes it to a fire blazing wall inMaybe you are in a good mood, so you apply the happy filter. boom! All walls that you see are now colourful and cloudy. Or maybe you like The Simpsons so your whole world is masked like the Simpson. This is you below taking a walk in a creek, and you see wait! what? Lisa? no its some one your AR glasses just masked as Lisa.This never stops,ARSources: Images from Google.The Future of Augmented Reality",0 followers,Lucas Martin,522,65,4.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-next-technology-trends

3,"The most obvious answer to this question is MLED or Micro LED which is basically OLED but with the individual LED that form its pixels being made of inorganic material (like gallium (Ga), aluminum (Al), indium etc) instead of the organic material found in OLED (which as the name suggested, stood for Organic LED.)It is actually a logical step, polymer-based organic LED used in OLED was a much older technology compared to our modern ones which were often made from semiconductors using inorganic materials.

And just like the modern lightbulbs we have been using, inorganic LEDs promised a much higher brightness, better energy efficiency and even lower the risk of burn-in which is caused by the degradation of organic materials in OLED over time. MLED is a logical next step in self-emissive technology and should it come to pass, will most likely replace OLED in the main consumer market.However, I don’t think that gives you the whole picture of the situation. While it’s true that MLED technology is promising, it does come at the price of being a much more complex technology to mass-produce. OLED being essentially polymer - aka a very resin can be made in a much faster manner with the ultimate goal being that the display can be essentially printed, while currently, Samsung MLED’s pixels had to be (robotically) picked and placed in a module individually, while LG relies on the Chip on Board technology for assembling. They are a lot harder to make and had a massively higher fail rate (which is the reason why they cost like a house in the present day.) While manufacturing efficiency may increase over time, I doubt they can beat OLED with material that can essentially be melted and cast into shape.Would you still buy an MLED over OLED if the latter cost half the price of the former? And don’t forget that organic self-emissive technology had also improved over time. LG OLED is basically getting brighter every year due to its improved efficiency and burn-in is not really an issue for TV and media consumption usage.All I can say for now is that it will be a very, very, very long time before MLED came out to the mass market (like possibly a decade, maybe even more) and even then, it will probably take even more time before they can get as good or as efficient as OLED, especially as a TV. Although it could see wilder adoption in the monitor market as while OLED burn-in isn’t a real issue for something like TV or phone, it definitely is for a desktop display.","7,445 followers",Bob Hannent,2K,10.6K,24.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-next-technology-trends
