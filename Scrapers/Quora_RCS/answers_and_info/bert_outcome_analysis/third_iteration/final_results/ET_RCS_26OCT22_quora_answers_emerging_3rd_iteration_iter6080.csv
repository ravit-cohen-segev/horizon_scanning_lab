You find success by continually learning, practicing, taking on harder problems, and absorbing + applying as much of it all as you can, ideally with a more experienced person guiding you, and maybe some university education to supplement it (so you’ll pick up things like algorithmic complexity, different types of data structures, computer architecture, how memory, OSes, databases work and whatnot…but that stuff’s all learnable on your own as well)",0 followers,Gavin Thorn,8.1K,230,1.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/You-see-that-numerous-technologies-frameworks-are-emerging-every-day-and-developers-are-interested-in-using-them-and-the-basic-concepts-of-programming-are-often-not-examined-very-deeply-How-do-you-find-your-way-to

But you have to pick and choose where you focus your attention, based on what you actually need and what you will actually use. Almost every new project I have ever worked on has required learning something new, and I’ve been at this a long time. Many large modern projects require multiple programming languages, frameworks, libraries, paradigms, etc.Professional software developers are fully expected to learn and use new things as needed, throughout their careers. They are not expected to know every possible thing before it’s needed. Of course, if something is interesting to you, and you have the time, by all means, go ahead and explore it. But with the myriad of things competing for your attention, you still need to pick and choose, if you ever expect to get any practical work done.Have a look at this blog post for more perspective on this:How long does it take to become proficient at ALL programming languages?","29,921 followers",Barry Rountree,4.3K,7.3K,39.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/You-see-that-numerous-technologies-frameworks-are-emerging-every-day-and-developers-are-interested-in-using-them-and-the-basic-concepts-of-programming-are-often-not-examined-very-deeply-How-do-you-find-your-way-to

So started thinking about caching, managing memory usage while reading in the file contents and preparing the response etc.I learned so much that morning - it was like lifting the lid on the Internet and going “ahhhh! so that’s how it all works!”(bonus points for writing a load generator to help you crash said web server… :-) )",628 followers,Dipt Chaudhary,2.1K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/You-see-that-numerous-technologies-frameworks-are-emerging-every-day-and-developers-are-interested-in-using-them-and-the-basic-concepts-of-programming-are-often-not-examined-very-deeply-How-do-you-find-your-way-to

They recommend some frameworks. I look at proposed solutions, at mentioned frameworks’ tutorials and choose which one looks more meaningful and useful for me and my problem. Then I start implementing my solution in this framework. When I encounter problems along the way I search the web for solutions to similar (probably, more general) problems and thus I improve my knowledge of the framework and its ecosystem.For instance, I had to develop Single-Page Application (SPA). I looked for the frameworks people usually use for that - Angular, React, Vue, some others. I decided that I like React best. I learned about how it does diffs and figures out what to rebuild/redraw, it’s described in pretty much all the tutorials. It plays nice with Immutable.js so I took them both and built first version of my app looking at simple TodoMVC example as a template. Then I needed several separate pages and going back and forth between them, so I found React Router and added it to my project. And so on.But to reasonably efficiently work in this way you have to have enough experience working with other frameworks and without any framework at all. I have pretty good intuition about how the framework works internally. I wouldn’t be able to write it all myself, but I’m confident I could implement pretty good chunks of it. :) Plus you should understand overall architecture and design to see what part your framework takes in it and where it ends. For instance, you’d better realize when you start writing spaghetti code and it’s time to employ Redux, for instance.","5,424 followers",Thanh Trung Nguyen,10.8K,121,1.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/You-see-that-numerous-technologies-frameworks-are-emerging-every-day-and-developers-are-interested-in-using-them-and-the-basic-concepts-of-programming-are-often-not-examined-very-deeply-How-do-you-find-your-way-to

12,"Unless you code in binary on the hardware you are using someone else's tool. It may be a compiler, it maybe a library, it may be what is fancifully called s framework (what is that others than some libraries and preprocessing tools?). Every decent programmer knows he uses tools build by his predecessors - and if they are good, is damned grateful for them.
