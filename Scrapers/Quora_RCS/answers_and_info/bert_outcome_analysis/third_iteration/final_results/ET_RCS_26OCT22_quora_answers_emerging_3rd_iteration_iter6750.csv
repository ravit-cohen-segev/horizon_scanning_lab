What kings once did by ordering that coins contain more cheaper metals and less gold, politicians now do via their central banks’ issuance of additional currency to go into circulation irrespective of no similar or equal additions to underlying economic-activity intensity, thereby intentionally reducing the purchasing power value of existing in-circulation units.

The church looked down upon people learning to read out of fear that they be drawn into heresy, and the underlying tenet of christianity was that everything that is, is because of god… no reason to look into it, just shut up and pray… and pay your tithes.I know that there are many revisionist historians who say that the dark ages weren’t really dark, etc. but just look at the history. I mean the amount of written history. Any scholar of Rome can easily check the name of every single Roman magistrate from the fall of Tarquin the Proud to the fall of Rome itself, and then there are centuries during which we don’t even know if many of the kings were mythical or not (Arthur?), centuries in which not one major advance was made, no philosophical works of any note were penned unless they were religious, and therefore introspective in nature.

5,"No, for a very interesting reason.You see, animals evolve within the sphere of their kingdom (mineral kingdom, plant kingdom, have different rules for evolution, specific to each kingdom). The purpose of animal evolution is survival - of individual animal with fight-or-flight mechanism among others - and of species it belongs to - mating.

The purpose of animal evolution is survival - of individual animal with fight-or-flight mechanism among others - and of species it belongs to - mating. Animals change in order to survive different conditions and circumstances of their ecological niche. Sometimes they move to a different niche. Sometimes they swing between conditions - like a certain iguana in Galapagos that grows longer limbs and becomes able to clime trees and shrubs in times of drought, while in times of normal rains it looses this ability and manage to eat the abundant grass.Humans are a kingdom of itself. Even if they have all the animal features, they have the abstract thinking, separating them from the animal kingdom. Humor, science, art, all these products of human intelligence, cannot be found in animal life. This is why humans have psychology while animals have ethology. See the differences between these two sciences and you will see why and how the two kingdoms are separated by the gap of different thinking.Therefore evolution for humans unfolds in a completely different sphere - that of society. Maybe at a certain geological time man and apes looked the same. But the way they evolved is totally different: the apes kept their ecological niche as long as it was possible, while humans evolved firstly physically, and finally using the upright locomotion, bipedal one, they spread all over the Earth, regardless of any ecological niche - even more, they did it in all manners possible: some - like the Eskimo and the nomads, became meat eaters, while others, from social reasons, became vegetarians. Some animals suffered the same change, but humans are able to switch during their life, not during ages!So human evolution is permanent - but social, not animal like. We still fight each other, when we should be cooperating, split due to religious, ethnic, ideological or whatever reasons. We still are able to totally annihilate life on Earth - and not only by nukes - pollution and destruction of natural spaces may bring another era of mass extinction, and not due to natural factors.Will we change our old, outdated ways of living, or we shall turn Earth into a desert? Because we are so resourceful that we may outlive all the rest of animal and plant kingdoms, with the exception of those species we consider ”useful”. Do you know that 2000 years ago men use to eat close to 1400 species of plants/tree/shrubs/mushrooms all year around, while today only 20 species are part of our food list? Just pay attention to what you eat, and you will discover that the staple list is extremely small: rice, wheat, potato, corn, with some addition of other vegetables like tomato, peppers, and so on. The extended list may grow to 200 species, but is still far from the 1400. Of course the reason was that the resources were then far scarcer that today.So we keep evolving, but not in animal, physical way, but human, social one.",3 followers,Samuel Bateman,1.1K,102,56.4K,2019,https://www.quora.com/Did-currency-stop-evolving-in-the-past-or-has-it-been-changing-and-adapting-to-technological-advancements-throughout-human-history

Big dataBig data is impacting every business, starting from small companies to Fortune 500 enterprises all are revolving around the BIG data! What actually is this big data? Big data is an evolving term that describes any voluminous amount of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data that has the potential to be mined for information. And here are the 4 V’s by which big data is been characterized –• VOLUME – Scale of data• VELOCITY – Analysis of streaming data• VARIETY – the Different form of data• VERACITY – Uncertainty of dataThe company size is not the factor to consider big data. Big data technology can help you if you have a website, an active social media presence, if you accept credit/debit card payments, or uses data collection form for customers. And analyzing these data can help you to improve your customer experience and in turn, increase your business ROI.Now, are you thinking how big data is helping companies to provide a customized user experience? Big data can actually help in collecting better marketing data about the customer, this gives companies a better idea of what the customer wants, how they will use, and which channels/platforms they typically choose to buy a product or service.While companies are continuously seeking new opportunities to benefit from data collection, but when a user hears these things he/she will definitely get worried, because it’s a matter of personal data and privacy. So in order to gain customers, trust companies should build and maintain a privacy policy and the systems/security needed to protect customer data.Now let’s have a look at how big data is changing business –1. Advanced Business IntelligenceBefore the rise of big data, business intelligence was rather limited. Integrating advanced analytics for big data with BI systems is an important step toward gaining a full return on investment. Now many companies are gearing up by hiring business intelligence experts because they help take a company to the next level.2. Personalized MarketingBig data analysis can help business predict what products customers might need in the future. Imagine how your business would benefit from being able to market the products that you knew your customers needed and knew enough information about them to customize for specific needs.3. Proactive Customer ServiceWith big data, businesses can know exactly what their customers need before the customer raises the query. This kind of proactive customer service will revolutionize business that desires to differentiate themselves based on their customer service. Big data analysis can also help customer support team to proactively contact customers on accounts where predictive analysis determines the customers might have made a purchase decision but in future, they can be a potential customer.4. Customer Responsive ProductsBig data promises to not only improve customer service but also allows companies to make customer responsive products. Product design can help in fulfilling the needs of customers in ways that have never been possible. Instead of customers telling you what they are looking for in a product, you can use data analysis to predict what they are looking for in a product. Even this can help in creating a better picture of what a future product should look like.5. Improving Business EfficiencyBig data is supplying rich data about every product and process. These data’s are helping smart businesses to conquer the marketplace. Engineers are analyzing big data and looking for ways to make processes run more efficiently. When constraints are discovered and removed, the business performance increases.6. Cost ReductionCompanies are now using big data to accurately find trends and predict future events within their respective industries. Knowing when something might happen can improve forecasts and planning. Planners can determine when to produce and how much to produce. They can even determine how much inventory to keep in hand.According to estimates, it is revealed that the global market share of big data and its allied technology is expected to reach approximately $57 billion by the year 2020, generating a need for over 50,000 skilled Big Data experts and data scientists. The US is the forerunner in the generation, consumption and deployment of data and this technology. Thus the big data is connecting and building the digital future.","47,054 followers",Abhinav Sharma,3.5K,865,7.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Did-currency-stop-evolving-in-the-past-or-has-it-been-changing-and-adapting-to-technological-advancements-throughout-human-history

These behaviors are implemented via biochemical pathways, since only multi-cellular organisms have a nervous system.Worms have a very primitive brain.Figure: Worm nervous systemInsects have nervous systems but also only barely have a brain. What they have instead are numerous bulges throughout their nervous system called ""ganglia"" that are information processing hubs serving the basic survival needs of the animal. Insects have a complex network of ganglia in their head, since this is where most of the sensory organs are located (eyes, antennae for smell, feelers, mouth), and this ganglia complex is something of a proto-brain.Figure: Insect nervous systemFish have very basic brains in their head. Brains get steadily larger and more complex as evolution proceeds through reptiles, birds, and mammals.The brains of birds have been studied extensively because the song-learning process is believed to parallel language learning in humans. The general architecture of the ""avian brain"" (neuroscientists avoid the somewhat insulting term ""bird brain"") is almost unrecognizable compared to a human brain, and yet the evolution of various components into those of the human brain has been traced and ""homologous mappings"" have been worked out.Figure: Brain of song bird (avian brain).Figure: Human BrainThe brain of each species is optimized for the unique needs of that species. Mice have a special brain area for spatial mapping using their whiskers (the ""barrel cortex""); bats have a specialized brain area for echolocation (vision using sound echoes); and birds have several specialized regions for song-learning. In humans, up to 2/3 of the brain is involved in vision in some way, whereas certain rodents that live permanently underground have practically no visual brain region at all. Dogs have an unusually large olfactory brain area to help with their keen sense of smell, while cats which need to hunt have the most advanced visual brain network second only to primates.Unfortunately, scientists don'tRelated:",0 followers,Juan Hathaway,9.9K,112,3.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Did-currency-stop-evolving-in-the-past-or-has-it-been-changing-and-adapting-to-technological-advancements-throughout-human-history

Extrinsic:Everything that influences your decision and opinion is stored here (ex: why do you like certain music, food or fashion)The interesting part is this motivation usually does not last more than 3–6 months.3. Obsessions:This stores your passions but also your addictions such as being a workaholic, drugs, shopaholic and chasing stuff.When it’s on, you are not free to choose what you want anymore and will go after the obsession.# Imagination:This is the marvel of evolution, it’s what makes us human.Your imagination driver gives you creativity and adaptation.It should take control when dealing with new and complex situations that require you to think out of the box.People usually don’t let imagination driver take control and stick to their motivation driver instead, which leads them to lose out on big innovations.Examples:These mistakes happened because the people in charge relied on their motivation driver which only thinks from what it already knows - if they had used their imagination driver, they can see a future that Steve Jobs saw.When your imagination driver is taking control, you feel calm and in full control.How to activate it on command? think for yourself these questions:Making yourself answer these questions in your head activates the imagination driver.In conclusion we can say that even though our brain is too complex to summarise in a Quora post, this framework gives us a better idea on how we go about our daily lives and how we can use this knowledge to live a better life.Hope this helps you as much as it helped me.I might be updating this post with more findings, follow it if you want to keep updated.All the best!","1,896 followers",Jalon Fonseca,21.7K,485,5.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Did-currency-stop-evolving-in-the-past-or-has-it-been-changing-and-adapting-to-technological-advancements-throughout-human-history
