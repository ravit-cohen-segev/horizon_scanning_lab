After all, it was beyond imagination for our forefathers that someday more than half of the Earth's population will use a handheld device to connect with near and dear ones living or working at a great distance from them. However, this becomes a reality with the advent of smartphones. So, the exact technology that will one day replace mobile phone calls is still in mystery. Maybe, implantation of microchips deep inside our skin will become a norm to make calls. In Sweden, microchipping is already popular, but not for making calls.

1,"It is a futuristic question, but let me try to answer it -A) Wave 1 (2017–2018) - The first wave of transformation is already happening. Augumented Reality (AR) will soon become a central aspect of smartphone applications (apps make the phone ""smart""). For example - Navigation and tracking would be transformed through AR as opposed to the traditional ways of using the maps applications.B) Wave 2 (2018–2020) - The form factor of smartphones would change. With foldable screens already available - it is a matter of time when foldable phones would be available in the market - making it easy for coIt is a futuristic question, but let me try to answer it -A) Wave 1 (2017–2018) - The first wave of transformation is already happening. Augumented Reality (AR) will soon become a central aspect of smartphone applications (apps make the phone ""smart""). For example - Navigation and tracking would be transformed through AR as opposed to the traditional ways of using the maps applications.B) Wave 2 (2018–2020) - The form factor of smartphones would change. With foldable screens already available - it is a matter of time when foldable phones would be available in the market - making it easy for consumers.Edit on 24/3/2019 - Foldable smartphones have been announced in 2019 as predicted. See link for more details -C) Wave 3 (2020–2025) - Multiple form factors will become available and would eventually replace the way we know the phone today. A smartphone would no longer look like a phone. Wearable glasses, watches, and even Virtual Reality (VR) devices would become ubiquitous. It will be difficult to completely replace the ""phone"" due to our conditioning - but slowly the usage of the phone would get replaced by wearables.D) Wave-4 (2025–2035) - The phone will eventually shrink and become an accessory (dumb phone) to our primary wearable devices. It will be used mostly to project the screen on surfaces (holograms and AR). The primary use case would be to consume content and to use the phone for using business applications. For example, the holograms would project themselves such as screens to play videos, or as a projected laptop screen and logical keyboard for typing, or even as a large screen to give presentations. Other use cases would be to use the phone as a digital wallet for initiating Point of Sale (PoS) payments.E) Wave-5 (2035–2050): The ""phone"" will become "" super smart"". By this time, the wearable devices would have replaced the phone completely and will be equipped with Artifical General Intelligence (AGI) and not just normal AI. The processing needed for AGI will be partially subsumed in chipsets of the wearables, while the rest of the processing will be in the cloud. The phone would no longer be just a communications device which provides us with apps. It will embibe our persona, and would become an alter-ego - helping us to perform daily tasks, and even talk to people on our behalf, and acting as our personal assistant.Just my two cents. Technology always surprises us, and it remains to be seen what happens in the future.",36 followers,Adam Ambrozy,579,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-will-replace-mobile-phone-calls-in-future
2,"Direct Neural Interfaces (also known as Brain-Computer Interfaces) or DNIs for short.Cell phones are amazing products, technologically and in terms of usefulness, but they have a few flaws. For one, they're not as private as they could be, and privacy is something really useful on phones. Another thing is that they can get lost, stolen, scuffed up, dirty, greasy, damaged, really anything bad. With touchscreens, if you crack the screen, it's not going to be good.Would a commercial DNI be a silver bullet? No, it wouldn't.

3,"I was recently in a similar position having worked for Siebel since '99, getting acquired by Oracle in 2005, then finally deciding I needed a change & leaving Oracle earlier this year.There are really a number of factors to consider.  The first one is what do you want to do, what do you enjoy doing? Changing role to a new hot technology in an area that doesn't interest you is not the best road to success, and you should be able to find a good company working in an area that suits your interests.  The next thing to consider is what expertise do you have that can be applied to new areas that yoI was recently in a similar position having worked for Siebel since '99, getting acquired by Oracle in 2005, then finally deciding I needed a change & leaving Oracle earlier this year.There are really a number of factors to consider.  The first one is what do you want to do, what do you enjoy doing? Changing role to a new hot technology in an area that doesn't interest you is not the best road to success, and you should be able to find a good company working in an area that suits your interests.  The next thing to consider is what expertise do you have that can be applied to new areas that you can leverage to get a good role?  If you come from a Peoplesoft background this could well be an understanding of HR business processes, or if you're more technical it might be a knowledge of enterprise architecture.   You could well be surprised how many of the skills you gained with Peoplesoft are still highly valued in leading-edge companies today.  The other major question you'll need to consider is how much security you want, would you be happy working for a small company or do you want the stability offered by a larger organization. Once you've considered these questions you should be much better placed to make a choice.I'm assuming you want to remain in the Enterprise Applications market, in which case you certainly want to move into cloud products,  but there's not much new coming out of on-premise anyway, with even old-timers like Oracle throwing themselves at the cloud bandwagon now.  The big names in Enterprise cloud apps products are Salesforce (disclosure: I work for Salesforce) which is primarily CRM & Marketing, and Workday which is primarily HR and some ERP.  Given Workday's HR focus,  and the face that it was founded by the founder of Peoplesoft that seems a great place for you to start.    But there are lots of other great companies in Enterprise cloud apps such as NetSuite & ServiceNow, both of which are multi-billion dollar corporations, and Microsoft Dynamics is also worth considering.  For smaller companies the range is huge, personally I really like Vlocity which is doing really well and has great leadership, but there are so many to choose from you'd need to focus more on what interests you in order to narrow it down.",36 followers,Adam Ambrozy,579,0,0,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-will-replace-mobile-phone-calls-in-future
4,"Original question:That’s a difficult one to answer as technology continues to move forward and what may be technologically advanced now will be commonplace in a few years.

With all this in mind, one car stands out.So, my nomination for the most technologocally advanced car ever is…the Citröen DS.First off, it looks like nothing else on the road either before or since; it was the first car designed with aerodynamic efficiency in mind; it offered a revolutionary self-levelling air-suspension; it was the first production car to be fitted with disc brakes and it had self-levelling headlights which swivelled as the steering wheel was moved. It was nothing short of a clean-sheet rethink of what a car should be.",96 followers,Julian Barkway,587,663,844.7K,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-will-replace-mobile-phone-calls-in-future

A significant number of major felony cases are cleared through traffic stops. Warren Jeffs, who was on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List for serial child molestation, and Tim McVeigh, who was the Oklahoma City bomber, were both apprehended after being stopped for having invalid vehicle registration displayed.","527,820 followers",Adam D'Angelo,1.1K,990,33.5M,2013,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-will-replace-mobile-phone-calls-in-future
