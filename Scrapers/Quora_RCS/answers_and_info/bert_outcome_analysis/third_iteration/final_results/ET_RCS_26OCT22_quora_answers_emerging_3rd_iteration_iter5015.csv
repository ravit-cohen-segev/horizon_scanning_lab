In that case, CPU chip design is by FAR harder than kernel programming.Quite apart from the sheer technical challenge of mastering the complexity of the design (ALUs, FPUs, multiported register files, cache coherency, branch prediction, TLB, speculative execution, memory controllers, write buffers, bus protocols, supporting chipsets etc etc etc) there is the cost of the simulators, timing verifiers and other desIt is perfectly possible to design a CPU using FPGA technology, or ASICs, or even discrete logic.

And that’s before fabricating even sample chips in a state of the art manufacturing process. As a result, beyond the obvious answer of the teams at Intel, AMD (CPU and GPU) and ARM I can immediately think of only:as the main threads of activity. I suspect this totals a thousand or two active designers. In comparison, I would guess there are somewhere in tens of thousands of folk, if not a few hundred thousand worldwide that are writing kernel code routinely. Probably ten or twenty times that could turn their hands to it if needed.",5 followers,Wasim Momin,1.1K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-system-on-chip-technology-for-example-with-Cypress-PSOC-and-programmable-hardware-is-a-growing-trend-and-will-replace-other-processor-families

Convincing the entire worlds nuclear nations to give up their deterrents isn’t easy. Franky It looked like that was a possibility, until Putin invaded Ukraine.

2,"Given the current situation in the world right now and Putin's current mental state, I would say its certainly possible.Look don't worry about it, turn the news off and don't listen to the media, what will be will be. You could go out tomorrow and get hit by a car. Live for the day because tomorrow is not guaranteed. Even if there was a nuclear war, you'd have a very small amount of time left, and you wouldn't even know because you'd be nothing but Ash. Just cherish your loved ones and be with them.

4,"The ultimate threat is not nuclear war… it’s a serious threat no doubt… but bio/chemical warfare is a far larger threat as it’s more readily available for smaller nations. It’s cheaper to manufacture, store and transport and has a greater psychological impact.The fact that sleeper cells can easily infiltrate infrastructure and on command initiate attacks against multiple points of food production/distribution and water sources is a seriously scary reality. One that even small nations like Iran can easily carry out on a global scale.",0 followers,Vladimir Kokorev,763,89,1.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/With-today-s-technology-will-nuclear-war-ever-be-replaced-as-the-ultimate-threat

Hiroshima and Nagasaki don’t make the whole of World War II a nuclear war.We just have nuclear weapons, but we have never employed them to their full strategic and tactical capacities to initiate a nuclear war.So, we don’t have any nuclear wars (and hopefully won’t have any in the future.)",477 followers,Abhinandan Pandey,826,612,1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/With-today-s-technology-will-nuclear-war-ever-be-replaced-as-the-ultimate-threat

It’s a bit like McDonald’s really, the final outcome isn’t like the menu images. You then sit back and think about all the money you’re (not) going to save firing all your copywriters (now AI is here).Here’s Your OrderThe output was horrific and would make you lose a client in a heartbeat if you dared to push the content out into the real world where humans like to read topics that make sense and matter.You see, content and communication are just words with associated imagery. That’s it. It’s not sophisticated - but what is - the way you communicate. AI is like a socially-inept writer that hasn’t grown up watching the trilogy of Die Hard/Rambo/Rocky cult movies to know when and how to pepper copy with appropriate culturally on-point flavour. Cult-like songs that copywriters borrow lines from lyrics to hit-home a point is not possible with AI. AI has never watched a decade of Friends, AI doesn’t know how the English think, nor how a Brooklyn native would bring their swag.AI right now (in the creative world) is akin to the latest innovations in sex dolls. Yes, they are high-tech, yes they can do (nearly) everything, yes they are cheaper and scalable (over time),A copywriter would just as much use AI as they would turn up to a social gathering in Starbucks with their new sex doll and introduce it to their friends -We’re not anti-AI in creative - by far no - as we were one of the very ‘early to the party’ and tried every single AI program we could find (we still dabble, if I’m to be honest). However, the results are currently disappointing, and as unfit for purpose as the Starbucks example above.The variables in the equation of writing for humans gets more complicated when you throw into the mix Google’s RankBrain algorithm. Tweaked to reward for human readability and staying power (time on article), in addition to the standard keywords. AI and readability is as comfortable (to read) as sitting next to a high-tech sex doll in Starbucks right now. Perhaps tomorrow that kinda-thing will be totally normal, as will AI articles in their current status quo. However, until such time, we speculate that friends will still meet with friends in public settings and copywriters will continue to stay relevant and write for human appeal.",UNKNOWN,Ben Y.

8,"I feel compelled to answer this question, because I disagree with most of the answers here.The common answer here seems to be: yes it will kill jobs, but only the jobs low on the food chain, and it will create more jobs to at least offset the jobs it does kill.I disagree. I think AI will kill jobs, and over time, AI might kill most “jobs” as we know them.

I think AI will kill jobs, and over time, AI might kill most “jobs” as we know them. I think that people are somewhat complacent in regard to the economic impact of AI, and will likely be ill-prepared for the changes we have to adapt to in the not-so-distant future.First, let's start with the comparisons to machinery and automation. They did indeed put factory workers out of work. In that respect, I agree AI today is similar in many applications, replacing workers who have less specialized skills, perhaps call center operators, office assistants (in a limited extent), and maybe soon, taxi drivers and truck drivers. But I would argue that AI is fundamentally different from machinery or most of the other analogies commonly made when answering this question, because AI is growing and is unlikely to stop growing. It's growing in breadth (of applications and industries), in geographic and economic scope, and in power (it's capacity to address increasingly complex tasks). A more fitting analogy would be machinery in an automobile plant that not only made the parts one day, but then learned how to assemble them the week after, and then how to design cars a year later.I think that there is little that is out of reach for advanced AI of the future. Let's leave the question of the AI singularity alone for now. Instead, I think that deep learning efforts at Google and elsewhere are making AI systems learn faster and faster, with a growing rate of acceleration. Advanced AI can now address increasingly complex tasks including medical diagnosis, stock market trading, weather prediction and human behavioral modeling. Very soon, it will be able to take the place of certain types of teachers, and find a role in education. It can already deal with complex systems in software and mathematics, and seems to be only limited in applications that require interactions with the physical world (sensors are still imperfect), and with people.So without projecting too far into the future, we can ask the question, what jobs will NOT be killed by AI? Jobs that involve labor are already (or soon to be) replaced. Jobs that require logical reasoning are being replaced, albeit at a slower rate. What are the qualities that humans have that cannot be captured by AI? Perhaps creativity, emotional responses? So perhaps researchers in academia will survive longer than most, and artists (though AI stylistic mimicry is already quite impressive and their results enjoyable), and counselors/psychologists/case workers, and decision makers like CEOs who cannot be predictable or error prone. And hopefully software engineers and algorithm designers who develop AI systems.This leaves a very, very small portion of today's jobs intact. Many say: we just need to train people to fill higher level jobs created by AI, e.g. Programmers, ML researchers. But this is no easy feat. The US educational system is struggling to meet the demands created by advanced technology today. This failure is in part responsible for the economic divide plaguing the country today. The challenge of educating the public for a job market that is both decreasing in scope and increasing in complexity, is nothing we've ever faced before.I am far from original in this opinion. But if I had to guess, I would say that AI will put far more people out of work than we can (re)train in time. That will have significant economic repercussions as corporations seeking to minimize cost will do so at the cost of rising unemployment. There will need to be dramatic changes in social policies in order to avert large scale economic disaster, first dramatic rises in minimum wage, then eventually some type of universal income/welfare. It's the kind of change that requires significant leadership in our government, something that seems woefully absent today.",35 followers,Noah Green,578,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/With-today-s-technology-will-nuclear-war-ever-be-replaced-as-the-ultimate-threat
