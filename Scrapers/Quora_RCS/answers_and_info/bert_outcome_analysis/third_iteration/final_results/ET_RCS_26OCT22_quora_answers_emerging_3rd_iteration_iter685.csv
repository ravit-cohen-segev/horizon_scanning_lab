2,"Historically, many of the UFO reports from the US Southwest by airline pilots in the early 1960s were almost certainly SR-71 test flights. They saw glowing afterburners that looked like two very bright lights in a tight formation, thousands of feet above them and moving at three or four times the air speed of their jet airliner. It lights were unidentified and they were flying, so UFO!IMHO, some of today’s reports likely fall into that same category. Bright lights, moving very fast, high in the sky are very difficult to identify, but do not need to violate the laws of physics as we know them.Historically, many of the UFO reports from the US Southwest by airline pilots in the early 1960s were almost certainly SR-71 test flights.

3,"There is a huge amount of evidence. The Pentagon recently released gun camera videos of craft doing things that are impossible for craft to do at our publicly known level of technology. Then it was released that a Las Vegas billionaire, Bigelow, had a secret warehouse holding materials from crashed UFO's. Then there are the cases where high level air force personnel witnessed a UFO over a ballistic missile silo site in North Dakota shoot a red beam at the silos and around a dozen nuclear missiles went offline.

Then there are the cases where high level air force personnel witnessed a UFO over a ballistic missile silo site in North Dakota shoot a red beam at the silos and around a dozen nuclear missiles went offline. Numerous people witnessed this. In 2001, dozens of former government employees shared radar records, documentation, and testimonies at a full house National Press Club event organized by Dr. Steven Greer that suggest we are likely not alone in the universe. Of course it was overshadowed a few months later by 9/11.Since the 1950's there had been an active campaign of denial by the government causing many people to laugh when the subject is mentioned today. This is largely do to the Brookings Report commissioned by the government that concluded mankind as a whole is not ready to know about the existence of alien life, that releasing such knowledge would lead to social chaos especially among religious people.It's analogous to when Copernicus concluded that the earth was not the center of the solar system, as many believed at the time. Even the eminent scientist Galileo was taken by the Roman Catholic Church and shown various torture devices to get him to keep quiet about his theory regarding the true nature of the solar system. The church at the time had the mistaken belief that the sun went around the earth and anything contrary to that idea was non-biblical.Today, people are more knowledgeable and open minded about the possibility of intelligent life on other worlds. This is bolstered by the discovery of earth-like planets orbiting relatively nearby stars. The chief argument against us being visited is based on Einstein's Special Theory of relativity that NOTHING, like a space ship, can travel faster than light. For a long time Newton's three laws of motion were THE authoritative word regarding physics, that is, until Einstein presented a better set of theories that superseded Newton's laws. Who's to say that a civilization thousands or even millions of years more advanced than ours haven't discovered principles of physics that supersede Einstein's?We are still somewhat arrogant regarding our level of understanding of physics. If earth survives, it's likely our physics thousands of years from now will be very different than it is today. The fact that there is no reconciliation between Einstein's theory of gravity and Quantum Mechanics suggests our physics is far from complete. That, and the experiences documented by highly credible people, which is often accompanied by radar records and other evidence, should at least persuade a person to keep an open mind on the subject. Each galaxy has billions of stars, and there are billions of galaxies, making the likelihood of earth alone being the only place intelligent life exists, extremely unlikely.As to ""why"" extraterrestrial life has not made itself known in a more open way, like by landing a craft on the Whitehouse lawn, perhaps Sagan's book ""Contact"" is accurate. They are waiting for us to become more advanced as a society, less warlike. Former head of Canada's Defence, Paul Heliard (sp?) suggests that's the reason. A person in his position has access to a LOT more information than most, so his opinion is probably a lot more informed than the average person.",489 followers,Alex Todorovic,733,1.8K,2.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Since-there-is-currently-no-evidence-that-aliens-have-visited-Earth-is-it-possible-that-UFOs-are-actually-top-secret-military-aircraft-running-on-some-sort-of-exotic-technology

9,"The quickest way to find technology partners for your patented technology is to do an in-depth patent search. By searching for prior art related to your patent you can normally  find patent owners with technologies similar to or inferior to your own. If their technology could benefit from access to your own technology, it could be that they will be excellent partners for you. A professional global patent search should reveal multiple potential partners. If another patent owner is filing multiple patent owners in your sector they are clearly investing in it, as a result, there is a fair chanceThe quickest way to find technology partners for your patented technology is to do an in-depth patent search. By searching for prior art related to your patent you can normally  find patent owners with technologies similar to or inferior to your own. If their technology could benefit from access to your own technology, it could be that they will be excellent partners for you. A professional global patent search should reveal multiple potential partners. If another patent owner is filing multiple patent owners in your sector they are clearly investing in it, as a result, there is a fair chance they will be interested in your work, even if they don't invest. Be aware that they may have already tried your idea internally, and rejected it. Of course they could also be stiff competition, however this should not deter you from approaching them if you believe they would make a good partner, just be careful what information you reveal.I urge you not to be afraid of international collaborations, these can be a little bit more tricky, but if you deploy an in country/in region business development partner then the risk can be reduced very significantly.Once you identify the potential partners it is often helpful to find a reason to work together. It could be to develop a product offering using their tech and yours. It could also be to approach a potential investor with a joint venture opportunity, or more likely, it could be to apply for some research and development funding from a national or international funding agency. Funding agencies are helpful sources of early stage funding to advance and derisk new technologies, making them more investable as the technology matures.Whatever way you decide to work with the new partner, make sure you put a solid agreement in place to properly protect your collaboration. In particular it will need to protect your intellectual property and confidential information, not just if the collaboration goes according to plan, but also if the collaboration goes sour. I strongly recommend you use a contract expert with expertise in these sorts of agreements to get the best outcome for you.I wish you every success in your endeavours. The road from invention to technology commercialisation is normally long and beset with unexpected twists and turns, however it is also very satisfying working with new technologies, and successfully navigating your path forward.","68,776 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,1.2K,17.3K,413.3M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Since-there-is-currently-no-evidence-that-aliens-have-visited-Earth-is-it-possible-that-UFOs-are-actually-top-secret-military-aircraft-running-on-some-sort-of-exotic-technology

That's bull$hit that needs to stop.Pace of play can be helped if more people dropped the stigma of the red tees being ""lady"" tees and the yellow tees being ""senior"" tees.  They're like levels in a video game; start at the reds, and as you get better move back a tee.It'd help if more courses had ""bunny slope"" courses.  A place with little challenge, so newcomers can learn to play without the fear of losing a whole box of balls in a round.  I'm lucky, as there are two near me I can point people to... but they're not everywhere.  People learn to ski on ""bunny slopes""- why can't golfers?The last one is the hardest to change.  People are set in their ways.  Unfortunately, there are many that expect to have their course look like Augusta National, they look down on newcomers.As I'm doing with GLG, and others are with their sites, maybe we can change that perception.  Using social media effectively can help, as well.","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,631,1.5K,2.9M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-there-no-top-golf-places-in-other-countries-Is-it-very-hard-to-mimic-their-technology-Is-the-technology-patented

Considering how hard of a time most golf courses are having with getting millennials into the game, it’s getting to be more and more important to adopt technology to make the game more accessible to young digital natives.The most significant consumer-facing change has probably been the adoption of online booking at many golf courses around the world. While not the newest technology out there, it’s still catching on in the industry. Some courses still use a pen and paper tee sheet and only take reservations over the phone; this is way too time-consuming and frustrating for everyone involved.Today, cutting edge golf courses are adopting mobile apps that make online booking even easier. These apps are the perfect tool for any golfer since you can book your round and sometimes get a discount. Plus, these apps allow you to track your scores, handicap, order food from the restaurant, track house accounts, and book rounds with friends.Some golf courses now will even let you check-in from the parking lot, so you can skip the pro shop line and go straight to the starter! I’d expect to see this kind of automation increase with self-order kiosks and more technology integrated within the experience of both playing the sport and relaxing at the clubhouse.","4,737 followers",Ben Podgursky,536,337,9.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-there-no-top-golf-places-in-other-countries-Is-it-very-hard-to-mimic-their-technology-Is-the-technology-patented

I had just switched my major to Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and previously had no CS experience whatsoever.  One of my friends from high school got me Starcraft 2, and I decided to try it out.Fast forward a couple of months, and I was in the top percentile of 1v1 players at the time.  I was queuing up against random opponents on the ladder, when I got matched up against a Protoss player with the tag ""anxman"".  He decided to cannon rush me, which was a strategy I was pretty used to seeing.  However, the way he did so was very odd.  For those unfamiliar with the game, a ""cannon rush"" is a strategy that you want to keep hidden from your opponent for as long as possible, until you are ready.  This guy just executed it in my face (he built his first pylon and forge, his first two buildings, next to my command center).  Since the strategy depends a lot on the element of surprise, and I was used to dealing with it with much less preparation, I was able to beat him.Since the game was still pretty young at this time, I was honestly curious if this was something he could pull off at this level of play.  It turns out he was just having a bit of fun seeing how far he could take these types of strategies.  We chatted a bit, and then ended up teaming up and playing a series of extremely silly 2v2s together where all our games consisted of these similarly terrible rushes bound to fail.  These games ended up being really fun, and we continued to chat while playing them.  This was where it got a little weird...(some hazy memory of a snippet of our conversation follows)anxman:  so... where are you at?Uhhh... what?!  At this point, I had been a CS major for about a year, and had completed maybe only 2 classes actually related to CS.  I let him know this.  He said it was cool, and told me to add him as a contact and hit him up when I had some more classes under my belt.  Later in my sophomore year, I throw out my resume everywhere (including Facebook), but I have no experience still.  I decide not to contact anxman since I don't think I'm going to have a shot at anything.  I'm promptly rejected from every company, and fail to get an internship for the summer of my sophomore year.  No biggie.Junior year rolls around, and now I *really* want to secure an internship that summer so I have something decent to show when I graduate.  I was still playing Starcraft 2, but anxman and I had not really talked at all since our initial encounter.  My resume was still pretty weak and anything was worth a shot at this point, so I made the decision to message anxman the next time I saw him online.  After a few days, I happen to catch him online and message him.me: hey man, do you remember me? (weak)At this point, I still don't know this guy except for some limited interactions where he creepily asked for my location during those games.  I quickly Google this email as a sanity check, and I see that at the very least, it's a legitimate email of someone who works at Facebook.  This is actually the first time I learn his real name, too.  I really have nothing to lose at this point, right?  Well, except that my resume contains my phone number and mailing address... but...whatever!  I send my resume over to that email and let him know.anxman: cool, let me checkPhew!  Got that over with.  90% confident that this ""anxman"" guy truly is a Facebook employee...A few days pass, and sure enough, I get an email from a recruiter at Facebook!  She sets me up with a short phone screen, which leads to a few 45 minute interviews over the phone, which leads to an internship offer.  I accepted this offer and interned at Facebook in 2011.  Almost all of the people who played Starcraft at Facebook knew me as ""that intern who anxman recruited through Starcraft.""  I have now worked at Facebook for over a year and a half full time.
