0,"Over 50% of all cars sold in Europe and the UK are diesel. They are more torquey, have far better economy and require less maintenance than petrol cars, especially when older.",0 followers,Ted Logan,1.7K,276,1.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-upcoming-methods-and-technology-are-used-in-a-modern-diesel-engine

2,"BS means Bharat Stage,For achieving the BS IV standardsEGRIn EGR engines,As exhaust gas is recirculated, itBS means Bharat Stage,For achieving the BS IV standardsEGRIn EGR engines,As exhaust gas is recirculated, itFor Gas flow, A pipe will be connected from EGR inlet to Engine Exhaust Manifold. And another pipe will be connected from EGR outlet to Engine Inlet Manifold.For Coolant flow( To cool exhaust gas), A coolant pipe will be connected from EGR coolant inlet to Engine Coolant flow. And another pipe from EGR Coolant outlet to Engine outlet coolant flow.SCRThe adblue tank I connected to the muffler so that the air passes from Ad blue tank to Muffler and to exhaust.This is exhaust gas after treatment system. Ad blue is injected into SCR housing pipe. By chemical reaction ammonia is formed in the catalyst housing.Ammonia reacts with NOx in exhaust gas at SCR housing, and reduces NOx level. This has set of sensors, ACU and set of actuators. ACU controls adblue(Aqueous urea solution - AUS32) injection.Adblue will be consumed in operation and it is refilled periodically. With SCR, emission levels of BS-IV can be metEvery automobile company in India has made some changes according their requirement but the main tech used for achieving BS-IV standards are EGR and SCR.THANK YOU.",998 followers,Mike Percival,1K,6.6K,8.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-upcoming-methods-and-technology-are-used-in-a-modern-diesel-engine
3,"A diesel with, say, 135 kW of power feels much, much stronger than a petrol with 135 kW.Why?Because torque, not power, is what moves the vehicle.That diesel will also have around 380 NM of torque from about 1500 RPM, and the petrol will be down around 220 NM at something like 3000 RPM (picking example numbers from some late model VWs).Since power is just torque times RPM (with a constant), the diesel is actually much stronger at low RPM.That’s why you have to change down to overtake in a petrol car… in a diesel, often enough you don’t.For a heavy vehicle, you need a lot more torque, and you baA diesel with, say, 135 kW of power feels much, much stronger than a petrol with 135 kW.Why?Because torque, not power, is what moves the vehicle.That diesel will also have around 380 NM of torque from about 1500 RPM, and the petrol will be down around 220 NM at something like 3000 RPM (picking example numbers from some late model VWs).Since power is just torque times RPM (with a constant), the diesel is actually much stronger at low RPM.That’s why you have to change down to overtake in a petrol car… in a diesel, often enough you don’t.For a heavy vehicle, you need a lot more torque, and you basically don’t care about power. So diesels are better for that application.Diesels also use less fuel because diesel has higher energy density and the engine is more efficient. That also matters for heavy vehicles.",UNKNOWN,Batman,855,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-upcoming-methods-and-technology-are-used-in-a-modern-diesel-engine
