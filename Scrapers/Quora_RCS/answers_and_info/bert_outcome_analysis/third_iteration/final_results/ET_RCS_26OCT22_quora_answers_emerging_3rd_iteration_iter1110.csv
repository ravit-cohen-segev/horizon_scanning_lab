0,"The obvious technology is cellular networking.For some people, cellular networks have replaced wired ISP connections. Already, Google offers print services between devices and printers via the Internet, and there is no reason why this should not extend to cellular connections.Creating private networks between cellular connected devices will allow your devices to work together as they do now, except they will be using cellular connections rather than traditional ISPs, Ethernet and WiFi. Moving MiFi technology into individual devices with the growth of 5G networks could be the next step.",540 followers,Tony Li,13.6K,14.7K,51.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-will-replace-WiFi
1,"Indian IT Industry not fully ceated by Indian companies. IT was driven by US Companies as IT industry was undergoing a change and supply of IT skill. With sudden shortage of Mainframe skill in early 1990s coupled with higher salaries due to demand and supply gap, outsourcing was considered as one key decision.GE was the pioneer to find 5 Indian IT vendors to do the work which American ProgrammersIndian IT Industry not fully ceated by Indian companies. IT was driven by US Companies as IT industry was undergoing a change and supply of IT skill. With sudden shortage of Mainframe skill in early 1990s coupled with higher salaries due to demand and supply gap, outsourcing was considered as one key decision.GE was the pioneer to find 5 Indian IT vendors to do the work which American Programmers were not willing to do viz. maintenance of obscure Technology like Mainframe programs.In fact Bill Gates sent a team before that to recruit software developer from India to relocatethem to US.. This move was seen as illegal like invading another country for human capital wealth.On the back of GE contracts to Infosys, Wipro, PCS, TCS build a profitable business with good profit margin.Each of these start ups except TCS realized the potential and went out for other big US companies and Indian ITIndustry reach 500 million $ mark in 1993. Incidently this was the year I moved to Seepz , export promotion zone created by Govt. of India to promote software export industry.The next momentum came due to Y2K ( year 2000 bug) problem hitting the companies world wide. India was the chosen partner of all global companies to fix Y2K.By this time other countries such as UK, Japan, Germany have realized that the outsourcing as way of doing business as training and retaining cost of IT professional was a challenge .IT industry has a trend of changing the technology landscape and forcing the businesses to adopt new technologies.During 1980 to 1990 only few big changes happened•	Third party operating system (OS) by Digital Research•	Growth of Intel micro processor capacity measured in MIPS those days•	Birth of Relation Database RDBMS•	Java machine independent programming language•	Object oriented programming•	Growth of multiple third party software company spreadsheet, database.After year 2000 the mobile phone has changed the volume of software development work and software development was not restricted to big software companies .In fact a lot of innovation came from small start ups. Start ups were in the driving seat to the extent huge amount of investment started happening in USA on start-ups.Ideas have become a currency of the new economyEinstein said it long ago: “Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere!”Suddenly young entrepreneur started becoming billionaire overnight, not really overnight but within 5 years due to their market potential even without having much revenue in the initial years. All they have is growing user base.With the above background it is certain that there would be continuous changes happening in IT industry, not every year, it would not only in decades.Next 25 yearsIn next 25 years you can expect maximum 3 major breakthroughs which may have high impact on IT industry( disruptive). This is my own prediction.One of key factor in IT is that it remains a manpower intensive industry. This factor restricts rate of change. Too many people working on a given project has its implications on overall productivity.Jeff Bezos has his own way of dealing with phenomenon.Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has this rule: no meeting should be so large that two pizzas can’t feed the whole group.Lets us now discuss the shape of IT Industry of India in next 25 years.With the above considerations, India IT industry will remain a source of manpower due to•	Cost arbitrage•	Investment in training•	Potential to scale up•	Cost of infrastructureIt is not a secret that despite of reaching 100 billion dollars mark, Indian IT has not invested in creating products or even software tools due to mind-set of the owners of these companies. Single reason for this the manpower based service business has much lower risks compared to software product which may yield higher RoI after few years but has higher risk, potential of failure and huge cost of marketing.Few start up but mostly extending the existing business models Amazon model by Flipcart and adopting to Indian consumers such as Swiggy, Paytm, OLQ . In India a lot of investment in start-ups came from Soft Bank driven by Nikesh AroraNikesh drove Google commercial business to a respectable level.Businesses are driven one single motive of profit.Cost is one factor which ca...","5,084 followers",Bobby Tatro,3.9K,2.2K,45.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-will-replace-WiFi
2,"That’s a very good question.Over next 25 years, IT will evolve so much that when we look back, we will pause and think how we managed without IT in 80’s, 90’s may be till 2000. Let’s see what is going to change:That’s a very good question.Over next 25 years, IT will evolve so much that when we look back, we will pause and think how we managed without IT in 80’s, 90’s may be till 2000. Let’s see what is going to change:After 25 years, we may further advance into Robots treating patients. Robots replacing Nurses. Robots driving cars. AI Machines/Robots may be our pets. If you don't like your face, you can change it to which ever Bollywood or Hollywood actor.So all these need IT guys and they will have jobs. Only people with exceptional skills will be hired. Regular IT support jobs will vanish.",77 followers,Alok Shrivastwa,806,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-is-Indias-Information-Technology-IT-industry-likely-to-evolve-over-the-next-25-years-Or-is-it-going-to-flicker-off-and-extinguish
3,"It is an interesting but testing time. It will no longer be contracting work that will deliver it will be realtime possibilities like an Indian Alibaba or a Google- doubt whether we will able to reach 10% of this target - . Knowing our broker mentality of training teams for the cheapest cost for delivery I do not know whether we will be able to achieve this ambitious target.Unless there are a few concept oriented individuals who are willing to get going from scratch and live of scrounging for the next meal and with the fire in the belly, instead of looking at Rolls or caddilacs from the startIt is an interesting but testing time.

If we are going to look at our ‘Industrialists’ to lead us - you are mistaken - they are just brokers or just looking at enlarging their markets and profits through Importing, setting up margins and making the money from this huge ever hungry population for newer products.Our political leaders are also not capable as they live from election to election mortgaging the future of this country. Most of us live from hyperbole to hyperbole .The Talent of Our Engineering graduates from the “Factories” set up are pathetic. Our schools curriculum still follows that of the 1900 where the British wanted Labour to serve their purpose and devised the curriculum accordingly. WE DO NOT WANT CHANGE as we are fighting the NEP!Our middle class is living from Mall to Mall and wedding to wedding and the next US visa. Our super rich from the tours of the Riviera to Nice to exotic trips. Our Hoi Polloi live from Cinema Star to Cinema Star.Startups are there for their Funding to Funding and the Final Exit.We will not Flourish but keep floating dreaming of the next VISA to the west or the East!","135,531 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-is-Indias-Information-Technology-IT-industry-likely-to-evolve-over-the-next-25-years-Or-is-it-going-to-flicker-off-and-extinguish
