If you wanted to hear it again, you had to lift up the record needle and move it back to the start, or rewind the tape.If you wanted to watch a movie, you either went to the movie theater, or watched whatever came on television. There were only 13 channels, and most of them went off the air after a certain time at night.Paying for things in stores meant using cash, and there was a cashier that had to punch in the prices of products one at a time into a register that added up the total. If the total was $75.50, and you handed them $80.00, the had to figure out to give you back $4.50 cents. There was no computer to do the math, and there was no card to swipe to make the payment.To entertain ourselves, we socialized in real life. We’d go to parties (and once we were old enough, to bars and nightclubs.) We’d talk, dance, or sing, or play card games, or board games. We played in the streets, skipping rope, playing sports like wiffle ball or frisbee.There was bowling and roller skating on special occasions. There were pool halls for adults. People formed softball leagues, and kids played in little leagues. We had a basketball hoop outside on a street pole. We’d ride our bicycles, and generally spent a lot more time outdoors just doing things than kids do today. On rainy or cold days, we’d stay inside and do arts and crafts, or sometimes watch cartoons on TV.Life was dramatically different from how it is today. People didn’t feel the need to share every silly thing that took place during the course of their day, like they do today on social media. We didn’t spend hours talking about news events, or sharing memes. We didn’t take pictures and videos of every blessed thing we saw. We certainly didn’t take so many pictures of ourselves. And the pictures we did take cost money, and there was a limit to the amount of film in the camera, so you chose things you really wanted to remember. You had to get the film developed, and that also cost money and took a few days. You didn’t even know how the pictures would look until you got them back. You couldn’t just see it instantly, and then do it over if you didn’t like it.In many ways, life was better because there was greater importance placed on the things you did, because they took time and effort. Life didn’t feel as “disposable” as it does now. We all had more patience, and learned how to wait, rather than expect everything to happen instantaneously. We didn’t give up as easily on things. We didn’t “get rid of things” as quickly. We learned how to take care of them, and mend them if they broke. And we didn’t feel the need to rush out and buy the latest new thing that was being sold. The phone in our house lasted 30 years before we got a new one. Imagine keeping a phone today for 30 years.Hope this answered your question.",504 followers,Mad Mann,3.1K,1.8K,2.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Before-advanced-technology-was-developed-like-computers-the-internet-video-games-etc-what-excuses-and-reasons-did-people-have-to-not-study-and-do-their-tasks

Take the recent fiasco with the UK exam results, we went into lockdown, nobody going anywhere without a just and valid reason, the vast majority of students saw this as a good skive even though the exam dates were not that far into the future and having greater access to a world of information than any other generation. Even with this bunch of hard done by whiners it's hard to see where the problem was that prevented them from using that time to get a bit more practice in subjects they felt needed more work, admitted schools could easily have set up chat room type classrooms, the technology to set up chatrooms has been around for over 20 years, they could have sent email lessons to students who then reply with their work. Why is that so difficult?I am a procrastinater of the highest level, I will push deadlines to the very limit and beyond, my school homework would be done during break immediately before the lesson that it was due to be handed in, often incomplete. Most of my excuses were responsive and made up on the spot, not a million miles from the truth but a story grown out of an actual event, one that I recall was during the time my dad was being treated for cancer, every Tuesday mum had to drive him to hospital and couldn't guarantee being home when we got back from school so on a Tuesday we went to nan for our tea and mum would either pick us up from there or phone nan's neighbour (nan didn't have a phone at the time) to give us the message to walk home, we were never there for more than 1 hour but for my excuse I'd done my homework at nan's and it was quite late when mum came to collect us and I forgot to pick up the work I'd done for my homework, and normally we alternate visiting of our grandparents maternal grandparents one Sunday, paternal the next Sunday. My excuses were never one liners, they were always a long epic tale of woe which sometimes said nothing to explain the absence of any work, a few teachers would stop me in the midst of my tale and say “ never mind, next week I expect to see 2 lots of homework “ only once I was told to attend “homework group"" it was originally the detention session but evolved into an after school session for students who need some help from teachers to complete their homework or students who didn't have the opportunity at home for peace and solitude, for example my friend Graham who had 2 brothers and 4 sisters living in a 3 bedroom house. No surprises that I didn't sit any academic exams but the friends I had that did used available spare time to study. If young people are serious about getting the required exam results needed for their future plans they will study.

4,"Feudal politics with ray guns is easy to write and to read because both writers and readers have a template in their mind. Writers have a sense of how such societies worked, and find it convenient to adapt a setting which promises lots of action and intrigue. The Roman Empire is popular for the same reason. It is much harder to think through the possibilities of real social and political dynamics as Kim Stanley Robinson did in the Mars trilogy, or to image radically different societies, as Iain Banks did in the Culture novels and N.

8,"Because public opinion is in the hands of western countries such as the United States and Europe, the BBC, Fox and NYT tell you that you think China will rule the world. But why do these media tell you that China will rule the world instead of Japan or South Korea? Because Japan and South Korea are the servants of the United States, the United States will only allow these countries to develop limited industries and companies, and limit their armed forces, so that they can never surpass the United States and challenge the United States.

If you are old enough, you should remember that in the 1980s, these media also said that Japan would rule the world and Japan would buy the United States. At that time, Japan's economic strength was closest to that of the United States, and its per capita GDP was far higher than that of the United States. However, the United States forced Japan to sign some agreements, which interrupted Japan's development momentum and widened the gap with the United States.Another reason for mainstream media saying that China has implemented a political system totally different from that of the United States and even the whole west. In the past, when China was very poor, the United States could help China develop. But when China's development is getting better and better, the United States and the whole west will worry that if the existing developing countries think that China's system is more suitable for them and follow China, then the world system carefully constructed by the United States and developed countries for hundreds of years will be over.

However, there are tens of millions of people in China who can do this analysis. What is important is not the absolute population, but the high percentage.The Chinese like to discuss power struggling between groups in the world. It's actually their biggest hobby. They are essentially not interested in harmonious coexistence of different groups.We have already experienced the German Empire, Nazi Germany, and Imperial Japan, who dreamed of conquering the world. China is essentially like them. The only difference is that if the first three groups tried to do it as a short-term military operation, but China is doing it in a very long-term view and in various fields.I hope you know that and observe and study China from now.Simply put, the optimism about China that exists in the Western world is completely stupid.But I am not calling for a military confrontation itself. The rest of the world, except China, has to be changed to fight in the same way as China. With a long-term perspective, in a way that all disciplines cooperate.When we get excited they will come out with a gentle attitude and then we will have a long time of fatigue that came from tension. At that time, China will grow its strength. China claims that China is the defender, but in fact they are attackers. They are leading all of these.They have this confrontation philosophy. ""He who is more patient wins.""Unlike Germany and Japan, China’s intention as expansionist’s one has never been frustrated with its dream of conquering the world. Little by little they will deceive us and slowly encroach on our territory.We have to frustrate them for our posterity. Although each Chinese person is very good and there are many good people, the totalitarian state is always driven by a small number of greedy people, and it is such people who are currently leading China.I don't want to see stupid optimism about China anymore. Even if the end of our efforts to become similar to China is Chineseization, our only choice should be stopping China, expansionist country.

In addition, there are some more objective reasons, such as air pollution and food safety, which can be troublesome.These feelings are sometimes amplified by what I call the “China sucks” feedback loop.In order to relieve the stresses outlined above, some westerners like to sit around in expat bars complaining about China and the Chinese. Their WeChat groups feeds are full of media that validate the “China sucks” narrative; videos, photos, stories, and memes featuring Chinese people driving badly, being rude tourists, assaulting or cheating foreigners, littering, spitting, etc. Also there are stories of Chinese cops or other officials harassing expats.Anyway, if you find a group of successful and mature westerners in China, they are unlikely to dislike the place. Westerners who really dislike the place are very often people who are having issues in some aspect of their lives, and whose anti-China views are constantly being validated and re-validated.Westerners living in their home countries.Now, if you are talking about westerners in their home countries who somehow dislike China, that’s a different story. This is likely due to the constant stream of disinformation about China and its activities. You have to understand that China’s economic and military ascension is a scary thing. For the past 100 (?) years the western counties have ruled the world economy— that looks like it’s come to an end. It’s hard to adjust.Take just one example: the South China Sea “dispute”. If you look at it from a Chinese perspective, it’s perfectly natural that China should carve out it’s own portion of the SCS. Everyone else has been doing it for decades and no one complained. In addition, look at how many US military installations are arrayed along China’s coast, between Taiwan and Vladivostok. And with the US and Vietnam getting more friendly with one another, it makes sense that China should reserve it’s own space.OK. That’s the a reasonable China perspective. But if you’re in the US, you may not even know, or may not notice, that the US has stationed itself across China’s doorstep and outside it’s backyard fence. You almost certainly don’t know that SE Asian countries have been claiming parts of the SCS for years. So it seems like a clear case of Chinese aggression.So the media tells you that China is threatening your economic and military dominance, and is a growing threat to world peace.

According to Wikipedia, “But today, most Hui people rarely have connections with people from central Aisa, many young Hui people marry non-muslims. Take my family as an example, my grandfather married another Hui woman, but my dad later married my mother who is not Muslim, and my brother married a non-muslim as well. Most young Hui people I know of don’t mind marrying non-Muslims, and many of them have dropped their Islam belief. so I can take a bold guess, in dozens of years, most Hui people will just be same as Han Chinese.In Northwest of China, you can still see a lot of mosques, but there is one thing that is particular important to understand Islam in China is that in front of every mosque, there stands China’s national flag. It means no matter what religion you have, you are part of PRC, and no matter what God you believe, you need to learn Marxism in schools.Najiahu Mosque, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, northwest of China (picture from Baidu)Besides, China has its own civilization for thousands of years, its own culture and beliefs. Islam was never dominant in China and I don’t think it will be.This is my opinion, hope it helps.",804 followers,Manas Chawla,7.5K,235,1.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-so-much-modern-science-fiction-like-feudalism-with-ray-guns-highly-advanced-technology-in-a-reactionary-political-system

17,"First of all, I am a Chinese. Just for your record.Both countries have rich cultures. I respect both countries. I would say traditional Chinese culture and Japanese culture have a lot similarities. They all value manners very much. I would say, as a whole country, Japanese people value manners more than modern Chinese. The reason is that China went through a time period when it tried to abolish “the old”, including superstition, traditional hierarchy view (sons listen to the fatter, women listen to the men), and so on.

The reason is that China went through a time period when it tried to abolish “the old”, including superstition, traditional hierarchy view (sons listen to the fatter, women listen to the men), and so on. Since the process happened so fast and thorough, and due to the misconsideration of initiators, good traditions and values were attacked as well. China stands so quickly on global stage, when we ever comment on its strength, we should be aware of the consequences. So, for people who comment on China, I hope you can also analyse it from two sides.Luckily, the awareness of Chinese culture is rising now, for Chinese citizens and for curious foreigners.I like Japan for their attitude at doing things. Many Japanese people I know do not bother others, and respect each individual’s life choice. Oh, I like the food there! Japan and China both have great dishes!!!! I had a classmate who’s father is Chinese and mother is Japanese. I would use her example to talk about Japan. She have lived in China and Japan both for many years. She told me that Japan is more a closed-off country than China. The hierarchy thing is crazy in Japan. It shows manners on one hand, on the other hand, it represses people. They are less open to global trends and news. She studies in International high school in China. She was very sad to study university in Japan, because it meant going back to a world that is narrowed down.The only thing I have strong feeling against Japan is its attitude to history. As a country, it disrespects history. Japan should really study from Germany.Besides, my friends and I use google in China. We read books by Japanese authors; we watch Japanese movies; and we toured in Japan. Most Chinese are open to the unknown. We try to understand the others, not only the Japanese.","1,011 followers",Tsien-Hsin Yu,613,699,2.2M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-many-people-often-say-China-will-rule-the-world-Why-dont-they-say-Japan-or-Korea-will-since-both-are-developed-countries-and-have-advanced-technologies-as-well
18,"The gap among this three countries, is actually because of America. The only way is to keep China growing rapidly. Once China is strong enough to contend against America, then Japan and South Korea may probably give up America and unit with China. After all, we are all yellow races and have similar cultures, just like British and France.I would like to show you some interesting pictures.The gap among this three countries, is actually because of America.
