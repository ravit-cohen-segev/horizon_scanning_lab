0,"Let’s look at some of the predictions from the foremost experts in the field, and how likely they are to come to pass.1)Data volumes will continue to grow. There’s absolutely no question that we will continue generating larger and larger volumes of data, especially considering that the number of handheld devices and Internet-connected devices is expected to grow exponentially.2)Ways to analyse data will improve. While SQL is still the standard, Spark is emerging as a complementary tool for analysis and will continue to grow, according to Ovum.3)More tools for analysis (without the analyst) wilLet’s look at some of the predictions from the foremost experts in the field, and how likely they are to come to pass.1)Data volumes will continue to grow.

While SQL is still the standard, Spark is emerging as a complementary tool for analysis and will continue to grow, according to Ovum.3)More tools for analysis (without the analyst) will emerge. Microsoft and Salesforce both recently announced features to let non-coders create apps to view business data.4)Prescriptive analytics will be built in to business analytics software. IDC predicts that half of all business analytics software will include the intelligence where it’s needed by 2020.So according to my research field of Big data& data analytics will have highest number of job opportunities as well as salaries would be sky rocketed with experience.","90,340 followers",Alisha Talks,21.9K,910,103.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-sector-of-the-technology-industry-will-have-the-most-job-openings-and-job-opportunities-in-the-next-5-years
1,"A woman in a domestic violence situation called 911, pretending to order pizza.The dispatcher answered the call and told the woman she had dialed the incorrect number. She insisted she was through to the right person, and it was only then did he realize what was happening.Tim Teneyck had seen similar scenarios being shared on social media, but never thought he’d be in the same position today.Here's a transcript of the conversation:Mr Teneyck:Caller:Mr Teneyck:Caller:Continue ReadingA woman in a domestic violence situation called 911, pretending to order pizza.The dispatcher answered the call and told the woman she had dialed the incorrect number. She insisted she was through to the right person, and it was only then did he realize what was happening.Tim Teneyck had seen similar scenarios being shared on social media, but never thought he’d be in the same position today.Here's a transcript of the conversation:Mr Teneyck:Caller:Mr Teneyck:Caller:Mr Teneyck:Caller:Mr Teneyck:Throughout the call, the woman found methods to respond to Mr Teneyck’s yes or no questions.Mr Teneyck:Caller:Mr Teneyck:Caller:The back and forth questions worked. The perpetrator who came home intoxicated and began to behave violently, was caught and arrested.In that moment, the daughter had to think quickly to protect herself and her mother — a hero!Mr Teneyck encouraged victims from that day onwards, to use the words “pepperoni pizza” as a magic word if the abusive person is in close proximity, when calling 911.I can only imagine how difficult his job is. The amount of patience and emotional control a person needs for this career is admirable. He could have easily brushed it off as a prank call, but his dedication to this woman is inspiring.Sitting on the other side of the phone line, not being able to physically be there in person, but to save someone through your words requires strength.","41,553 followers",Rakshith Akira,3.9K,467,18.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-sector-of-the-technology-industry-will-have-the-most-job-openings-and-job-opportunities-in-the-next-5-years

It is not going to be investment banking, private equity, consulting, hedge funds or venture capital. Can you guess?It is the FINTECH . In my opinion, financial services has faced the least disruption over time. May be credit card, ATM, Pay pal. Anything big you can think of. Now comes the fintech revolution. Currently, one of the industries facing the most exciting innovotive disruption is the financial services. Financial Technology ( Fintech) has the potential to revolutionize the way consumers undertaking financial transactions. It can range from facilitating mobile and online payments and transactions, providing financial planning and advisory, help consumers and businessess in receiving loans and financing.The size of the fintech market is steadily on the rise. You know, which is fintech capital of the world. Any guesses? It is London. Brexit is putting a cloud on its dreams. Yet pundits are of the opinion, that London will overcome the temporary difficulties. Germany is trying to snatch away something from London. It even ran a van across London with a message, 'Dont worry ! Come to Berlin' No doubt the fintech startups in London are worried and some are seriously considering moving to many alternative attractions in Europe, but nothing can replace London. Dublin in Ireland can come closest.Now coming to US. Again another trivia. New York fintech startups attracted more funding than fintechs in silicon valley. In US alone, about 20k fintech startups responsible for creating 500k jobs. More than $50 B is reported to have been invested in fintechs around the world. In the the first quarter ending March 2016, it is estimated fintechs have attracted an investment of $5B.Let me list some of the familiar areas in fintech and some popular and some less popular names currently in fintech.There are thousands around the world aiming big.1. PAYMENTS: PAYPAL, Square, Transferwise, Coin and Stripe.2. TREASURY functions: Coinbase, Digital Assets Holdings, Blockstream, Ripple.3. LENDING: CreditKarma, Sofi, Lending Club, Prosper, Funding Circle, Kabbage, LendUp, OneDeck, Avant.4. RETAIL BANKING: Circle Internet Financial, Mozido.5. INVESTMENT BANKING: Kensho, Circleup, Axial, Iex.6. WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Robinhood, Wealthfront, Betterment.7. FINANCIAL INFO: Angellist, Equidate.These are only handful and there are hundreds of them around the world joggling for place.On their part, Big banks like Citibank ( it has more than 50 percent of its business from retail banking and hence most threatened) have set up a seperate nucleus unit to work on fintech solutions and JPMorgan is following a unique method of allowing fintech startups to work hand-in-hand with their staff, for a period of 6 months and any successful start-up will have the benefit of funding from the bank.The answer is getting too long. I have not talked about crypo currencies, block chain technology and so on.So if you want a piece of action, prepare yourself .",4 followers,Matthew Bates,553,9.8K,293.1M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Which-sector-of-the-technology-industry-will-have-the-most-job-openings-and-job-opportunities-in-the-next-5-years

This led to the creation of “specialists”- a handful of people who were masters of the art.Today, internet has completely changed the dynamic. To learn Data Science, I can choose from 10,000 resources on the internet. Just 10 years ago, it wouldn't have been possible. This has led to the creation of “generalists”- people who are jacks of many trades and masters of probably none.Thing is, we need generalists as much as we need specialists. Generalized skills can be transferred at a rapid pace thus quickly building up a work force.Internet can easily be used to transfer these skills from one part of the globe to another. This no longer limits tech innovation and tech jobs to miniscule pockets in developed countries.As a result, tech jobs are springing up in the remotest of areas in the most backward of countries. A lot of these places are giving competition to Silicon Valley. Even in USA itself, cities are trying increase the number and quality of tech jobs...",114 followers,Hemant Sharma,16.7K,151,2.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-sector-of-the-technology-industry-will-have-the-most-job-openings-and-job-opportunities-in-the-next-5-years
