I'm not a computer scientist. I cannot learn from theory, I must learn by doing. I'm as much right-brained as I'm left brained. I cannot stand vim or emacs because the margins are fucked up and prefer Sublime. I enjoy the wind in my hair as I blaze ahead with Ruby on Rails or Meteor (I'm a pretty goddamn good coder, but I'll never reach guru-grokkery in binary tree search, terminal commands and emacs shortcuts.

While I appreciate and admire the discipline and dedication that it takes to get to that point of mastery (and on bad days they make me feel like I need to build more muscle), but I'm just not able to stick to a vertical for long enough to get to that level, nor do I feel a proper desire to do so.Instead, I know shitloads of things because I'm a euphoric goldfish when it comes to learning new stuff (the new thing I've discovered is always theTry to find an approach to programming that worksOr byOrI don't mean to imply that there isn't a lot of theory and good practices in software development that you need to learn.

5,"Definitely C++ and Python.C++ to do the work in the framework and Python to command the framework.Yes, Python is not the main language, the main language is C++. Python is the language that sends the requirements to the framework and presents the answers to humans. The real work is done in libraries written in C++.If your work can be done using algorithms that are already written in C++, you will probably only use Python to handle the framework to do well know tasks. However, if you are developing new algorithms, you must implement them in CDefinitely C++ and Python.C++ to do the work in the framework and Python to command the framework.Yes, Python is not the main language, the main language is C++.

However, if you are developing new algorithms, you must implement them in C++.The more you stray from the existing algorithms, the more you need to work in C++. The more you use existing algorithms, the more you will use Python.Therefore, C++ and Python make up a very powerful tool that allows you to be very efficient, thinking at different levels of abstraction.I believe that this powerful tool (C++ - Python) is not unique to AI and could be used in almost all scientific investigations.Finally, I must clarify that of that pair, C++ today is insubtituible, while Python can be replaced by other languages ​​such as Julia or R.

College made me see how wrong I was.Knowing a lot of languages is fine to show to your professors and friends how much you know. However, the more programming languages you learn, the more you will realize that most of them do the same job or can achieve the same result. It’s nice to know a lot of stuff but from an industrial point of view, it won’t prove your talent/skill when required.>Are these languages enough to get“I’m going to learn every programming language out there so that I can become the best programmer ever.”I was of the same opinion as you were when I was in my first year too.

Your interviewer, when looking at your resume, will not look at the “Programming Languages known/Technical skills” section. Instead he will look at “Projects”.Let me give a very simple example here. Suppose Thomas Alva Edison experimented a few thousand times to invent the lightbulb. What would have happened if his research never came to light? (Pun not intended) What if nobody came to know about his lightbulb? All his hardwork would have gone to waste.Similarly, all the hardwork you put in to learn those languages will go to waste if you have nothing to show for it. So start building apps. You know C# and SQL? Build some webapps with either old or new ideas. Publish research papers and projects in conferences. Go for internships. These will help you more than learning languages over and over again.You have a brilliant headstart with your vast knowledge of programming languages. Most of my classmates didn’t even know C during our first year (some still don’t). Create a Github profile. Learn how to use Git and version control. Learn how to host webapps on servers. Programming is much more than knowing just languages.By your final year, with all those projects and internships, you will have created a resume so strong that none others can compare to. From a completely technical standpoint, job guaranteed. But there is much more to interviews than just technical knowledge.Cheers.",72 followers,Bui Quang Tuan,958,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-website-to-read-about-technology-rankings-and-the-upcoming-programming-languages
