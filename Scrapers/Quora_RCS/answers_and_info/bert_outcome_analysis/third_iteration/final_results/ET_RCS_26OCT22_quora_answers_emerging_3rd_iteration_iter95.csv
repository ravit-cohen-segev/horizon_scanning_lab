Otherwise, Florida (Tampa/St. Petersburg ) is a better option. If both were cars, California would be a Ferrari, whereas Florida would be something like a Lexus sedan.. both great vehicles, but the Lexus is much cheaper and easy to maintain while still being very nice, where as California is flashy, expensive, and lots of fun if you can easily afford to buy, maintain, and insure it.Lets start by saying California and Florida are magnets for insane people. Something about the warm weather just draws them in like moths to a flame, from all parts of the US. But in the end, Florida seems like it has a few more. Or maybe its just that California balances it out with more people I feel are better socially adapted. From this perspective, California wins slightly.Californians are very open about politics… in fact, you can’t stop them from discussing politics if you try. Floridians just don’t seem to talk about them as much. So if you’re a non political person like me, its nice to escape that. Note: its not that Floridians aren’t political, its just they are pretty much 50/50 on both sides and people generally aim to avoid conflict (in California, its pretty much known where most people stand).California has earthquakes which can kill you without warning, Florida has hurricanes that can also kill you but comes with a warning of a few days… combine this with water shortages and droughts in California, and the frequent wild fire that seems to kill a dozen or so people each time, and Florida wins this round if self preservation is of concern.California has more high paying jobs and a great tech industry (I work in tech), but those funds quickly disappear to taxes, housing, and gas costs. Florida doesn’t have as well rounded of an economy as California and is largely based on hospitality, although its becoming more diversified as people/companies from all over the US relocate here.Florida has nicer sandy beaches, crystal clear water, and warmer year round weather, California has better cliffs that drop in the ocean with amazing views and mountains you can hike, as well as very pleasant weather most of the year along the coast. California is surfing with a wet suit or looking at the cold water from a high end restaurant, Florida is swimming casually with a mojito in hand… both have good sailing, although Florida you can quickly sail to the Caribbean whereas Hawaii is far from California (both close to Mexico). Florida is very humid and green, California is very dry except way up north. There is no clear winner on this one.In regards to costs, Florida is the clear winner. The median home value in California (per Zillow and other sites) is $549,000 vs Florida’s 299,000, and California has much higher t...",0 followers,Justin Mark,1.2K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-technology-upgrades-kids-can-do-for-their-parents-while-visiting-over-the-holidays
6,"Thanks for asking, Justin!When I was growing up in Tallahassee, Florida primarilyThanks for asking, Justin!When I was growing up in Tallahassee, Florida primarilyFlorida is considered by many today to be a red state, mostly because of the change in state leadership switching from primarily Democratic to primarily Republican over the last nearly-three decades, but it’s actually more purple than anything else. There is still a strong Democratic population in the state, and it’s beginning to regain some of its former power. The current Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, just barely held onto his seat in the 2018 elections; the race between him and Democrat (and Tallahassee mayor) Andrew Gillum was so close that there had to be a statewide vote recount before either could concede the election to the other.

The pain of compile time on these builds is so great that Google has invented build tools that separate the dependency analysis and compiling, just to gain a few per cent in build time using conventional languages. Go is designed for quick compilation without the need for dependency checking, so it addresses the build pain.Google’s other problem is string processing. Google reads and analyzes a lot of web pages, which are text files. They do a lot of string manipulation, so it pays for this to be really efficient. Google built a rich library of string functions into Go, Garbage collecting makes strings in Go simple to think about, and efficient in ways some other string libraries are not (I’m talking toEverybody thinks they’re a language designer. Microsoft and Apple had their own languages, (Apple has two these days). Google decided they needed their own, I guess. Then Facebook joined the proprietary language party, leaving only poor homely Amazon alone at the language dance. As a language design, Go is not unreasonable. It does what it says on the tin. It’s not in any way innovative, but certainly well designed for a very specific use.Go has good concurrency support, which is essential for a language designed after 2002, and for companies who have a million servers waiting to be spun up. But it’s not breaking new ground in concurrency.Go = C + strings + garbage collection + concurrency.

He did a “hackamonth” in Facebook AI Research (which is a one-month period where you get to work with another team), and they hired him as a software engineer.That being said, a PhD program is one of the best places to do research (and it’s the only place where you can get formally trained as a researcher). There’s not as much urgency as in a company, so you can spend a lot of time reading literature and delving into the state of the art. You also kind of get to work on whatever you want (as opposed to in a company, where research is generally guided by business priorities). So I highly recommend doing a PhD if you are really interested in research.It’s much easier to do a PhD and then get a research job than it is to straight-up get a research job at a company. You kind of have to be very special to do the latter (especially if it’s a real research job, instead of a software engineering job on a research team).","7,036 followers",Rob Ennals,6.2K,130,3.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-technology-firms-in-the-state-of-Florida
