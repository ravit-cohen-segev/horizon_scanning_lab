UAT graduates are recognized by large tech companies and government organizations that need cybersecurity skills. They host many tech user groups and are very supportive of the overall tech community.","45,632 followers",David Seidman,858,3.6K,85.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-University-of-Advancing-Technology-prestigious-or-recognizable-to-big-tech-companies

Its sort of like the Igbo proverb (everyone I think has a version) about broom sticks being easy to snap but not the broom itself.Take a cursory glance through a map of the continent, you’ll see a correlation between the strength of national identity, stability and long-term economic performance. Stability and long term economic performance in turn leads to technological advancement.

I think AI will kill jobs, and over time, AI might kill most “jobs” as we know them. I think that people are somewhat complacent in regard to the economic impact of AI, and will likely be ill-prepared for the changes we have to adapt to in the not-so-distant future.First, let's start with the comparisons to machinery and automation. They did indeed put factory workers out of work. In that respect, I agree AI today is similar in many applications, replacing workers who have less specialized skills, perhaps call center operators, office assistants (in a limited extent), and maybe soon, taxi drivers and truck drivers. But I would argue that AI is fundamentally different from machinery or most of the other analogies commonly made when answering this question, because AI is growing and is unlikely to stop growing. It's growing in breadth (of applications and industries), in geographic and economic scope, and in power (it's capacity to address increasingly complex tasks). A more fitting analogy would be machinery in an automobile plant that not only made the parts one day, but then learned how to assemble them the week after, and then how to design cars a year later.I think that there is little that is out of reach for advanced AI of the future. Let's leave the question of the AI singularity alone for now. Instead, I think that deep learning efforts at Google and elsewhere are making AI systems learn faster and faster, with a growing rate of acceleration. Advanced AI can now address increasingly complex tasks including medical diagnosis, stock market trading, weather prediction and human behavioral modeling. Very soon, it will be able to take the place of certain types of teachers, and find a role in education. It can already deal with complex systems in software and mathematics, and seems to be only limited in applications that require interactions with the physical world (sensors are still imperfect), and with people.So without projecting too far into the future, we can ask the question, what jobs will NOT be killed by AI? Jobs that involve labor are already (or soon to be) replaced. Jobs that require logical reasoning are being replaced, albeit at a slower rate. What are the qualities that humans have that cannot be captured by AI? Perhaps creativity, emotional responses? So perhaps researchers in academia will survive longer than most, and artists (though AI stylistic mimicry is already quite impressive and their results enjoyable), and counselors/psychologists/case workers, and decision makers like CEOs who cannot be predictable or error prone. And hopefully software engineers and algorithm designers who develop AI systems.This leaves a very, very small portion of today's jobs intact. Many say: we just need to train people to fill higher level jobs created by AI, e.g. Programmers, ML researchers. But this is no easy feat. The US educational system is struggling to meet the demands created by advanced technology today. This failure is in part responsible for the economic divide plaguing the country today. The challenge of educating the public for a job market that is both decreasing in scope and increasing in complexity, is nothing we've ever faced before.I am far from original in this opinion. But if I had to guess, I would say that AI will put far more people out of work than we can (re)train in time. That will have significant economic repercussions as corporations seeking to minimize cost will do so at the cost of rising unemployment. There will need to be dramatic changes in social policies in order to avert large scale economic disaster, first dramatic rises in minimum wage, then eventually some type of universal income/welfare. It's the kind of change that requires significant leadership in our government, something that seems woefully absent today.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-University-of-Advancing-Technology-prestigious-or-recognizable-to-big-tech-companies

Most of these things below I think are cool but are mostly either too expensive, underutilized, or create a multitude of issues.2.It was a little thicker than a standard credit card, but it contained all of your medical records. Including emergency contact information. it could contain any or all of your credit cards. On your home PC you would load up the info on the credit cards you want to use, and set the applicable priorities. For example you could set the default to use the card with the highest available credit, or the lowest APR, etc. When working with a compatible scanner you could make changes on the fly. It serves as both your passport and any other applicable id that may be required. Like Military ID, or here in the states it would have been a Social Security card. It was yet another step of having everything bundled together. There were a lot of security concerns, as well as some big brother concerns, but ultimately it became moot as most of that functionality can now be done with smart phone apps.3.4.The second was an oven with an integrated INTERNAL webcam. You could watch that turkey roast while you were at home without having to open the oven. Or if you were cooking a roast, you could time it to be done when you got home from work. But you are delayed. So when it is done cooking it would go to a warming temperature, and then eventually a COOLING temperature. To the best of my knowledge this failed to really take off because of some serious concerns about food safety. And how about not wanting THAT to get hacked.5.These were just some fun and wacky ones I liked. Hope you had fun with it.","2,863 followers",Rhasheed Vickers,600,4.2K,25.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-University-of-Advancing-Technology-prestigious-or-recognizable-to-big-tech-companies
