Extrinsic:Everything that influences your decision and opinion is stored here (ex: why do you like certain music, food or fashion)The interesting part is this motivation usually does not last more than 3–6 months.3. Obsessions:This stores your passions but also your addictions such as being a workaholic, drugs, shopaholic and chasing stuff.When it’s on, you are not free to choose what you want anymore and will go after the obsession.# Imagination:This is the marvel of evolution, it’s what makes us human.Your imagination driver gives you creativity and adaptation.It should take control when dealing with new and complex situations that require you to think out of the box.People usually don’t let imagination driver take control and stick to their motivation driver instead, which leads them to lose out on big innovations.Examples:These mistakes happened because the people in charge relied on their motivation driver which only thinks from what it already knows - if they had used their imagination driver, they can see a future that Steve Jobs saw.When your imagination driver is taking control, you feel calm and in full control.How to activate it on command? think for yourself these questions:Making yourself answer these questions in your head activates the imagination driver.In conclusion we can say that even though our brain is too complex to summarise in a Quora post, this framework gives us a better idea on how we go about our daily lives and how we can use this knowledge to live a better life.Hope this helps you as much as it helped me.I might be updating this post with more findings, follow it if you want to keep updated.All the best!","68,804 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-that-as-humans-evolve-at-a-slower-and-slower-rate-that-our-technology-will-evolve-at-a-faster-and-faster-rate
8,"The reason why human brain developed to be so advanced compared to any other being has to do with the existence and location of the NOTCH2NL genes.Scientists for long have been baffled for explanations to this question why human brains evolved so much over the last million years while many other beings just didn’t cut it through. The question would inevitably lead to surprising answers as our closest relative chimpanzee shared about 99% of our genome.

The question would inevitably lead to surprising answers as our closest relative chimpanzee shared about 99% of our genome. It was always going to be daunting to find out which one of the remaining 1% made 99.99% of the difference in the brain size vis-a-vis other creatures - How did human brain alone evolve with such a high cognitive abilities?Several dozens of ‘human-specific’ genes have been found in the human genome, but their role has often remained unknown. Many of these genes are thought to be non-functional or redundant and are not even appropriately annotated in genome databases. Since we share so many of our genes even with simple organisms like worms, it was concluded that genes in themselves can’t account for all of the answers we are looking for. Gene duplication may have led to outcomes like novel genes in species which resulted in outsized rapid emergence of human specific traits like increased size of brain cortex.Looking for the answer, Scientist Pierre Vanderhaeghen and his team hypothesized that NOTCH2NL genes could act as species-specific regulators of brain size. Remarkably they found that Notch2NL can expand human cortical stem cells and thereby increase the number of cortical neurons.Reason for this hypothesis is also the location of these genes: on the first chromosome, in a region that had previously been linked to disease-related changes in brain size, such as micro and macrocephaly. American scientists led by David Haussler analysed DNA of patients with these conditions and concluded that, indeed, origin of these conditions corresponds with the region where NOTCH2NL genes are located.Basically, a unique gene and its perfect location are the two accidents of nature which later evolved to the complex human brain we have today. The complex brain which is more complex than the least known regions of the deepest ocean; We each have something approaching 100 billion nerve cells – neurons – in the human brain (more than the number of stars in the Milky Way). Each of them can be connected directly with maybe 10,000 others, totalling some 100 trillion nerve connections. If each neuron of a single human brain were laid end to end they could be wrapped around the Earth twice over. All because of a small difference in what we started off with vis-a vis other beings.So next time you think of evolution, forget the Pareto’s principle or 80/20 rule. As far as evolution is concerned, it is just 0.01% which over time in millions of years which makes 99.99% of the difference in evolution - A single grain of sand among trillions which moves and brings down the entire sand castle.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-that-as-humans-evolve-at-a-slower-and-slower-rate-that-our-technology-will-evolve-at-a-faster-and-faster-rate

But it is also likely that somewhere in our dispersed species, some individuals or group of individuals will have a mutation that makes them resistant to that biological threat. And since any new humans would result from that smaller group, that indeed would be an example of “natural selection” showing up in our evolution.There is no such thing as “good” evolution or “forward” evolution.
