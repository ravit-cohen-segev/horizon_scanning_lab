0,Haven’t most things? The question is why the Western toilet hasn’t evolved. My theory is Americans first saw bidets in France in World War I and associated them with naughty things like prostitution.

1,"Simply no space. Japanese bathrooms are tiny, there is no space for a proper Bidet so they do two things with one tool. I've seen simplified versions of Japanese toilets also in Indonesia, with a spray of water that wash your butt…it doesn't matter the temperature since in Indonesia is always hot…the real question is why most countries still use just paper and don't implement anything like that.",0 followers,Le Hao,4.2K,373,2.8M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-caused-the-Japanese-toilet-to-evolve-into-the-technological-wonder-that-it-is-today
2,"It’s not a technological wonder by any means.A Japanese toilet is no different from other toilets, only the seat is different as it has a cheap and simple electric heating system built in, and also a water nozzle which splashes your buttocks with water.This “technological wonder” is nothing more than a little heater and a little nozzle with a pump behind it. Don’t be fooled by it.The reason why it hasn’t spread beyond Japan is because it is wasteful (energy), and first of all not hygienic as it is hard to clean and introduces unnecessary complications to a very simple system.All the nooks andIt’s not a technological wonder by any means.A Japanese toilet is no different from other toilets, only the seat is different as it has a cheap and simple electric heating system built in, and also a water nozzle which splashes your buttocks with water.This “technological wonder” is nothing more than a little heater and a little nozzle with a pump behind it.

4,"There is no single greatest invention. Issac Newton, one of the greatest inventors of all time, famously said ""If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."" What he meant was that all new innovation and discovery is based upon small incremental improvements upon the previous work of others. Many times that work is done in parallel without one party being aware of the other parties simultaneous discovery.

Issac Newton, one of the greatest inventors of all time, famously said ""If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."" What he meant was that all new innovation and discovery is based upon small incremental improvements upon the previous work of others. Many times that work is done in parallel without one party being aware of the other parties simultaneous discovery. How is one to parse out a single invention without listing all of the previous underlying inventions?I learned long ago that inventions are effectively just recorded artifacts exploited for nationalistic purposes. For example, research the invention of the airplane. Most Americans will tell you that the inventors were the Wright brothers from Ohio. If you ask the Romanians they will tell you it was Traian Vuia. If you ask New Zealanders, they will say Richard Pearse. I could go on and on. Probably 20% of the countries in the world would each have a different name on file. And each one of those names could without doubt be associated with some small incremental advancement in flight.Inventions in America at the time of the Wright brothers were not subject to the vastness of a Google search nor did/do modern patent examiners have fluency in every language in the world, let alone access to translated scientific works. What prior inventions does one expect a patent examiner to uncover with only a couple thousand dollars worth of time and resources to expend?There is a famous historical confrontation between Gottfried Leibnitz and Isaac Newton regarding who first discovered Calculus. They both accused each other of stealing the other's work. I only mention this because it is generally accepted that Gottfried Leibnitz invented binary mathematics, which is the basis for virtually all computers used on the planet except for quantum computers. So if one answered your question by saying it was the computer, would Leibnitz's invention come up in the discussion? What about Konrad Zuse's invention of the computer while working in his parents living room in 1938? Many would say that all the German Zuse did was invent a programmable computer, rather Charles Babbage from the UK was the original inventor even though there is no practical use for a computer than can't be programmed. In America, probably we would hear names like John Atanasoff or Cliff Barry only because a Federal Judge named Larson decided he would determine the inventor when challenged to decide between them and the inventors of the Eniac described as the first general purpose computer.",269 followers,Karthik Reddy L,16K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-caused-the-Japanese-toilet-to-evolve-into-the-technological-wonder-that-it-is-today

10,Ahem…Cars are not an investment they are a way to spend money… the trick is to spend less money and get better value for it…Choosing carefully when ever a car is purchased is the key to doing well in this regard…My choice would be something built by Tesla and my preference would be to wait for the base Model 3… or a used Model S….I don’t need all the latest gadgets - I am interested in the nuts and bolts of the car and these both fit my criteria for value and technology over the long term….,11 followers,Lamar Jackson,885,625,656.1K,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-caused-the-Japanese-toilet-to-evolve-into-the-technological-wonder-that-it-is-today

12,"A car is never an investment. (Unless it’s a true collectible). Buy it because you want it or need it, not because you’re thinking about the money. Regular cars will have value for several more decades in the US. Unless you think you can afford an, as of now, non existent fully autonomous electric car, just buy a regular car and move on with your life.
