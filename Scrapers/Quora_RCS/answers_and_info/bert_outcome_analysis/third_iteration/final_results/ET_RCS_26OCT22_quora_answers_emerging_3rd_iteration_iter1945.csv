In all of these industries, corruption and inefficiencies are rampant, making rich people even richer at the cost of the poor and the middle class, costing lifes, polluting the environment, enabling lots of fraud and scams.Some of these blockchain have already found usage and we can expect for some of them to become the standard worldwide in several industries.Here, you have a few more use cases in a nice infographic.If you found this post helpful, please give an upvote. :)","31,158 followers",Phillip Remaker,1.7K,11K,78.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-promising-products-that-will-support-the-Blockchain-technology

What is the pattern here?Not only do we need to see the pattern, but also one step before and after it:Here is the pattern:(illustration credit) which is the “why” part.Here is how to think about the pattern, the “what is going on” part. I will keep the examples in this part within the power of 2 orA kind grandma has many grandchildren and loves to give candies to those grandchildren of hers who visit her. She gives even more candies if more children visit her together, like so: if a child went there alone, he’d getSo on Monday,Then they realized they could get even more candies if they all went there together. So when the boys and girls went there at the same time, each of theThat is, each of theAlthough simple, this is a powerful way of thinking. Suppose I ask you to solveWe factor them apart:(8100Now try solvingAnd the fun does not stop there. We can use5AddA perfect square! (a perfect square is the square of an integer, hereAnd of course, we can prove this for anyThe smaller number isTheir product:nAddingnSinceThis is equal toThe excellentTake the most common sequence1Now write the difference of the squared numbers under them:13The second row of numbers is an arithmetic progression where the numbers vary by a constant of 2. (Note thatBut why does the second arithmetic progression differ byBecause the consecutive numbers (inConsider now that sequence of the difference of the squares—our second arithmetic progression:If you’re not impressed already with the powerfulLet’s say we haveNow doGood. Now multiplyNow, to the end of2025Let’s try this again withCalculator says:8The excellent(Since we know the backstory and how(The two terms have an exponential in common, so we recast them as:(Multiply a to a and b to b, without changing the external exponent:(That is,NowaFor this next part, let’s jump up one step and try examples with the powers of 3. I am also going to use the wonderful Julia programming language (you can treat it as a calculator) to demonstrate a new link to the Binomial Triangle, aka Pascal’s Triangle, even though it was discovered several times before Pascal.If you are new to programming and Julia, you are in luck because I am currently releasing a beginner-friendly textbook that teaches both programming and Julia (for link, please see my profile); in any case if you are in a hurry, the explanation below is intuitive, so if you read carefully it should all make sense.Lines of code starting # are called comments, and are explanations of the actual code. Assuming Julia is installed on your computer, you launch Julia in the terminal, and then summon DSP:Now we can use convolution, which I’ll explain soon:(thenend of update.)Now let’s see what that was all about: an ordered list of numbers is called a vector. In the above example, our kernel is a vector, but so is the base. Multiplying two vectors is also called a dot product of two vectors:aMultiply x elements of a and b, then y elements of a and b, then add them all up. In Julia:Feel free to double-check this: 4 * 5 + 9 * 8 = 92.(end of update.)Now, convolution is like aImagine a machine that goes from right to left, multiplies the top and the bottom numbers, adds them up, and repeats this.(Then, we tackle the middle 1. Above it, we have a 1. Their product is 1, so we write this underneath. The left-most one follows the same outcome as the right-most 1.After we write these numbers, we add them all up horizontally: 0 + 1 + 1. I hope this is clear.Returning to our convolution example in Julia, the first convolution is:Note the pattern in the second and third and fourth and the nth:Cool! The machine analogy applies here; see how our Julia convolution produced the Binomial Triangle by going right-left right-left—like a printing machine—(as described in the definition of convolution).(end of update.)Alright, now let's look at the third row: the pattern is 1 3 3 1. Is it relevant to:a?Look at the coefficients of each term:a33bWe established a pattern, so we are halfway through predicting this for anyBut don’t just stop there. The Binomial Triangle can also be found as powers of 11. :)Neat! But why do we need convolution if we can do this so simply? You’ll see later why.We have come a long way from a mere:(Haven’t we?So now pay attention to the powers/exponents:a is to the power of 3 in the first term, while b is to the power of 0:aa is to the power of 2 in the second term:ab’s exponent is rising by 1, as a’s is falling by 1:aand finally:aWe have a new pattern, also called the combinatorics pattern:(Each tall bracket can be written asNewton wrote a neat formula for it (although the theorem was independently discovered by Cardano, and beforeBy this convention, there is only one way to choose 0 items from n items.Newton’s formula is based on the idea of a factorial (another inter-link to our previous topics). A factorial is simply a sum of consecutive products:What about 2 items out of 3? How many different ways of choosing this is possible?Using the factorial method:Three exact ways to choose 2 items out of 3. Let’s see this in practice and what it exactly means:You have a choice of 3 ice-cream flavours. Out of 3, how many unique combinations are possible when you choose only 2 ice-creams each time?Getting interesting right? Who would’ve thought that boring-looking(had such an interesting connection?Further, let’s see coefficients computed for each of the terms in:0th term is where there is no b since b^0 = 1 and b^0 *So 1 is the coefficient forNote, the 1st term is decided by the fact thatSo what is the coefficient for 1st term?Nice! It matches the coefficient in the first term :What about the second term (as I mentioned earlier I’d explain)?Which matches:And finally, the last term:Matching:1Given all this inter-linked ideas, we can predict and solve a binomial expansion under any reasonable n, by using the heuristics developed above.Solve:Well, from powers of 11 we know:The coefficients are:1 then 6 then 10 then …oops… because the Binomial Triangle isSo I think it is still safest to go back to our convolution result and check the 5th base:There!So the first coefficient is 1,then 5then 10then 10then 5then 1Giving us a symmetric skeleton:aNow let’s see what kinds of powers we can raiseThat is:and:SinceNow our output looks like this:aLet’s test it in Julia:Result:Okay so what happens if you don’t have Julia to compute for you?You see the pattern in the Binomial Triangle:Look at the 4th row. How did we get the 5 in the 5th row? By adding 1+4 in the 4th row! 10? by adding the left 4 to central 6 and another 10 by adding central 6 to the right 4. (On both sides, the triangle is flanked by 1 btw).Notice that each row tells us what the next row is, just like a linked list !This is how mathematics should be taught. Understand and you don’t need to memorize. Enjoy it. Mathematics is beautiful!All the best,Jan__Update__PS:It’s worth mentioning that when I was teaching mathematics at top-ranked universities in China, my students would often suggest that I compile and revise my lecture materials into books.In fact, on the strength of the anonymous student evaluations that you can see below, a well-known publisher offered to publish my books, but I did not like the payment terms in their contract and therefore declined as a matter of principle. Instead, only in 2022 have I finally found the time to publish my own book, which will be made available on my site:Anyway, the first screenshot is the evaluation rubric (to view, please click on the image).

3,"Discrete mathematicsSo 0, 1, 2 and 3 are all part of discrete mathematics. The same goes for -1, -2, -3 and so on. How about 1.3, 36.9, -9.99 or 3.14?

This actually makes the math much easier.ExampleIn∫In discrete mathematics, the equivalent calculation would go like this:∑So you see, the latter is much simpler. You just add all the numbers.Graphically, it would amount to this, where the continuous sum is the area below the red line while the discrete sum is the area below the blue line.Another continuous function (sine wave) may look like this:…while a discrete function (square wave) might look like this:I can tell you that the math behind the last one is a lot simpler.Why is it important for computer science?Since the bits are the building blocks of everything that happens in computer software, everything becomes discrete. For instance, the hard drive on the laptop I’m using right now can store 1 845 074 329 600 bits of information. Not 1 845 074 329 599.99, but exactly that number. You can’t have half a bit.The study of algorithms is also firmly in the discrete world. An algorithm is a step-by-step list of instructions to the computer and it’s what makes computer programs possible. When determining how much time an algorithm needs to run, you count the number of operations it needs to perform. Notice the wordDiscrete mathematics is the very foundation of computer science.
