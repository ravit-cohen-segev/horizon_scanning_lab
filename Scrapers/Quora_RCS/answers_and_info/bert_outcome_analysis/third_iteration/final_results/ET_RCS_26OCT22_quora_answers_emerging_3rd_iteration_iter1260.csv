Notable human advances include the first cultivation of rice (we also invented wine, so yeah, we've been drinking since before we invented the wheel). Just try and picture the technology difference between realizing you could plant, grow and eat rice and having quantum computers. In 8000 years we'll look back in the same way.

In 100–200 years we will be Type I,in thousand years we will reach Type II.Because growth of technology is exponential,more technology there is faster technology growth then in ~10 thousand years we will be able to harness the energy of the whole Milky Way.In 8000 years because we will be close to harnessing so much energy humans will probably already find aliens in our galaxy.Most likely not as clever as us.Wormholes will also be found thus people will live in various solar systems if not galaxies.Vacations will change from international to intergalactical.Or we will nuke ourselves and if anybody survives then they’ll have to start from 0.","5,084 followers",Bobby Tatro,3.9K,2.2K,45.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-imagine-technology-advancing-within-the-next-8000-years

Some competing technologies now are acquired to be boxed or assimilated into others.Two quotes come to mind.Albert Einstein, in an interview with Alfred Werner saidRobin Williams inHow will technology change in 8000 years? I believe it will be a mix of the above. We maybe forced to use rocks for somethings and choose to appreciate rocks for others. The same goes for high tech. What metric or resource that is important now, might not be important in the future. One could read Asimov’sWhat is valued now might not be considered important later.

For example, if you try to calculate the mass at the center of a black hole, your equations say it’s infinite.

So, at least with the information we have now, we can’t say for sure what either of those values are, or if they are even possible to know.Now, the technological singularity is a little different. The technological singularity is what could happen if a computer is taught to program and build computers. That computer will build a better computer, which will build a better computer, which will build a better computer, over and over, faster than a human can think. Soon, a computer will be created that is so ridiculously intelligent, we’ll seem no smarter than ants to it. So, humans trying to guess what that computer will do, or if it will do anything, is like a cat trying to guess which nations will go to war in the next decade.Now, that doesn’t mean we haven’t t...",UNKNOWN,P.E.

8,"The Singularity of course means something different to everyone, so short of all of existence becoming a black hole (and even then), the arrival of the Singularity will be an undecidable proposition.I do think it is inevitable that there will be a momentous, and perhaps wrenching, socioeconomic transition in the near future as informatics overtakes all fields of economic activity and converts our present order of monetary economics (which relies on the ""confidence"" of markets and is thus, in many respects, a faith-based system) to... ... ... well, something different.The issue is this: throughThe Singularity of course means something different to everyone, so short of all of existence becoming a black hole (and even then), the arrival of the Singularity will be an undecidable proposition.I do think it is inevitable that there will be a momentous, and perhaps wrenching, socioeconomic transition in the near future as informatics overtakes all fields of economic activity and converts our present order of monetary economics (which relies on the ""confidence"" of markets and is thus, in many respects, a faith-based system) to... ... ... well, something different.The issue is this: through the histories of all major civilizations, economic activity has been premised on scarcity; resources and goods are not simply available, they can be procured only through labor. Since labor-time is itself scarce (no one has the time to do all the work required to procure all the goods they might want), it was most optimal to divide labor into different types to be done by different people. Division of labor made trade more favorable  (the Law of Comparative Advantage), and when trade networks were regulated and secured by protections against fraud (standard weights and measures and standardized currencies), the result was the enormous proliferation of goods and wealth.However, advanced information technology seems to contain a possibility that subverts the foundation of classical economics. Everyone knows about Moore's Law, the exponential increase in processing power over time, as well as the radical (monetary) devaluation of processing power. An amount of computing power that cost millions to implement in the 1950s is now a tiny, tiny fraction of the computing power of your $400 netbook.But what's significant is not the advances in computing power, but rather the way in which previously valuable (i.e., scarce) forms of content -text, graphics, sound recordings, moving images- have been seized by computing and multiplied as freely copyable data.Goods are only priceable if they're scarce. In the age of high-powered computing, information is not scarce but wildly abundant. This obviously creates a huge economic problem (for the music and newspaper industries, and for many more sectors in the near future.)The real freakout will happen when material goods can be reproduced by information technology: hence, Kurzweil looks to nanomanufacturing (see 3D printing and the RepRap) and sees the end of the world as we know it.It is the creeping, inexorable, and very real transition from a resource-scarce economy to a data-abundant economy that I think gives rise to fantastic Singularitarian dreams.","5,084 followers",Bobby Tatro,3.9K,2.2K,45.6M,2010,https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-imagine-technology-advancing-within-the-next-8000-years

For example, the Internet will become available to residents of remote cities, and medicine will be able to fight rare genetic diseases.1. Mega-constellations of satellitesThe main goal of creating satellite mega-constellations is the desire of people to provide high-speed Internet access in all corners of the planet. The development and launch of such satellites is engaged, for example, by Elon Musk's Starlink company .2. Pocket Artificial IntelligenceArtificial intelligence technologies will become even more accessible to ordinary users in 2020. The smartphone will remain the main guide to the world of AI technologies, primarily due to smart applications.3. Artificial intelligence in microbiologyArtificial intelligence isn't just used for entertainment. With its help, doctors and biologists create new drugs and antibiotics, thanks to which it becomes possible to treat rare diseases. The use of AI technologies in medicine is significantly reducing costs in the industry.4. Quantum computersLast fall, Google officially announced its ""quantum supremacy"". However, the company admitted that while their technology is capable of performing only one calculation, and the use of quantum machines for solving ordinary problems remains in the distant future. But development continues and quantum reality is not far off.5. Forecasting climate changeThe increase in computing power has led to the fact that today humanity is better able to predict climate change and their consequences. These technologies will only develop. Over time, people will be able to better understand how to save the Earth and improve the ecological situation.6. Anti-aging drugsMedicine today deals not only with the treatment of the main "" diseases of the century "" such as cancer and heart pathologies. Doctors are also working on anti-aging drugs and life-extension technologies. Already, many of them are being successfully tested on humans.7. Safe InternetThe trend of the future is quantum networks. They are much more secure, and the information in them is better encrypted. So far, the quantum Internet remains the technology of the future, but developments in this area are being actively pursued today.8. Digital moneyDigitalization of currencies will only develop. Already, a huge number of people almost (or not at all) do not use paper money. Banking technology allows instant transactions and guarantees greater privacy and security.9. Hyperpersonalized medicineMedicines will adapt to the needs of each individual patient. This primarily concerns the treatment of rare genetic diseases. Hyper-personalized medicine will bring hope to many who suffer from incurable diseases.10. Differential PrivacyDifferential privacy will be used in 2020 during the US Census. This method allows you to collect a lot of information about specific people, but for specialists they will be impersonal.
