Do you have enough money to take a pay/benefits cut if you’d go smaller? What does your family think? What role would you be taking in this smaller company? Would you have more exposure (a con) but would you also have more creative/hiring/idea/spending freedom; would you gain in compensation later? What services and/or products would this smaller company have and are they valuable in the long-run; any buyouts of the company or product lineIf you’ve got 15+ years of general management experience in a larger corporate company(ies), what are you asking us for? What are your ultimate life goals? Do you have enough money to take a pay/benefits cut if you’d go smaller? What does your family think? What role would you be taking in this smaller company?

What services and/or products would this smaller company have and are they valuable in the long-run; any buyouts of the company or product line on the horizon? Will your smaller company be viable in 7 years (usually takes 2–5 years for a new company to emerge fully, get investors and get on stock exchange - to start making a profit).

2,"Very much so.99 years ago,As democracy is perfected, the office represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. We move toward a lofty ideal. On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart’s desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron.As far as I’m concerned, this is one of the most accurate predictions I’ve ever seen.","115,126 followers",Daveed Phoenix,3.1K,9.9K,160.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-a-good-advice-to-transition-from-general-management-roles-to-any-emerging-Technology-smaller-roles-given-technology-is-changing-rapidly-Will-it-be-a-good-decision-in-the-longer-run-With-about-15-years-of
