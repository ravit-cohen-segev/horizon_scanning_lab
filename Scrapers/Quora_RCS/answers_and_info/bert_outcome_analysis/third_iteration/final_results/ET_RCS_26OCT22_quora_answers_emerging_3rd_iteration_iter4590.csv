You have no idea. They might go years without spending a dime. They might develop a weird, rare form of cancer that costs three million dollars to treat. You don’t know.Get a six-sided die. Roll it. What number will you get?Could be a 1. Could be a 6. You don’t know. There is high individual uncertainty.Ah, but … aggregate uncertainty leads to high cumulative certainty.
