The idea was great, but the execution and development weren’t.Intel recently revealed its smart glass called Vaunt. Vaunt looks a lot like a regular set of glasses at first glance and they are nearly indistinguishable from regular glasses and they only weigh about 50 grams.At its core, Vaunt is simply a system for displaying a small heads-up style display in your peripheral vision.

The idea was great, but the execution and development weren’t.Intel recently revealed its smart glass called Vaunt. Vaunt looks a lot like a regular set of glasses at first glance and they are nearly indistinguishable from regular glasses and they only weigh about 50 grams.At its core, Vaunt is simply a system for displaying a small heads-up style display in your peripheral vision. It is designed to show very simple basic information in one of your eye. It can show you simple messages like directions or notifications. It works over Bluetooth with either an Android phone or an iPhone much in the same way your smartwatch does, taking commands from an app that runs in the background to control it. If there is any notification it can be read or dismissed using certain head gestures.It has little red monochrome projector. that shines an image on the holographic mirror which bounces it directly into the eyeball.Notification can only be seen if you are look down at the display. It does interfere with the standard line of vision.This was the technology which every college kids dreamt and now Intel has finally built it.﻿Thankyou",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-upcoming-trends-in-IT-technology-related-to-virtual-office-organisations

2,"You don’t advance technology as a monolith. Germany is a leader in material science and mechanical engineering.Germany is sub-par in software engineering and in its physical communication infrastructure. This is in part due to persistent cultural wariness of surveillance technologies like social media. People aren’t keen to fund the infrastructure to make mass surveillance easier, and politicians don’t want to be seen as pushing for the capability.Germany also has the capability to advance nuclear technology, but doesn’t due to mass scientific illiteracy among the voting population that falselYou don’t advance technology as a monolith.

Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party. Because radiation from nuclear accidents is apparently scarier than way more people dying of regular pollution constantly and the total annihilation of all life on Earth as the oceans boil away.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-upcoming-trends-in-IT-technology-related-to-virtual-office-organisations
3,"Nanotechnology, but in a really cool way.You remember the microbots in Big Hero 6, right? Well, unfortunately, those microbots are impossible, but there is a similar technology that’s being developed in real life.The idea is to build tiny replicators that can create more of themselves, like a sort of super bacteria that never stops replicating. Such a technology would be“…the first replicator assembles a copy in one thousand seconds, the two replicators then build two more in the next thousand seconds, the four build another four . . in less than two days, theyNanotechnology, but in a really cool way.You remember the microbots in Big Hero 6, right?

Such a technology would be“…the first replicator assembles a copy in one thousand seconds, the two replicators then build two more in the next thousand seconds, the four build another four . . in less than two days, they would outweigh the Earth; in another four hours, they would exceed the mass of the Sun and all the planets combined …”Of course, self-replicators require materials, so they aren’t going to spread through space or anything. But they would have an abundance of material on Earth, especially of carbon, which would likely be the building blocks of such an assemblers. If you were carrying a jar of them and tripped and they spilled out, and they had no limit, they would quickly devour the entire earth with no way of stopping them.But here is where things get interesting: These tiny robots would have the ability to construct molecules from atoms, giving them the ability to produce amazing materials like graphene, cubes of apple, and even brain material.With advanced nanotechnology in the form of self-replicators, the entire world would experience a revolution. Think for a second about what wouldn’t change in the face of machines that can produceProduction jobs would cease. The price of every item ever created would be lowered massively. Supercomputers and experiments regarding brain material would become almost commonplace. Terraforming other planets would take years if not months. And all of this is actuallyThere is a lot of power contained within those tiny machines.","246,826 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-upcoming-trends-in-IT-technology-related-to-virtual-office-organisations
