That’s a really cool set-up you got there. Back in 1818, we didn’t have this much protection.”“Yeah, I know. The 1400’s are serious times. I don’t mean to brag, but we gotta keep our equipment shiny. We gotta look good when we’re in a war.”“Yeah, no kidding. I don’t know why we have this minimal protection. I mean we do have upgraded weapons.”“Eh.

Our muskets take forever to reload. I can’t even hit a target past 50 yards.”“You’re telling me… We use bolt action rifles. I’d pick a crossbow any day. Especially that armor. I look like a turtle with this helmet…”“Eh. It ain’t easy being such a cool killing machine, you know?”“Yeah, I bet!”“You’re so cool!”“Hey, what’s that sound?”“Who is that???”“Sup.”“Ooooooooooooh…”“Who are you?”“I’m Staff Sergeant Rangers, with the 82nd Airborne Division.”“Whoooooooa…”“Psh… Looks like an armadillo with that helmet.

It’s just an Advanced Combat Helmet with a baseplate, made of Kevlar which can stop shrapnel, 9 millimeter rounds, and sometimes larger rounds.”“Ooooooooooooooh.”“And what’s that???”“It’s just my 1980 Camaro.”“Oooooooooooooooh.”“We use horses. We never saw that kind of thing.”“You serious, bro?”“And I bet you use some kind of advanced crossbow system, right?”“Psh. I got the most advanced crossbow system.”“Crossbow? Nah. Those things are useless and obsolete.”“But…”“I use an M4A1 Carbine. An air-cooled, magazine fed, shoulder fired carbine chambered in 5.56 millimeter cartridges that can easily take out an area target at 600 meters, has a max range of 3,600 meters, and a muzzle velocity of 2,970 feet per second.”“Whooooooooooa…”A meeting between the 4 soldiers would probably end up like this.

4,"Ok, assuming the same language our 1418 guy is going to have an immediate issue with 1818 as to his point of view 1818 is the only one displaying obvious weapons. 1418 won’t have a clue about an M4 or a Enfield rifle, but the sabre or sword in 1818 hands are going to make him nervous. Chivalry may prevail for 1418 and 1818. Now 1918 is going to see the M4 and go “gun” and see it for what it is immediately. The ego of the four warriors is going to come into play. If 1418 is an armored knight(as someone else pictured) you can bet he will believe he is all that and one best in the world fighters.Ok, assuming the same language our 1418 guy is going to have an immediate issue with 1818 as to his point of view 1818 is the only one displaying obvious weapons. 1418 won’t have a clue about an M4 or a Enfield rifle, but the sabre or sword in 1818 hands are going to make him nervous.

If 1418 is an armored knight(as someone else pictured) you can bet he will believe he is all that and one best in the world fighters. 1818 and the others are much more likely to be more generic grunts. So our aristocratic knight is probably going to look at the others think of 1818 as just another peasant soldiers no matter the uniform because he isn’t in full armor, he won’t even recognize 1918 and 2018 as holding effective weapons since they look nothing like any black powder devices he might’ve seen. He will assume he is the best again and start talking crap to the others. 1818 will take offense and demonstrate his single shot 1818 flintlock by asking to borrow the knights helmet for a demo. After putting a hole in the helmet our knight is now sufficiently dissuaded from the thought of his invulnerability but still holds that if the shot had missed his broad sword would take 1818 out being superior to 1818s sabre. To this 1918 cracks of 5 quick with the rifle. 1418 and 1818 are both shocked. Our Brit smiles looks over at 2018 and says “I have a feeling that thing across your chest will do a little better”. Instead of firing the M4 - 2018 points the barrel at a hill engages the laser & grabs the mic on his chest and speaks a quick short sentence, 20 seconds later the hilltop disappears under a massive series of explosions. At this point 2018 is going to be pummeled by questions and the other weapons are going to be after thoughts.

Tracking a customer who starts online before coming into the store to make a purchase is a significant and meaningful challenge to overcome, but fortunately, marketers have a set of O2O strategies that they can implement.Over 80% of shoppers will do online research before coming into a store to make a purchase¹. In the same way, marketers should understand the customer journey and customer pain points to create an experience tying online activity and research to the in-store visit for a truly omnichannel marketing experience.Benefits of implementing O2O to your business.Trustworthy brand.Having a connected online presence and a physical store will help your business build a trustworthy brand. When consumers feel that your business can easily be contacted with or deal business with, they will trust your brand.Better customer experience.Customers always want flexibility, options when shopping, and convenience. An O2O strategy will deliver all these benefits to your customers. From the wide selection that you offer in your online store to flexibility in knowing more about the product that they want by visiting your physical store.Additional traffic and customer segment.Foot traffic in physical stores can be slow, but if you augment it with digital traffic you are able to increase both. Targeting new customer segment online can also improve your existing offline segment. O2O strategy integrates your existing physical store with your digital presence.And the techniques that a company uses to effectively and efficiently attract and engages these customers online varies by store category.By providing more convenience, personalisation and engagement for the customers when in store, the customers feel they get more value by shopping in the physical store than they do by shopping online.","135,535 followers",Hector Quintanilla,4.6K,1.2K,88.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-soldiers-from-1418-1818-1918-and-2018-met-what-would-they-say

Online-to-offline commerce, or O2O, identifies customers in the online space - such as through emails, SMS, social media, apps or mobile wallet content - and then uses a variety of tools and approaches to entice the customer to leave the online space. This type of strategy incorporates techniques used in online marketing with those used in brick-and-mortar marketing, as well as the relatively new but fast advancing customer engagement technology of proximity services. (e.g. beacons).Retailers are concerned that they are not able to compete with e-commerce companies that purely sell goods online, especially in terms of price and selection. Physical stores require high fixed costs (rent) and many employees to run the stores; and because of limited space, they are typically unable to offer as wide a selection of goods.  Online retailers can offer a vast selection without having to pay for as many personnel, and only need access to shipping companies in order to sell their goods. That said, currently, around 90% of commerce still happens ""offline"".  So while there is still much room for growth for pure online retailers, I don't foresee that shops will disappear from our highstreets any time soon. But it is very important that offline business embrace online channels and the associated technologies and capabilities that come with 'online'.  Tis even more critical now that around 2Billion people in the world have a smartphone (and this is set to rise to over 2.7Billion in the next few years):Most companies that have both an online presence and an offline presence (physical stores) treat the two different channels as complements rather than competitors.  The goal of online-to-offline commerce is to create brand, product and service awareness online, allowing potential customers to research different offerings and then visit the local brick-and-mortar store to make a purchase.Techniques that O2O commerce companies employ include in-store pick of items purchase online, allowing items purchased online to be returned at the physical store and allowing customers to place order online while at the physical store.  These techniques are evolving, as the underlying technology and platforms evolve and become more sophisticated.  A couple of techniques that are in infancy but will become more commonplace over the course of the next couple of years, are ability to pay for your goods online while in the store (rather than having to wait in line at the cashier terminal) to interacting with ""bots"" or virtual assistants.The rise of online-to-offline commerce has not eliminated the advantages that e-commerce companies have.  Companies with brick-and-mortar stores will still have customers that visit physical stores in order to see how an item fits or looks, only to ultimately make a purchase online (referred to as ""showrooming""). The goal, therefore, is to attract and engage a certain type of customer that is open to walking or driving to a local store, and enjoys shopping in a physical store, rather than wait for a package to arrive in the mail.The best O2O strategy is one that is focused on leveraging the many online capabilities (e.g. mobile wallet, SMS, apps, bluetooth beacons, physical web, big data etc..) to deliver a truly engaging experience for the customer when the customer is out-of-store, near-store and in-store.  i.e. delivering more value at each step of a shopping experience; more enticing to visit a store, more engaging and informative when in store, and easier to 'transact', and then maintaining a relationship / personal dialogue with the customer when they leave the store so they want to come back and tell people about their experience.  By providing more convenience, personalisation and engagement for the customers when in store, the customers feel they get more value by shopping in the physical store than they do by shopping online.",0 followers,Leonard Kim,709,593,15.3M,2016,https://www.quora.com/If-soldiers-from-1418-1818-1918-and-2018-met-what-would-they-say

Some business performs better on certain websites, for example. Some business performs well in Linkedin, Twitter, some of these are considered (B2B) or business to business companies, that primarily do business with other companies.Other businesses perform well with Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest. These are considered (B2C) or Business consumer companies, that sell products or services to the general public.The first thing, that you have to do. Before you start marketing, creating content, or spending money on advertising. Is that you have to define, what is the purpose of my marketing.Are you trying to grow your brand awareness? Are you trying to get free users on your website? Or are you trying to make sales?Each of these strategies will be different which is why is important that you first know what you want to do.Why would someone want to create brand awareness instead of sales?Great question, bigger companies such as Coke, McDonald's, Tesla, Microsoft, and apple.Don’t have to sell you the product 24/7, you know where to go to buy the product. But they want to keep reminding you of the product because they know if they contact you (7 times), you will ultimately buy. Whereas if they try to sell you the first time, you probably wouldn't buy it.So marketing is a way, to create that awareness of the product, so that the consumer, knows who the company and the product are. And feels like their making their own decision over time to purchase.Whereas a smaller business might need a sale today (POS)- Point of sale type of business, with a fast closing cycle sale or a convenience item, which has a smaller dollar value, or a smaller lifetime customer value.these are the most expensive categories. Cost per advertising, which money is being spent.Finally, the most important I think. Cost and ROI per advertising technique employed. For business, each business or industry will have a different one which is most effective.Thus small businesses and the markets to make money, instead of remarketing so often to get customers, if their customers that are willing to buy after the first interaction, either impulse purchase, or just a low price point sale.Once you have identified your goal, you want to research. What are the best (places to advertise for ROI), this could be (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Quora, Google), and e-mail.Once you have this information, then at this point. You got to determine, how much money you have to spend to hit your goal.For example, if one of these social media platforms tells you for every $1 dollar you spend, your ROI is $7 dollars, now you know in order for you to make $20,000 you will have to spend.$3,100 (Spent) x $7 dollars= $21,700 (ROI) - $3100= $18,600 in profits.Always make sure that whenever you are marketing. Always take a calculator out, and make sure that the numbers make sense if the numbers don’t make sense. Then is very unlikely that the result of your marketing is going to make sense.And lastly, create simple yet engaging content. This can be a video, a graphic design, or just words and images, that get people to buy your product or service. Make sense that the product communicates to the end-user, the benefit, cost, and that the cost is worth the money they are paying for it.If you can do this, then you will go a long way, and you will be able to sell your products or services.",34 followers,Rahul Chauhan,7.4K,2.5K,101.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-soldiers-from-1418-1818-1918-and-2018-met-what-would-they-say

Some modern missile systems using helmet mounted sights can lock on at up to 90° off-boresight capability. Essentially if an air combat did get into visual range the outcome would be decided at the merge.It also depends on the exact fighter role. It may be more useful for an air superiority fighter than an interceptor.

If both pilots are adept at utilizing the aircraft systems and designed maneuvers to defeat beyond visual engagement tactics, then you’ll end in a dog fight.In the 1960’s, the US was utilizing the F-4 Phantom.
