They’re a terrible solution to a problem that doesn’t exist.I’d bet that anyone who’s used a hand dryer (even the nicer ones) knows that they don’t work very well. Paper towels are faster to use and they do a better job drying your hands.But, did you know that hand dryers are less hygenic than paper towels?The real argument that dryer companies make, though, is that paper towel waste is bad for the environment. That's only a little true; lSome people worry about the trees we have to cut down, but paper towels are usually made from recycled wood pulp, and they don’t need the really nasty binders or bleaches. The related problem of paper waste can be solved if we just put a bit of effort in; paper towels are easily biodegradable and can be composted. By fitting paper towels into the middle of a recycling stream, we don't need to cut down any trees, and no trash has to go to a landfill.Long story short, paper towels are a clean, hygienic, and sustainable bathroom solution, and hand dryers are a completely unnecessary replacement that’s actively worse.I’m tired of having soggy hands for no good reason.2020 edit:","3,411 followers",Louis Vaught,4.8K,1.2K,13.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-technology-disruptive-invention-that-can-help-the-world-with-at-least-one-major-problem-that-it-current-faces

He describes it as a technology that unexpectedly displaces an old technology in such a way that the old technology becomes redundant and is phased out. Introduction of automobiles were an ‘innovative’ technology no doubt, but not a ‘disruptive’ one since, in those early days, automobiles remained as an interesting luxury ‘toy’ in the hands of a few, horse drawn carriages were still the norm. But introduction of mass-produced automobile like the ‘Model T’ from Ford virtually replaced horse drawn carriages and is considered ‘disruptive’.Social perspective“The plan is like this, we first take the night train to Madurai, reaching there in the morning”.“Ummm….”“Then we take a car and straight go to Kodaikanal, we reach by noon”“Ummm….”“You know where I have booked up this time? Guess what, karlton”.“Ummm….”I realized that my teenage daughter was not paying attention. Her fingers were busy dancing across the Smartphone, typing out text messages.“Why can’t you listen at least, I took so much of pain and trouble for arranging this holiday. You are not even interested”. I was visibly upset.“Ummm….”.“What ummm?”“Ohh papa I am listening”.One more time Smartphone proves to be smarter than a dumb parent.Medical perspectiveWhen I joined my third year of medical curriculum, during the surgical posting, 9 out of 10 general surgical procedures would be some kind of surgery for peptic ulcer. A part of the stomachs was removed with cutting off the vagus nerve (which triggers off the gastric acid secretion) a technique called ‘gastrectomy’ and’ vagotomy’. Faster the surgeon more was his status. By 1980 Prof James black discovered a novel kind of drug that blocked the receptors in the stomach that resulted in profound reduction of acid secretion. It was a new concept, acting like a wrong key in the lock. The receptor, like the lock got essentially jammed by the drug, making the real key useless and the lock failed to work. Acid in stomach came down.

It is relatively costly today, but improvements in solar power and smart chemistry makes this process cheaper and cheaper. In 20 years time we certainly could transform enough water like this. Whether we can also transport it the many thousands kilometers into the depths of for example Africa is another question, but there’s no reason why coastal regions wouldn’t have more than sufficient clean drinking water.The list is very long.
