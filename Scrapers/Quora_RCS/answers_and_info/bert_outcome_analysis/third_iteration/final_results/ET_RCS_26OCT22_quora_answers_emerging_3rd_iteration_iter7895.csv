As I recall the power was less than 1 watt (a weak flashlight) and the core was about 6"" diameter.  It was in a tank of water 6-8 feet diameter.This reactor was designated AGN-201, it had a 25 cm right cylindrical core, used 20% enriched uranium, and had a design power of 0.1 watts.","29,974 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.7K,249.9M,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-smallest-working-nuclear-reactor-ever-built-and-how-much-energy-does-it-produce-in-terms-of-how-many-average-homes-it-can-power

So seeing it loses energy then more energy has to be introduced so the fusion process remains active.Plasma behavior! In most commonly know methods many times during the fusion process besides the fast moving neutrons that it loses, the flow of plasma isn't always the same. Some times the plasma takes on some erratic shapes that simply force the reactor to stop.So bottom line is this…We still don't have the right kind of fuel that does not produce fast moving neutrons. I mean, we do know of a fuel but seeing there's almost none here on Earth but tons of it on the Moon, it is still cost prohibitive to do such an endeavor. At least until oil runs out and then we'll really have to get a move on.As for the inconsistencies in the plasma flow. That's been gradually been fixed thanks to the data we have already collected and the information obtained by simulations run on supercomputers.So the real problem seems to be fuel.Or maybe… There is actually no problem at all.Here… Let me present to you. Jetter Cycle Fusion! It will be a bit long so bear with me.So what is the Jetter cycle…Adding lithium 6 to an electrostatic confinement fusor that contains deuterium should result in a more practical system of energy production. Though none have been reported as yet.Li-6 is easily separated from Li-7. If you have a Lithium mine you could sell the Lithium 7 and keep the Lithium 6.Then manufacture a Farnsworth Hirsch fusor with a Lithium Tungsten lining.Since selling enriched Lithium is illegal you sell the power and keep the hardware. Or better yet use the power to make fuel and sell that.If you could make lots of cheap fission free hydrogen bombs out of Lithium 6 and deuterium say 0.33 kilotons each. That's 1.395 trillion joules. And detonated them off in a nozzle that directed the plasma plume we’d have a rocket! Put two rockets pointing in opposite directions blowing up bombs 1/60 th of a second apart each operating at precisely 30x per second and let the plasma stream flow through a MHD generator for each exhaust plume and switch the two generators we would have a 60 Hz AC generator producing 83.68 terawatts of power!Humanity today uses only 17 terawatts of power burning stuff that died long time ago. So the generator just described provides 5x the power of the whole planet. Since each watt allows people to create $6 per year of income done cheaply this generator ends air pollution and generates enough power to support a $502 trillion per year economy. $68,000 per person per year. A family of four earns $272,000 per year.Monaco levels of Wealth! At 16,000 people per km2 the same as Monaco very little of the Earth is used. 100% recycling by mixing in garbage around the bomblet and separating out various elements from the plume with magnetic deflection.Now at 270.1 trillion joules per kilogram of Lithium 6 deuteride we need only 5.16 grams per bomblet. At 0.6 kg/l this occupies 8.6 ml. About the size of two teaspoons.Shot out of a Gatling gun into the nozzle at 30 times per second each phased a 60th of a second apart. The two guns are synchronised and each charge has a detonator that senses the magnetic field of the power circuit to get the timing just right.This that I have described to you is all technology developed in the 50’s.At $0.03 per kWh and 1.395 terajoules per unit you could spend over $12,430 per bomblet and spend less for energy than you do for coal.At 60 detonations per second the generator uses 310 grams per second to power the generator imagined. 232 grams per second of Li6 and 78 grams/sec Deuterium!Deuterium is extracted by processing 2.23 litres per second of sea water and isotopically separating 3.06 kg per second of naturally occurring Lithium metal.That's 70.67 million litres of sea water per year and 96,700 tons of raw Lithium per year. 16% of today's 600,000 ton per year production.University of Michigan and Ford estimated that we know of 39 million tons of Lithium can be recovered. Enough to operate this generator for 403 years.The Lithium content of sea water is 230 billion tons. Enough to power the generator for 2.38 million years! This requires 15.3 million litres of sea water be processed each second. 0.5 TW is needed to desalinate this much water. A fraction of the power available. So we are good to go!This also produces 67,000 litres per year of fresh water from sea water per person. A fraction of the 3 tons of garbage per person.We start with known Lithium supplies and build out seawater based systems as we go.Treated as revenue sources the power could be secondary to the value of the raw materials produced by such an engine!Reducing bomblets from Hiroshima sized blasts well below Davey Crockett sized blasts of 30 ton equivalent though our bomblets are far smaller (0.8 ml) and far cleaner, (no fissile materials) lets us build 10 floating generators spaced around the planet each 8.368 TW in size. Each near a populous port city.With all revenue streams producing $0.11 per kWh for energy waste processing fresh water raw materials etc the generator owners earn 16% of the $6 per year per watt they create. Of the $50 trillion per year in wealth they create they collect $8 trillion per year!!The cost of the power plant is less than the cost of a conventional nuclear plant or off shore drilling platform. $10 billion tops!",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

7,"Eh? Not working? Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos Laboratories have designed some of the finest single-use fusion devices in the world.Oh, you meant continuous fusion for commercial power generation. Well, the problem is that plasma does not like being confined very much, in fact it’s quite the escape artist. Getting it to hold still while heating up to the correct temperature is quite difficult.

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but it really isn’t. Even in the core of the sun, fusion generates only a small amount of net heat. A cubic metre of the sun’s fusing core only generates around 275 watts. That’s less energy output than we give off as body heat for an equivalent volume. The reason why the sun is so hot is because there are hundreds of thousands of miles of insulation (in the form of hot gas contained by gravity) around this heating centre.There’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), and then we have to extract sensible energy without causing the whole reaction to stall and still end up with enough energy to outweigh the inevitable energy losses.I hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be. It should be considered like the Manhattan project or Apollo programme but wa...","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Whats-our-current-progress-on-nuclear-fusion-power-and-what-problems-remain

Gas, salt and metals are possible coolants. Some of these reactors can work with current technology and designs. The main problem stopping development of new reactors is the cost and complications of building prototypes.China has started operation of a gas cooled reactor, a They are likely building a Molten Salt Reactor and a Traveling Wave Reactor, TWR. China has also tested a research fusion reactor and created heated plasma twice the temperature of the sun for 100 seconds. But useful Fusion energy is likely decades away.These reactors will be built. Some are under construction. While nuclear power is unpopular there are countries that appreciate the benefits of low carbon and safety. Poor and less developed countries may see nuclear power as part of development of rich countries. Many very powerful countries have nuclear power.Even if reactors are being built in other countries it can still affect its neighbors. So development of safer nuclear power should be of concern to everyone. Even opponents of nuclear power must realize that better nuclear technology is important. China has a huge nuclear energy program building a number of different reactors from different countries. And including Next Generation, Gen 4 reactors. They are planning for over 50 nuclear power stations. They will be able to find which reactors are suitable for their needs.The US has fallen behind in reactor technology. Not being able to develop prototypes. But this may soon change. As the potential for Gen 4 technologies are understood politicians may change their views.The anti-nuclear groups say that investing in Gen 4 technology will be a waste of money and resources. And will take to long to develop. But there is plenty of resources available. We should be spending more money on a variety of low carbon energy-producing technologies. We need many types of energy and to focus only on solar and wind does not guarantee success. Solar and wind energy does face problems. Solar and wind power is not as simple as most people think it is.I am not saying we should start mass production of Gen 4 reactors. But we need to develop working prototypes to test their capabilities. From a technical view these reactors are viable. Most of the technology is available. Some prototypes have been tested before.THE ACTUAL NUMBERS AND HISTORY SHOWS HOW SAFE NUCLEAR ENERGY IS. Different from the sensationalized accounts in the media.Some projections it to future energy production are not very good. We need more options. Gen 4 power could be competitive with fossil fuels.
