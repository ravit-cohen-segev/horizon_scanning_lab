0,"If evolution is about adaptation and survival why are humans going the other way?The vast majority of species miserably fail at evolution. Over 99% of all species that have ever existed are now extinct. There is no reason to assume that that is something that can’t or won’t happen to humans. What you observe might be a sign of us actually doing that.That does not change the rules of evolution, though.","220,633 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,783M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-help-humans-evolve-past-basic-survival-behaviors
1,"Oh, *way* past. We’re still fairly recognisably the same kind of thing as the first members of the human line 7 million years ago, at the point where we split from the line leading to chimps, and we’ve insulated ourselves against most selection pressures now so we evolve more slowly. To get “beyond recognition” I’d say you’re looking at at least 20 million years and probably more like 100 million, depending on your definition of “recognition”.",3 followers,Samuel Bateman,1.1K,102,56.4K,2021,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-help-humans-evolve-past-basic-survival-behaviors
2,"Yes. That started with the discovery of fire and the technology of cooking. Cooking releases more nutrients from food, enabling larger, more nutrient-hungry brains. Agriculture, one of the largest technological innovations in human history, accelerated that trend.Technology has shaped our evolution since the beginning.","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,742,6.8K,91.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-help-humans-evolve-past-basic-survival-behaviors

4,"Laypeople have this idea that evolution is about becoming better. That’s not the case! So long as the members of a species can procreate, that species is going to go on.There’s some speculation that stupid people have more children than smart people, and that as a result mankind’s average intelligence will be dropping. I have no comment on this idea, other than to say, if humanity really did change and become more stupid, that would be evolution too!",366 followers,Brett Alder,1.1K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-help-humans-evolve-past-basic-survival-behaviors

It is only the hybrid military expression of humanity that is dependant upon technology.The supposed “advancement” towards technology throughout history has only led to civil collapse and termination. This present advance towards technology has already triggered a major extinction event upon our planet which will disintegrate the capacity to construct technology and humanity will revert back to those sustainable communities that are not dependant upon technology.Every civil collapse that has ever taken place upon our planet over the pHumanity in its pure self is not dependant upon technology.

6,"For an organism with generation times as long as humans we would not expect any noticeable evolutionary change in only a few hundred years, regardless of the circumstances.Exceptions do exist of very rapid evolution in long lived populations but those involve unusual circumstances that mostly cannot be predicted in advance.For example humans might develop in the next few hundred years the ability to genetically modify their own offspring and thus direct the evolutionary direction of the population, but the direction that goes will depend on the free choices of future humans and that wouldn’t bFor an organism with generation times as long as humans we would not expect any noticeable evolutionary change in only a few hundred years, regardless of the circumstances.Exceptions do exist of very rapid evolution in long lived populations but those involve unusual circumstances that mostly cannot be predicted in advance.For example humans might develop in the next few hundred years the ability to genetically modify their own offspring and thus direct the evolutionary direction of the population, but the direction that goes will depend on the free choices of future humans and that wouldn’t be predictable.",3 followers,Samuel Bateman,1.1K,102,56.4K,2021,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-help-humans-evolve-past-basic-survival-behaviors

8,"Evolution is not a direct path from point A to point B. It is not like following Google maps. Evolution is reactive and acts more like a Roomba vacuum. It goes until it hits something, turns and goes again. It has no purpose in any given move, but cumulatively, the moves assure the entire room is cleaned. It is an algorithm, not a plan.So, predicting evolution is like predicting the path of a Roomba. You can make an educated guess, but that is all it will be is a guess.","5,085 followers",Bobby Tatro,3.9K,2.2K,45.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-help-humans-evolve-past-basic-survival-behaviors

Let me be more precise:Andros, Greece. The specific architecture could somewhere in South Italy or South Spain, or even Portugal:Similar architecture is common anywhere in Greece where the traditional style was not replaced by modern blocks:And as it was previously said anywhere in mediterranean/southern EuropeBut not really in any Non-European coasts of the mediterranean sea, maybe except for the one depicted in the last picture (Cycladian and dodecanese).In a similar way, as I have already implied, homemade cuisine of Greece, especially that of South Greece and the islands (not steetfood which was introduced by Greeks who came in 1923 from Anatolia as refugees, but native one that we usually eat at home) is quite similar to what someone will also eat at home in other Southern European countries. That includes not only various Mediterranean vegetables, olive oil and pork meat, but also Greece is the second pasta power in the world, and no that doesn’t mean that we have the second most successful “pasta factories”, but that we have native pasta dishes since centuries (possibly introduced by Venetians or Genovese, not sure about it):The same, to a degree goes for music: Some parts of Greek music are completely irrelevant to Southern Europe, but other genres are pretty close to South European sounds with much similarities in tunesFamily types also seem to be technically the same, along with many other social and mental indexes:Other countries with which there surely is some resemblance from many aspects are:Poland and Hungary:Ireland“I am from Dublin and I studied law at Trinity College Dublin with a year studying in Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. I then studied my LLM at the London School of Economics…Working in Athens has taught me that you cannot always get what you want. You have to be creative, find workarounds, adapt to the pace and style of the Greek culture, learn to see things from their point of view and disagree politely when you dont! I have also learned that, on a more familial level, Greek and Irish cultures are very similar. There is the same strong emphasis on family, religion, humour, and strength of relationships here as at home. Despite the language barrier, I feel very at home with Greek people. They are definitely the Irish of the south of Europe.”Source:Southeast EuropeBut that’s all about “native” Greeks.
