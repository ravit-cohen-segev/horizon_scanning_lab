1,"Those actions have awaken the world that too much reliance on American technologies is fatal, since the US can cut off the supplies anytime it wants in the name of “national security”.For example, if a Japanese company somehow becomes the leader in 6G technologies in the future, you can bet the US will do similar thing to that Japanese company as they are doing to Huawei now.Don’t want to get banned by the US?

Because ZTE is a state company and Huawei is a private company.Huawei is everything entrepreneurship stands for in China: hard working, innovation, competitive rewards, ruthless competition, etc.Compared to other telecom tech companies in China ten more years ago, Huawei didn’t get more special favor from Chinese govt, as many other companies are state owned, including ZTE, Julong, Datang. Even Alcatel’ Chinese subsidiary is half owned by Chinese govt. Whilst Huawei was and has kept been a private company.Huawei faced a lot of uncertainty back then, to the extent they almost sold the company to Motorola in 2003. The deal was not closed only because Motorola’s new CEO had no interest in buying an unknown Chinese tech company.Financial Times: How Huawei tried to sell itself to Motorola for $7.5bnRen Zhengfei of Huawei, second left, and Mike Zafirovski and Larry Cheng of Motorola walk along a beach with an interpreter on Hainan island in 2003 as the two sides moved closer to signing a letter of intent on the sale of Huawei to MotorolaSome may say, yeah, private company huh? Who knows Chinese govt isn’t at work behind the curtain. My argument is, if you accept a state owned (openly or covertly) company could ascend to one of very top Tech and consumer electronics companies in the world, then you don’t have enough faith in free market and capitalism.So here’s how people like me view the attack on Huawei:You start by saying China is using state power to interfere the market, state owned companies are having too much edge over foreign and private ones, thus making competition unfair and trade unbalanced. Alright, at least we all agree to push China towards the direction of more structural reform and opening up, so we can leave that door open.You ban the use of Huawei telecom gears in US, that’s understandable too, because though there’s no hard evidence ever presented, you can always say as long as capability is there so intention doesn’t matter——after all intention can change at times or on whims, as displayed by the great incumbent POTUS himself.Now you start killing Huawei’s consumer phone business, which gains its popularity around the world(except US) for every reason but the blessing from the Chinese govt.By this you are showing you are a caring big brother, you know better what other people should have; and because you are so omniscient and omnipotent, you can dictate billions of people to do as you say, for their own sake of course. If the persuasion doesn’t work well, you can force them to, one way or another.Wait, is that the same U.S. of A. we are talking about? Because that sounds a lot like the enemy US as we knew would paint on.Where goes the Beacon of Liberty?

Our first tool of the trade was an inline assembler that was really just a debugging tool from Commodore; the promised macro assembler has not yet shipped.How skilled were we? Less skilled than we thought! Everything was new. We were learning on the job. For instance, I learned from fellow team members with industrial automation experience that there exist incredible algorithms (Bresenham's algorithm and variants) that allow us to draw, e.g., that slab of ice or that moving horizon in real time with a reasonable refresh rate. I learned from another team member, good friend (who, sadly, passed away many years ago) the art of handling a soldering iron and using an oscilloscope, making sense of the timings of a system bus when a processor accesses DRAM or the memory is being refreshed. And I taught myself the basic concepts of time slice scheduling, writing an interrupt-driven kernel that would play back (with accurate timing) a music score through the C64's sound chip while executing different parts of the game in a round robin process.There is something to be said about programming a computer with so little memory, you can have a decent mental model of its entire physical address space. (A comparable present-day experience would be programming low-end microcontrollers like a PIC.) Back then, an assembler program of a few hundred lines was considered ""large"" (all uncommented of course. Comments are so lame, a waste of precious RAM or floppy disk space.) Debugging misbehaving code often involved dumping ALL the contents of the RAM and then searching for clues by visually inspecting the dump.We had loads of fun! But skilled? I am looking at what people have accomplished since those early days using the same 8-bit hardware. A graphical operating system with a mouse. A text-based browser and an HTTP server using a network adapter attached to the C64 extension port. Animation that puts our early attempts at 3D visuals to shame. Even freaking video playback with sound; low quality of course, but still. Talk about skilled.Of course it's always easier to do things in hindsight. Once you know what computers are capable of, once you learn extremely efficient algorithms, you can push them to the limit as you backport them to ancient hardware. Back then we didn't know what was possible. We were exploring limits even as we were dreaming about a future when these wonderful computers might have more storage (for instance, we calculated that when used as a data storage medium, a VHS cassette, for instance, could have stored several MEGABYTES!) or even be interconnected through the telephone network using these newfangled acoustic couplers, modems, at the blazing speed of 300 bits a second...",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

The C64 ran a 1MHz 6502, and there were a number of ICE’s for that CPU — but they were expensive, and not likely to be available except for people doing hardware development.The real problem was that you had such incredibly limited resources. You had 64KB (yeah, kilobytes) of RAM, and 20KB of ROM, which had a variety of entry pointsNote from this map that there are overlapping pieces - you might correctly assume that you can either use the CART ROM from 8000-BFFF, or you can use RAM, or. you can use RAM and BASIC… but not all three at the same time. That was hardware switched BTW - plug in a CART and it “won” the mapping. It was also software switched - if you weren’t running a BASIC program you could map that ROM out, giving another 8KB of RAM…Also note the panel to the right — where it says “COLOR RAM”, between D800 and DBFF? That was part of the video refresh RAM — drop bits in there, change the colors of the pixels on the screen. But not “bits” — bytes, actually nibbles. The screen was drawn in 25 rows of 40 characters each, and the lower four bits of each byte changed the color to one of 16 gradients for each block of pixels.The content of that block? That was way down in the SCREEN MEMORY block, from 0400–07FF, again a block of 1KB characters (actually 1000, but what’s 24 bytes between friends?)So, as alluded to inThe “cheat code” on this was that you didn’t have — couldn’t in fact — write individual pixels; you wrote characters, 8 x 8 bit glyphs coded in something calledSo… think about your graphic design process… you have to piece together a set of PETSCII glyphs that you can change color on to paint your image, you have to load that before you turn on the video, then as you update it, you have to punch in the updates for one row, which covers 8 lines of pixels, in 504 microseconds while the block of characters on the rows above you are scanning, retracing and blanking… which means you’ve got between 250 and 64 instructions, depending on what specific instructions you’re using… and that has to cover not only the character updates, but also the computation around what you’re updating and why.Got it??Super. Now consider this: you also don’t have hardly any space for this code. And you barely have a stack - 256 stack frames each of which can be 512 bytes. So what you’d consider “normal” subroutines?? Too slow. Too expensive. So you wound up writing (god help us all) non-reentrant code, with multiple entry points which you’d keep track of by bits in the code that you’d set and re-set as you went…Plus, there would typically be a couple of people working on different bits of code. And because actual addresses mattered — none of this “variable” bullshit, you knew the actual factual specific in-physical-memory address of important entry points and data values — you might find yourself fucked all of a sudden because something moved, and someone forgot to tell you. And sometimes, in addition to being annoying, it mattered, because alignment might be messed up, or you might be in a different memory frame which added another clock cycle or three to your access time, or it broke some timed loop you were running, counting on a progression of values through a flag…I’m not a game programmer. Never have been. I’m more the guy that builds the shit that makes it all work underneath the covers. But I have absolutely delivered production code for all sorts of things - security systems, factory automation, medical devices, automotive controllers, you name it - on 8 bit systems of this class. That’s hard. Sometimes, really hard.But games?? Those developers were on a completely different level. Dumping the code, disassembling it, and hand tracing the execution is one “omg, you fucking did WHAT?” moment after another - not to mention that you have to carry around a whole great galloping shit ton of information about how the hardware works, what the physical timing constraints are, what is stuffed in which memory location, etc to be able to make any sense of it.Crazy times. Some days, I’m glad they’re behind us. Other days? I wish that we were a little more resource constrained, because I know that working against hard limits improves the quality of your thought processes about what you’re doing.",2 followers,Martin La Grange,3.2K,1.3K,8.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-US-cutting-off-technology-sales-to-Chinese-company-Huawei-a-move-that-might-backfire-for-the-US

You did NOT have some external game designer insisting on every detail of the game matching their vision. You were at most given a gist of what was wanted, and told to implement the idea in the best form you could. More often than not in the early days, the developers were the designers. If you could do something neat, it would be praised.Now a major game will have a large number of developers and designers, as well as leadership, writers, actors, directors, etc. Doing something cool is nice if it supports the goals of the game, but hard work might easily be tossed aside of the goals change.Think about props, effects, and sequels in films. When the first Star Wars film was made, designers made neat props and cool audio and visual effects. In later films, those had to be reproduced precisely. The advent of digital effects raised the level of what could be accomplished, and that led to hundreds of modelers working on each element of each scene. Those long credits on recent films are mostly lists of modelers (and to a less extent, programmers).Different expectations lead to different challenges.",30 followers,Robin Thomas,3K,731,13.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-US-cutting-off-technology-sales-to-Chinese-company-Huawei-a-move-that-might-backfire-for-the-US

10,"Between 1986 and 1988, when I was an undergraduate student in electrical engineering, I worked a vacation job atBetween 1986 and 1988, when I was an undergraduate student in electrical engineering, I worked a vacation job atWe didn’t see programming the C64 in assembly as requiring any particular skill. We had so many more resources on that machine, compared with others we had programmed, that it seemed easier, rather than harder. It was possible — indeed quite easy — to understand and master the capabilities of all of the C64 hardware. The data sheets for each chip, even the relatively complex (for their time) graphics and sound chips, were only a few pages long. Sure, you couldn’t just go online and download them as PDFs. You had to actually call a supplier and have them mail the data sheets to you on dead trees. But once you had them, you had everything you needed to fully master the machine. Try that on a modern PC!For development, we did our editing, assembly and linking on IBM PCs, with the resulting code downloaded onto the C64 via RS232C serial link. Debugging could be a bit tricky. Since we could not just put ‘print’ statements in to tell us where in the code our programs were executing, we would typically use graphics cues, such as changing background colours. This could even be done (by writing hardware registers) part-way through display updates, so that we could visually observe how much time our programs were spending in different parts of the code.To us, however, this was not ‘skill’. It was just business-as-usual. And it was a lot less complex than the many tools and frameworks that programmers have available today. 6502 assembly language is not hard to learn or to use. The processor is basically a state machine. It handles instruction and data fetches, arithmetic and logical operations, register updates, data stores, jumps, branches etc in completely predictable and deterministic ways. There are a handful of operations, combined with a handful of addressing modes, and once you have learned those, and which combinations are legal, you are pretty much good-to-go.I was a teenager (18) when I started at Beam. I was basically self-taught up to that point. So was I especially ‘skilled’? Of course not! How could I be?

Divide your day up based on your productivity patterns.For example, I know that between 1-3 pm I tend to have the most trouble focusing.  Same with 5-7ish.  So I choose to do my hardest tasks in the morning, late afternoon, and at night.6.Remove distractions when you're doing your work, and do not try to multitask.  If for 1 hour you're going to work on X, then only work on X.  Nothing else, unless absolutely necessary.7. Delegate what you can.There's no dignity in doing everything yourself.

List your “crucial results” for the day.Create a spreadsheet listing your top 3 crucial for each day. This will help you plan each day and make sure you’re maintaining focus on the most important tasks each day.4. Change your self-talk.A simple shift in perspective can do wonders for your motivations and energy levels. Instead of saying “I have too much to do today!”, say “These are the two things I need to focus on today. ”5. Use idle time to knock out admin tasksWaiting in line at the grocery store, at the bank, in the elevator, etc. Bring a book you’ve been meaning to read, clear a few emails, or catch up on status updates. Or simply let your mind wander and observe the world around you.6. Learn to say noLearn to say no more often to guard your time for your highest leverage activities.A saying “no” tip: When someone comes to you with a request that you need to say no to, simply ask them to give you 15 minutes to finish what you’re working on then by the time you come around to find out what they wanted, they’ll often have figured it out on their own.7. Start the day with structured ’me time’:Go through email and social media updates that have piled up overnight and triage the backlog. Knock out quick responses and referrals, so other people can start working on tasks. Schedule the bigger tasks. And delete the stuff that is informational or not important.8. Use checklists for repetitive tasks to reduce errors:Particularly when you are overworked or are operating under time constraints, checklists keep you on track.9. Eliminate personal distractions:Personal distractions could also kill your productivity at work. When you let personal distractions interfere with your work, you would easily lose focus and waste time doing nothing.10. Stand more:Are you feeling a little sleepy around 3pm? Stand up!Is your posture starting to wane? Stand up!It’s simple, but it’s effective.～Bonus tip: Find the real, motivating reason for completing the task.If you experience a slump in your usual productivity, a lack of motivation might be the culprit. Motivation is the fuel for productivity in the face of apathy, and generating it is as simple as tying the task at hand back to a bigger, more important goal.Upvote if any of these could help you.","2,346 followers",Sandeep Prasad Bhatt,47.3K,91,2.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-US-cutting-off-technology-sales-to-Chinese-company-Huawei-a-move-that-might-backfire-for-the-US

25,"There is popular story on working smarter which goes something like this.A soap manufacturing company received many complaints from their retailers mentioning that some of the purchased soaps were empty. There was packaging but there was no soap inside them. Since these soaps were manufactured in lots, the issue was critical as the retailers were paying for empty boxes.This issue is harder to resolve as the whole process is automated by big machinery.

Many engineers propoThere is popular story on working smarter which goes something like this.A soap manufacturing company received many complaints from their retailers mentioning that some of the purchased soaps were empty. There was packaging but there was no soap inside them. Since these soaps were manufactured in lots, the issue was critical as the retailers were paying for empty boxes.This issue is harder to resolve as the whole process is automated by big machinery. The management assembled their technical team and asked to get them a best way to suggest how would they resolve the issue. Many engineers proposed different solutions. They chose the top two:Both these solutions were somehow impractical. It was not suggestive to pass each soap box through a weighing machine as it slows down the manufacturing process since each soap box has to pass through. The second solution requires constant monitoring from a representative which is not recommended.The managers now placed a hefty prize money and asked the people who were working down in the line to suggest something for the issue. One maintenance laborer went to the manager and asked some money in advance for the solution. The maintenance guy said he will return back the money if he didn’t found the solution, but if he did, the manager will require to give him two times the prize money since he is also providing the mechanism for resolving the issue. The manager agreed and provided him some money.As the days progressed, the company heard fewer complaints about the empty soap boxes. Until one day, there were no complaints from them at all. The manager remembered the guy who mentioned he will find a solution. He thought may be it was his work. He met the guy and asked whether his solution worked. He said, absolutely, and asked whether he is receiving any complaints now. The manager responded, no they aren’t. The maintenance guy mentioned he will give him the mechanism once he provides him the agreed prize money. The manager had a discussion with higher officials and gave him his prize money.The whole management was curious on what the mechanism was, whether he used sensors or some machines. The maintenance guy requested only one person to accompany with him. His manager went along. They both stopped at a place where the belt with the soap boxes goes into other machinery where it packs them into boxes.The manager didn’t see anything unusual there. The maintenance guy casually bent down and turned on a switch. A fan, which was right besides the manager, started blowing some air. When it was on full speed, it just blowed away the empty boxes which he placed them for demonstration. He turned off the fan, unplugged it and handed it to the manager while slowly walking away.The moral of this story is pretty simple. If you understand the problem at a very fundamental level, it just requires a lazy ass to resolve it. Also, common sense is the best starting step to find a resolution to a problem. We see this lacking in some people causing them to do great hardship when it can be done with simple common sense.Edit:If it is already posted on Quora or if you have already read it, please down vote the answer.

I have seen times when my father did not have money to feed us. I have seen people standing at our door, shouting at my father to return the money he had borrowed from them. I have been working since I was 17. My school fee was paid through some NGO. I had to literally go and stand at some senior person’s door for hours to get his signature on my “Scholarship Form”. At time I have slept hungry to save some money. I have spent countless nights because of pain in my teeth, have lost two of them now. Never had money to get them treated. I started off as a sales boy in a clothes showroom. I never went to a college after my 12th standard. I used to work through out the year, and only could took out time for appearing for my exams. This is how I completed my graduation in commerce. I walked straight 10 kms to appear for my first interview, had boils at the end of this journey. Fortunately, cleared the interview and things started changing for me. Gradually I have made progress in my career, so much so that I own a car now. It has been a long journey.My girlfriend broke up with me because of my obvious financial problems. I still love her and miss her. I am 6′1 and those days my weight went down to 48 kgs. I went into depression. I did not have money, the girl I loved left me for some other guy.There were times when I wanted to kill myself, no kidding. I literally was few seconds away from killing myself. Not once, twice, thrice but many times. One thing that has kept me alive and kicking is The Bonding with my parents. I can’t see them in pain. It kills me from inside to even think about those days when they struggled to keep our lives going.Other thing, that has kept me going is the will to not give up. I am glad that I did not give up. I knew that was not my destiny, I knew I could do something good with myself. I am in a far better situation today.However, this is not the end of my story, certainly not the happy one.Things begin to settle down starting 2011 professionally. I started to gain weight, I am better than an average looking Indian male. Girls, still find me attractive. One such girl found me attractive around 2012–2013, we began talking. I was still trying to deal with my first love and this girl came as a huge relief and diversion. Things started looking good. Eventually, we fell in love. We were of different castes. I thought I was ready to get married. I tried talking to my parents and family before proposing her. My parents have been the strongest pillars of my life. We are a pure vegetarian family and this girl was one hardcore non-vegetarian. My parents still gave me their blessings. Yes, they love me and I love them too!!Wedding date was decided, and things began changing. She started dominating. She suddenly started having problems with my bonding with my family. She always knew that I did not come from a very financially sound background. Suddenly, she started feeling insecure about our future since my parents did not have any money. I thought she is just scared, she will settle down. We got married, and it has been 3 years now. Things have gotten worst. My parents do not stay with me, they live in our home town. They do visit us occasionally. My father is 60 now, I want them to stay with us but I do not want them to face things which I am facing. They do have a hint that things are not that great between us, but hopefully they do not know to what extent.I feel like I am going into depression. I don’t want to go for divorce since this would again make my parents vulnerable to our relatives torture. They had to face quite bad things when they stood with me when I wanted to get married to this girl. I again cry a lot. I thought my bad days were over when my journey of 10 years brought me to my current job, but I think I was wrong, insanely wrong.I still am not giving up. I won’t give up. I try harder every day to keep her happy. I try harder to hide all of this from my parents when I talk to them daily(I call them twice a day, it has been my routine since last 8 years. It is a short but mandatory call to ensure that all of us are safe and sound). I am hopeful that one day all of this will end. After all, IF IT IS NOT HAPPY, IT CAN NOT BE YOUR END!!!I hope, after reading this, your class 9th results won’t matter to you anymore. Life is much more than class 9th. Go, make some memories. Live your life!!!EDIT 1:Below are some pages from my personal diary, these dates back to years 2007–2008–2009.Present:2. Another page from my diary, these are few quotes which I used to write down to keep me moving.3. One more page, this I am talking about my then girlfriend. Here I am explaining how I had a dream about her. “I saw her going, I called her but she did not listen to me. She just keeps on going. I know I need help.Have started studying. Have nothing much to do. Miss her, watch TV, eat, sleep n study. Desperately need a job. I hope I get one after my exams. No one at home, everybody has gone to Rajasthan”.I used to stay at a relatives place, that was another struggle :D !!!Another positive, English!!!As mentioned earlier, I never went to a college. However, I still can walk English, talk English, sleep English :). I always wanted to look presentable and be presentable. There was this undying hunger with in. We did not have TV at our home, but once I shifted to my relatives place in search of Job I started watching Star Movies, AXN, HBO and those channels were my English teacher!!That is my babe, overlooking the beauty of one of the corners. I am an avid biker and love going on long rides & drives. The longest road trip I have taken so far is of 3000 Kms in my car!!!For those who have suggested a Divorce:I know, when we look at it, Divorce is the most easiest way out of my miseries. I appreciate that you took out time to help some one who does not even have a name for you. However, I still believe I could make this marriage work. I want to give it some more time. That girl has sacrificed a lot to get married to me. She comes for a upper middle class family and it would not have been easier for her to leave all that luxury and get married to me. I should have mentioned it earlier, my bad. Apologies.One thing I am very clear about is, the day my parents need me and if my wife stops me. That would be the last day of this relationship, till then I will not give up on this marriage!!!Thank you everyone for taking out time to read through my journey, and I am happy that I could give some of you a ray of hope and some inspiration._____________________________________________________EDIT 2: 6K+ Upvotes. Never thought, this journey of mine would be so interesting to read!! Never the less, thank you my fellow people.I almost missed to share a very important factor which has kept me going, and I think this could be of great help to many of you out there.No matter, how depressed or low I was. I never took to drinking or smoking. Trust me, things would have been very different if I had fallen into “Addiction” trap. There were times when I felt like buying that bottle, which every one says is an escape from all the miseries, fortunately I never gave in. I am glad, I did not.Love,A :) !!",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,9K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-uncommon-ways-to-work-smarter-instead-of-harder

Windows 10 and 11 both install the most up-to-date drivers and the only two that you might need to install are the audio and GPU drivers separately. But even those are perfectly fine if installed through windows updates. So I just install the requested OS, and turn the updates on while I work on something else.

This may sound like a “work harder” proclamation, but this is what I found helped kickstart the rest of my day!This is the same philosophy as “eat the frog” or “do the scariest thing first” and it has worked wonders for me.What I want you to realize about this is that it can mean anything from doing more in the day, to doing the most difficult thing first to doing everything you set out to do in the morning.There is no greater feeling than getting everything important done before noon! Think about having the rest of the day off AND already having accomplished some insanely big tasks!Motivation is an emotion you can call upon from time to time, but it generally comes and goes as it pleases. In this case motivation makes an exception and stays almost the rest of the day.Not only will you feel extremely motivated, which increases your productivity a lot, but you will also feel super confident, like you are owning the world and all other tasks will be a piece of cake.This is the reason so many successful people get up around 5 or 6 in the morning. The feeling will still be there no matter how early you get up because the world will still get the same amount done by noon regardless of how much you do.What I mean by that is this: Have you ever gone for a morning stroll before most people get to work or before some people get up? Maybe it was a very late night stroll or an early morning rise, but either way there was a calm sense of peace around, right?Compare that how it feels to go outside at noon and you will literally feel the differenc...",326 followers,Anubhav Jain,4.4K,4.4K,123.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-uncommon-ways-to-work-smarter-instead-of-harder
