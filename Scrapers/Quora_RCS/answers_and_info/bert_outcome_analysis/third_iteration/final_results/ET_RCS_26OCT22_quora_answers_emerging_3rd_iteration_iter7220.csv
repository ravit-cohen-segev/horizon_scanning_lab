Action expresses priorities. India’s first underwater rail tunnel completed ahead of schedule. The entire project is 16.6 km long, out of which 10.8 km runs under the ground. Of this 10.8 km, 502 metres is under the water. The tunnel is being dug 30 metres below the riverbed. The project connects Howrah to the west and Salt lake to the east. Digging this tunnel was the most difficult and critical task in the entire project. The stretch of 16.6 km will have 12 stations, six of which will be under the ground, while the remaining six stations will be on elevated tracks. Congratulate the engineers & employess of Afcons Transtonnelstroy and Kolkata Kolkata Metro Railway Corporation Ltd!! Thanks me later.3. A solar plant of the size and cost of a center table on your rooftop can insure your home against power cuts and halve your electricity bill. Made-in-IIT solar plant powers thousands of rural homes - smaller and cheaper than present installations. At a cost of Rs 20,000, the rooftop plant and storage system can run couple of tube lights, fans, charging points and a TV. The solar inverterless DC system is cost and energy-efficient as unlike other solar power systems, it does not convert direct current produced by a solar installation into alternate current . A 125W solar installation will require 10sqft space, while 500W requires 50 sqft of space. The system comes with a full DC wiring. A wonderful cost effective solution.4. The Made In India BMM300 clay brick making machine is genius. It cranks out bricks laying them in nice straight rows for easy collection. The production capacity is 300 brick/min. It is the world's only Mobile Brick Making machine. Made in Firozpur Bangur village in Sonepat, it stood 19th among 30 innovations that bagged the DST-Lockheed Martin India Innovation Growth Programme awards for 2016. Congratulate Vilas Chhikara and his team. Thanks me later.5.You can have results or excuses, not both. 13-year-old students from Tamil Nadu designed low-cost toilet urinals using 20-liter waste plastic bottles. Finding the stench that emanated from their school toilet unbearable, students at a government school in Trichy district designed low-cost urinals. The project won the ‘Boldest Idea’ award at the ‘I CAN Awards 2016’ organised by Design for Change. As the cost of installing urinals was high, the boys came up with an imaginative solution. Congratulating the students on their idea, the seller handed over used, damaged, and leaking water bottles free-of-cost. Using funds collected from the students and teachers, they purchased other necessary pipes and parts. To flush the urinals after use, they set up a line of drip irrigation pipes above the urinals. Congratulate the 5 member team – Supikpandian, Santhosh, Dhiyanithi, Ragul, and Prabaharan. Thanks me later.I think i answered this question to some extent.

By splitting the question I get a frame of reference and then the answer becomes fairly straight forward to comprehendThe answer to the first question is straight forward and India is much advanced compared to where we were in 2000. I am not going to elaborate this further because its for us to see. But should we be happy about it? That leads us to my second questionWhile it is true that India has advanced immensely in the last 20 years, the real question is has this made us more dependent on other countries? Most notably the United States and recently China?Despite having a population of 1.3 billion people and being touted as the software superpower (thanks to the IT services industry) not so long ago, India does not have self-reliance when it comes to technology. China created companies like Ali Baba, Baidu and Tencent a parallel to the American tech giants while India (even India’s telecom minister recently) takes pride in being the largest consumer of Whatsapp, and Facebook! Yes almost everyone has a mobile phone in India today and therefore the opportunities for growth is tremendous. But the real question one should ask is, who will be the beneficiaries of these opportunities? The mobile phones used in India are Chinese phones and the software used in these phones are U.S owned. Basically all our data, from our shopping habits to our entertainment preferences are in the hands of foreign technology companies. Now we know IoT is catching up fast and that means more control to these companies and India will be a proud consumer supplying data.One of the many important aspects discussed in Rajiv Malhotra’s latest book “Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Power, Five Battlegrounds” is India’s military dependence on foreign technology. While the manufacturing of Rafale jets will happen in India, the technology is owned by the French and let’s understand when such technology transfers occur between countries, the supplying country will always provide a technology that is one generation behind to the consuming country. That means we are technologically and militarily advanced compared to our previous generations but we are at least one generation behind the innovating countries! In certain areas like military that is not good newsMy last point on this is our pride in our Human resource and how skilled we are! Yes as individuals many Indians are CEOs of big foreign tech giants. But how does that benefit India as a nation? Do we have a stake in the intellectual property of these products? Can we say for instance Sunder Pichai as Google’s CEO holds the same clout in his company as Mark Zuckerberg holds in Facebook? Certainly not! Let’s not confuse individual brilliance with technological advancement as nation.For India to have a grand standing in the world stage as a technologically advanced nation, we need to come out of our consumer mindset and to quote Rajiv Malhotra’s words “be producers of knowledge and technology”.",979 followers,Juzuo Zhang,1.6K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-advanced-is-India-compared-to-other-countries

16,"Here is a relatively short list:Here is a relatively short list:Having  a number of high impact and high leverage solutions is important.  Its  also critical to find solutions which fit the specific needs and  contexts of the people on the ground--how they live and how they farm  and how they sell their crops.I think if you pick 3 or 4 of these...it can go a long way.  IDE has been pretty successful with drop irrigation and treddle pumps (along with going after crops like strawberries).  Also, you can partner with other organizations which provide complementary services.  For instance the One Acre Fund provides services for other non-profits in the regions they work in.  I believe all of the above can be used with small farmers.Also if you Google ""increase yields in Africa"" or ""increased yields in India"" or whatever country you are interested in you can find some more answers.  You might even look for ""low cost ways to increase yields in (insert country, continent, or region)""Here are some other resources:I highly recommend CGIAR.  Its super-legit.  They have like 14 global research centers.  I haven't read any of the research out of AGRA, but I'm going to assume thats its pretty legit given its support from Bill & Melinda Gates as well as Rockefeller.  I'm also not as personally familiar with the International Food Policy Research Institute, but pretty important they are linked to by the World Economic Forum article.  You might also check this thread which is titled specific to Africa but doest contain a number of key technologies for farmers:In terms of Africa, this is a pretty interesting blurb, some of which echos what I said above:""Investment in smallholder agriculture and rural development is the foundation for economic growth,"" he said. ""Having witnessed the capacity of African farmers to adopt new technology and make it work to their profit, I know that smallholder agriculture needs to be seen as a business.""Agriculture remains a critical sector for African economies. It accounts for about 30 per cent of sub-Saharan Africa's gross domestic product and a high portion of export value. In most countries, agriculture accounts for more than 60 per cent of employment. But despite this, African smallholder farmers are faced with a host of stumbling blocks to increase their yields and get their goods to market - such a lack of infrastructure or access to technologies - that are compounded by climate and food price shocks.""In order to create a transformation in African agriculture we need to put smallholder farmers at the center of sector exchanges by seamlessly connecting them to each other as well as local and regional markets,"" Nwanze said. ""Nwanze said that the private sector, including buyers, can also improve the ability of smallholders to have access to local, regional or global markets""I am glad to see that the public and the private sector will sit around the same table at the AGRF - a step closer to helping smallholder farmers become commercially viable in African and beyond,"" Nwanze added.Africa has always been a major focus of IFAD's work, and has traditionally received a large share of the Fund's resources. In 2011, for example, sub-Saharan Africa accounted for about 43 per cent of IFAD funding.Source:",46 followers,Manpreet Singh,4.7K,85,133K,2013,https://www.quora.com/How-advanced-is-India-compared-to-other-countries

Koenigsegg for example employs some very advanced engine and chassis technology with things like it’s Free Valve engine technology or a transmission they employ in one of their cars which is a sequential manual gearbox that lays claim to the fastest shifting transmission to date. Koenigsegg is a very innovative company.Toyota lays claim to the most thermally efficient engine on the plant at this time as another example and so on.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,573,65,4.2M,2022,https://www.quora.com/How-advanced-is-India-compared-to-other-countries

I make a non-trivial amount of money from my Android apps but I make more than double that amount on my iOS apps.But to the main point… Android sucks. I know this sounds like a religious argument, but bear with me.To be clear, as an AndroidApple works diligently to make iOS WORK very well AND look good at the same time. Many of the bits of visual candy that Apple includes in iOS actually help with usability, they aren’tHowever, Google focused primarily on just getting the basics of Android working because they valued the idea of individual expression by the developers as opposed to Apple who wanted apps to have a consistent look and feel. (I used to work at Google, so I understand the inside mentality.) The problem is that the vast majority of developers are not trained in usability or graphical design and so their apps looked crude and worked crudely. Around the time of Android 4.x Google realized they had a real problem because no two Android apps worked in the same fashion because every developer came up with a different approach. They started trying to standardize the UI and they got some of their graphics people to try to make the visual elements look nicer. It still wasn’t great.Here is a specific example of the difference in effort from the developer’s perspective. I have a feature in one of my iOS apps and I wanted to make sure that feature was in the Android version as well.The feature involves tapping+holding on an item in a list/table and then dragging it upward or downward to reorder the items in the table (drag and drop). In iOS, this only took me 23 lines of code because essentially everything is already built-in to the underlying iOS system. The UITableView object (the scrolling lists you see everywhere in iOS) already knows how to respond to tap+hold and already knows how to animate moving the row as you drag around your finger… and already applies a nice drop shadow as you’re dragging the row around… and already knows how to animate the other rows of the table to move out of the way as you drag this one row around, etc. It also already has built-in hooks so that the system can ask my code: Should the user be allowed to drag this row? Can the user drop this row in between x and y? and it’ll tell me The User just dragged and dropped this row at this new location, which allows my code to respond to that event.That’s why my iOS code is only 23 lines long. All I have to do is write code that says which rows are draggable and then to respond to them dropping the row so that I can update the underlying data. I implemented this feature in a few minutes on iOS.But Android does NONE of that which is why my Android code is 567 lines long and it took me 3 days to get it all working. Thankfully, in this ONE particular case, I didn’t have to write all of that code myself because SO many other Android developers had complained about missing this incredibly basic feature. In response, Google had posted some “sample code” that showed how to manually create a rudimentary form of the dragging/dropping. Of course, that code was out of date because it was written for Android 4 and didn’t work for Android 5, 6, or 7 (7.x is the current version as of this writing).And their sample code didn’t involve any features for checking if certain rows in the list/table should be allowed to be dragged. It didn’t include any checking if a row should be allowed to dropped in a certain location. It didn’t include the ability to set a callback so that your code could respond to the reordering. I had to take all of their rudimentary, buggy code and try to improve it so that it did more than the kindergarten version of the feature.That meant I spent multiple days to produce a feature that doesn’t even work as well or look as good as the feature that already exists in iOS and took me only a few minutes. I took a screenshot of the code from both and placed them side-by-side so I could use it to explain the difference. (see below. The screenshot includes the comments in the code, but I didn’t count comments in my line counts.)Whenever I have a client that wants their app on both iOS and Android, I tell them the Android version will take 4 times longer to produce and will only be about 80% as good. When I give them the quote, I determine how much the iOS app will take to produce and then I multiply that number by 2.5 to cover the Android version… which doesn’t -truly- pay for all of my time on the Android version, but charging 4 times the amount sounds ludicrous to them because they don’t know what it’s like.","4,105 followers",Mehmet Fidanboylu,662,166,5.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-advanced-is-India-compared-to-other-countries
