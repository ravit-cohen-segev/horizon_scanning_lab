0,"Because nobody has problems that blockchain solves better than other options.Unless your problem is you hate government financial policy but you really wish the FBI could flawlessly track your every purchase on a public ledger so you like cryptocurrency.Everything else is handled better by a trusted central party.Heck, if the popularity of exchanges says anything, the best way to use Bitcoin is to never actually use the blockchain.",356 followers,Gordon Miller,1.8K,10K,165.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-arent-governments-investing-in-Blockchain-as-much-as-they-invest-in-other-emerging-technologies
1,"The reason is money. They can not support cryptocurrency. Otherwise they will dig their own grave. Those who control power control and money, and if you do not control money, then you lose power. Support will be provided by the stable central bank of the countries. All other projects are uninteresting to them.

2,"Its not discussed in any serious way by anyone grounded in technology and economics.It is a hobby-horse for people looking for some rationale to boost the notion of “space mining”, for which no economic case can be made for the foreseeable future.He-3 is offered as a fuel source for a technology that does not exist, controlled commercial He-3 + D fusion. This reaction is attractive in that the fuels are stable, few neutrons are produced (D+D side reactions are inevitable though), and no fuel needs to be bred with said neutrons.The only problem (well, not the only one) is that we have no idea hIts not discussed in any serious way by anyone grounded in technology and economics.It is a hobby-horse for people looking for some rationale to boost the notion of “space mining”, for which no economic case can be made for the foreseeable future.He-3 is offered as a fuel source for a technology that does not exist, controlled commercial He-3 + D fusion. This reaction is attractive in that the fuels are stable, few neutrons are produced (D+D side reactions are inevitable though), and no fuel needs to be bred with said neutrons.The only problem (well, not the only one) is that we have no idea how to build a fusion reactor that might be able to use the He-3 + D fuel. Currently we have good ideas about how to build one that uses the easiest to fuse fuel: D + T. We can’t actually build a power plant this way yet, but the actual/proposed ITER -> DEMO -> PROTO international tokamak fusion energy project can probably build one, perhaps as soon as 50 years from now. It won’t be able to produce economically viable power, mind you, but it could be built.Here is a chart showing how easily the key fuels fuse:This are the reaction rate parameters for Maxwellian average fuels at the temperatures indicated. This is from page 8 ofExisting fusion reactor concepts operate in the range from 10–30 keV. Looking at the chart you will find that the reaction rate for the the He-3/D reaction at that temperature is hundreds of times slower. So it is hundreds of times harder to fuse than than the easiest fuel, which still has no hope of producing cost competitive power.So this is all pie in the sky speculation which might be relevant some centuries from now (or maybe not even then - we don’t know).",UNKNOWN,Mr. Testtubehead,732,3K,2.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-arent-governments-investing-in-Blockchain-as-much-as-they-invest-in-other-emerging-technologies
3,"Lunar He3 is in the parts per billion. Extracting it would take loads of energy and may only be on the surface (required very large farms, and meaning that there’s not much of it).Jupiter’s atmosphere, however, is 24% helium by mass, and so we could probably get in the parts per million, and separating gases is arguably easier, plus you could get large amounts of energy from fusing the helium-3 and deuterium that is in the atmosphere of Jupiter, whereas deuterium is even rarer on the lunar surface.But Neptune is even better, but much further. But once you have fusion of a high enough caliber,Lunar He3 is in the parts per billion.

But once you have fusion of a high enough caliber, getting to Neptune isn’t much of an issue. Neptune has a higher fraction of Helium in its atmosphere and has less gravity than Jupiter, and so would be easier to mine. Only problem is distance, but again, fusion rockets could get there pretty quick, and fuel tankers could go much slower, and since we probably wouldn’t need too much of it anyways…Point is: lunar mining might be a thing, but it’d be short term, only used up until we can economically mine Jupiter, Neptune, or Uranus’s atmospheres. Saturn isn’t a good candidate, since it has the lowest helium fraction of any gas planet in the solar system.Still, this stuff is probably centuries off, if not millennia.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-arent-governments-investing-in-Blockchain-as-much-as-they-invest-in-other-emerging-technologies
4,"I see three major trends in early childhood education:(1) ProfessionalizationAs the importance of early childhood education becomes increasingly understood, not only by researchers but by the general public, there is a trend toward higher quality early childhood education.

Instead of ""daycares"" where children can be dropped off for babysitting / child-minding services, we are seeing an increase in early learning programs that offer stimulating learning environments for children. To deliver high-quality early learning there is a requirement for more educated teachers so you are seeing increasing minimum requirements for early childhood educator positions, but also will hopefully see a trend of higher wages as well.(2)Progressive countries are moving away from child ""assessments"" and teaching children based on prescriptive curriculum and lesson plans. Instead, they are moving towards an emergent learning model where teachers take cues from the children and where their interests lie to inform their program plans. This style of pedagogy has been shown to result in better outcomes for children at this age. A more flexible program plan, however, also requires teachers that are well-versed and capable in delivering this type of learning, hence reinforcing the trend of professionalization.(3) InnovationThere is an increasing acceptance in early childhood education that innovation and technology are central to progress and, ultimately, improving outcomes for children. In what has traditionally been a sector that is a laggard in adopting innovative solutions, there has been great strides taken in the last several years. In particular, the accessibility of affordable technology, such as tablets, has made it easier for early years programs to explore apps and other technologies that can support a higher quality learning environment for both teachers and children.","358,983 followers",Sean Kernan,6K,5.6K,727.1M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Why-arent-governments-investing-in-Blockchain-as-much-as-they-invest-in-other-emerging-technologies
5,"US answer here.From middle school onward, not using physical textbooks, partly due to expense and storage issues. Instead, use online textbooks with accompanying videos and online homework. Or drop the textbooks entirely.Use of printed handouts. My two children studied algebra 1 in middle school in two different states. Both teachers handed out printed material which the children folded up and pasted into their composition books. It substituted for a textbook and was part of their grades.Less homework. More assignments done in class, with teacher supervision.Use of personal digital technology.US answer here.From middle school onward, not using physical textbooks, partly due to expense and storage issues.

It substituted for a textbook and was part of their grades.Less homework. More assignments done in class, with teacher supervision.Use of personal digital technology. From middle school on, it was assumed that all children had personal cell phones. Teachers would send homework reminders, class assignments, messages to cell phones. Students are expected to take photos of class notes on their own phones. Over the past five years, cell phones went from being banned in school to required.More group assignments, which foster teamwork and communication skills, important in the workplace.Teaching to the test and benchmarking. State boards of education mandate skills to be taught. Tests are supposedly designed to measure those skills. Tests are administered several times per year to gauge progress. Children are explicitly taught standardized test taking skills, such as proper pencil bubbling.Opportunities for extra credit to raise academic scores. I think this one is to reward children for effort and to put less emphasis on subject tests.Digital education over analog skills: less handwriting, little to no cursive, learning proper digital communication etiquette early, kindergarten keyboarding, internet research skills.Far fewer “dead white guys”; more emphasis on contemporary life and situations. Unless you attend a private college preparatory school or competitive public school, you don’t read the classics/Western canon. For those who attend state universities or go into technical education such as engineering and business, this normally does not handicap you. If you want an Ivy education, you should read up. This is a huge difference to when I was in school.Less emphasis on memorization, even for times tables. Less emphasis on mental math. Parents are expected to have their children master these skills. This is why McDonald’s can’t process your order when computers are down; they can’t figure the total and the tax in their head.Emphasis on “the numbers” - if high school students don’t do well academically, they do quickie remediation through online classes such as Plato to gain credit to graduate, or are encouraged to transfer to a “home school” so the high school graduation rate stays up.More acknowledgment of different learning styles. Many assignments are given with choices: do a project kinesthetically, aurally, or submit artwork or digital presentation.More acknowledgment of different cultural norms. Children move around more to different schools, more are in poverty, more children have less grasp on written and spoken English (I include native English speakers of all races here.) More emphasis on making sure children have access to food all day and have access to tutoring on the basics.",47 followers,Deepak Mishra,6.1K,2.4K,138.4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-arent-governments-investing-in-Blockchain-as-much-as-they-invest-in-other-emerging-technologies

That field was Civil Engineering. Without hesitation, I accepted and had no clue where I was heading.There is no best field ‘myth’ here. If you follow the business market, one field becomes best for 2 or 3 years in terms of salary and it is surpassed by another field. For instance, take the Engineering field. Everybody became. an Engineer like it is a gift and the opportunity to have one decent job for any undergraduate becomes complicated and much harder. Right now, we are on the verge of paying 40–60 thousand Birr to be hired in one of the banks, which is painful.So, please take a path that interests you and never merely choose the ‘majority rule’ path. For the young generation, please don’t take any move driven by emotions, peer pressure, family pressure, or anything related to it. Simply sit and look back at the type of science you were interested, and if you are good at say Chemistry and Biology, Medicine and related fields are the best; If you like Physics and Maths, engineering is the best. Also for social sciences, you can go on the business sector or other social sectors.
