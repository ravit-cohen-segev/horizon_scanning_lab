1,"Well, we’ll always be part of the clade of hominids, the great apes. It would take a very long time to become a hominid that was no longer considered an ape but something else - maybe if we ever become energy beings.","220,627 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,783M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-possible-future-of-mobile-application-developers-if-mobile-technologies-evolve-yearly
2,"We’re continuing to evolve physically. For instance, some people are more resistant to this novel coronavirus than others, either due to their physical makeup or tendency towards healthy lifestyle choices. This outbreak will tend to weigh the surviving population towards those who have genetically better resistance for one reason or another. That is how evolution works.I’m not trying to be cold towards those suffering. I believe I may have the virus myself, and have an 87 year old father to worry about. I am anxious and upset.

3,"Any tool use is technology.Dairying, the routine keeping of mammals for milk production, is a historically important technology. And in cultures where dairying was developed, we generally see the evolution of lactase persistance — the generation of the enzyme to digest milk sugar long after typical weaning.The opposite, wild-type condition is lactose intolerance. It can be quite unpleasant, because if you don’t digest milk sugar there are bacteria in your gut which will be quite happy to do so — with the concomitant production of copious quantities of gas.

4,"There weren’t any great inventions, but experience in war bought on a few, mostly strategic, shifts.The most pronounced shift was the shit towards bigger and bigger frigates, driven by the American ships such asIn the War of 1812, however, the US deployed bigger frigates of up to 50 guns, in a role not unlike that of the NaziThere weren’t any great inventions, but experience in war bought on a few, mostly strategic, shifts.The most pronounced shift was the shit towards bigger and bigger frigates, driven by the American ships such asIn the War of 1812, however, the US deployed bigger frigates of up to 50 guns, in a role not unlike that of the NaziUSS ConstitutionThe greatest innovation of the war was the invention of the blockade, or more the perfection of a permanent blockade. Blockades had been used in the past, since Athens became a naval power at least, but never before had anyone managed to keep a fleet permanently stationed at the mouth of an enemy port.The British blockade of Europe was the first modern close blockade, and largely down to the 1st Earl of St Vincent, Sir John Jervis. He is more famous for battle his title is named for, but was a very effective administrator as well. Even before Trafalgar, he organised the very first effective blockade, of Brest on the Cotentin Peninsula. Mostly through a reorganisation of his ships’ food supplies, he enabled his fleet to stand off Brest and keep the French permanently imprisoned.A contemporary diagram showing just how small Napoleon is compared to the mighty Englishman, fed on noble roast beef.The economic effects of this were secondary to the effects on the French fleet - unable to train in seamanship, they became far inferior to the British sailors (in skill if not bravery) and removed them as a threat to the Channel.","12,760 followers",Khalid Elhassan,900,1.2K,38.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-possible-future-of-mobile-application-developers-if-mobile-technologies-evolve-yearly
5,"Ever heard of the Sqweel? The earliest record of this was from a boisterous but backward tribe who invented what was a ‘square wheel’. Whilst this had limited success, it actually only lasted about two weeks. Another settlement came by moving stuff in a cart with exotic looking ’round wheels’. After much scoffing, derision and some good natured clubs to the head, the proponents of the sqweel challenged the ‘round wheelers’ to a race. It was a humiliating defeat for the sqweel which quickly became wood for another recent discovery (by that particular tribe), fire. The ‘wheel’ as it became widelEver heard of the Sqweel?

6,"Not At all !!Biggest flaw in Indian income tax system are1. Its snatching money from people who are fair and earning with hard work , mostly salaried people who cannot hide their income.2. They are giving exception to people of many classes like landlords who act as farmer but not the actual farmer who is treated as a lobour by land owners of farms, I will say more pseudo farmers are earning money more than taxable income than salaried still they are exempted,even many farm landlords are super rich.3.

Income tax system is so complicated that most people pay money to filing their tax return , even some companies popped up to do for them like ClearTax.When salaried people see their hard earned money being snatched and rich farmers and businessmen are enjoying all subsidies like farm loan waivers with their money without paying any taxes then they feel cheated.When they see these politicians doing scams of their hard earned money then they feel cheated .But they don’t have any options as their tax is deducted before it reaches to them (TDS). They start to avoid paying tax by using some investment and others.Large business hire charted accountants to save the tax and some starts evading it by investing in offshore companies.Who are the biggest losers ?
