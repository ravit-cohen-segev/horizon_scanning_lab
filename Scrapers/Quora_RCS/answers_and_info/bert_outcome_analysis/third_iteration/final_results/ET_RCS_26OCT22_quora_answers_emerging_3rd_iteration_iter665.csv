Many trans women who seek surgical treatment frequently don't feel the need for top surgery as HRT covers that, but those that do feel the need for augmentation or implants should have similar results as cis women who get their breasts done. FTM top surgeries are fairly decent, there are a few different surgery options for individual needs and many people who get it retain at least some of their sensation and depending on the surgery there can even be very minimal scarring. Bottom surgery on the other hand isn't great, there are few options and both of the penile options have massive downsides. For example the phalloplasty option allows for the surgeon and patient to have better control over size and the patient is more likely to have functions like penetration and the ability to pee standing up but they are much less likely to retain ability to orgasm and the phallus remains the same size always, requiring an implant to become erect, meaning that a larger phallus doesn't look as natural while it's meant to be soft. Metiodioplasty patients are less likely to be able to stand to pee and penetrate as the surgery works with bottom growth from T and does not add length, it's still possible to do both and the bigger the patient is the better the chance but it won't work for everyone. The patient retains feeling and ability to orgasm but at a pretty big size loss maxing out at around 2–3 inches compared to phalloplasty's 4-6 inches.",12 followers,Marc Lawrence,877,12.6K,148.5M,2022,https://www.quora.com/How-hard-is-it-to-get-a-scholarship-for-the-Massachusetts-Institute-of-Technology-as-a-top-student-from-England

Your background2. Your interest (red team versus blue team: red team attacks and blue team defends and both are equally important)3. Market/job opportunityYou can be an inch deep and miles wide in security or you can be inch wide and miles deep. For example there are different skill set required based on at which layer(network, OS,application , data) you are providing security. For example1. Network security (IPS, proxy, web filtering, email filtering, firewall, APT detection, next gen firewall and so on )2. Endpoint security (mostly desktops,mobile and laptops)3. Application security (code review, white box testing, black box testing and all three requires different kind of skill sets)4. Server security (web server, application server, database servers)5. Data security ( encryption, DRM, tokenization, compliance , data classification and policies and so forth)6. Network forensics or endpoint forensics7. Incident response and security monitoring8 malware analysis and reversing9. Hardware hacking (p0wning IoT devices smart meters, phones or Barbie dolls for fun)10. Surveillance (man in the middle for cell phones, sessions , cookie stealing, and so on)These are some of the high level buckets you have to think about and what matches your background.But before you do that I would strongly advice following .1. Read the entire TCP/IP illustrated volume I and when you finish it, read it one more time. If you can't finish the whole book atleast read first 10 chapters. You can thank me later.2. Read basics of port scanning on3. Read up on cyber kill chain4. Download kali from5. Once you are familiar with Kali and tools, Start with CTF (capture the flag) and try and solve few challenges.Now you have basics to conquer any advanced stuff in network and data security. For application security specially for white box testing or security code review you should have some programming background.Application security , malware reversing and security monitoring are really hot. Depending on the vertical you choose data security and compliance can be really in demand for example financial , healthcare or retail.Last but not least, there are ton of books on the topics I mentioned above , and ton of material onNow after all this if you say on top of this I have CISSP or CISA then it holds some water but it won't automatically get you a job just because you are CISSP . By the way there is an inside joke within security community but may be will table that for some other time.Good luck and I promise, you will never ever be bored in security.Regards,Vijay""If you can see the invisible you can do the impossible""P.S : the question was changed after it was answered.

13,"They are asking the pits for permission to use the engine mapping that gives them the most power.Since I am a 60 years old guy that always dreamed to be a race car driver, I’ll give you an example of what that means in my racing simulator.Last week I was racing at Mosport (Canada) and I was holding a nice P3. Because this was a GT3 series (supercars) I did most of the race at the “full power engine mapping”.I went to the pits and put in fuel to finish the race.

Because this was a GT3 series (supercars) I did most of the race at the “full power engine mapping”.I went to the pits and put in fuel to finish the race. However, by the time I returned and got in traffic, I was in P11. For a time I didn’t need full engine power to race in the little “train” of cars I was stuck with, so I changed the mapping to a fuel saving mode.Once the guys in front pitted themselves, I realized there was a car behind me that was gaining. I switched back to “full power” mapping and I was able to keep him back, barely.Toward the end of the race, I realized that I screwed up on the fuel. With about 6 laps to go I put it back on fuel saving and I did what I could to save fuel, and the guy behind started gaining again.I did a quick calculation and figured that I was going to be short by about half a lap, so I further mapped the engine to max savings and I drove like a nun. Better to finish a position back than not finish at all. The guy behind me was now less than a second back, but he too must have realized he was running short, so he slowed down.Now it was 2 of us, P3 and P4 driving as if on a Sunday drive. With 1 lap to go, P2 entered the pits for a splash. He too screwed up, so now I was P2 and my nemesis P3. I crossed the finish line with the engine sputtering.Had I not gone in fuel saving mode, I would have stopped short of the finish (which has happened to me at various times and it’s no fun).Conversely, if I did the whole race in fuel saving mode I would not have finished P2 at all.For the guys in F1 a screw up like that would cost them million$, so fuel management is imperative. It also makes the engines last longer, which is a serious concern in real life racing, as engines as costly and limited.However, and this is important, the driver is in charge of turning that knob, not the pit crew. However, in the pits they have the data and they are not driving, so they can calculate fuel consumption and lap times better than the driver can. Hence the reason why a driver asks for permission to set the engine at the various “maps”.",778 followers,Rohn Jay Miller,3.3K,58,5.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-hard-is-it-to-get-a-scholarship-for-the-Massachusetts-Institute-of-Technology-as-a-top-student-from-England

Max Verstappen, the headstrong Red Bull driver, jumped out to the lead on lap one and never looked back. After the halfway point of the race he held a 12 second lead over Mercedes’ Valtteri Bottas in second place. Verstappen heard that Lewis Hamilton, bumped to last place on the opening lap because of a tire puncture, set a lap record as he worked his way back up the order. Verstappen responded by setting a lap record of his own.The Red Bull team sent orders out to Max to run his car “to the target time” the team had agreed to. This was almost a second a lap slower than the lap record he had just set. The reason? With a comfortable 12+ second lead, Red Bull wanted to make sure Verstappen didn’t blow his Renault engine up before winning the race. In effect the Red Bull team told Verstappen to slow down to avoid a catastrophic loss of the engine.At that point in the race Verstappen’s teammate at the time Danny Ricciardo had been knocked out by engine failure, as had both of the Renault works cars driven by Carlos Sainz and Nico Hulkenberg. Red Bull had good reason to fear that Verstappen’s engine might be next if he didn’t slow down. (Once Verstappen slowed down Hamilton again set a new lap record—but the Red Bull team deliberately didn’t tell Verstappen over the radio, to avoid Verstappen feeling challenged to once again put the hammer down and beat Hamilton’s single lap time.)Verstappen went on to win the Mexico Grand Prix that day.In every F1 race every driver is aware of “target” times the team strategists want him to hit at various times in the race. That target changes depending on the circumstances. For example, if a car is contending for the lead and a rival decides to pit, you’ll hear the first team’s engineer on the radio saying, “push! push!” to their driver—meaning “speed up!” This is to try an build an advantage over t...",16 followers,Dave Reynolds,11.1K,445,1.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-know-the-top-10-demanding-technology

This is an automated process that many of us don’t even realize is happening.This button exists for several reasons:It is hard to say whether or not this button is a good thing.On one hand, this button made China where she is in the world today, we simply refuse to be bullied by foreign powers. No compromises.On the other hand, this button made China seems love to act aggressively in certain situations, this topic is worth a whole answer on its own.When Trump kicked off the trade war, for example, many of us immediately connects this trade “war” with the Opium Wars. The British Empire was unhappy with their trade deficit with China, and the next thing you know, all hell broke loose.At any rate, it’s hard to say which direction this mentality will take China and her people in the future.

19,"My feeling are mixed. When we first went back to Taiwan and China in the ‘70’s to ‘80’s, we recognize that we are Americans because of our behavior and attitude are not Chinese even if we looked “Chinese”.

When we first went back to Taiwan and China in the ‘70’s to ‘80’s, we recognize that we are Americans because of our behavior and attitude are not Chinese even if we looked “Chinese”.

We did not have to go through the turmoils of the beginning of Communist China.On the other hand, culturally, we are more Chinese. Can’t do without Chinese food and followed a modest living style. Even though I have not encounter any prejudices, Chinese are subjected to be “stereotyped”. So we are not totally accepted as typical Americans as depicted in TV for example. And racial prejudice has prevented us from being fully participating in the American political system - unlike the Jewish population, which looks “white”.I was for a few years an active Republican but gave up on the party when it passed Medicare D without providing for its funding — more deficit spending to buy senior votes.So given that we are not fully accepted as typical Americans and as we retain our Chinese cultural orientation it is only natural for us to be proud to see the advancement of China in all aspect of economic parameters. Having observed poverty in pre 1949 China, the rise in the standard of living, literacy, and the development of Chinese infrastructure makes one proud to be associated with its culture and heritage. And given the achievement of CCP in governing China, one can appreciate the potential for other than “western democracy” in governing a society - although personally I would not want to live under such system.I am particularly struck by the praises of Africans living in the U.S. on their appreciation of how China is helping African nations to develop their economies.As I accept the words of Chinese government that it has no interest in becoming a hegemony and with the existence of nuclear weapons, my concern is how America will handle the natural decline of its influence world-wide. Our hope is that the rivalry will be managed or handled peacefully.Unfortunately the recent actions of the Trump administration has only increased this concern or even worse, fear.

China does not intentionally seek world dominance.Second, China will not export her political ideology; she’s not America.China minds her own business.
