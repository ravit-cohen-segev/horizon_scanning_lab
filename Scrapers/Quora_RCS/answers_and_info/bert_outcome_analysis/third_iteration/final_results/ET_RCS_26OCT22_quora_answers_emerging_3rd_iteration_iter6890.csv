1,"Africa is growing, and people should stop constantly singling out Africa. If they are worried about regions of the world that are not growing, they should probably be worried about Europe and the EU, as the graph below shows Europe’ economic growth has stalled, and the European region is projected to experience virtually no economic growth till the year 2050.Sub-Saharan Africa together with Asia,Africa is growing, and people should stop constantly singling out Africa. If they are worried about regions of the world that are not growing, they should probably be worried about Europe and the EU, as the graph below shows Europe’ economic growth has stalled, and the European region is projected to experience virtually no economic growth till the year 2050.Sub-Saharan Africa together with Asia, currently have some of the fastest growing economies in the world, as shown on the graph below:The collective GDP per capita of Africa currently in the year 2019, is ($1930), which is almost the same as India’s 2019 GDP per capita of $2199 (India is an Asian country with similar population as all of Africa) at about 1.3 billion people. So if people think Indian who have about the same per capita income as African countries are okay, why are they constantly painting Africa as poor?Second, countries around the world are not extremely ahead of African countries as people falsely believe. In our modern era, the differences between countries in terms of development is not very substantial, so it is not like the rest of the world is in the “computer age”, and African countries are in the “Stone Age”.If you are someone who has traveled just a bit, you would have realize that there can be several areas of Africa that are much more developed than some areas in Western countries. Western countries just happen to have more areas developed than Africa.Some projections by the world Bank indicate Africa in general, and Sub-Saharan Africa in particular, will soon witness very substantial growth in GDP and GDP per capita. PriceWaterhouse Coopers, is actually projecting a GDP for Africa that will be around $29 trillion dollars by the year 2050, almost equivalent to what the whole European Union’s (EU28) economy is projected to be by the year 2050.This will mean if Africa were a country, it will be around the same rank as India in either number three or number four position in the world.Personally, I prefer to use a very low growth rate of about 3.5% to project how Africa’s economy will be in about 30 years.Using this approach, I still arrive at an African continent with a very high collective GDP of about $9 trillion dollars. I you multiply the $9 trillion dollars by Africa’s GDP to PPP multiplier of about (2.9 average), you arrive at a “yuge” GDP (PPP) of $26 trillion dollars.The high economic growth in Africa is already beginning to show in the number of people who are in the middle class:You can see from the table above that even currently, apart from Europe and Asia, Africa has more people in the mid...",83 followers,Josalone Wordsworth,547,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-we-can-have-centres-of-innovation-in-Ghana-or-Africa-where-new-technologies-will-be-developed-for-the-rest-of-the-world

We are arguably the only country in the world that have the most peaceful Christian and Muslim coexistence (visit Nima in Accra and you'll see churches close to mosques).So why are we portrayed as a poor nation is because of bad media representation. We are just fine. Of course we can do better with better governance and less corruption. But so can any nation.No study can significantly point out truthfully why Ghana can be considered a poor country. At least we have a peaceful democracy than most other nations.We have more potential of growth and sustainability than many advanced countries.

One should understand that modern warfare is fought with systems instead of piece-by-piece equipment, hence even some minor omission in an otherwise complete combat system (i.e. a fleet and all of the support units and infrastructure attached) can lead to seriously handicapped performance of the system. Also, even within the US military, some rather new equipment to one branch can have been long retired by another (the AH-1W Super Cobra, for example).With that in mind, here is an incomplete list of the Republic of China (ROC) military arsenal items that are indeed “state-of-the-art” by US standards in various degrees - I will also attach the really, really NOT “state-of-the-art” part below:I’ve been really scraping around the corners here.

First, the battleship wouldn’t fit in any of Taiwan’s harbors, so it would have to dock in Guam.

Also, he pointed out that the battleship used sophisticated computers that required career officers to use efficiently, and he said that the ROC Navy just didn’t have that kind of personnel. Plus, all the computer systems were in English, and although his English was excellent, he did not place much faith in the English ability of the Navy.In another answer to this question, Edmund Leung hit the nail on the head: it is protection money.

This is why even ROC lost 99% of its land to the Communist in 1949, it still had strong support in Washington till the 1970s... The Treaty/Law that was written in the 1970s/80s pretty much gave USA the power to sell any weapon to Taiwan, as long as USA wish to (and China which is still relatively weak in the 70s and 80s, failed to push USA to legislatively block arm sales to Taiwan).SO.. the situation Continues... that although USA diplomatically recognize PRC, but military the USA refuses to sell weapon to PRC, the USA keeps selling weapons to ""the other China"" (Taiwan/ROC)",74 followers,Chia Hak Thye,658,318,162.3K,2018,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-we-can-have-centres-of-innovation-in-Ghana-or-Africa-where-new-technologies-will-be-developed-for-the-rest-of-the-world

And let’s be honest, another world war would most likely mean nuclear winter and cockroaches dominate the world. So let’s not go there.US being the military superpower world police because the US had utilized its success in WWII and strategically created a military network around the world, from military bases, to its 7 fleets, to the CIA’s relentless effort of creating “friendly” governments (with various degrees of success…), to its media dominance of the public opinions. the US got to do that because it takes advantage of a very unique international political climate after WWII, and such climate will most likely never repeat itself for another superpower to do the same thing.On top of that, the US had consistently spent a significant amount of money in their military.China will never compete with that.And the key point here is that China doesn’t care about competing with that.Yes yes… we’ve all seen the footage of military parades and fly-pass over Taiwan… yes, I get that, it looks scary especially CNN and Reuters make it looks like WWIII is imminent.And it doesn’t help when Chinese nationalists get off on bragging about how they’re going to take Taiwan in 2 days. (eye roll…) I mean, we all have our own equivalent of “MAGA” people.The truth is, China cares more about trade and commerce than military and war. Chinese want a strong army because they don’t want the hundred years of shame to repeat itself. They want a strong army so they can defend themselves against foreign invaders (which most likely won’t happen) and protect overseas Chinese citizens.
