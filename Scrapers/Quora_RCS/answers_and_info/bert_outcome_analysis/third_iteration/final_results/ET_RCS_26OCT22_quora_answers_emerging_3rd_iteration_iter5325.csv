6,"The shitty mark one human can work about 8 to 10 hours a day, requires around 2500 calories worth of foodstuff to function and has a power output of around 0.1 horsepower in repetitive tasks.Historically a major upgrade was the oxen. It could also work around 8 hours a day, fed a diet of roughage and had a power output of around 0.57 horsepower.An improvement on this was the draft horse which had a power output of around 0.86 horsepower. A horse required higher quality food and its ability to pull heavy loads was slightly less than that of a oxen, but it could move about twice as fast.As you mThe shitty mark one human can work about 8 to 10 hours a day, requires around 2500 calories worth of foodstuff to function and has a power output of around 0.1 horsepower in repetitive tasks.Historically a major upgrade was the oxen. It could also work around 8 hours a day, fed a diet of roughage and had a power output of around 0.57 horsepower.An improvement on this was the draft horse which had a power output of around 0.86 horsepower. A horse required higher quality food and its ability to pull heavy loads was slightly less than that of a oxen, but it could move about twice as fast.As you might imagine power output moves up considerably once we move into the inanimate realm. A properly built vertical windmill or an overshot waterwheel could have a useful output in excess of 5 horsepower. Of course they required skill and material to build, operate and could only function when there was a sufficiently strong flow of water or air.Something like a sawmill might have an output 30 to 50 times that of a human sawing by hand.Though I am not confident in the specifics I can suggest that the most powerful output in pre-industrial days was generated by sails. Sails with an area in excess of a field hockey pitch could propel huge ships with hundreds of crewmembers at speeds in excess of 12 knots if the wind were right. Again I can’t say exactly how one would translate that to horsepower but I think we should see them as engines in the hundreds of horsepower range.The industrial revolution introduced new powerplants that had considerably smaller footprints and a higher degree of reliability. In addition they could run on fuel that was burned. Steam engines in ships, locomotives and factories could generate thousands of horsepower.What made cars and aeroplanes feasible were engines that had higher outputs at smaller sizes and lighter weights.Early automobile and aircraft engines might only have 30 horsepower internal combustion engines but rather than being the size of a three story building like a windmill they were small enough to fit in a modern shopping cart. By the end of the Second World War some aircraft were fitted with V-12 engines that had outputs in excess of 1000 horsepower while remaining comparatively pocket sized.Even lighter and more powerful engines such as various forms of gas turbines pushed airplanes beyond the speed of sound while rockets got us into space.The ultimate limit of our species is the ability to generate power. We can certainly improve existing power plants, their fuel cost, output, size, weight and manner of power distribution. However I do think there are limits to these. We kind of figured out how they all work and as such we are really improving them by each iteration.What I suppose the humans of the future need more than anything is something radically new. Something which can generate power beyond what we can imagine is feasible, something which might as well be magic to us.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-will-emerge-due-to-Covid19

What are some of the best Roman inventions still used today?A.By:Ancient Roman inventions gave shape to the Roman civilization as we know it today. Here is a list of top 10 ancient Roman inventions that led to major advances in engineering and innovations.10. ArchesEven though it predates Roman civilization, the arch became essential in general architecture paradigm once Romans made necessary changes to fit their designing schemes. Romans found out a way to set an arch on top of two tall pedestals such that it would span over a walkway (even highways). Many bridges, aqueducts, sewers, amphi-theaters and the Colosseum. The only known method forRoman city of BathThe Arch, although other civilizations used the arch in their architecture, its purpose was never really understood. When the arch is projected three dimensionally it can become a barrel vault. Another way of using this piece of architecture is when the arch is rotated around a single point it can become a dome.9. Grid based citiesEarliest of basic grid planning dates as far back as8. Sewers and sanitationThe7. Roads and highwaysRoman roads and highways played a pivotal role in the rise of the Roman state. In 700 years, they built 55,000 miles of paved highways, ensuring fast and efficient movement of goods, soldiers and information across the empire. Straight route across the countryside, making travel efficient and fast. Easy to navigate. Uuse road signs and mile markers.6. AqueductsEntire aqueduct network relied on gravity to maintain continuous flow – engineering remarkable for its time. Bigger cities like Rome, large reservoirs, connected to public baths, fountains, toilets and private villas.5. Roman numeralsRoman numerals4. Surgery tools and techniquesRoman medical scenario was heavily influenced by surgical advances achieved by ancient Greeks. Medical practitioners in ancient Rome also developed many new tools themselves and efficiently devised cesarean section. Biggest of leaps in battlefield related surgery by making medical preparedness and remedy in battle a prime concern. During reign of Augustus, medical corps assisted injured soldiers. Romans also mastered medical innovations to curb immediate blood loss in battles. Invented tools like bronze scalpels, obstetrical hooks, bone drills and forceps, and3. Julian calendarImposed months with odd number of days because of superstition against even numbers. Julius Caesar implemented reform, solar year as basis for calendar. He also instituted the 12 months in a year. Some Eastern Orthodox churches use it to calculate holidays even today. Even though it was a seemingly perfect innovation for its time, the Julian calendar miscalculated the solar year by about2. NewspaperSophisticated system to circulate written news published on Acta diurnal “Daily events”. Handwritten news sheets were published daily and posted in the Roman Forum. Content news on political happenings, trials, military campaign, executions, major scandals and other similar subjects. Acta Senatus recorded proceedings in the senate, though kept out of public reach until Julius Caesar made it accessible to everyone.1. ConcreteAncient Romans were particularly skillful in rapidly building new structures and maintaining. The revolutionary concrete developed by the Romans impeccable built and lasting formation – huge part in architectural accession of ancient Rome. It is superior to modern day concrete and more environment friendly. Romans combined their cement with volcanic rocks resulting in concrete that endured chemical decays. Pantheon, Colosseum and Roman forum standing since more than two millennia.PantheonColosseumConclusionFrom engineering marvels like aqueducts and arches to amazingly stable concrete, the ancient Romans succeeded in inventing and innovating their way to become one of the most prominent empires of the ancient world. Their inventions encouraged subsequent societies to adopt news ways of governing, living and understanding the world.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-will-emerge-due-to-Covid19
