1,"Question: Is it true that China has created an artificial sun?Answer:Artificial Sun is a romantic name for nuclear reactor. As of November 2021, the Chinese is leading in the particular field with the EAST reactor where the reactor was able to generate more power than the input for more than a minute.","9,064 followers",Allan Steinhardt,1.1K,2.3K,5.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-China-has-created-an-artificial-sun

3,sigh.What’s with the unequal treatment?In the west it’s a hurricane. In the East it’s a typhoon.Yet Europeans and Americans try make a fusion reactor… it’s a fusion reactor.China tries to make one and it’s suddenly an artificial sun.Fusion reactors work.There used to be four problems getting more energy out than was put into it.

4,"While anyone can speculate, the truth is that no one on earth knows the answer to this Quora question for certain.Several recent trends can be observed -More privatWhile anyone can speculate, the truth is that no one on earth knows the answer to this Quora question for certain.Several recent trends can be observed -More private companies are entering the fusion field using a combination of private and public funding to finance their fusion research. Venture capital firms have committed large sums to fusion research in hopes that timely profits can be obtained from fusion development.Plasma density is fusion’s “high ground” for commercial competitivenessI believe that the quest to build competitive commercial fusion reactors tends to favor approaches to fusion that are able to use the densest fusion plasma. This is a result of the fact that the power that can be drawn from burning fusion plasma is proportional to the square of the plasma ion density. Approaches to fusion that use dense plasma can be physically smaller and still produce the same amount of fusion energy. Fusion approaches that can only operate using very low density plasma (ion density around 10^14 - 10^15 ions per cubic centimenter) typically have to be scaled to HUGE size to approach break-even energy operation.The following graphic show the typical plasma ion density employed in current fusion experiments.You will note that Magnetic Confinement Fusion tokamak and stellarators operate using plasma that is 10^11 times less dense than Inertial Confinement Fusion experiments. This difference in density of operating plasma gives Inertial Confinement Fusion a competitive advantage (smaller and less costly commercial power plant).Picture comparing the fusion chamber volume of ICF and MCF fusion. Both fusion technologies are capable of producing fusion power but the technology that uses the densest fusion plasma tends to be physically smaller and less costly.Nations that support development of experiments featuring mid to high plasma density will have a competitive commercial advantage over nations who primarily invest in low plasma density fusion technology.No bucks = No buck rogersSome nations are currently doing a better job than others in investing in fusion development.China is currently doing the best job over all in investing in a range of new fusion experiments of differing size and technology. Asian nations are graduating more PhD engineers and physicists today than individual Western nations but Europe collectively graduates more PhDs than Asia.England, for its size, is also investing strongly in fusion and has a vigorous private and public fusion program.Huge amounts of incredibly skillful creative design and innovation have been lavished on the problems involved in bringing to reality practical forms of commercial nuclear fusion. Which ever nation finds success in the commercial fusion quest will provide a huge benefit to all other nations on the planet.Prevailing trends currently in force to internationalize fusion efforts are laudable and hopefully will continue.Private fusion startups located in nations around the world stand an excellent chance of bringing to reality small commercial forms of fusion that can form the basis of competitive fusion power generation and a new fusion nuclear industry.","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-China-has-created-an-artificial-sun
5,"Excellent question unfortunatly very difficult to answer as of now 6 countries are big players in the controlled thermal nuclear race. They are from most likely to succeed to the least are the top 3 European Economic Block countries of France, German and England. The other remaining big players are US, Japan and South Korea. China is starting to enter in to the fusions reactor race while Russia has decided to scale back on their program. I personally do not have much faith in the US National Ignition Project as it has been defended and was already mired in too much political interference.

I personally do not have much faith in the US National Ignition Project as it has been defended and was already mired in too much political interference. The Laser Implosion design in the NIP is not that efficient. The French led fusion reactor Tocamak style magnetic confinement reactor is already able to turn over for up to 2 seconds after initial start up. Germany has one of the most innovative magnetic confinement fusion reactor experiments underway and shows the best possible reliability once it start up.French/EU ITER programMax Planck Institute, GermanyBritish thermal nuclear program started since the 1950s and has merged with ITERLivermore National Laboritory Sandi Research CenterJapans Thermal nuclear program is much harder to look up due to search engine results. They have not abandoned nuclear power in general but their unique situation means they are more desperate to find a replacement for existing nuclear power toward fusion.Most of the South Korean offical KSTAR reactor research is hard to follow with a sizable chunk published for English as a very secondary language.Your guess is as good as mine but I personally believe magnetic confinement is more likely to succeed than laser energy confinement.",0 followers,John Holmes,826,1.2K,784K,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-China-has-created-an-artificial-sun

7,"Nuclear energy HAS already been used to mitigate the problems associated with the use of fossil fuels. They have been offsetting the emissions from fossil fuels since the 60s. So it absolutely CAN be AN answer. Is it THE only answer? No. There are limitations in the way that nuclear power plants are designed. Because nuclear plants tends to run best at 100%, and are not very good at responding quickly to changes in power demand, other types of generation are typically used to supply power during peak demand times. Current designs are excellent for offsetting “baseload"". TheNuclear energy HAS already been used to mitigate the problems associated with the use of fossil fuels.

Current designs are excellent for offsetting “baseload"". TheCan it further mitigate those issues? Yes, simply by constructing more nuclear plants to supply all of the baseload. This is not a cheap endeavour however. Initial costs of building nuclear plants is expensive, with the tradeoff being that they are cheaper to operate once built.Are there dangers associated with nuclear plant operation? Absolutely, but pale in comparison to the dangers associated with fossil fuel generation.Can the dangers of nuclear generation be mitigated? Yes, through new designs that are more intrinsically safe.What about all the nuclear waste these nuclear plants produce? Well, there are people working on that too. Bill Gates has a company called TerraPower that is building a reactor design that recycles waste from current reactor designs.The efficacy of Nuclear energy has been greatly debated over the years. I would suggest that you watch a documentary film from 2013 called Pandora's Promise which shows how the most vocal opponents of nuclear power have now become proponents of the technology.","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.5K,6.8K,91.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-China-has-created-an-artificial-sun
