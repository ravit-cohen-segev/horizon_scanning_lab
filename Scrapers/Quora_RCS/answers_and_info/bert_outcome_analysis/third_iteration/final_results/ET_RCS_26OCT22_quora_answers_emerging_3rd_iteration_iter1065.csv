Startups and multinational companies alike are beginning to feel the ripple effects of innovation in the industry, with technology becoming more intertwined in everyday lives each year.As 2018 progresses, here are 5 future technologies you can expect to reach the public in the next couple of years.1. The Internet of ThingsAds by HoolyThe Internet of ThingsApple has announced its plans to roll out the HomePod this year and Samsung is reportedly working on their Bixby technology in order to compete with the success of the Google and Amazon systems. You can expect that one of these devices will be simplifying life in your home and the homes around you by 2020.2. AutomationWhile large-scale innovation inThe store has proven itself successful as an efficient alternative for shoppers in its first location. The current cost of this technology, however, puts it out of the reach of pretty much any other storefront. As the technology continues to develop, consumers can expect that pressure sensors and cameras that automate pay and alleviate long lines in stores will be coming to groceries and pharmacies near you in the next couple of years.3. CryptocurrencyRecommended for YouWebcast, January 16th:After Bitcoin’s meteoric price jump in 2017, major tech players have begun to takeAs these coins begin to work themselves out and exchanges even out the fluctuations in prices, expect these assets to be mainstream methods of payment by 2020.4. BlockchainBlockchain, the decentralized ledger that holds together cryptocurrencies, has applications reaching far beyond financial transactions. Companies have applied the technology to everything, from simplifying tracking and access to information in academia to interesting and amusing games that use complex algorithms to create unique experiences.5. Artificial IntelligenceArtificial intelligenceIn addition to its security applications, companies like Amazon and Google have begun to apply the technology to regular consumers in order to simplify shopping and searching experiences on the platforms. With all the current progress of AI technology, it is reasonable to expect that by the year 2020 the innovation will be deeply entrenched in both business and consumer activities.

For example, at the very well-known web design site MasterBundles, I observe a trend of minimalism in design. You can see for yourself what trend is happening in the world of web design on this portal. I also think that the design of the site should correspond to the corporate identity of the company.

11,I believe you still use some technologies which were innovated 20 years ago. Can you tell what they are? Technology once invented/innovated is hard to become obsolete as some people presume. Technology will get updated/renovated based on that particular fundamental design. Try not to ask questions about what will happen in five years since we have not fully exploited all what 10 years old technology had to offer.,0 followers,User-11441330561143484822,4K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-technologies-will-disappear-within-the-next-5-years-Why
