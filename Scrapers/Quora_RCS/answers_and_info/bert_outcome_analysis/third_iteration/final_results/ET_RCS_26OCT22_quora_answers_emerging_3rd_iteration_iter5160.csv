However, that being said, there will always be the need to supervise the automation. So who better than those who know every step of the process so well?

4,It has already happened.Electric typewriters all but disappeared in 1989 (in less than 18 months) with the advent of Word Processors. IBM Selectric typewriters dropped in value from close to $1000 to less than $50 in two years.Tens of thousands of skilled technical engineers either lost their jobs or had to retrain in other areas in a very tight timeline.

There is no point in having an industry which produces mountains of goods that nobody can afford to buy because they’re all unemployed.AN ABUNDANCE ECONOMY:One solution is a “Star-Trek”-like world - with an “abundance economy” where goods are so cheap that money becomes meaningless. Everyone can have whatever they want - and people only “work” if they want to. This is only vaguely alluded to in StarTrek - but it’s much more explicit in theThat’s an interesting idea - but it only works if raw materials and energy are truly abundant too. In reality, if someone decides that they want to build a house made out of solid gold - then there’s a problem, because there just isn’t that much gold available.Since our planet is finite - and even with resource extraction from other planets and the asteroid belt - it can only be the case that not everyone can have everything.Once you start rationing resources - you’re back with a kind of “money” - because the guy who want’s more gold than his ration for building his gold house will want to trade with the guy who wants a diamond-encrusted car…and once you get into bartering your rations, the idea of “money” pops up again.The other problem with this kind of economy is that it’s hard to phase it in gradually.UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME:My belief is that the only solution is the “Universal Basic Income” (UBI) - a system in which industry is taxed more heavily in order to provide every single person with sufficient income to live a reasonable life without working.Those who do decide to work (for whatever reasons) get their pay IN ADDITION to the UBI payment - so actual earnings will be smaller than they are now - but with UBI added to earnings, it’s still worth working if you want to.With automated production of everything - prices should fall and one might actually be able to have a pretty decent life on UBI alone.It’s suggested that being freed from the fear of unemployment, people will spend more time becoming innovators, artists, starting their own businesses.CONCLUSION:I don’t think we’re close to hitting this problem yet - but I think it’s inevitably going to happen - and we need to be prepared for it.","284,852 followers",James Altucher,992,878,91.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-jobs-most-at-risk-of-being-made-obsolete-by-clever-software-today
