They also would not be enslaved to gravity like our biological bodies are. They would be like our machines that are surveying Mars today, but infinitely more intelligent with consciousness and the ability to self sustain. In other words, there would be no “need” for them to occupy Earth.Instead, I would think that the Earth would fascinate them as a rare example in the galaxy where life not only exists, but has evolved into complex forms that occupy the entire planet. In addition, if they were to visit today, and not a million years ago, they would see a life-form in its infancy, just beginning to explore and leave its home planet like they did so many eons before.If this new member of the galactic community ever became “dangerous” they could annihilate them easily with their far superior technology so there would be no fear or reason to exterminate them at this time (besides, they might do that to themselves).The real question would be: “How have they kept their presence from being known by us?” They would not only have to have hidden their galactic presence from our telescopes, but they would have had to have kept us from detecting any other “upstart” civilizations that have not yet developed this “cloaking mechanism”. Given not only the immense spatial separation of potential civilizations, but the temporal separation, too, this would be a monumental task.",253 followers,Hadmat Singh Rajput,2.4K,277,896.6K,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-aliens-could-have-more-advanced-technology-than-human-beings-why-cant-they-kill-humans-and-occupy-the-Earth

Any mortal species with the technology to travel that distance within its lifetime is probably not interested in conquering a primitive species like us so that they can occupy an insignificant planet like Earth.The closest star (Proxima Centauri) is ~24 trillion miles away.

It takes 4 years for its light to reach Earth.If intelligent creatures from PC could construct a vehicle that would reach Earth in a reasonable (human) time, it would face a long and perilous journey. Once it escaped the energy fields of PC, it would have to traverse the relative dark, emptiness of the void between the stars. The external temperature would be near Absolute Zero (-273.13°C) for most of the journey not to mention random objects along the path.Arriving at the Solar Horizon, they would have to navigate the Oort Cloud, then the Kuiper Belt to teach the inner planets. They could avoid the Asteroid Belt by making a polar approach to the Sun, but negotiating Solar forces is a lot more difficult than most people realize.Star Trek simplifies most things for the sake of storytelling, but Warp speeds over that distance will require ginormous energies. Energies we haven't even seen in quasars.At the very least, the ship would have to be well insulated, produce its crew's food and maintain an environment native to that crew. In addition, it would have to be resilient against the random objects and energetic forces of deep space. And it would have to be maneuverable and able to navigate the voids between stars or even galaxies.On the journey to achieving that level of power and technology, I think we humans would wise up or destroy each other. Instead, I think we would come to the realization that we exist in a multifaceted, interdependent matrix. That our ideal state individually is dependent on our ideal state collectively.The greatest problem has always been antisocial, megalomaniacal personalities. Humans who do things out of their want, as opposed to their need, and whose wants are both irrational and insatiable. Personalities who have lesser reguard for other entities than they have for themselves and, therefore, are disposed to violence.For us, as a civilisation, to make the leap to interstellar technologies, we'll have to implement mechanisms to identify, monitor and manage those antisocial personalities. The “Odin Power” will be easily accessible and we can't allow it to fall into homocidal hands.These interstellar extraterrestrials you speak of will have certainly been down the road we're on. I seriously doubt that, with all that power, they'll have a need to conquer us and occupy this little blue marble. Their needs will probably be more internal than external and their gratification in coming here will arise from seeing the glory of God in the diversity of His Creation.",4 followers,Dan Bradbury,635,21.7K,235.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-aliens-could-have-more-advanced-technology-than-human-beings-why-cant-they-kill-humans-and-occupy-the-Earth

But a large screen IPad is a reasonably good option, while travelling or in your own space, but in the living room, most devices can be Google chromed through a big TV anyway. All you need is to 'borrow' a Wi Fi or have an internet connection. And Smart TVs are becoming as common as the smoothie maker. Not a huge screen delight but very, very watchable. Turn off the weather outside, turn on the TV and my world is doing well againThen there's free to air TV and subscription TV of various kinds. Live sports is the Big Daddy in this category. The World Football Cup and the Olympics, though once in 4 years only, generate a phenomenal increase in TV sales and not just in the year in which it is being staged. Again the new generation TVs with their enhanced sound and picture quality gives me hours of viewing pleasure, even if my team is not winning.Finally the cost. There are still a lot of TVs in the very high price range but if you choose the right time, brand and payment scheme, you can get it at unbelievably affordable prices.TV set sales will only crash if there's nothing BUT Reality TV shows on the box. Or worse Greta Thunberg, the passionate teenage climate worrier who's become an overnight media sensation. And possibly star as herself in a new mini series ' The Humbug's Tale '.But all is not lost.

That was when I realized that the reader’s power to imagine has a big role to play in reading books.A word of caution though: if you are short on time or are impatient then TV series/movie is the way to go.

A watch is made with a movement AND a container, its case. You can place a mundane movement in a precious case, or vice-versa, but we should always think that while the content is related to the field of horology, the container instead borders in the field of jewelry - and more often than not, it stays there.Does this mean that a movement cannot have artistic/precious characteristics? Not really! But it is not its primary “job”. There are some excellent movements which main claim to fame is their beauty. They are so good-looking that they become a sort of jewelry in motion.As a note, I explore in more detail the characteristics that make an object like a watch truly precious in my book,For example, just take a look at this.It is theThis beauty retails from a tad less than $50,000, list price - and I think that it far exceeds the value of the raw materials composing it.

17,"Two kinds of watches come to my mind in this context, and they could not be more different from each other. In type one the price of less than 10k US dollars is related to performance.

Both are, of course, battery powered quartz watches, the Citizen with Ecodrive technology that reloads the battery with light.

In any case, you pay for the time, the ingenuity and the commitment that only the best possible will be good enough. Such watches will not make you miss the wedding reception but they will be quite a bit less accurate than any average Rolex.
