Historians argue about which later developments were in effect indirectly caused by European effects, like the Iroquois alliance.So really we can only say that Aztec and Inca would have continued, but in Eurasia and Africa empires could and did self-destruct and get invaded and die out from climate changes, so even projecting 200 years forward from 1492 is impossible to do.",746 followers,Jonathan Graifer,7.7K,4.8K,5.1M,UNKNOWN,https://www.quora.com/How-much-further-would-the-Mayans-Aztecs-and-Native-Americans-have-advanced-technologically-if-Europe-never-contacted-them

What are some of the best Roman inventions still used today?A.By:Ancient Roman inventions gave shape to the Roman civilization as we know it today. Here is a list of top 10 ancient Roman inventions that led to major advances in engineering and innovations.10. ArchesEven though it predates Roman civilization, the arch became essential in general architecture paradigm once Romans made necessary changes to fit their designing schemes. Romans found out a way to set an arch on top of two tall pedestals such that it would span over a walkway (even highways). Many bridges, aqueducts, sewers, amphi-theaters and the Colosseum. The only known method forRoman city of BathThe Arch, although other civilizations used the arch in their architecture, its purpose was never really understood. When the arch is projected three dimensionally it can become a barrel vault. Another way of using this piece of architecture is when the arch is rotated around a single point it can become a dome.9. Grid based citiesEarliest of basic grid planning dates as far back as8. Sewers and sanitationThe7. Roads and highwaysRoman roads and highways played a pivotal role in the rise of the Roman state. In 700 years, they built 55,000 miles of paved highways, ensuring fast and efficient movement of goods, soldiers and information across the empire. Straight route across the countryside, making travel efficient and fast. Easy to navigate. Uuse road signs and mile markers.6. AqueductsEntire aqueduct network relied on gravity to maintain continuous flow – engineering remarkable for its time. Bigger cities like Rome, large reservoirs, connected to public baths, fountains, toilets and private villas.5. Roman numeralsRoman numerals4. Surgery tools and techniquesRoman medical scenario was heavily influenced by surgical advances achieved by ancient Greeks. Medical practitioners in ancient Rome also developed many new tools themselves and efficiently devised cesarean section. Biggest of leaps in battlefield related surgery by making medical preparedness and remedy in battle a prime concern. During reign of Augustus, medical corps assisted injured soldiers. Romans also mastered medical innovations to curb immediate blood loss in battles. Invented tools like bronze scalpels, obstetrical hooks, bone drills and forceps, and3. Julian calendarImposed months with odd number of days because of superstition against even numbers. Julius Caesar implemented reform, solar year as basis for calendar. He also instituted the 12 months in a year. Some Eastern Orthodox churches use it to calculate holidays even today. Even though it was a seemingly perfect innovation for its time, the Julian calendar miscalculated the solar year by about2. NewspaperSophisticated system to circulate written news published on Acta diurnal “Daily events”. Handwritten news sheets were published daily and posted in the Roman Forum. Content news on political happenings, trials, military campaign, executions, major scandals and other similar subjects. Acta Senatus recorded proceedings in the senate, though kept out of public reach until Julius Caesar made it accessible to everyone.1. ConcreteAncient Romans were particularly skillful in rapidly building new structures and maintaining. The revolutionary concrete developed by the Romans impeccable built and lasting formation – huge part in architectural accession of ancient Rome. It is superior to modern day concrete and more environment friendly. Romans combined their cement with volcanic rocks resulting in concrete that endured chemical decays. Pantheon, Colosseum and Roman forum standing since more than two millennia.PantheonColosseumConclusionFrom engineering marvels like aqueducts and arches to amazingly stable concrete, the ancient Romans succeeded in inventing and innovating their way to become one of the most prominent empires of the ancient world.

19,"Here are 25 negative effects technology can have:1. IsolationSocial isolation is characterized by a lack of contact with other people in normal daily living, such as the workplace, with friends and in social activities. We isolate ourselves by walking around in our own little world, listening to our iPods or staring at the screen of the latest mobile device even when we are around other people. Studies have shown that people who are socially isolated will live shorter lives.2. Lack of Social SkillsThe use of online social media outlets causes us to meet face-to-face with much less frequency reHere are 25 negative effects technology can have:1. IsolationSocial isolation is characterized by a lack of contact with other people in normal daily living, such as the workplace, with friends and in social activities. We isolate ourselves by walking around in our own little world, listening to our iPods or staring at the screen of the latest mobile device even when we are around other people. Studies have shown that people who are socially isolated will live shorter lives.2. Lack of Social SkillsThe use of online social media outlets causes us to meet face-to-face with much less frequency resulting in a lack of much needed social skills. We lose the ability to read body language and social cues in other people.3. ObesityThe more time people are spending engrossed in video games, talking to friends online and watching funny cat videos on YouTube, they are spending less time being active or exercising. Also the likelihood of mindlessly eating unhealthy food increases as people are hypnotized by the latest episode of Honey Boo Boo.4. DepressionTechnology creates the perfect recipe for depression with the lack of human contact, overeating, and lack of exercise. There is a reason the use of antidepressants are on the rise and the blame can’t be completely dumped on the pharmaceutical companies. They aren’t carting people into the doctor’s office and force feeding them the pills. This isn’t to say that depression isn’t a real problem, but some people could cure their depression by living a healthier lifestyle.5. Poor Sleep HabitsSome of the negative effects of technology can be linked to the effect it has on sleep habits. We get sucked into online activities that keep us up too late and the constant stream of information can make it difficult to turn off our brains. Also, the ambient glow from screens can affect the release of melatonin, the sleep chemical. Keeping technology out of the bedroom would be a very healthy habit to acquire.6. PollutionWith the rapid-changing world of electronics and technology, the turnover rate for upgrades is staggering. This constant stream of out with the old, in with the new is adding to the levels of toxicity in our air and land. E-waste is not always disposed of properly, causing deadly chemicals to leach into the ground. Plants that manufacture the electronics are emitting toxic fumes into the air. Plus there is little to no regulations on the disposal of personal E-waste.7. Increased BullyingThe use of technology has caused an increase in bullying and escalated the degree of severity. Kids are no longer able to escape their tormentors once they reach the safety of their own homes. Bullies infiltrate the security of their victims’ homes through online avenues. It is also easier to get more kids involved in bullying because people are more likely to say things online that they wouldn’t say in person. The increase in cyber-bullying has also led to an increase in teen suicides.8. Lack of PrivacyThe internet has stripped the world of privacy. Long gone are the days of having an unlisted telephone number and staying offline to keep your information safe from prying eyes. With a few clicks on a keyboard, the average person can find anyone’s address and contact information. For those with more sinister intentions, the use of phishing, viruses, and hacking helps to find any information they wish to obtain. Plus, people have no sense of privacy online. They don’t think twice about tweeting every move they make, freely giving out their location on Google Map and putting their entire life story on Facebook.9. Higher Level of DeceitOn the flip side of having no privacy, people use the internet to deceive others. Most people don’t dig too deeply when doing a search on someone to check them out. By creating a few false profiles, people are able to pretend to be whomever they want. People are being “catfished” on dating sites. Hell, you could be talking to someone on the FBI’s top ten most wanted list and not realize it until you see them getting arrested on the news.10. Warped Sense of RealityUsing the internet as an escape from real life is very easy to do. In real life you only speak to a few people each day, there’s no Photoshop or avatar for the reflection in your mirror, bills must be paid and saying smartass things is frowned upon. However, online you are a freaking rock star! You have enough “friends” to form a small country, you look great in your pics or you have a kickass avatar, plus you get rewards or points for saying clever things (more if the clever thing is also mean-spirited). Unfortunately, we must live in the real world whether we like it or not.11. StressConstantly being “plugged in” and “connected” causes an extra layer of stress that wasn’t present before the overuse of technology.12. Blackberry/iPhone ThumbTendonitis in the thumb, a.k.a. Blackberry/iPhone Thumb, is a form of repetitive strain injury caused by the frequent use of thumbs to press buttons on mobile devices. The same injury can also be obtained from playing too many video games.13. Lack of Social BoundariesMuch in the same way that people overshare on social media sites, there is an increasing tendency to cross social boundaries. Cyberstalking someone or sending unsolicited nude photos are examples of grossly crossing social boundaries.14. Lack of Sexual BoundariesExposure to sexual content is more likely to happen at a much younger age. Before the internet, the only chance a child had of being exposed to pornography was if their dad didn’t hide his Playboy magazine well enough. Now, well, let’s just say you pray your filters are doing their job when your kid searches for “Puss and Donkey” from Shrek.Sexting is also a concern with technology being used at such a young age. There is no way in hell a girl would have taken a nude photo of herself and handed it to a guy before the popularity of texting. Yet, using your phone to snap a quick boob shot and texting it to your boyfriend seems to be no big deal. If you wouldn’t print the picture out and hand it to the guy, then you shouldn’t test it. And guys — girls do not want pictures of your penis. So stop sending them.15. Lack of Social BondsCreating a lasting bond with other people requires face-to-face interaction. The more we isolate ourselves with technology the fewer bonds we will form. People are expected to do more work at home which takes away time they would be spending with their families. Also, younger people prefer communicating online versus face-to-face. When people are in the same room and communicating via text or instant messaging instead of speaking to each other, there’s a problem.16. Constant DistractionWhen we are focused on a device instead of what’s going on around us we miss a great deal. Think of the number of times you have been texting or talking to a friend and missed the opportunity to flirt with the hot guy standing beside you. There is also a rise in the number of injuries incurred by people texting while walking.17. Neck and Head PainConstantly looking down at devices can cause neck pain and over time will cause the neck to lose its natural curve. Eyestrain can also cause headaches, blurred vision, and migraines.18. Shortened Attention SpanThe use of social media has shortened our attention span from 12 minutes to 5 minutes. Constant news feeds, getting information in 140 characters and videos that are 10 minutes or less has literally rewired our brains. People who are online an average of 5 hours a day have trouble remembering people’s names, forget pots on the stove and even their own birthday.19. AddictionPeople are not only dependent on technology they are also addicted to it. Studies have shown that when cell phones are taken away subjects heard or felt fathom vibrations, continuously reached for phones that weren’t there and became fidgety and restless. These are some of the same withdrawal symptoms you would expect from doing drugs.20. Lack of EmpathyThe constant stream of violent scenes on video games, TV, movies and YouTube causes people to become desensitized to the destruction of any kind. The normalizing of bad things happening and the culture of narcissism created by social media creates a society of people who lack empathy. When people stop caring, the world goes to hell in a handbasket.21. More ViolenceAfter people lose empathy and are accustomed to violence, it becomes the social norm. Teenage girls are videoing themselves violently beating another girl; the number of school shootings is rising and videos of people attacking homeless people are a few examples of violent behavior caused by media.22. Higher Energy ConsumptionAlthough individual devices are becoming more energy efficient, the increased overall use is causing a higher consumption of energy. People don’t turn their devices off; they keep computers on or plugged in, mobile devices charging and televisions plugged in. Also manufacturing all of these high tech toys causes an increase in greenhouse gas emissions.23. Developmental Issues in ChildrenChildren are using more technology now than they have ever used in the past. All of the negative effects that social media and television is having on adults are far greater when it comes to the developing minds of children. There is no way to know what long-term effect technology will have on our children because this is the first generation to have unlimited access.24. NeurosisTechnology causes people to suffer from mental and emotional disturbances, such as anxiety, phobias, and delusions, which are all symptoms of neurosis. Being convinced you’re very ill after looking up strange diseases on WebMD or thinking you are famous because you have had a viral video are a couple of ways technology neurosis manifests itself.25. Loss of Hearing and EyesightUsing headphones and earbuds can cause people to lose their hearing over time. Likewise, straining your eyes looking at computer and device screens can cause people to need glasses much earlier in life.Be more mindful of the time you spend using technology. If you have long conversations with Siri than you do with real people, it’s probably time to put the phone down. Force yourself to have an electronic-free day or weekend. When you go on vacation, don’t take your phone or at least put it on “do not disturb”. Creating balance will help you enjoy the benefits of technology without becoming a mindless internet zombie.",47 followers,XingTang Chu,576,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-much-further-would-the-Mayans-Aztecs-and-Native-Americans-have-advanced-technologically-if-Europe-never-contacted-them

And that creates the illusion that smoking helps you relax when you get your hands on a cigarette, while it actually does the opposite.I am a former smoker. I had smoked for ten years before I quit.

24,"Managing stress and anxiety is my central life-struggle.Many of the things I do to be happy I have discovered in an attempt to not panic.I used to worry constantly. About everything. I had to learn that worry is ineffective, that I have no control over most things and that living in the worst case scenario was stressing me more, not “preparing me”.I have trouble sleeping – I always have, even as a little girl. Except for one precious cup of coffee early in the morning, I don’t drink caffeine. I exercise nearly every day, go to bed early, and do everything I can to improve on my sleep.I have aManaging stress and anxiety is my central life-struggle.Many of the things I do to be happy I have discovered in an attempt to not panic.I used to worry constantly.

Except for one precious cup of coffee early in the morning, I don’t drink caffeine. I exercise nearly every day, go to bed early, and do everything I can to improve on my sleep.I have a hyperactive personality. My mind is always wired. It races, and I hold multi-voice conversations with myself. I talk myself off the ledge every day.For my noisy, noisy brain and my irrational, terrified voices, holding conversations with myself works for me.I’m a stressball, which means I’m tense. Very tense. I exercise and stretch and breathe but I also get reflexology massages. Whenever anything is healthy and claims to “provide relief from stress” (aromatherapy, floats, cranial massage, hot stones, chimes, sound therapy, whatever), I’m listening.I have learned to love myself and feel like I’m worth loving which was the only way to halt the insecure, jealous, controlling voices.I enjoy trying new things and being bad at them and not getting everything perfect, a far cry from the Dushka that wanted everyone to think she could do no wrong. (No one ever believed that, but still.)I am a recovering overachiever.I have a very driven, super compulsive personality and have learned to let it guide me rather than own me. This has taken many years and I fall off the wagon with an almost musical regularity. I scramble back on as gracefully as I can.I take deep breaths – deep, deep breaths – whenever I feel overwhelmed (writing this makes me feel overwhelmed, but look. I’m still here.)Meditation has been very helpful, in particular being OK with the thoughts that “I’m not doing it right”. I breathe and focus on my breath and get distracted and dash after a thought and come back and can really only do a few minutes at a time.And, you know what? I’m not “doing it wrong”. There is no such thing.What has helped me the most is the knowledge -deep and certain and primal - that I seem to figure things out.We’ve done this before, haven’t we, Dushka?Don’t you think that if you’ve made it this far, maybe that’s proof that we’ll be OK?You are in good hands, Dushka.
