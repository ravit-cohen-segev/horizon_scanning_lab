Current predictions for the singularity, the point in time when a computer’s capabilities matches a human being, is 2040. It will last a while before all humans on the planet can live inside machines, but already by 2050 it will be possible to load a human brain into a computer, so it is likely that a large number of people in the “civilised” world will be doing so already by the end of this cen...","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/When-will-technological-development-peak
2,"Science and technology are ALWAYS at their peak! (well, with the slight exception of cases where significant knowledge is lost).Just because science and technology are “better than they’ve ever been before” doesn’t mean they’re “as good as we want them to be”…and besides, many of the world’s problems are more political and social than scientific and technological.

Just based on what words I wrote here, the idea of something was faithfully communicated.In fact, mathematics can be defined as the study of mental objects with reproducible properties. That’s how a few mathematicians see it, most recently Alexandre Borovik, quoting David Mumford, and ultimately Davis and Hersh for this description.That’s similar to what we know about science. Science is meant to be the study of the observable world. Where science looks at what is physical, mathematics looks at the mental (or abstract) realm.But what about things in the physical realm that are not observable? Science doesn’t have an opinion of these. They fall outside of its reach.Just so, there may be mental objects that are not communicable. Suppose you think a thought or have a feeling and cannot exactly express it satisfactorily. This happens most commonly in romantic relations, wherein the feelings one feels may be significant only to oneself.Yet the realms of religion and philosophy are both personal like this. They look at mental objects that are not necessarily communicable.And that is why the problems in the world are not solved, despite a great knowledge of science and engineering. It’s due to the nature of the world. Much of the world (and especially peoples’ behavior) is personal, and is subject not to science but to philosophy. And people live by a range of philosophies.I suppose if you really want the problems of the world to be solved, then you might work to promote greater health. Healthier people generally might be thought to have healthier outlooks. If you want people to make better choices, start setting up the conditions that will promote good health.As it stands, people are up to a lot of things, and many of them are not so healthy. Poor health may be helping to preserve some poor philosophies.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-arent-the-problems-that-matter-most-of-the-world-solved-even-though-science-and-technology-is-at-its-peak

From the very beginning it was a small boutique organization that put all the best available people and resources together. Students were literally hunted across USSR and went through multiple very rigorous and non-standard tests administered by top academics face to face to be admitted. The same academics were then teaching them in small groups (~5-10 people) in the beginning and in one-2-one setting later. The institute had a number of its own well equipped labs, but one of the innovations was that students were required to work on real research projects in leading academic institution of the country starting from the third grade (of 6). The main focus of the institute was fundamental science, although some engineering disciplines were also present. On the down side, this was a rather closed community. Students had less opportunity for collaboration and ideas exchange with other countries in comparison to US universities nowadays.I am less familiar with MIT, but to me it looks like a more typical university of outstanding quality. It is clearly larger and has a broader range of disciplines (including e.g. business administration and the likes). The entrance exams are standard, but the cut off is high. It is significantly more open to the world and significantly better financed. My understanding is that most students do their research in the labs of the institute, while studying, which is very different from MIPT.If you want to compare the quality of knowledge average student had in comparable subjects after completing either of the univetsities then and now, then I believe this could only be some fundamental discipline (everything changed a lot in 70 years passed) and here MIPT would have won hands down. The reason is the unique students taught individually by world famous scientisis with much less distraction and much greater commitment.

All of these classes will be in Russian but from the first semester, you will have a good level to understand the topic. You will still have Russian classes in the second semester but at a reduced rate. Maybe 2 classes per week.Here in the preparatory course, they will prepare you for the entrance exams and for some of my classmates, it helped so much and they were able to enter.This for me is the easiest way for an international student to enter MIPT.The preparatory program does take 1 year so you need to keep in mind that you will “waste” a year of study to enter here.

But that's not where strong computer engineers come from. At MIT, studying isn't why we are here. We're here to hack everything we can lay our eyes upon.

We had easy access to supply rooms, machine shops, and all kinds of other facilities for non-academicWhen was all this stuff done? At the dead of the night. When Tsinghua pulls the power on its dormitories. In fact I'm not sure if I can think of a bigger showstopper to a country's technological future than forcefully pulling power and restricting internet bandwidth for the country's brightest, most motivated students. How are you supposed to build projects? How are you supposed to run your servers and process massive amounts of data? Over at MIT, we bootstrap companies out of dorm rooms. By day, our bedrooms are sleeping rooms, and by night, they become laboratories for all kinds of wacky projects.Did we sacrifice study time to build stuff? Totally. A lot of us weren't at MIT to study anyway, we came here to build, and so build we did.Did we break any rules? All the time! But fortunately, MIT doesn't watch us. No guards standing everywhere, no cameras, nothing telling us what we can and can't do unless we really do something physically unsafe. And so we hack the hell out of the campus too with high-tech (safe) pranks, not just our dorm rooms, and by doing them I learned about everything from Python to RF circuitry to power electronic design. In Tsinghua, they wouldn't even let me take pictures inside; there was a silly guard at the entrance to every building. Good luck hacking anything there.Where are these people today? Half of them are CEOs of major computer engineering companies, software companies, or hacking away at the next big innovation from a large Silicon Valley company.Don't get me wrong, I've been there many times myself and Tsinghua students are extremely intelligent, bright, smart, and in fact no different from us in the passions they have for inventing the future.

Below that is an AM/FM tuner, followed by an amplifier, followed by an audio cassette deck, followed by a collection of vinyl records (surrounded by high-quality speakers). All of the components plugged into the amplifier, which piped the audio to the speakers.Here’s a demo of an ’80s stereo system that’s of the same configuration.Digital technologyThere was some digital media around. Compact discs (CDs) were what digital music came on. There was the Laserdisc format for movies, which was a combination of digital video and optical-analog audio.CDs didn’t become popular until the late ‘80s, because even though the format came out in the late ‘70s, CD players were very expensive. They were high-end audio equipment, and in the early ‘80s, players cost over $700 each (about $2,200 in today’s money). What people went for with CDs was the clarity of sound. With vinyl records and audio tapes, you had to be really careful about not wearing out the media, because the audio quality would start to fade, getting distortions in the sound quality, scratchy sound, the more it was used, because you’d get messy with the stylus, scratching your records, or getting fingerprints and dust on the grooves, or the tape player would wear out (messing up your tapes). With CDs, the idea was the audio quality never faded. It would sound as good ten years later as the first day you bought it.A compact disc (CD)One of the “miracles” of CDs was that unlike vinyl records and audio tapes, you could damage the media “with no ill effects.” I remember marketers of CDs demonstrating this, showing how you could take a push pin and scratch, scratch, scratch a disc, put all sorts of clearly visible scratches on the side the player read, put it in a CD player, and it would still sound great. What people found out later was that this was partly true. Transverse scratches were fine, but scratches that followed the curvature of the tracks were not, causing skipping, and audio repeats, because the CD player was losing its place on the disc, and trying to recover.The Laserdisc movie format wasn’t very popular. The discs were about the diameter of vinyl records, and they were typically two-sided. It had the same weakness as Betamax, an unpopular analog videotape format. With Betamax movies, you needed two tapes for one two-hour movie. So, you had to switch tapes in the middle. With Laserdisc, you had to open the Laserdisc player, and flip the disc to watch the rest of a movie.Laserdisc (a DVD is on the right for size comparison)VHS videotape was by far the most popular video format, even though it was lower quality than Betamax, because you could fit a whole two-hour movie on one tape. It was “good enough” quality. You could just put the tape in, sit back, and not worry about it.In the early ‘80s, a popular digital technology was children’s handheld electronic games, such as Electronic Quarterback, by Coleco.There were many more. Some were two-player.These had segmented LED displays, with players represented as blips of light. All but one of the “blips” were controlled by the electronic logic in the game. Only one was controlled by the player (in the case of two-player games, of course, two blips were controlled by two players). They played beeps for sounds. The action could get very frantic, and it was common to see players glued to these things, mashing the buttons madly, and exclaiming if they scored, or lost a play.We also had educational electronic games, such as:Merlin by Parker BrothersThe Little Professor by Texas InstrumentsTI Speak & Spelland many more.These electronic toys were fairly affordable. As I remember, they were around $40-$50 (about $100-$130 in today’s money).Gaming consoles were around. There was the Atari 2600 VCSThe Mattel IntellivisionThe Atari 5200The ColecoVisionThe Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) (starting in 1985 in the U.S.)You hooked these up to your TV. You got games on cartridges, put them in when the console was turned off, turned it on, and up the game would come on your TV, and you could start playing immediately. You had to switch the console off to change games (change cartridges), and switch it back on again.By the mid-80s, the Atari VCS had become very affordable. I remember Atari ran an ad campaign saying you could get one for “under $50.” Its popularity was waning by then, because Atari had fallen behind newer game consoles.What was nice about these consoles, of course, was that you could play video games at home, rather than having to go to an arcade. The trade-off was the console game hardware was not as advanced as what was in arcade games. So, the gaming experience was not as nice.Here are some samples of these consoles:Atari 2600Mattel IntellivisionAtari 5200ColecoVisionThe Nintendo Entertainment SystemThere were, of course, the arcade games. Very few people owned these, as they were very pricey, but there were arcades around you could go to, and play a game for 25 cents (for one player, 50 cents for two players). You could also find these games in all sorts of places, like in department stores, convenience stores (like 7–11, or Circle K). They’d have one or two of them in the store.Games typically gave each player 3 “lives.” Some games gave you extended lives if you were good at the game, and got a high enough score. After you lost all your lives, the game was over, and you’d have to put in more money to keep playing.This was the way for you to get the best gaming experience possible. Arcade games had the latest tech in them.Pac ManDefenderHere’s a sample of some ’80s arcade gamesMicrocomputers were fairly popular. Among them, the popular models were the Commodore 64, Apple IIe, IBM PC, PC AT, and in the late ’80s, PC clones (not pictured), ranging from about $550 (just for the computer, no monitor) at the low end (about $1,400 in today’s money) to $1,500-$2,000 at the high end (about $3,500-$4,700 in today’s money).There was a ton of marketing hype around them. In my opinion, it created a “reality distortion field” for a lot of people who were into them (including me) for many years, extending into the 1990s.The Commodore 64The Apple IIeThe IBM PCThe IBM PC ATThe Apple Macintosh PlusOf these, I only used the Apple IIe and the Macintosh for any length of time. I had a friend with a C-64. I don’t know much about the IBM PC, since I hardly ever used one in the ‘80s.In the early ‘80s, most people who had computers (which wasn’t the majority of the population) stored stuff on 5–1/4″ floppy disks.The Mac pioneered the use of 3–1/2″ floppy disks, which came in a hard, thin case, with a sliding window to protect the magnetic disk (you had to be more careful with 5–1/4″ floppies, since getting dirt on the disk media, or getting it wet could damage the data on it).Despite being smaller, 3–1/2″ disks typically had higher data capacity than 5–1/4″ disks.Floppies were magnetic media. People had to be careful about putting them around any sort of magnets, like a TV, an audio speaker, or particularly setting any sort of magnet on top of it, because it would scramble the information on it.A lot of times people booted the Apple II into its built-in Basic language, since Basic’s command prompt was the default shell to access stuff they had on disk. You could boot into an application, like a word processor or spreadsheet, or a game, which would take over the whole computer, from a bootable floppy disk. To change applications, you had to change out the disk in the floppy drive, and power cycle the computer (turn it off and on again), which would reboot it.I’ve put a few videos here from Terry Stewart, demonstrating the Apple IIe, the IBM PC, and the Mac Plus. I’ve cued them up to “the demonstration parts,” where he shows what it was like to use each one. The earlier part of each video gets into their histories, and their hardware features, if you’re interested.The Mac was the first computer I used with a mouse and GUI. I decided to profile the Mac Plus for this answer, rather than the original 128K Mac, because it seemed like the Plus was the more popular model, and the one with which more people will be familiar. It came out in 1986, a couple years after the first Mac.Though it was possible to use Commodore 64’s for productivity, most of what my friend and I did with his was play video games together. So, here’s some of what that was like.The video below shows that expectations of computers in the ’80s were very different from what they are now. The interface of the computers that most computer owners had was much more technical, not intuitive, not graphical, and since there was no public access to the internet then, the computers had no internet connectivity built-in. The idea usually was to use the computer by itself.Having said that, there were proprietary computer networks around, which you could access if you had a phone modem (which was a separate device you had to buy, and hook up to the computer). The commercial service most computer users knew about was called CompuServe. You paid for it by the minute (as I recall). Flat-rate pricing hadn’t come out for these services.They were nationwide. They had discussion forums. They also had file databases, so that people could share free or shareware programs. They had online commercial services, like daily news, and airline, and hotel reservations. All of this was delivered through a text-only interface. Aside from that, though, the modern analogy I make for these services is they were rather like Facebook. Except rather than accessing them through the internet, you connected to them directly through your modem.The more common online access people had (in my experience) was to use what were called bulletin board systems (BBSes), which were typically microcomputers (like I listed above) running software that set them up as servers that offered a mini online service, but typically to only one person at a time. These were typically free to access, but you had to be patient. If someone else was connected to one you wanted to access, you’d just get a busy signal through the phone line, and you had to either do something else for a while, and try again later, or give up for the time being. BBSes were typically not connected to each other. So, it wasn’t like if its modem was occupied by someone connected to it, you could call in to a different BBS, and somehow gain access to the one you wanted through some network of bulletin boards.There was a bit of an exception to that, which was a BBS-based network called FidoNet. As far as I know, it was free (the node I used was). It was not like the internet, where everything was live and interconnected. FidoNet had distributed discussion forums, and a kind of private e-mail service, but the way it worked was through a subscriber network of nodes, where nodes independently agreed to connect up with each other, and distribute text messages. Each BBS on the network would batch-distribute text messages at certain times of day to other nodes on the network, as needed, through their phone modems, sometimes late at night when long-distance rates were low. It was a fairly slow process. If you wanted to get a message, say, to a recipient on the other side of the U.S., it might take 3 days to get there through this network, but at least it would get there. Like with e-mail today, you had to know the recipient’s address. You’d connect up with a member BBS, type out your message, and send it off.With all of these services (proprietary networks, and BBSes), you accessed them through a piece of software called a terminal program on your computer.Some of these terminal programs were commercial, which you could buy at a computer store, but there also were plenty of free ones around on bulletin boards, and these proprietary services. Though, you had to have a terminal program first to get to the others. Chicken & egg… Or, if you knew of a user group, someone might bring a free terminal program by, and you could copy it off of them onto a blank floppy disk. Still, people might like to get the free ones, because sometimes they had features more to your liking than the commercial ones.","35,157 followers",C Stuart Hardwick,2.3K,12.3K,143M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-arent-the-problems-that-matter-most-of-the-world-solved-even-though-science-and-technology-is-at-its-peak
18,Not even close to being at a peak.There are new products in the works such as Graphene that would provide lighter and stiffer speaker cones which will increase the efficiency.Rare earth magnets would also help.Speaker systems are the highest distortion and least accurate part of a modern audio system. I think they have a long way to go before they peak.,"5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/When-will-technological-development-peak
