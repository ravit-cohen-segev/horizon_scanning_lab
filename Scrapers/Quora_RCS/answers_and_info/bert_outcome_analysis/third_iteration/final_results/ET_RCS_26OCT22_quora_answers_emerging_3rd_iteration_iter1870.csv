1,"Many of them, in both coasts, do some of the outdoor testing on their parking lots. This usually happens after considerable indoor testing in lab rooms or office hallways.You've lumped together some very dissimilar technology fields, so it's hard to give you a one-size-fits-all answer.Robotics and drone technology may have some things in common, but nanotech and bioengineering are quite different.

Robotics applications frequently occur in industrial settings, such as auto parts assembly or machine processes. From a technology point of view, drone applications look like a variant on personal gaming but actually the field has many, many more applications, many of them having to do with government and security. Nanotech development has been going on in a wide variety of industries, including everything from electronics to medical instrumentation. And bioengineering is being done at even tinier scales: manipulating genes, stem cells, and other microparticles in the growth of other cells and collections of cells.","246,826 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Where-do-Silicon-Valleys-high-technology-firms-engage-in-outdoor-research-development-testing-and-training-for-the-upcoming-technology-fields-such-as-robotics-drone-technology-nano-technology-bio-engineering-etc
2,"We are nowhere near it.Nowhere. Not even slightly.An exoskeleton that allows the user to have greater strength for lifting in specific circumstances? Yes. But not a suit. A suit that allows you to breathe? Sure, with GIANT tanks attached to it, for a couple hours.Let’s break down what the suit is and why we can’t have nice things… yet. (and I’m not even going to use the new nano particle suit, just the one from Iron Man I - the very first movie, the basic suit).Fully enclosed suit:We are nowhere near it.Nowhere.

You need the actuators to give it the stretch but the suit would fall apart from stress so you need the exotic materials but then you need to power it so you need a power source that generates enough power in a tiny space that doesn’t kill the wearer with radiation and heat, but you can’t fly unless you have repulsors and then you can’t control it because you don’t have the mind interface, but then you are limited in what you can do unless you have the most advanced and complete and benign AI installed but you can’t do that unless you have the computing power that is insanely powerful in a tiny space and none of that matters because a couple hits from physical attacks would turn your body and brain to jelly from the outside shocks so you need electronic inertial dampeners that would put the Enterprise to shame.And that’s why we can’t have nice things.PS - I’m sure I missed something. :)","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Where-do-Silicon-Valleys-high-technology-firms-engage-in-outdoor-research-development-testing-and-training-for-the-upcoming-technology-fields-such-as-robotics-drone-technology-nano-technology-bio-engineering-etc
