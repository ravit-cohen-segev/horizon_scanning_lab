But this Star Trek probe didn't just have information about Earth, it had information on how to make something called antimatter. A civilisation found the probe, followHumans destroyed, and probably Earth too.That much technology overnight to a society that has never had the growing pains of that technology will destroy itself.In Star Trek, there have been many instances where advanced technology has been given to much less advanced civilisations with dire consequences!In Star Trek Voyager, 21st Century Earth sent a probe out called Friendship 1, and it was similar to the Nasa Voyager probes. But this Star Trek probe didn't just have information about Earth, it had information on how to make something called antimatter. A civilisation found the probe, followed the instructions which caused a nuclear winter on their planet. They blame Humans for this. They had no idea about antimatter. The story is more complex than that.Friendship One (episode)But imagine if we discovered how to make nuclear weapons in the 17 and 18 hundreds, would Humanity be capable of understanding how dangerous nuclear weapons are? Would we have seen more than two nuclear strikes against a country? Would we have blown ourselves up in the process?",0 followers,Kelly South,1.7K,340,12.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Suppose-that-tomorrow-humans-managed-to-get-their-hands-on-and-invent-all-the-upcoming-technology-for-the-next-100-000-000-000-000-000-000-years-What-could-we-be-expecting-to-see

3,"When the last human was welcomed into Heaven he was scratching his head.The Creator looked at him and asked “Is something puzzling you?”“Yes,” the man answered. “I've always wondered if there was other intelligent life in the universe.”The Lord chuckled and said “Of course there was.”“Then why did they not contact us?” the man questioned.“Why? Because they were no more intelligent than you,” Yahweh replied.“What do you mean? Did you limit them in some way?” the man continued.“Actually they were only limited by their resources,” Allah said.The man looked puzzled.The Supreme Being explained, “EaWhen the last human was welcomed into Heaven he was scratching his head.The Creator looked at him and asked “Is something puzzling you?”“Yes,” the man answered. “I've always wondered if there was other intelligent life in the universe.”The Lord chuckled and said “Of course there was.”“Then why did they not contact us?” the man questioned.“Why? Because they were no more intelligent than you,” Yahweh replied.“What do you mean? Did you limit them in some way?” the man continued.“Actually they were only limited by their resources,” Allah said.The man looked puzzled.The Supreme Being explained, “Each world was equipped with everything it needed to support itself for infinity, or until I figured enough was enough.” The human noted the smirk on the Divine One's face.“So, you had enough of us?” he asked.The laugh shook the clouds beneath them.“Oh hardly,” Krishna said containing himself. “You used it all up!”“We what?” the man asked feeling rather small.“Just like every other intelligent world you used up all of your resources without pausing to think of the future. You wanted everything now. Oh sure, there were some that tried to warn you, but there were too few of you who would listen. Your world was only so big, yet you continued to overpopulate until there was no space left. And what space you previously had was mined into oblivion or drained and decimated for what you call progress.“Like all of the others, you have affected your home place so adversely it was almost as if you were hell bent on destroying it. I always expect you to realize at the last minute that you are at the precipise, yet you continued right over the edge.The man countered, “But you gave us those resources to use, right? I mean oil, coal, gas, nuclear...”“Sun and wind – didn't you see that big ball in the sky or feel the breeze? I'm sure you did, but you wanted more. And for what? You called it progress. Only you can say if it was worth it, but I didn't think you were doing half bad early on, except for how you treated each other. That's really the only progress I saw when you began to get along. Sadly, that came kind of late, if you ask me.”They stood in silence.Then Waheguru said, “Oh look, we're about to welcome another world.”The man was incredulous. “They... they look just like us!”The wise one laughed, “And why wouldn't they? I made them too. Yeah, looking back maybe I should have made some modifications. Woulda should coulda, right? Maybe next go round not so much 'intelligence.'”—The Last Interview,",0 followers,Tony Nguyen,915,216,2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Suppose-that-tomorrow-humans-managed-to-get-their-hands-on-and-invent-all-the-upcoming-technology-for-the-next-100-000-000-000-000-000-000-years-What-could-we-be-expecting-to-see
4,"Interestingly enough, extinction is not an absolute. The heat death of the universe is not certain in terms of the limits of our technology.In about 22 billion years, the universe is expected to end, because of the expansion of space. The space in the universe, most of it empty, is expanding at an accelerating rate, which means that galaxies are moving away from each other, and eventually, because the rate of expansion will tear apart molecules and then, atoms.However… our technology is advancing much faster. Theoretical designs like the Alcubierre engine (shrinks and expands empty space) coulInterestingly enough, extinction is not an absolute.

Theoretical designs like the Alcubierre engine (shrinks and expands empty space) could save us from this. Our technology could advance to the point of making parts of the universe immune to the expansion effect. It might be possible. We just haven’t figured it out yet.Our technology is advancingTechnology is unpredictable, but it should make sense that the advancing rate will protect us, especially in the case of survival. In the end, it will be our motivation to survive that will determine our eventual fate.It’s hard to know where we’ll end up.",1 follower,Alexander L,777,13.6K,30.8M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Suppose-that-tomorrow-humans-managed-to-get-their-hands-on-and-invent-all-the-upcoming-technology-for-the-next-100-000-000-000-000-000-000-years-What-could-we-be-expecting-to-see

He spent more than $500,000 on the house, put another $150,000 into adding a very large pool and a room to put it in, and did insane landscaping.After the crisis, his home with all of the fancy upgrades was worth less than $250,000 but was taxed at the original purchase price.By the time he died, he and his wife were living on social security.It was fun while it lasted, but the real world took it all anyway.",73 followers,Amo Lees,2.3K,76,884.8K,2019,https://www.quora.com/Suppose-that-tomorrow-humans-managed-to-get-their-hands-on-and-invent-all-the-upcoming-technology-for-the-next-100-000-000-000-000-000-000-years-What-could-we-be-expecting-to-see
